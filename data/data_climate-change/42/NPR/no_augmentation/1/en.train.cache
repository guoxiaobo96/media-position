The annual funding cap will increase if enrollment grows. What's different is that, unlike with other states, Medicaid funding to Tennessee won't automatically keep up with rising expenses.

All that said, Turpin clarified that he didn't want to overstate the discord. We have a wonderful culture; people come here and they stay. I joke that I've been here 17 years and I'm still regarded as a newcomer. But I think this has been a wake-up call that we can't take it for granted.
To those who wreaked havoc in our Capitol today, you did not win, Vice President Pence said once lawmakers reconvened after many spent hours in lockdown. Violence never wins. Freedom wins, and this is still the people's house.

MARKS: The secretary of state's office has run that particular operation. It's called Center for Election Systems. At the time of the breach, it was located at Kennesaw State University. It was operated as a little satellite organization that was really under the control of the secretary of state's office. After the breach and then after an explosive event when we sued them and then they deleted all of their files, then there was such a public outcry that that contract was canceled, and all of the work was moved back to the secretary of state's office but under the direction of the same managers.
There had been talk of reconvening the session at a more secure location. There were obvious reasons to do so.

Can a $12 lunch change the way people think about racial wealth disparity in America? How about a $30 lunch? That's the premise behind a social experiment playing out in a New Orleans food stall.
Comey's 2018 book, A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies and Leadership, describes Trump as unethical, and untethered to truth and institutional values. His latest offering, Saving Justice: Truth, Transparency and Trust, continues to lay out his case against the Trump administration while assessing former Attorney General William Barr and the Mueller report. Trump's firing of Comey in 2017 helped set in motion what became Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
MOORE: And then Lucy and several other shows followed. But in that show it's a little like doing theater that's captured on film. You rehearse for five days. And then on the evening of the fifth day, the audience comes in and the cameras, having blocked their moves and yours lined up with them, you film it from top to bottom in continuity.
On what the initial study suggested and where it went wrong
BROOKS: You know, Robert Putnam wrote a book called Our Kids. Charles Murray wrote a book called Coming Apart. It's about how the country is bifurcating along class and other lines. And we - a lot of us read those books and thought they were really important. But, at least in my case, I didn't make the connection to the presidential race as much as I should have. And the coming apart of the country and the segmentation of the country has affected both parties, and that's one of the reasons Bernie Sanders is doing so well - because he represents the disaffected people, or at least speaks about the disaffected people in the working class, as does Donald Trump. And Hillary Clinton, if you watch her and Bernie Sanders back-to-back, Sanders just talks with so much authenticity and force, and Clinton has not been able to match that. It's too much calculation and hesitation.
Several dozen countries have signed but not fully approved — including Iran, Turkey and, most significantly, Russia, which is a major emitter of greenhouse gases. But three-quarters of the countries on Earth have fully committed to the accord.

There definitely has been an improvement in business confidence since the election, even before Mr. Trump took office, Behravesh said. Small-business confidence, for example, soared. Overall business confidence has improved. Consumer confidence has improved. So I think there is a confidence effect and that is translating into jobs growth.
But the Trump Administration seems headed in the other direction. The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is preparing a five-year plan expected to greatly increase offshore drilling in federally controlled waters, including those off the coast of Santa Barbara.

Still, Rendell isn't dismissing Trump's play for blue-collar Democrats in Western and Central Pennsylvania. There's no question that they're part of the angry slice of America, he said. Many of them have lost their jobs because of manufacturing problems. Not just trade-related, but technology, related, etc. So I think he will be successful in taking some of those into his column.
But those who know him say his experience in a blue-collar town, and its long decline since then, helped shape his views on trade.

KANDER: I am trying to - I'm trying to remember exactly what was going on. I know that the moment when Sally makes a decision to have an abortion was a moment which, I think, had not yet been properly musicalized. I'm just trying to remember this now. I don't know if it's all correct. But we wrote a song which did exactly that. It was a song which starts out very jaunty and nasty and cheerful all at the same time, sung by a girl who's just been insulted by her lover and who's found out that she's pregnant and is in - actually is in misery. And in the middle of the song, our intention, without tipping it lyrically, was that she make her decision to get rid of the baby. I think it works really well on the stage. The interesting element in that song is that all the sort of popular versions of it - most of those performances are of a very jaunty, cheerful, hey mate, come in from the rain and let's have a good time. And, of course, that's the opposite of the intention of the song.

There is no set time limit on how long such celebrations can continue. But the league is placing an emphasis on speeding up the pace of games. The 40-second play clock will begin once an official signals a touchdown and teams will have to snap the ball for their extra-point play by the end of the clock. League officials will review celebrations during the preseason and anticipate providing guidance as the regular season progresses. Former player Jon Runyan, who is in charge of on-field disciplinary actions, will decide the fines. Two other former players, Derrick Brooks and James Thrash will hear appeals for players.

And as a physician in Flint, I never used to really kind of respond to these questions of accountability and justice. There [were] these criminal cases and civil cases. And as I began to practice more in Flint and interact with the families in Flint, I began to understand how critical and foundational the concept of accountability and justice really is to health and healing. Because without that to happen, it's almost like a wound that never [closes], and it stays open and open and open. And it's been open for about seven years. And having some level of justice is like a salve. It helps those wounds finally close, and it helps the city and the people move on and recover.

This just underscores the need to adhere to the public health measures that would prevent the spread of any virus, whatever the mutant is. But the bottom line answer to your question, it's serious enough we have to pay attention to it. We can't just blow it off.

While Trump was not able to make good on his highest-profile health-related promises from his 2016 campaign — including repealing the Affordable Care Act and broadly lowering prescription drug prices — his administration did make substantial changes to the nation's health care system using executive branch authority.

Much of this growth can be attributed to Nepal's internal changes. Before 1950, Nepal was closed to foreigners. Mountain climbing changed that. And starting with the Maoist Civil War of the 1990s and culminating with the end of the monarchy in 2008, the country has transitioned from a Hindu kingdom to a communist-led secular republic with greater freedom of religion. Encouraging someone to convert to another religion was always illegal, but as Nepal eased away from its official Hindu status, the rules lightened up.

And to be honest, if somebody got attacked by a predator - one of our film group - I'd be really cross with them because they will have done something wrong. They will have got themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time because if you put yourself in a situation like that, you're already - the animal's aware of you in a way that it shouldn't be aware of you. So I think we are pretty confident. We've - touch wood - we've never had an incident like that in all the 60 years that the natural history unit has been making films. And I think that's because we just kind of know what we're doing and make sure that that situation doesn't happen.
Historian Sherrie Tucker writes that jazz history is typically told as the history of records, the residue of living, breathing musical creation — an observation that could be extended to all kinds of music histories in the 20th and 21st centuries. But recordings are also made and circulated within a male-dominated industry and media. So the year-end polls that rank those projects — and empower experts to anoint or dismiss the artists who make them — warrant our skepticism and scrutiny.

Nearly all congressional Republicans are self-described fiscal conservatives.

But it turns out that the laws of some states at the time actually said it could not be aggravated rape if you were a voluntary social companion. That was the term in the law.

Introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sen. Ed Markey of Massachusetts, the Green New Deal sparked a fierce political debate on how to best combat climate change. The plan drew significant attention from President Trump and Republican lawmakers, who have panned the plan as costly and unrealistic and used the policy to cast Democratic supporters of the framework as socialists. The Green New Deal was introduced as a nonbinding resolution, written with out some specifics, making it challenging to specify a price tag. Supporters say the plan will pay for itself through economic growth, and that the urgency of the climate crisis requires a bold and immediate response.

Days later, Cosby arranged to have Thomas flown to Reno, Nevada, where she was greeted at the airport by a driver who took her to a remote ranch house outside the city. The driver said it was a getaway Cosby preferred as an escape from the glare of the paparazzi. ... Cosby, dressed in sweat clothes, opened the door and ushered her in. He told her to change into something more comfortable and then meet him in the kitchen with a monologue she wanted to run through.

Once upon a time, he said he would get rid of all of it in eight years. He walked that back, but his positions on how to handle that debt are still making headlines. Just a few days ago, it seemed like Trump wanted to renegotiate America's debt with the nation's creditors — a potentially disastrous policy. Then it seemed like he was offering a subtler solution. Then he said the U.S. government could print money to stave off default.

I felt for a long time that if there was an explanation, if I could easily explain away Fleabag's emptiness or sadness, I felt like I'd be betraying her own complexity, really. But some people are just susceptible to feeling certain things that others aren't. And I feel so often that stories of angry young men are often unexplained, and actually so often when there's a broken, damaged woman it's because at the end you go, Oh right, oh, it's because she was abused. That's why. Or, you know, she was abandoned or she was raped. ... I was really determined to make sure that she didn't have the one reason.

After a long day and night of dueling between the House managers calling for impeachment and attorneys for President Trump declaring the articles of impeachment ridiculous, the Senate adopted a set of rules that will govern its impeachment trial, in which opening arguments will get underway Wednesday.
That's partly because the law is vague about which branch of government can give permission for someone to conduct foreign affairs, noted Eugene Volokh with The Volokh Conspiracy blog at The Post in 2015. It could be the executive branch, it could be Congress. It could even be the president telling just one member of Congress to go do something without telling the others. It seems like [there] are so many loopholes and uncertainties, it's hard for prosecutors to peg down how someone violated this law — and even harder for courts to make that determination. But the law is pretty clear that you need to have permission from the government to do something, and it doesn't look like Flynn had permission to talk to Russians about sanctions while the Obama administration was still in power.

But there are some signs of progress: This year, a new dengue vaccine might finally make a dent in the roughly 100 million cases of the disease that occur most years. And the world is more prepared to deal with Ebola than at any time in history: Two vaccines and several experimental treatments are in use, all developed after the 2014 West Africa outbreak. The current Ebola outbreak in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo appears to say more about the dismal social conditions there than about the world's ability to battle this virus. If there's an Ebola outbreak outside a conflict zone in 2020, it would likely be contained and crushed quickly. — Jason Beaubien

After November's general election, Georgia became the center of the U.S. political universe and the scene of a bitter battle within the GOP over the results of the 2020 presidential election, with President Trump falsely claiming that the state was stolen from him.

Forward Maya Moore was a star at college powerhouse UConn and she didn't skip a beat when she was drafted first by Minnesota in 2011. She was named Rookie of the Year that season. She was league MVP in 2014; point guard Lindsay Whalen, born in Minnesota, a star at University of Minnesota and now, according to longtime women's basketball reporter Mechelle Voepel, the emotional core of her hometown professional team; forward Rebekkah Brunson, a gritty inside player; and guard Seimone Augustus, who's been with Minnesota since 2006.
All kinds of views. And as far as I know, many people disagreed.
It varies a lot from city to city. In some places you can evict someone for being a penny short and a day late and the process is very efficient and quick. In other cities it's a lot longer and laborious and it's much more work. We're only also talking about formal evictions, too. These are evictions that go through the court and there are 101 ways for landlords to get a family out. Sometimes landlords pay a family to leave. Sometimes they change their locks or take their door off, as I witnessed one time in Milwaukee. So those evictions aren't even captured in these numbers that we have — which means the estimates that we have are stunning, but they're also too low.

If you don't know, find the episode, which is called Chuckles Bites The Dust. She doesn't find their humor the least bit funny, but at the service itself, as the reverend - played by John Harkins - gives his eulogy for Chuckles, Mary - and Mary alone - starts giggling and laughing until the reverend singles her out.

President Trump's strategy has included pulling out of the nuclear deal. Since the president came to office, Iran has moved closer to a nuclear weapons capability. They are closer today than they were when he took office. They are spinning more centrifuges. They are stockpiling more enriched uranium.

Democrats have been stung by the fact that President Trump's victory marked the second time in five cycles that a Democrat lost the presidency while winning the popular vote. 2016 was the most egregious example, with Hillary Clinton winning 3 million more votes than Donald Trump, but losing the election. It was the largest margin ever for someone who won the popular vote, but lost the Electoral College.

At the same time, though, broadening the ceremony beyond the walls of the chapel to encompass the idea of a broader responsibility for each other provided a vital link to how Harry's mother, Diana, saw the world and her role as a royal. She was an activist always, and her charitable work often seemed to be the only thing she liked about being a princess; the only part of it that brought her any happiness. While Curry offered one link between this very British ceremony and Markle's American blackness (a gospel choir offered another), he also offered a link between this obscene world of wealth and a man who was raised by a mother who seems to have desperately wanted him to know more of life than that. So both of their mothers felt especially present in that moment, even if only Meghan's was seated nearby.
Several of the law's provisions apply to plans offered by large employers, too (with some exceptions for plans that were in place before the law passed in March 2010).
Russia really turned the balance of power. Assad was struggling. Now he's been on the offensive, and the rebels are in chaos, Joshua Landis, head of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, told NPR's All Things Considered. There's real depression amongst rebel ranks. So in that sense, the regime is solid.
For more than 100 years, it was understood that a president's annual report to Congress would be a written document sent up to the Capitol. That's how things were from the time of Jefferson in the beginning of the 19th century until Wilson's arrival early in the 20th century.
Is a country like China different, and is it more likely that they are — cheating isn't necessarily the right word, but — doing more of these kinds of things that are more worrisome than other countries? said Chad Bown, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. And I think the answer to that is probably yes.
David Humphreys, who's a Missouri businessman who spent $2 million to support Hawley's election in 2018, now tells the Missouri Independent that Hawley is a political opportunist willing to subvert the Constitution. And he would like the Senate to censure Sen. Hawley, which would take a simple majority vote. Would you vote for that?
We live in an era where the pace of change is quick. The lines between science fiction and science fact often blur. Science journalists will continue to pull from science fiction, and they will inevitably write the sounds like science fiction cliché.
But late Wednesday night, some Senate Republicans withdrew their objections. Each objection requires the backing of a member of both the House and the Senate to be considered. Sens. Steve Daines of Montana, Mike Braun of Indiana and Kelly Loeffler of Georgia all said that they would stand down.
I think they're valuable, but I'd never say they somehow constitute a complete education. If I'm confused about something, hey, to get a 5-, 10-minute explanation of it, I think that's valuable.
In addition to the U.S., Canada and nine other governments in the Western Hemisphere, including Brazil, Argentina and Colombia, recognized Guaidó as interim president, the AP reports. The Organization of American States also backs Guaidó.

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. There's a lot of great dramatic television these days. And our subject today is a series where none of the stars are professional actors. In fact, none of them are human.

I didn't have hangovers, per se, but I found that it was getting very difficult to hold the eyeliner brush steady when I was applying my makeup in the morning.
The administration was so eager to trumpet that good news, officials ignored a long-standing rule to withhold comment for at least an hour after the official report. The president waited just 11 minutes before retweeting a Drudge Report item with the jobs number and the headline GREAT AGAIN. His press secretary followed 11 minutes later.

That's when I saw the opportunity to ... step up and defend free speech, defend individual liberty, defend the free flow of information that I saw under attack, Torba says in the recent YouTube video, in which he also describes feeling like a minority in Silicon Valley as a conservative, as a Christian, as a straight white male in a place that's very far-left, very progressive and very liberal-minded. (He now lives in Austin.)
Of course, gender parity among voters would be unlikely to result in the equal representation of women musicians in the poll. Being female doesn't render women critics immune to implicit bias. And women jazz musicians are fewer in numbers than their male counterparts. But, if all of the critics who voted in 2019 had been female, we can project that the number of recordings led or co-led by women musicians would be 32% of the total ranked albums — a number consistent with the 30% female membership of JEN. In other words, if everyone had voted the way that female critics did, the representation of women musicians in the poll would be in keeping with the number we estimate to be working as professional performers.
Each year, thousands of Americans miss their deadline to enroll in Medicare, and federal officials and consumer advocates worry that many of them mistakenly think they don't need to sign up because they have purchased insurance on the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces. That failure to enroll on time can leave them facing a lifetime of penalties.

In general, China's market access restrictions prevent the consumption of American goods and services, wrote the Brookings Institution's David Dollar this week. He points to one example: In automobiles, a 25 percent import tariff plus domestic content rules in the past mean that American-brand cars sold in China have little U.S. content. Likewise, he said, China could be more open to U.S. agricultural and service industries.
Collins on Thursday announced that she planned to vote for hearing witnesses.

The basic reality of the Vietnam War that Americans can't get around is that it was, in many ways, a really bad war. And so Hollywood has at least acknowledged that much. But the way that it has contained the meaning of that war is to make Americans the stars of this drama and relegate the Vietnamese to the margins, even though in reality, the Vietnamese paid the heaviest price. And that is one of the ways by which cultural power, soft power, prepares Americans to do the same things over again, that now as we confront the same parallels and analogous situations in the Middle East, the irony is that, you know, it's mostly people from these other countries that are dying.

Sheila Bedi is an attorney with the MacArthur Justice Center. She represented activists and community groups in a successful fight to allow them to have a direct say in overseeing the court ordered reforms. She says that's different from other consent decrees: There are very specific ways that police in Chicago abuse their power, Bedi said, and it was critical that this consent decree couldn't just be imported from Seattle, for example. That it really addressed the particular harm that Chicago communities face.
As you mentioned, they were both activists — met during the civil rights movement. In light of that, did you ever consider representing marginalized people as a defender? Why did you decide to be a prosecutor?

DOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Well, you certainly heard much less about a border wall. There certainly wasn't the idea of, you know, build a wall; crime will fall - as the president talked about yesterday. Instead, when you asked her if the president would accept $5.7 billion or potentially more than that that Democrats could put on the table as early as today for border security, she said, well, why don't we have the Democrats propose that to the president? Certainly sounds like an openness and a potential way out of this shutdown. At the same time, of course, we don't know inside the mind of the president. We don't know if he will accept that, but it certainly sounds like an opening, Steve.
The law contains a section that authorizes the president to control the production and distribution of scarce materials deemed essential to the national defense. In his executive order, Trump specifically cites protective equipment (presumably face masks) and ventilators as meeting the criteria in this provision.

What I can understand is that this is a rapidly evolving situation, and Americans are sharing a lot of information from different directions. We have a framework that we use and have used for many years in response to outbreaks like this. We have followed that, but we have adapted as this has changed. I think what the American people understand from what I'm hearing on the ground is that this is a very different outbreak than we have seen in the past and that evolving our approach to this is really important.

We actually now have a majority of women and/or minorities on the Circuit Courts, something that's never happened before. So my record of appointing a judiciary that reflects the country is unmatched.
Federal Judge Mark Bennett, who has written and lectured widely about implicit bias among juries, said he had hoped the court would take more affirmative steps to prevent biased jury selection — such as requiring prosecutors to prove by clear and convincing proof that there were legitimate non-racial reasons for striking qualified minority jurors. The current system, is not very helpful in the real world, he said in a telephone interview with NPR, because the judge has to call the prosecutor a liar in order to force any change. Bennett, like others, also said he believes that there are inherent problems with the whole system of peremptory strikes.

Now he tells The Washington Post he wants to devote the remainder of his term to racial reconciliation.

GARNER: It's currently around 7 percent. And in aviation, we make up less than 4 percent. For example, I'm at the largest Marine Corps air base, and I am the only female pilot on this base.

IRWIN: Well, historically that's really been the case. We think back to 1992 when Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot ran on an anti-NAFTA platform. In 2008, Barack Obama ran against NAFTA - 2012, Mitt Romney raised issues with China. So trade has always been a sensitive issue in American politics because jobs are at stake.

One listener wrote to us equating the COVID-19 briefings to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's World War II fireside chats. But the two situations are not equal, nor is the media environment the same. Unlike in the 1940s, when newspapers and radio were the only major news sources, we are now in an era of abundant media outlets; the briefings can be seen or heard on npr.org or myriad other places. They can be watched live, or after the fact. (That said, there are indeed some media consumers in rural areas who do not have cable or broadband connections and who rely on public radio airwaves to receive news. That's where local community station decisions come in.)

String theory is, perhaps, the most ambitious of these approaches, which tries to whole-hog put together the laws of the big and the laws of the small into one theoretical framework that might be able to go way beyond the scales that Steven was referring to, and perhaps allow us insight into the physics of the very, very early universe, the physics of the Big Bang. So we try to go step by step.
Although it is seen as a less likely outcome, if Democrats win the Georgia races and give the party a slim majority in the Senate, the whole ballgame will change, and Pelosi will march into her new term as speaker with far greater power.
Walking around Sigep — despite the freshly made waffles and cappuccino foam artist demos — there was no doubt the industry has customer health in mind.

Last year, authorities took steps to limit wasteful infrastructure investments in an effort to rein in unsustainable levels of local government and corporate debt.

One thing I, I do ask them is how do they generally approach a problem where the text of the Constitution might be ambiguous. What do they do to — to understand either the meaning of the text, to what extent do they draw on historical data, to what extent do they draw on their sense of how society is dealing with that problem today? You know, so you'll get some sense of their judicial philosophy.
In a statement, Mission Health said it has adequate staffing and is aggressively recruiting nurses. We have the beds, staffing, PPE supplies and equipment we need at this time and we are well-equipped to handle any potential surge, spokesperson Nancy Lindell wrote.

The group proceeded into the hospital. Claire followed, the others oblivious to her. She was like a spy, paid to fit in, to hide in plain sight, her identity and her loyalties concealed. Her ability to hide in plain sight was a paradox, even to herself, because she was physically striking. Had the others taken the time to notice her, they would have seen a thirty-six-year-old woman filled with the confidence and glamour of success, tall, slender, strong, her arms and shoulders shaped from carrying heavy photographic equipment. Her thick dark hair fell in waves to her shoulders. Her face was broad, her features well defined.

Evaluating the numbers: If projects led and co-led by women are 18% to 22% of all albums that received votes in the poll in 2017, 2018 and 2019, is that number high or low relative to all of the projects released by women during those years? Likewise, is the number of women core band members, 11% to 16% of total personnel for those years, high or low relative to the number of women performing professionally? Unfortunately, there are no ready-made statistics for direct comparison. We can, however, look to other sources for context. For example, the membership of the Jazz Education Network (JEN), an organization that connects musicians, educators, students and fans, is 31% female based on their most recent data. The membership of the American Federation of Musicians Local #802 in New York City, which includes a broad stylistic range of musicians from jazz to Broadway to classical orchestras, is 26% female, a number based on those who voluntarily report gender on their membership forms. Both of these statistics suggest that the representation of women in the NPR Music Jazz Critics' Poll is low, indicating a gap between the numbers of women working in the field and their critical recognition.
While this experiment focused on racial income disparity in New Orleans, the numbers when it comes to the racial wealth gap in America are even starker. White families accumulate more wealth more quickly than do families made up of people of color. As NPR's Code Switch team has reported:

The letter calls for a number of steps that the coalition argues that Biden could take unilaterally, including an executive order upgrading public buildings, transportation and energy in a transition to a clean energy economy; an executive order that requires federal agencies to secure informed tribal consent from Indigenous nations; declaring a national climate emergency; and banning new fossil fuel projects on federal and tribal lands and waters, as well as in environmental justice communities.
SEBRELL: Well, one of the things is it's very hard to find qualified teachers who will stay. There's not always a lot to offer to people who are coming in to teach. Housing sometimes can be a problem. Living in a home in the country, you're going to deal with leaking roofs and mice, and sometimes that can be a problem, finding a place that you want to live in, just a house, so that you're not driving back and forth. So a lot of our teachers do come in from the triangle area - Raleigh, Durham - and they drive, you know, an hour in the morning or an hour and a half in the morning and again in the afternoon. And when you have long hours, that makes it really tough as well.
Mr. ALLEN: Well, Bette, actually, I wanted to ask you very, very quickly: When you say you want the bishop held accountable, what would that mean to you? What would accountability look like?
Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan is one of the lawmakers who's calling for President Trump's removal. She's on the line with me now. Good morning, Senator.
When asked how much he thinks Starr knew of the school's sexual assault problem, Dunnam pointed to a lesser-known 2014 report by the consulting firm Margolis Healy & Associates that was also commissioned by the university and obtained by the Waco Tribune-Herald in 2018.
I'll be blunt, she says, It's devastating. She tells the students the proposed rules would mean schools don't automatically have to investigate incidents alleged to have occurred in private, off-campus apartments, or misconduct that is reported to a coach or resident advisor, for example, instead of the official Title IX officer.
The National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association has announced plans to file its own suit in the coming days on behalf of its member clinics in conjunction with a clinic in Washington state. On Monday, Essential Access Health, which administers Title X grants in California, announced a lawsuit challenging the rule on behalf of patients in that state.

HADID: ...Enormous response in the media. One hundred - and those aren't cases that happened after she was killed. They're families who were reluctant to say what had happened to their children, who found the courage to come forward. That in itself is a pretty big deal here.
The research can't explain how these messages are getting to kids or how they could be changed, says Cimpian. He is planning a long-term study of young children that would measure environmental factors, including media exposure and parental beliefs. That would give a better idea of what factors predict the emergence of stereotypes, and what levers are available to change attitudes.
And these are the villains that we don't usually notice and don't want to, and these are the villains that poison Flint with policy. And I hope one day we can go after these systemic villains and bring forth justice.

After Stinging Presidential Loss, Popular Vote Movement Gains Momentum In States
The classroom is the ideal place for this conversation between the sciences and the humanities to unfold. By exposing students to the two sides of the cultural divide, we stand a chance of building bridges that will actually close the gap. Scientists should read from original sources, and humanists should grapple with scientific concepts such as relativity, quantum physics, evolution and natural selection, plate tectonics, climate change, and the expanding universe. Scientists should recognize that some research topics — AI, biotechnology, climate change, life extension, the nature and pervasiveness of faith, and many others — need to be investigated together with humanists as a joint effort; inasmuch as they impact society as a whole, they are not just scientific research projects.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi informed House lawmakers that Congress will reconvene Wednesday night to continue its constitutional duty to count and certify the electoral votes after pro-Trump protestors breached the Capitol and forced Capitol Police to evacuate both the House and Senate.

Trump is beating him in the polls in Ohio and Kasich has said that if he doesn't win his home state he's done. So, tonight, what does Kasich do to claw his way back into contention? Does he continue his Mr. Nice Guy strategy, showing voters that he's a reasonable, not very partisan, not very angry candidate who is as fed up with the antics of his opponents as they are? Or does he actually try to take on Trump?
Indeed, right now — the start of the year right after an election is concluded — is when many companies conduct this kind of review of political spending anyway.
That congressional vote will be the final formality leading to the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden two weeks later.

NAUGHTON: Well, I think the nature of careers as, especially as independent practitioners for physicians, it does allow for greater flexibility and the ability to take time out of their career without being punished for it later. But what we are trying to do, although we include physicians in our umbrella group, we really want to bring people in from teaching, from research, from fields that are under-represented currently.
Mr. WEINBERG: Yeah. Well, he - yes, you are right about his views, but his views were very different from those of most astronomers and physicists today. John really thought that things - the only things that can exist are things that we observe, and they exist so that we can observe them.
SIMON: And how does that happen? Why would mutations make a virus more contagious?
These laws have long been the source of deep concern to international rights organizations and others, not least because they are sometimes misused to settle feuds, grab land, or persecute religious minorities by making false allegations.
Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate, Murkowski said in a statement. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.

KAPLAN-LEVENSON: In the 1990s, an anthropologist named Shannon A. Novak was studying skeletons of the Fremont civilization, a group of people that lived in Utah 1,300 years ago. She noticed that all the female skulls had specific types of cracks and dents in them, while most of the male skulls didn't.

A new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll finds Trump's approval rating down and his disapproval rating up from a month ago. He currently stands at 39 percent approve, 53 percent disapprove — a 7-point net change from December when his rating was 42 percent approve, 49 percent disapprove.
On a brighter note, at least some of the decline in people buying and selling houses might be due to something else. Americans are moving around the country a lot less than they used to. In fact, 25 years ago, Americans were more than twice as likely to pick up and move from one state to another.
As of today, by the way, they even opened up a kind of a psychological support hotline so that if people are feeling really, really (inaudible), there's a number they can call, which I think is awfully nice. I do give credit to the ship. They're really trying to do the best they can.
We're essentially borrowing from the rest of the world at relatively low interest rates to be able to make the investments that we need without having to do the savings ourselves, he said.
Space would only be a rigid stage and time would only be a steady river if light could travel from Point A to Point B instantaneously. (That is if light traveled with an infinite speed.) But it doesn't. Our illusion is corrected once we incorporate the fact that light has a finite speed of propagation, even if it's so ridiculously high. (In fact, it is its enormous value that makes our illusions so persistent and convincing.) Once the correction is factored into our studies of motion, everything changes. An observer at rest that measures the length of a moving bus will obtain a different result from the passengers in the bus. To her, the moving bus will be shorter. If she also saw a clock attached to the bus, she would notice that the seconds pass slower for it than for the watch on her wrist. Amazed, she would conclude that moving objects shorten in the direction of their motion and that moving clocks tick slower.
It's a much weaker economy, Bosworth notes, much fewer options available to them.

The AR-15s are out there, the ammunition is out there, the crazy people are out there, he told NPR. This is the society we live in and we just have to get more diligent about protecting our citizens and it's not a joke.
Yeah. But then don't have the son get the no show job. How about the conflict there? OK, well, you can say conflict to a point. When you get up, the six of these it becomes bribery. Then you got they got the brother in Iraq. He becomes point man for Iraq in 2011. All of a sudden, within a few weeks, James Biden out of nowhere is made a partner in a $1.5 billion housing program in Iraq and comes out of that with millions of dollars. So he monetizes Joe's office and pulls out millions of dollars. Now we come to Ukraine. They monetize his office in Ukraine. Look, whatever you think, you know Zlochevsky didn't hire Hunter Biden because he's Hunter Biden. He hired him to get the vice president. Now, the question is to do what? So it's a sale. It's a sale of the vice president's office. The thing of value that got them to $5-$8 million was the office of vice president. They sold it. This is now the third time I can show it. And then we go to China, and if you imagine the shrewd, tough Chinese going into a $1.5 billion deal with a kid who has a serious drug problem. The one equity fund he ran it almost went bankrupt and somebody was accused of a Ponzi scheme.
The move by civil servants effectively ends the bureau's participation in Trump's bid to make an unprecedented change to who is counted in the 2020 census numbers that will be used to reallocate each state's share of congressional seats and Electoral College votes for the next decade. According to the 14th Amendment, those counts must include the whole number of persons in each state.

NGUYEN: Though whatever name I tried - see, you laugh. Nothing sounded right. Nothing sounded right except my own name. So I've always stayed with it despite the minor cost that it might have entailed in terms of not seeming to be quite as American as everybody else. But obviously the ambition is to make Americans say my name, to make Americans recognize that this is also now an American name. It is also now a French name. It is also now an Australian name. My surname, Nguyen, is the fourth most popular surname in Australia. You know, we've transformed the countries that we've come to and the people who live in these countries will eventually be able to say our names in the same ways that they say Coppola.

After working for about eight hours, the final margin of error in Bartow County was less than a tenth of percent from the original results - expected, Kirk said, because humans are involved in the counting process that is normally done by machine.
But I recently came across a tweet from Phil Yu, the Angry Asian Man blogger, about an intriguing new Kickstarter campaign: the Haikus with Hotties 2016 calendar.
The suffering and deaths of so many animals helped get the public's attention and spur lawmakers to action. And 1969 marked a turning point for environmental activism.
The inside sources say the company is hoping to get between $10.7 billion and $15.5 billion for its gas assets. Given the company's safety, liability and political challenges — including new allegations last month that the company violated safety regulations — analysts say it's not at all clear they would get that on the open market.

Offering flavors geared toward specific diet concerns broadens a gelateria's appeal, explains Giampaolo Pelli, co-owner of Le Botteghe di Leonardo, a small Italian chain of shops that emphasizes its use of only seasonal fruit, fresh cream and organic eggs. Because there are, we know, a lot of problems that people have, he says, its menus always include several dairy-free options and at least one stevia-sweetened flavor, which is a hit with diabetics.
This interview has been edited for length and clarity.
Politically, the story of Section 230 has recently taken a surprising turn.

For example, the Trump administration made it easier for those who buy their own insurance to purchase cheaper plans that don't cover all the ACA benefits and may not cover pre-existing conditions. It also eliminated protections from discrimination in health care to people who are transgender.
Nobody wants to see the flag or the national anthem weaponized, Bryant says. They don't want to see citizenship weaponized and the veterans that I've spoken with do not want to be used as commercial props and yet sports is doing both.

There are a few cases where the invention of an infinite number of new universes gives rise to observable consequences. Everyone's favorite example is that our universe might, in the past, have collided with another universe, leaving correlated rings in the cosmic microwave background (see here). Another idea suggests that if we live in a multiverse, certain types of black holes are more likely (see here). But if such predictions are not confirmed, then this merely means we do not live in a multiverse with these particular properties.

We have also seen the gravitational waves generated when black holes collide with one another, a discovery celebrated with the Nobel prize last year.
IRWIN: Well, trade does destroy jobs in import-competing sectors, such as apparel and furniture. But so does technological change. And it also has to be pointed out that trade creates jobs in export-oriented sectors, such as aircraft and high-tech. So trade doesn't affect the number of jobs in the United States so much as it affects the composition of jobs. And unfortunately, some of those jobs are located in Ohio and Michigan, where heavy industry has traditionally been.
I think there's a real anti-incumbent mood, and it's part and parcel of this progressive wave, and I think Bernie Sanders has really inspired that and helped build it further, Canova said.

NEKIMA LEVY ARMSTRONG: Here's the body camera footage being released so swiftly because people are demanding the release of the information or because police feel that there's information that will vindicate or exonerate the officers involved.
Still, I do wonder, is it likely to be successful across all disciplines? When I taught college, my science-based biological anthropology courses did require me to jam in a lot of material. In a course on human evolution, for instance, doing a thorough job meant teaching a range of topics in genetics, primate behavior, fossil humans, and the evolution of cognition and behavior.
Feeding that demand, however, could be a lot more complicated — and expensive — if prairie grass' nutrient problems aren't solved.

And I really get a sense from doing this World Science Festival and other activities that there's a willingness and even an enthusiasm on the part of so many scientists to try to get the real message of science out there. So I think things are going in the right direction.
More broadly, Turpin said, discussions that started around sexual harassment in the newsroom also turned up wider questions about how we treat each other. It's about civility, it's about what's acceptable behavior in the newsroom. I think we want to make sure we have a civil and respectful work place, and I think we need to work out what our baselines are and what's acceptable and what's not. I think it's clear that we don't have as strong a sense of shared values around civility and around what's acceptable as I think we might have thought that we did, and we clearly need to work at that.

I want to ask one other question about—
Would we miss the hour-plus of speechifying and unspontaneous ovations from one side of the aisle or the other? Would we be the poorer without those hours of pregame and postgame punditry?
So where does that leave science and scientists? Some say it leaves them locked out of doing independent research unless you want to sign an agreement to hand over all the data that you collect, and lose control of it.

PETRAEUS: There are chances of that, without question. I mean, look. There's no question that the tensions have been dramatically increased as a result of this action. Perhaps the overlooked question is what kind of diplomatic initiative the U.S. puts forward now. This would very well, I think, be the time to - through intermediaries first and then directly with Iran - to sit down and say, OK, let's stop. Let's come to some agreement because this is clearly headed in a very bad direction. Make no mistake about it. There will be losses on all sides if this escalates further.

There's been a lot of discussion lately on how race and ethnicity affect success in romantic matches.

So when you're booked in a weird city and the booker calls you and goes, hey, man, I need you to go do blah, blah, blah, Arkansas and you look at it on a map and you can see that it's - I call it the blue line. It's the freeway. You know, the freeways on, like, the atlases are blue. They're denoted by the color blue. So I could look into about how far off the blue line a city was whether or not I was going to have problems. And it looks like a problem city. OK, I'm going to go into town late. I'm going to pull up right to the venue. I'm going to do my gig, get my money. And then I'm leaving.

Now Medicare has temporarily changed its rules to offer a reprieve from those late-enrollment penalties for anyone who kept the ACA policy after becoming eligible for Medicare Part B. For those 65 and older and for people with disabilities, Medicare Part B covers doctor visits and outpatient care.
Now, there was a failure of planning. There was a failure of deployment. There are ways that this could have been prevented. The fact that we got ourselves into this mess in the first place is the real problem. So, while there are clearly sympathies within law enforcement to the demonstrations, to the Trump administration, to the kinds of conspiracy theories that they are in league with, I don't think that that is the way to understand what happened.
Many of America's communities are changing, and so is how voters decide what matters most to them and whom they want their leaders to be.

Governor Cuomo's executive order that we refer to as a shutdown exempts 59 specific occupations that are at work today in New York. And so any of us who are working from home also need to recognize that there are a lot of Americans who don't have that option, and they continue to provide the electricity, the health care, the package deliveries - all the things we rely on in this shutdown environment.

RUSSAKOFF: You know, he didn't want to say anything critical about what happened. He said that he feels that he learned that change comes more slowly in school districts than he thought it did.

Producer Ann Marie Baldonado spoke to John Carney and they started with a clip. Connor's band has made a cassette recording and he's playing it for his older brother, Brendan, who's been schooling him on '80s pop music.

A separate group of New York lawmakers led by Rep. Yvette Clarke wants the bureau to extend counting at least through September due to the social disruption caused by COVID-19.
SAGAL: On Sunday, Nancy Pelosi narrowly won reelection to her fourth term as blank.
Since then, she's been creating bright, primary-colored portraits that both celebrate and transcend Ethiopian culture.
EFF attorney Andrew Crocker says Congress could make rules that force Apple to cooperate.
This 1996 statute became known as a core pillar of Internet freedom and the law that gave us modern Internet — a critical component of free speech online. But the journey of Section 230 runs through some of the darkest corners of the Web. Most egregiously, the law has been used to defend Backpage.com, a website featuring ads for sex with children forced into prostitution.
And it's wrong to kind of, I think, to paint animals as good or bad. You know, they're all trying to make their living. And they're all trying to do the best they can. And the truth of it is, actually, that painted wolves are extraordinary animals. And actually, it's often lions are the baddies - if there was one in those situations. And, you know, that story about that - the way they look after their pack, their co-pack members is remarkable.
Total Wireless – A Solid Verizon's Network
ALISON KODJAK, BYLINE: There's a good chance you didn't know that the nation's health department has a team of lawyers dedicated to protecting your civil rights. Traditionally, they focus on making sure you're not denied medical care because of your race or gender or on protecting your medical privacy. Roger Severino says he plans to continue to defend those rights. But he's also made it clear that his top priority is to protect health care providers' religious freedom.
At a steakhouse in McLean this week, ads for Bloomberg played on large TV screens mounted above the bar. Marc Steckel, a retired federal employee, said in 2016 he voted against Republicans for the first time, choosing a third-party candidate. Steckel, 63, said if he votes in the primary, he will likely pick Klobuchar. He said in November, he would support any Democratic nominee against Trump – except Sanders.
North Carolina has lost business over the law, including NCAA championship events that were scheduled to be held in the state.
The crisis led Goodell to issue tougher league rules concerning domestic violence, including the six-game suspension penalty.
Police believe the men arrested may have been responsible for 17 such heists in the past two years.
The brothers agreed to cooperate in the investigation, Risa Lanier, a prosecutor with the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, explained during the bond hearing later. As more evidence — such as text messages, phone records, social media records, bank records, surveillance video and the receipt from the purchase of the rope — was obtained by investigators, this investigation shifted from a hate crime to disorderly conduct.
HORSLEY: The Trump supporters eventually disperse under steady pressure from police. Some promise to return with weapons.
THOMPSON: Every time I come out here, I am super surprised at how many, you know, older folk are here. I think that's really important for them to turn out.

He thinks that the leaders are corrupt crooks, and they they've ruined the country, Caddell said.
Somewhere on the order of 50,000 cow pies got shipped to Texas for this study, says Craine, who co-owns Boulder, Colorado-based Jonah Ventures.
Automakers are especially at risk because of the sector's high volume of cross-border trade, and because it is so vulnerable to consumer opinion.
NPR's news operation is a team effort. But a newsroom can't abruptly lose its leader — as NPR did in November when Michael Oreskes resigned under pressure amid allegations of sexual harassment — and expect to bounce back quickly or easily. More disruption could be on the way, as well, given that NPR has announced internally that it will search for a new newsroom head, who — unless she or he is already at NPR — will likely come with his or her own priorities and vision.
You should be sure to see his 2004 feminist masterwork Moolaade. But this first one remained the foundation stone. It put an entire continent on the movie map and showed other would-be African filmmakers what was possible. It opened up the world, and it did this with an artistry startling in a new director. Beautifully shot by Christian Lacoste, this movie about black people and white people becomes a symphony in blacks and whites, from the black-and-white tile floors to the black patterns on Diouana's white dresses to the newspaper article about her that appears near the end. The whole story is encapsulated in the African mask that Diouana gives to her mistress on her first day of work. Each time we see it, its emotional charge has changed until the mask has gone from being a gesture of appreciation to a symbol of angry rebellion.
Right now, the economy is not driving American politics, he said. You don't have unemployment at a 50-year low while at the same time you've got a president who has never ever had a 50% job approval rating in any credible national poll.
YONG: And I think actually, even though there are a huge number of unknowns left, it is astonishing how much we know about this virus considering that literally no one knew that it existed mere months ago.
I was actually in the tunnels under the complex when the breach occurred and Capitol Police told me to barricade myself in a secure location, which I did, the Illinois Democrat told NPR's All Things Considered.

The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in California and Washington state on Wednesday. The most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the U.S. to Mexico.
Remarkably, all this relativity stuff was only one of Einstein's playgrounds. The other, his muse and demon, was quantum theory. Next week, I'll take it up from here, and explain why Einstein got his Nobel prize for his ideas on the nature of light (being both a wave and a particle) and not for relativity. And why he was haunted by the quantum ghost to the end of his life.
G COURTER: Well, you know, at first, we just got to make the best of a bad situation. But the virus cases keep coming, and the numbers go up incrementally. Yesterday, there were 46 new cases, virtually doubling. Today, there are three or four. And now we're awaiting a helicopter and a boat run by the (inaudible) coast guard that is supposedly taking some samples from other ill (inaudible), I guess to test them for the virus. And all (inaudible) bringing medical supplies on board for people, the passengers who are all running out of their prescribed medications 'cause the trip is extended for two more weeks.
INSKEEP: I want to ask about one of your colleagues, one of a number who voted to object to the obvious election results - Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri. He was the first senator to say that he would join the objections. He raised his fist to the mob before they stormed the building. He continued his objections afterward and said, if I can paraphrase, listen, I'm just raising some concerns about ballot security. Is there any doubt, though, that your colleague knew what he was inciting?

There is some concern that businesses are getting ahead of themselves in the sense that while there's been a lot of good talk about rolling back regulations, about cutting taxes, there's only been very, very limited progress so far, Behravesh said. So the worry is that we could be setting ourselves up for disappointment.

Two class-action lawsuits against the RCMP have been before the courts for five years. They include allegations of rape, unwanted sexual touching, physical assault, sexist comments, threats, gender discrimination, harassment and bullying. It's expected that about 1,000 former and current employees of the RCMP will seek compensation.

So once you're done with that makeup process, you still are looking at a 10- to 12-hour shoot day, and then you're looking at a tear-down period. ... The Shape of Water, the amphibian man, was a quick one because it went on in only three hours, it was less glued down makeup and more suit, therefore it came off faster. So we got that off in about 40 minutes.
The treasure-hunt aspect for patients is slowly improving. The National Infusion Center Association built a website that now lists clinics known to offer it. (It shows that the Regeneron drug has been shipped to a clinic in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, which is not far from Spokane.)
Medicaid, part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society initiative of the 1960s, is an entitlement program in which the government pays each state a certain percentage of the cost of care for anyone eligible for the health coverage. As a result, the more money states spend on Medicaid, the more they get from Washington.
Today, Santa Barbara is much better prepared for an oil spill than it was in 1969. There's a 46-foot fast-response vessel in the harbor. And animals exposed to oil are cared for by a statewide group called the Oiled Wildlife Care Network.
The goal is to inspire students to want to learn. If we hold to labels like coddling, we miss the point. My students work incredibly hard to qualify for med school and law school, and for engineering, finance, and other professional careers. Drexel is a cooperative education school, which means that students spend some of their time working at actual jobs in their fields. At times, they hold down part-time jobs while also taking a full roster of courses. These students are intensely hard-working, even driven — very far from a coddled stereotype. The humanities, unfortunately, tends to get short shrift in this context. It is important to find ways to lure students into reading for intellectual stimulation and pleasure rather than just for facts and careerist ends. So I don't see this as coddling but as intellectual seduction without which we are likely to see the books and ideas we love fall by the wayside.
That's the area where they're actually burying people right now. Each of those people has someone who's related to them, so it's an important day for those families, she says.
Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong, Raffensperger said at one point. We have to stand by our numbers. We believe our numbers are right.

HAVILAND: Absolutely. You want to talk with parents. You want to make it a part of the conversation. You want to talk with administrators and make sure that the school environment is safe and always possible. You want to make sure that you've created a community among the students where the students - when they see something, they will tell you.
In general, the bureau says all U.S. residents should be counted where they usually live and sleep, even if they're away on Census Day (April 1).

GONYEA: And a boast about the small-dollar donations to fuel his campaign.

The U.S. government is able to make contracts with industry under the law prioritizing the production of goods in scarce supply. It can also provide loan guarantees or lend money directly to targeted industries, and it can shield them from anti-trust actions resulting from firms cooperating and planning with one another. And if those incentives prove insufficient, administration officials can also use what's called an allocation authority — namely, telling firms that the government has the right to purchase their products above anyone else.
I mean, obviously we're successful and we're successful partially because of the opportunities that America has offered. But, again, it's only possible because of a war that the United States waged in Vietnam. And there are so many Asian immigrants and refugees who have come from countries like the Philippines, Korea, Laos, Cambodia who are here in the United States because of wars that the U.S. waged overseas. And the difficulty for Americans and for these refugees and immigrants is to think about both of these kinds of things at the same time - economic opportunity domestically in the United States for some Asian immigrants and refugees, not all of them - that are made possible because of foreign wars that the United States have waged abroad.
I come from this family of social justice lawyers and I had these incredible role models. Right? But I was always encouraged to pursue my dreams — not to be corny — but that's how I was raised ... and I'm super thankful for that.
The prairie is so diverse, in fact, that to study it, Craine and researchers from Texas A&M University don't actually study the plants themselves. They study poop, collected between 1994 and 2016 everywhere from Texas to Kansas to Montana.

Last year Trump ordered Perry to take steps to help struggling coal and nuclear power plants, which have trouble competing against cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. No such plan has been carried out so far. Meanwhile, coal plants have continued to close during Trump's time in office, and coal consumption in the U.S. has hit its lowest point in nearly four decades.
One of the worshipers is 20-year-old Ali Hajizadeh. He says the nuclear deal is enough engagement with the West for now.
Lieber set up the WUT-Harvard Joint Nano Key Laboratory, according to the complaint, without telling Harvard about it.

Lieber is currently out on a $1 million dollar bond.

Albert Einstein figured this out sometime between 1905 and 1910, when he was trying hard to expand his theory of relativity to objects that could accelerate. His original theory, the special, only considered objects moving at constant speeds. When Einstein saw the link between gravity and acceleration, he was stunned. But it makes sense. If you go up an elevator, you feel heavier the faster the elevator goes up. Gravity and acceleration are deeply linked. (My co-blogger Adam Frank explored gravity and elevators here some time ago.)

SAGAL: The woman was understandably upset that not a single employer had reached out to her, so she checked out her resume, only to find out in huge letters at the top of it, her name was listed as Princess Banana Hammock. Apparently, the Word document automatically changed her given name to her computer's username, and she did not notice. Employers did, though, and were clearly too nervous to reach out to a member of the monarchy to offer her an interview.

SASSE: I think we need to change rules that allow people to be fundraising while the Senate is in session. You know, I'm a fan of term limits. I don't think the idea of constantly trying to get these feedback loops and make politics the center of kind of horse race rage, addiction, social media stuff. I don't think any of that is healthy. So the fundraising is gross. I have - I want to ban cameras in committee rooms, not audio. I want the American people to have transparency. But I want to end the constant grandstanding that drives so much of our politics at present. And so I want this kind of gross stuff, this kind of - these kinds of fundraising stunts to be ended.

Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó declared himself the country's interim president amid nationwide protests Wednesday, in a bid to seize power from sitting leader Nicolás Maduro.
And so this continues to be the problem: Whites who have benefited from this system of order continue to support order over justice. And what I think is being demanded in this moment is some courage. Some willingness to stare a little bit of disorder in the face. As a necessary part of producing a more just and ultimately more stable society, because, look, our state, our society, is a mess. The standards of living are declining for all but the richest. People are miserable. And to say that we need to hold on to that system at the expense of racial justice because it's less scary is a profound kind of cowardice.

For the poll's three most recent years (2017, 2018, 2019), the team analyzed every new recording that received a vote, as many as 500 recordings per year. The total number of projects led and co-led by women artists represented in the poll over that time span was between 18% and 22%, in keeping with the representation of women in multiyear analysis of the top 50. Although the number of women in the top 10 in 2019 was 50%, and higher than it had ever been before, the number of projects led or co-led by women overall actually declined slightly from 22% in 2018 to 21% in 2019.
Baylor failed to take appropriate action to respond to reports of sexual assault and dating violence reportedly committed by football players.

Madaya's a small Syrian town located between Damascus and the border with Lebanon that has been held by rebels and under siege since July of 2015. In January of this year, Rym Momtaz, a producer for ABC News, was able to get in touch with a mother of five children in Madaya. ABC News has joined with Marvel Comics to try to tell the story of a woman who was in a place that reporters can't reach in a truly vivid and graphic way. They have produced a nonfiction graphic book, a true life digital comic called Madaya Mom. Rym Momtaz joins us now and also Dalibor Talajic, the Marvel Comics artist who has drawn Madaya Mom. Let me thank both of you for being with us.
I know from my meetings here in Beijing that my counterparts have very much taken the resolution to heart, he says.
He says the same thing today, sitting in a big easy chair in the same living room, his eyes watery and his face grave. The data he and his fellow engineers presented, and their persistent and sometimes angry arguments, weren't enough to sway Thiokol managers and NASA officials. Ebeling concludes he was inadequate. He didn't argue the data well enough.
The DPA is a law that has its origins in the War Powers Acts of World War II, which granted the executive branch broad powers to direct industrial production for the war effort. Those authorities were allowed to expire when the war was over, but in 1950, after Soviet-backed North Korea invaded South Korea, President Harry Truman revived those lapsed powers by persuading Congress to enact the DPA.
After the earthquake, C4C sent relief materials such as tents and money for food and first-aid items to congregants in Dapcha and other affected areas. Gary Fallesen, C4C's founder and president, and a team were also in Nepal in October helping rebuild the earthquake-damaged house that belongs to the family of Sumitra Pariyar, a young woman who believes she was healed from paralysis and seizures by her acceptance of Christ.
Neither party is making a very good impression, either. Only about a third of Americans have a positive view of congressional Democrats (34 percent), while a majority (53 percent) disapprove of the job they are doing.

It used to be the case that if computer science was your thing and you wanted to be a software engineer, the best place for you to reap a return on those skills was to go to Silicon Valley, he says. Now, that's probably still true today; it's just less true than it used to be.
Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam. It requires Muslims who are healthy and financially able to travel to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. During this time, men and women perform a ritual called tawaf: praying while making seven circles around the Kaaba, a black cubic structure in the middle of the Great Mosque. The Kaaba is believed to have served as a sanctuary for centuries.
Instead of answering the question, Stanton said, Dr. Rivers, this is Claire Shipley.
As a doctor, if I admit 100 patients to the hospital and only three recover enough under my treatment to be discharged, I would deserve to lose my medical license, said Sen.

The suburbs around Philadelphia had been growing less and less Republican over the decades, but Democrats are hoping the 2018 and 2019 elections were the tipping points for making those areas blue. In 2018, four Democratic women won congressional seats, most of them from the Philly suburbs. And the delegation is now evenly split with nine from each party in the U.S. House. In 2019 local elections, governments in three suburban counties flipped from Republican to Democrat – one for the first time since the Civil War.
A lot of my voters, a lot of my citizens, do not trust the voting system after November, after a lot of misinformation went out about this specific system, elections director Joseph Kirk said.
So I do it because, and I know, look, it's self-serving as hell, but it's true. I have a great sense of justice.
Depending on whom is asked, President Trump's Saturday phone call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — during which he urged state officials to find votes that could overturn his loss in the state during November's election — may have violated state and federal law.

Cipollone also falsely stated that not even Mr. Schiff's Republican colleagues were allowed into the SCIF during the pre-impeachment depositions. In fact, Republicans from all three of the House committees that held the depositions were allowed into the secure hearing room, and many of them did attend.
He also ordered the development of miniaturized nuclear weapons, tactical nukes, military surveillance satellites and hypersonic aircraft.
MALEK: (As Elliot Alderson) I like coming here 'cause your Wi-Fi was fast. I mean, you're one of the few spots that has a fiber connection with gigabit speed.

Those are my opinions, and mine alone. Here's what the newsroom told me yesterday, via an official statement:
State officials in Tennessee applauded the approval.
And I think that the kind of angry white man, white supremacy at the center of the movement we saw yesterday is emboldened by their racial status. They feel like they have the right to engage in this kind of behavior. Clearly these white nationalists, extremists feel that they have the right to do this. And without having to worry about any consequences.
Yeah. And it was our conclusion that they were trying to set me up. He was involved with one man — he was involved with one man who was the lawyer and one of the chief associates of someone who basically stole the biggest bank in Ukraine. Walked out with $7 billion. And the fear was that he was around Zelenskiy to protect that guy. And then he had another man with him who worked closely with George Soros, whose organization AntAC was substantially involved in obtaining a lot of the illegal information to hurt Trump, Manafort, Trump Junior in the campaign.
Cathy Donnelly Courtesy of Cathy Donnelly I retired at 50.5 years. My job was not unfulfilling but I know that I was done. 28 years of being a 911 dispatcher takes it toll.

I love my job and my benefits and feel fresh again in the work force. Starting on year five and couldn't be happier. Advice: DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY!
This is, arguably, the most direct observation of black holes ever made. Because black holes are (as their name implies) black, they can't be seen with ordinary telescopes. Up until now, their existence has been inferred by looking at the stars and gas swirling around them. This gravitational signal comes directly from the holes, and it is virtually incontrovertible proof that the holes are out there. If black holes didn't really exist, you couldn't explain these waves, he says.

The company asserts that its own executives will not pick and choose favorites. Rather, they'll let the users decide what counts as a trusted source.
OSBORN: They started to study the engineering processes better and discovered that there is information about these risks that gets to top managers, he says. Schvartsman, the CEO, said in a letter to the board on Saturday that he and the other directors acted adequately and correctly.

Trump's use of tools like regulations, guidance and executive orders to modify health programs was like an attack by a thousand paper cuts, said Maura Calsyn, managing director of health policy at the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank. Approaching the November election, she said, the administration was in the process of doing irreparable harm to the nation's health care system.
Wyoming and Idaho had issued permits to hunt 23 grizzlies last fall, before the federal judge's decision restored federal protections for the bears. Montana held off on granting a hunting season, but few doubt that the state would soon do the same.

Much of what we assume about this giving of Information has been established by custom. President George Washington decided a report each year made sense, and he also gave the first SOTU to Congress in person in 1790 in Federal Hall in New York City, the seat of the fledgling U.S. government at the time.

DWYER: So are the next two men in line for his job if he does resign. But Fairfax, the lieutenant governor, may not last long enough to see that happen. A state lawmaker says he plans to begin impeachment proceedings against the black politician, who has denied the rape allegations. It would be more difficult to dislodge his colleagues, who have admitted to wearing blackface and who have vowed to complete their terms. But Dagnes says they may be missing the point.

ALDA: Yeah, he was finally satisfied with that. But here's the thing. Doctors were civilians. I was in the arts. I was in show business. That was my life. That was my identity. I didn't want to do anything else. And when people ask me for advice - young people who want to be actors or writers - especially if they want to be actors, I say to them, if there's anything else you can do, you should do it. If there's any hint that you can do something else, don't waste your life trying to be in show business because you have to have an all-consuming need to do it - an all-consuming passion. And I did have that. There was nothing else that I would consider being.

One of the major bulwarks of policing is not right wing extremists, it's centrist liberalism. It's the belief that what's most important is the production of order. And the willingness to to turn that problem over to police and the criminal legal system. And the kind of willful ignorance about what the consequences of that turning over are for the people who are subjected to it. So part of what's happening is a racial reckoning. That the folks who've been subjected to that system of order are unwilling to put up with it anymore.

But when reports began to surface in 2014 and 2015 that seafood harvested or processed by forced labor was making it into the supply chains of major U.S. retailers like Walmart, Kroger, Safeway and restaurants like Red Lobster, corporations were quick to make public commitments and include stronger language in their supplier guidelines in hopes of addressing the problem. Delivering on those promises, however, has proved harder. Traceability alone hasn't been enough. Until now, retailers have had few tools to make it easier to identify which fisheries are actually at higher risk for human rights abuses.
And even in 2016, they'll have to prove their mettle in some of these House contests. Targeted races for Flores in Nevada and Teachout in New York are GOP-held swing seats, and Republicans welcome the chance to take on the most progressive nominee.

He was driving to his job one day at the University of Massachusetts Amherst when he heard a radio commentator slam the idea of paying college athletes. He heard hints of racial bias. Being a social scientist, Nteta wanted to test his hunch. He devised a survey that weighed variables like age, sex and interest in college sports and negative attitudes towards African-Americans, a measure he calls racial resentment. Then Nteta crunched the numbers.

Whether it's a deadly cold snap or a hole under an Antarctic glacier or a terrifying new report, there seem to be constant reminders now of the dangers that climate change poses to humanity.
All right. So, you can — you can — I don't know what that means. You tell me what the conclusion is. I had to find people in Ukraine. I couldn't use the FBI because the witnesses had been trying the FBI for a year, and right or wrong, the witnesses — that amount to about, now, 12 people — were convinced the FBI was corrupt because they were convinced that the FBI agent in the Kiev embassy was corrupt. And they had tried to go to the FBI and you'll see on my interviews that one of them says he went to an FBI agent, he names a specific FBI agent, and the FBI agent basically said, you know, don't bother. Nobody is interested in this. They attempted to go to the Justice Department and talk with a lawyer that laid out Biden's criminality and the collusion, criminality. And they were turned away. Again, the impression they got was all they were interested in was getting Trump.
MOORE: Just that she was going to be a wife, a television wife. And that really had its classical parameters and dimensions, and they were established and they hardly ever varied, except as to whether or not the wife was the star of the show, in which case she was the funny one. Or if she were the straight man for the male star and she was then totally supportive. But all these wives were kind of obedient and, you know, a representative of the vows to love, honor and obey. They hardly varied from that. And with Carl Reiner's character the way she was written, Laura actually had opinions of her own. And while she was asserting herself, she also didn't make Dick Van Dyke look like a dummy. It was a matter of two people. I mean, society's expectations at that point still said, hey, wait a minute, lady. You only go so far here.
The shift has already proven doable, he said. Last week, NPR put forth, among other stories, a major investigative series on sexual assault of people with intellectual disabilities, a report on why states are worried about changes to 529 college savings plans, and a thoughtful piece on if and how sexual harassers find redemption. All that while covering the fight over the DACA program, the revocation of Temporary Protective Status for El Salvador, and the uproar over reports of the president's profanity when discussing which immigrants should be allowed to enter the U.S.

He had to keep his mind clear, thinking ahead to the next patient and the next. I'll continue with 35,000 units every four hours. We'll use higher doses on the next patient. Next time, I'll also use a double dose for the first injection.
But what it meant is, as you said, is that suddenly the - this female, Charm, whose job it is normally to provide because the females do most of the hunting and most the providing of the food, she not only had to be the provider, but she had to take the role of the males whose job it is fundamentally to be a protector of the pride. She had to do both jobs. And that, of course, put enormous pressure on her.
The GCF is designed to do this in a range of ways, says Martinez-Diaz, who is now global director of the Sustainable Finance Center at the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank.

DIONNE: I think the big - the big talk here is, is Bernie Sanders closer to Howard Dean in '04, where Dean generated a lot of energy in the antiwar left of the party? A lot of volunteers came in for Dean, and it turned out he didn't have the depth on the ground. Or is he Barack Obama? I think it's already very clear that Bernie Sanders is stronger than Howard Dean in 2004. And the question is, how close does he get to where Barack Obama is? I think Dean - Sanders, rather - speaks for a very odd feeling a lot of Democrats have toward the president, which is they approve of him; they're happy he's there, but they still wish, at times, that he had been more progressive and had taken on the Republicans harder. And I think Sanders speaks for that and speaks for an idealism among the young that's really captured in that ad where - called America, which uses the Simon and Garfunkel song and really doesn't have any words at all. It doesn't have any words about policy in it at all. It's about a feeling of change.

Well, the good news is we have concluded this phase one trade agreement. This is evidence that there's intention on both sides to solve our economic problem and maintain and develop our economic relations. There is a good attempt on both sides. At the same time, I think people have to follow the economic and technological logic. They cannot do anything against this logic. For American business, for American companies, they have to weigh the pros and cons, they have to aim at the most efficient allocation of resources and of their production. They have to follow the law of economics, not any wish of any politician.

McConnell needs at least 51 of the 53 Senate Republicans to support his rules if he wants them to pass.

Those amendments also need 51 votes, meaning all 47 Democrats need to recruit four Republicans if they hope to change any element of McConnell's plan.

If you close your eyes for a few moments, you can try imagining the line stretching back from you to your parents to your grandparents to your great-grandparents, etc., ticking off grandmas until your reach someone working in some field 10,000 years ago in a world of endless forests, fields, oceans and mountains.
For nearly a full year, he zoomed along at 17,500 miles per hour — orbiting 230 miles above earth — on the International Space Station. And for those million or so of us who follow him on Twitter, Cmdr. Kelly's year in space gave us a mind-expanding view of planet Earth.

But it has also created demand for continuous updates and real-time collaboration. And that change has driven some companies — including IBM, Best Buy and Yahoo — to recall some of their remote workforces back into the office.
In earlier days, Sallenave says, each city had a local team to oversee Uber operations and drivers might have the cell number of the general manager. But once Uber centralized its system, in an effort to aggressively scale up, we were so focused on the rocket ship of growth that corporate leaders let communication systems fall apart.
GUNTON: Yeah, absolutely. In fact, there is a situation where, (laughter), the vehicle drives over a dropping. One of the painted wolves had had a poo there, and they drove over it. And as they drove over it, it squished it. So it released some smell. And he said, stop, we're following a different pack here. That's the other pack.

The DMV will soon begin evaluating permit applications for companies interested in launching self-piloted car tests, although the likelihood of approval appears to be slim.
His name is originally Farrokh Bulsara, and he wasn't even called that as a kid. A very strong set of buck teeth - and most of the kids in school called him Buckie (ph). So you see this young man who travels from Zanzibar and goes to a boarding school called St. Peter's in India. He travels there on a ship. He feels very, I think, removed and isolated. And when he comes back to Zanzibar, his country is in the midst of a revolution. They have to immigrate to London. And he's a young man at that point, feels like a fish out of water in the 1970s, trying to identify himself sexually as well. I mean, so much stands in the way of this man becoming who he is.
And so when you go into these charter schools - the one that I spent a lot of time in was a KIPP elementary school called SPARK Academy. There were two certified teachers in every grade from kindergarten through third. There was also a learning specialist or a tutor for every grade so that children who couldn't learn in the small groups that these two teachers set up for those who were academically behind or just struggling - there would be a learning specialist who would push in and do extra work with them.

But experiments measure — they don't ask questions of meaning. John Wheeler, the physicist who proposed such experiments in the 1970s, would have been amazed if he had seen the current results. It does seem that the present can influence the past, at least at the level of quantum objects.

Green mold. It's made from a fluid produced by a common green mold in the same family as the mold that grows on stale bread and that's used to make Roquefort cheese.
HAVILAND: It can be a very scary experience. It's a reality now that our students in our schools are preparing for. So when we do a drill, we don't tell our students they are drills because we need them to take everything seriously. And we want to normalize and help them feel calm during those things. And I've also wondered, what is the impact of doing these drills for our students?
The suspended columns are made of Corten steel, which is a material that rusts over time, making them appear like the bloody corpses they are meant to represent.

Two Democrats in Georgia won the state's U.S. Senate runoffs this week — a stunning upset after nearly two decades of Republican control that also handed Democrats a narrow majority in the Senate.
CUMMINGS: That came out more abrupt than I meant for it to. What I'm saying is it is a relatively new art form, medium, whatever it is you want to call it. And people are figuring out what they like there. If what I do makes people uncomfortable, I totally understand. I'm not going to change.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: The judges ultimately backed down and decided not to take a stance on the civil rights remedy. Now it was down to the final negotiations and deals cut behind closed doors. It had been nearly four years since Victoria started working on the bill. And in that time, a lot had happened.
KHALID: It's about pragmatism. And that's a common theme at Biden rallies. I bypass the clipboards and stickers and the line of voters signing up for Biden campaign updates, and I make my way inside.
Rudell recalls they were a dynamic and charismatic young couple.

What I regret about her experience is that she was treated as though she was on trial. She was not on trial. She had done nothing wrong. ... She decided that what she had known needed to be known by the decision-makers. So she reached out to her member of Congress, to make sure that those people who have the responsibility for vetting this guy knew this thing that she knew. And she wanted to remain anonymous because it was never about her. She initiated all that visited her in the ensuing months because she felt an obligation as a citizen to make sure that those who are in a position of power and responsibility had all the information.

Another theme that I saw coming out of all this was these different narratives about what to make of the way that police force was used. I saw some people saying, Look at this reaction, this is proof that the police are ineffective! Different people were saying, Look at this, we need police to be stronger and more prepared and have more weapons at their disposal. And then I saw other people saying that this is how police should respond to any situation, with the sort of calm and restraint that kept things escalating even more. What did you take from Wednesday's events? And what do you think other people should be considering?
NPR invited Slutsky to comment; he declined.
LANDAU: (As Judah Rosenthal) I know you have. I've heard these stories before.
I'm trying to share my heritage but also to show the universality of people around the world. I've gone from looking at body painting around Ethiopia to looking across the continent to looking around the world. The Kayapo indigenous people of Brazil, Wodaabe people of West Africa, Maori people of New Zealand, for example, all used body painting. I realized from looking at all these different kinds of body painting that there are all of these lines of connection between different societies. Whatever our struggle, there's something that we share. The whole collection isn't a matter of looking at our differences. It's a matter of looking at the similarities that we share.
GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guests are Vic Chesnutt and Guy Picciotto. And Vic Chesnutt is a singer and songwriter. His new CD is called At the Cut.

Although Congress passed [Section] 856 to shut down crack houses, its words reach well beyond them, the opinion said. Safehouse's benevolent motive makes no difference. And even though this drug use will happen locally and Safehouse will welcome visitors for free, its safe-injection site falls within Congress' power to ban interstate commerce in drugs.

FADEL: That's NPR sports correspondent Tom Goldman. Thanks, Tom.
NGUYEN: Viet just means the name of the people. So my parents chose for me a very nationalist and patriotic name. And in combination with my last name - Nguyen - I am basically John Smith in Vietnam. But what's also interesting is that, you know, I've always understood that even as common as that name is - my name is for Vietnamese people here in the United States, it's obviously for many Americans - for most Americans - a very foreign name that they have a hard time getting their tongue around. But I've never changed my name because I think for whatever reason, as ambivalent as I feel about coming from Vietnam - especially, you know, when I was an adolescent growing up in the United States - as ambivalent as I felt about it, I also felt that I was Vietnamese. And whether or not Vietnamese people accept me as Vietnamese or see me as authentically Vietnamese, I always felt that there was a part of me that had been marked by being born in Vietnam, that had marked indelibly by being a refugee, by war and that I would not give up my name for anybody. My parents, for example, I think are more pragmatic. They have adopted American names legally, even though they're very, very, very Vietnamese.

Those powers apply only to U.S. companies, wherever they operate, according to Bialos. He says this could prove problematic if those companies have foreign firms in their supply chain. And not all companies are able to quickly shift production to what the government requires. For a company that already makes the widget, it's easier to say, 'OK, let's put your lines to full capacity, let's repurpose your lines,'  says Bialos. It gets a lot harder the less substitutable the production mix is.

Among those watching the session Wednesday was Joseph Bondy, the attorney for Lev Parnas, a former associate of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Bondy was in the Senate gallery as a guest of Schumer. Parnas, who has been indicted in New York for alleged campaign finance violations, wasn't in the gallery because he has to wear a GPS monitoring device as part of his pretrial release. Bondy declined to say where Parnas would watch the proceedings from.

For many years — nearly a century, in fact — it was believed that color vision was for spotting ripe fruit. But there may be a better adaptive hypothesis: We see colors so that we can see each other.
KHALID: Biden spoke for about a half an hour. He doesn't always stick to the script and meanders around. He took no questions from the crowd and no questions from the press. A major part of his appeal to voters, though, is not actually what he says in his speeches but the one-on-one interactions he has with them afterwards - the hugs, photos and the bits of conversation.
REUSS: And that's why, you know, it's a power thing. It's a hierarchy thing. Right now if you and I had some problem, I would look at you and I would say, who's going to believe you?

Scientists, by training, have little exposure to the humanities. Given that a major in the sciences requires a lot of technical work, we spend precious little time dealing with what happened culturally and historically around the science we are trying to understand. We don't learn much about Galileo and his bouts with the Roman Inquisition, or about Newton's religious motivation for his work or his research in alchemy, or Kepler's Pythagorean mysticism, or Darwin's struggles with his wife's (and his own) faith, or Einstein's work as a pacifist. In the classroom, at least, we learn about their technical ideas, but not about who they were or why they were thinking what they were at the time.

GONYEA: Yeah. I mean, where do I begin? The rallies are done for now at least. And when will people feel comfortable coming back to a rally? So that's an open question. Joe Biden held a virtual event on Friday. Sanders did a virtual fireside chat but so much of a campaign is about human contact.

OVERBY: AIPAC has more than 100,000 members and the biggest lobbying budget among pro-Israel groups - $3 1/2 million last year. Among its activities, it regularly flies lawmakers to Israel.

For one thing, it would send interest rates on Treasurys soaring and destroy the U.S. Treasury's risk-free status. That's what Strain means by foundation; right now, everyone knows and trusts that U.S. debt is a safe investment. Treasurys are used in all sorts of financial transactions worldwide. They're in many people's retirement accounts as a low-risk asset. Rattling faith in that Treasury would introduce massive amounts of uncertainty into the economy.

His transition team says he'll change a Trump administration policy that kept millions of doses in reserve, only to be shipped when it was time to administer people's second doses.
The movie is about a group of hippies who meet up with a family of homicidal maniacs who kill strangers to the area, eat their flesh and turn what's left over into sausage. The main character, known as Leatherface, wears a mask of human skin and attacks his victims with a chain saw.
Mr. GREENE: Well, the only thing I would say to that is, you know, when you're trying to answer questions that are this deep; questions that are in one form or another we've been asking for thousands of years, questions that could indeed lead to resolutions of how the universe began, where it all came from, the origin of time - these are big issues. And if you're working on a theory for a few decades and it matures in various unexpected ways, you go with it and you try ultimately to extract some predictions from it.
SIMON: I've got to tell you about a reaction I had. I found the message at the heart of this novel to be very American, that the power is in the pitch. You know, Darren says at one point earlier in the book, Martin Luther King, Malcolm X, James Baldwin, Frederick Douglass, Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman, they were all great salespeople.

Whether that will come to pass remains to be seen. But the problems papered over by the Copenhagen interpretation for so long are finally receiving the attention they deserve. And plumbing the depths of the quantum hole may yield an entirely new perspective, not just on the world of the quantum, but on the nature of reality itself.
Eubanks' statement also noted that the student who obtained Arthur's racy photo has been charged by local police with the crime of transmitting pornographic material using electronic media and now will now also face possible expulsion from the school District.

NAYDA ALVAREZ: They're going into our properties to build this wall. Luckily, we're in the 2019 appropriations. So whatever it is that they vote on next week, on the 15, that's when we'll find out what's going to happen to us. So we're hoping it doesn't go through or that they don't give any money towards the - any more barriers or walls.
The opening scene is archetypal: An ex-con named Nick Mason walks out of a maximum-security prison into a waiting limousine. Nick doesn't know why or how he's been released decades early from his 25-years-to-life sentence for his role in a caper that resulted in a cop's death, but he knows that a crime kingpin named Darius Cole — who's still inside the prison — is responsible.

Paul Mifsud, an MLB vice president and deputy general counsel, says the interpreters the teams are required to hire, which are subsidized by the league and included in negotiations with the players union, will be in place for the next five years. There was initial skepticism about the value of it, but at this point all teams, I think, have really bitten into it and find it extremely useful, Mifsud said. It's really started to improve the communication dynamic in the clubhouse and the ability of the players who may have felt uncomfortable talking to the media.
Mr. ALLEN: Oh, you're very welcome, Mark. What's your question?
It was a certainty. It might have been delayed for a month or a year or five or 10 years, but it guaranteed them that pathway. This administration has pulled the Band-Aid off. It's been realistic. We accept the facts on the ground as they are. This is a regime that lied to get into that nuclear deal. You can see that now. And what's going on at the IAEA [International Atomic Energy Agency] in Turquzabad where we now know that they lied about the scope of their program. These are important, Mary Louise. These are important items. You can't talk about the Iranian nuclear program without acknowledging the facts of what this regime has been up to. They stored documents. They kept technology in place. They dispersed it as a result of the JCPOA. They didn't have it in a central research agency, but they continued to develop their program and this administration is determined to prevent them from getting that weapon. Not now, not a year from now and not 10 years from now.
I mean, I could actually lose a kidney. And, I mean, I could die only because I cannot afford to go in there again. I don't want to die, especially just because of I don't have enough money to go in the hospital. But that's the reality of it. You know, I have a preexisting condition, my quadriplegia, and I can't get health insurance.

LANDAU: Well, I did a scene - a five-minute scene with a partner - not classical, contemporary, you know, give-and-take scene. You can't do a monologue. And it's still the case. And I did a scene from a play called Clash by Night. Lee Strasberg actually directed it on Broadway with a cast consisting of Lee J. Cobb, Tallulah Bankhead and Joseph Schildkraut. At any rate, I chose a five-minute scene from that piece. Everyone told me I was crazy because Lee had directed it. And they said there's nothing - there would be no way that he would, you know, agree with what I chose because he - his closeness to that material.

MOORE: You know, there was another thing that won them over. It wasn't just the fact that he was pomposity to the nth degree but that there was a vulnerability and a sweetness to Ted. We found out later that Ted, who was a more out of work than in work actor, had gone out and bought himself a blue blazer and a crest and had it sewn on the pocket so that he would look the part. And everybody just thought that was, you know, real throat-clenching stuff. And you know, if there had been any doubt about whether or not he was the right one, that clinched it.
A nurse for 30 years, Amy Waters had always been aware of a mostly unspoken but widespread sentiment that talking about unions could endanger her job. But after HCA Healthcare took over Mission Health in 2019, she saw nurses and support staff members being cut and she worried about the effect on patient care. Joining National Nurses United could help, she thought. During the pandemic, her fears only worsened. At times, nurses cared for seven patients at once, despite research indicating four is a reasonable number.
I think that it is a huge mistake, at the end of the day, to analyze this event in relationship to questions of policing. Because even if we had the perfect police deployment, and the Capitol was protected, [yesterday's violence] would have required high levels of force by police that would have just played into these existing polarizing narratives. It would have done nothing to resolve the underlying political problems, and might just have inflamed additional resentments. Which then just means police have more work to do.

That action came last night even though a chemical weapons verification mission was to begin today. Eleanor Beardsley is in Paris. Eleanor, thanks very much for being with us.
GARNER: I absolutely had that fear myself. I spent so much time, particularly my first few years in the Marine Corps, just trying to be accepted that I didn't speak up many times when I probably should have because I didn't want to call additional attention to myself. And in many ways, it was just about kind of survival, if that makes sense. And I think there's always that fear.
MWANGE: Supposedly if I get a vehicle.
ALLAM: So that really gives a sense of just how intense and chaotic the scene was. In some cases, you know, the police opened the gates. We also saw the mob trample and tear down barriers, climb up the scaffolding. There were booms from fireworks, paint guns, tear gas firing. People were running, shouting and celebrating.
Robert Socolow, another Princeton colleague, has mixed feelings about Happer's post. Socolow's own biography — first a physicist, then a specialist on the environment — makes him a kind of bridge between Happer and the environmental scientists on Princeton's campus. He doesn't doubt Happer's technical grasp of climate science but says that everybody has areas of irrationality.

But if quantum physics really applies at all scales, what's the true answer to the measurement problem? What's actually going on in the quantum world? Historically, the standard answer was to say that there is no measurement problem, because it's meaningless to ask what's going on when nobody's looking. The things that happen when nobody's looking are unobservable, and it's meaningless to talk about unobservable things. This position is known as the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum physics, after the home of the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr. Bohr was the godfather of quantum physics and the primary force behind the Copenhagen interpretation.

Bipartisan appeals have not gone far in Colorado. Not a single Republican voted for the bill as it moved through the state legislature. During a debate on the House floor, one Republican even suggested renaming the bill the We Really, Really, Really, Really, Really Hate Donald Trump Act of 2019.
Control of the Senate significantly changes what President-elect Joe Biden could do, but most importantly, his party will now be able to set the legislative agenda. Democrats failed to make the kind of gains in Senate races in November that many had forecast, with GOP incumbents staving off strong challenges in several states. But with narrow control, they will wield the gavels for Senate committees, call hearings and decide which items get top priority.

We think of this as a systemic issue, like something that happens outside of ourselves, when in fact the aggregate sum of all of our actions and choices exacerbates or ameliorates the wealth gap, says Wey.

VANCE: So New York law goes a little bit further than it has to go. The Fifth Amendment protects a defendant who's been tried on a charge once from being tried again. We call that double jeopardy. But it really only applies if you're tried by the same sovereign.

If a plane crashes and people are killed because of this shutdown, is the wall worth that?

A number of things, but one of the interesting concepts we're working on are centers that will be put into neighborhoods, repurposing some of the old buildings, and exposing people to what those many opportunities are, exposing people to some basic skills that people used to get, for instance in high school, creating mentorship programs.

Earlier this week, NPR was taking a middle road on air: preempting All Things Considered to air the first minutes of the daily White House briefing, which are generally the most news-filled, and then cutting back to the newsmagazine partway through the briefing, to provide analysis of what was said. That is better than running the entire briefing live, but a better public service would be to simply stop the live broadcasts and report on what is said later, using the same news judgment as for any story. Of course, NPR could still do what it always has done: break into its regular programming if the briefing warrants.

My work starts out with a sketch — more like chicken scratches. But I start on paper with the idea. Then I figure out what I need for that set. I look at a lot of archived images from Ethiopia in the 1930s and 1940s. People then looked so regal, and their Afros were so perfect. I don't know how they got it that perfect. I can't get anybody's Afros perfect today. You'll notice a lot of my clothing is long, and you don't see a lot of leg. That comes from these archived images because I don't want people to focus on the exotic or erotic features of the female body. It's more about her gaze.
The new U.N. resolution is not just adding a few new companies to a sanctions list or a few new North Korean officials, Szubin says.

Given that so many artists who have come before me, especially artists of color, have given me so much, I feel like I have a platform and I want to use it.

We would refuse to reconstitute these forces, to retrain them, to fill them back up with people, equipment and weapons and so forth until the toxic leaders were removed. Sadly, those leaders were returned to their positions several years later.

House Republicans preferred to force votes to approve debt ceiling increases in an effort to bring more accountability and political pressure to reduce the nation's deficit and debt. However, that decision never resulted in reducing spending and only added to a culture of brinksmanship in recent years that often threatened the U.S. into default on its debts and increased economic uncertainty around the globe.

The existing culture of mask-wearing helped Asian societies in this regard — and is partly a legacy of SARS. After surviving the outbreak 17 years ago, many people in this part of the world began wearing masks even if they just had a cold — to protect others but also for a sense of being protected from others, even if there isn't scientific data to back that up.
There are a lot of people out there who would be delighted to take people under their wings but they don't have a good mechanism for doing that. (And) to provide day care for so many of the young ladies who end up getting pregnant and then their education stops. Provide them a mechanism so that they can go back and get their GED, get their associate's degree, their bachelor's degree, their master's degree, take care of themselves and teach their children to take care of themselves, so that you break the cycles. The systems that we have been using for decades don't seem to be breaking the cycles. They seem to be adding to them, so we have to start thinking a little bit differently about these things.

The idea is that mixing chopped mushrooms into our burgers boosts the umami taste, adds more moisture and reduces the amount of beef required for a burger. And reducing the need for beef has a big impact on the environment. According to the World Resources Institute, if 30 percent of the beef in every burger in America were replaced by mushrooms, it would reduce greenhouse emissions by the same amount as taking 2.3 million vehicles off of our roads.

When a new Congress convenes every two years, the majority party must approve a resolution outlining House rules, the intricate parliamentary procedures that govern the chamber. Two notable changes in the Democrats' package are aimed at avoiding certain confrontations that became commonplace during the Republican majority from 2011 through 2019, after the rout of the party in the 2018 midterms.

This is, however, a narrow sample. Broadening the base for analysis to the top 50 new releases offers a clearer picture. The percentage of projects led or co-led by women over the life of the poll has ranged from 8% to 20% — until 2019, when it jumped to 34%, perhaps the result of recent #MeToo consciousness raising or the happenstance of a particularly strong year for recordings by women musicians. It is not possible to say whether or not last year's poll represents a significant difference in the status of women or is an outlier until the 2020 poll data is available.

REEVES: Indeed. And if you drive around Caracas, you still see groups of Chavistas - that's his supporters and the supporters of the Socialist Party - in their red baseball hats and T-shirts.

Now, that meeting has been seized upon by Maduro, who appeared on TV yesterday at a rather eccentric performance in which he sang at one point. And he portrayed yesterday's U.N.

While Claire worked, she recalled reading in the Times some months before about a new medicine made from a fluid given off by green mold . . . sitting in the garden, the pale leaves feathery on the trees, her son building a model-train village across the flagstones at her feet. Yes, she'd read the article in the spring, May or June. The experimental drug was called penicillin. The drug had been discovered in the late 1920s by Dr. Alexander Fleming, a researcher in London. Although Fleming published his discovery and experimented with the mold, he'd had no success developing the fluid into a viable medication. The mold was temperamental, virtually impossible to work with. Few researchers saw any reason to pursue Fleming's discovery. Penicillin was essentially forgotten until the past few years. With the war raging in Europe, physicians and military leaders were desperate to find a cure for battlefield infections. The development of sulfa drugs in the 1930s had shifted physicians' attitudes toward systemic medications, those that could be injected into the body without harming healthy tissues. Researchers at Oxford in England, and at Columbia University here in New York, began experimenting with penicillin. According to the newspaper, penicillin was thousands of times more powerful than sulfa drugs. Unlike sulfa drugs, which were made from chemical dyes and caused a range of side effects, thus far penicillin had proven to be nontoxic and without side effects.

INSKEEP: And can you describe President Maduro's approach to staying in power? Forty people killed sounds devastating, but we have not reached that moment of the military killing hundreds or thousands at Tiananmen Square kind of incident yet. We have not reached the moment of the opposition leader being in chains. What is Maduro doing?
TALAJIC: Yes, it does. What I could relate to is this civilian point of view during the war because somebody else is fighting, and regardless of your actions, bombs are falling around, snipers are shooting around, and you just survive. It's just very boring, very pointless, very hopeless aspect of war. One of the fragments in the Madaya Mom story that rang so many bells with me was her disappointment in the U.N. because they couldn't come to agreement what to do with the siege and everything. And she was - she was really enraged. Like, why doesn't anyone care? And that made me remember, like, during the war, as the war started, as it was about to break out, we were all thinking like, no, this is not going to happen. I mean, it's 20th century. And as the time goes by, people start dying, cities start being destroyed, and you realize that, you know, it really doesn't matter. Nobody cares.

Christopher Turpin is in the challenging position of overseeing this interlude period. A 17-year NPR veteran, he has been there before, as interim head of NPR's newsroom for a stint in 2014-15. When Oreskes, formerly of The Associated Press, was named to the top post, Turpin was named his deputy. He took the top spot again after Oreskes was pushed out. I have been impressed at how quickly he and his colleagues have moved to regroup, even as uncertainty looms.

Many observers thought Putin might take on a different role that would let him maintain influence – like Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei or Kazakhstan's first president, Nursultan Nazarbayev, who now chairs the country's security council and holds the title leader of the nation. There was talk of having Putin lead the country's State Council, which would be strengthened, with the presidency becoming more of a symbolic position.
Yet despite the simplicity and beauty of the Schrödinger equation, wave functions are pretty weird. Why would you need so much information — an infinity of numbers scattered across all of space — just to describe the position of a single object? Maybe this means that the electron is smeared out somehow. But as it turns out, that's not true. When you actually look for the electron, it shows up in only one spot. And when you do find the electron, something even stranger happens: The electron's wave function temporarily stops obeying the Schrödinger equation. Instead, it collapses, with all of its infinity of numbers turning to zero except in the place where you found the electron.
I want to ask about the president of the United States and what happens to him now. I know there's talk of urging the 25th Amendment. There is talk in the House of impeachment, which would take a while. And we had Jeh Johnson on this program, the former homeland security secretary, who said he thought the best option was for people around the president to urge him to leave town. What would you have the president do in the final 12 days of his term?
Jackson Elementary School in Salt Lake City will keep its name but change its namesake. Jackson Elementary will no longer be named for Andrew Jackson, the U.S. president who owned slaves and ordered the forced brutal removal of Native Americans from their lands. This week the Salt Lake City School Board voted unanimously to name the school in honor of Mary Jackson, the first black woman to be a NASA engineer. Her story was told in the book and the movie Hidden Figures. The Salt Lake Tribune says the crowd at the school board meeting burst into applause and a standing ovation.
In the heat of a presidential campaign, how do you keep this nomination front and center, alive and prominent in the face of Republicans saying that they won't give your nominee a hearing?

Contrast that with the Democrats. In the Dems' 11 states reporting results from last night, turnout totaled only around 5.9 million — that's around 2.6 million fewer people than came out in those states 2008, when Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were in the middle of what would would be a long, hard-fought race.

'Welcome To The New Georgia': Raphael Warnock On His Win In Senate Runoff
GATES: And, you know, what's even more amazing, it's - one, it was my mother's third great grandfather - my fourth great grandfather. His name was John Redman. And he fought in - for the Continental Army. He was a free negro, as we would have said then. And he mustered in in Winchester, Va., on Christmas Day, 1778, and was mustered down the Continental Army in April of 1784. It's the damnedest thing I ever heard. And what's the real showstopper for me is the fact that my three sets of my fourth great grandparents lived 18 miles from where I was born. I don't think that's true for very many people in this room or any - or many people who are watching this show. It's incredible that the mystery to my family tree - I'm looking toward Africa, and it was 18 miles away in Moorefield, W.Va., County Courthouse.

VON VACANO: So in politics, it's very difficult to predict. But I anticipate Sanders will continue to be successful, and that will change the mainstream. And I think in the case of the GOP that Trump has definitely already almost co-opted the party. So he has won that fight. So definitely, the Democrats have to respond in kind in some sense. And I think there'll be a lot of self-reflection within the ranks.
MCMULLIN: It's more akin to a movement, although I'm not exactly sure I would call it quite that at this point. It's more a coordinated effort between potential independent candidates and those who would support them to drive change in American politics.

Washington's in-person delivery was continued by his successor, John Adams. But in 1801, the third U.S. president, Thomas Jefferson, decided the in-person speech was not for him. Jefferson disliked the similarities between this address and the manner in which the king of England in those days addressed opening sessions of Parliament to deliver his marching orders. (Some say Jefferson also disliked his own public speaking voice.)

But the final days of Trump's presidency have been fraught because he continues to deny the outcome and refuses to concede.

GROSS: So was Linda Emond in the role that was originated by Lotte Lenya in Cabaret as Fraulein Schneider. And Lotte Lenya was such a great singer. And she was also, of course, the widow of Kurt Weill.

He's the songwriter we most associate with that period. He's a German songwriter who fled the Nazis.
GUNTON: Yes. I - in the case of the tiger, we had no involvement in that at all. We just observed that. That was all done by the authorities.

As for what he's doing, I mean, turn on the TV here, the state-run TV, which the government entirely controls and uses as a channel for propaganda, and you see these days Maduro in front of his Army troops, you know, attending parades and urging them to fight to the end and to be loyal and so on. So that is how he is proceeding in this crisis that he faces. It's got a lot worse now that the U.S. has cut his oil money. So he has to deal with how he's going to, you know, handle that, too.

It won awards all over the world and opened a few doors, but I think it took seven or eight years before mainstream filmmakers - producers, I should say, the heads of studios - before were, for some reason, able to recognize this as an artistic piece of work and a very good technical piece of directing because of what it was and because of the effect it had on you.

On Wednesday evening, Northam obliged, tweeting out a statement that said, I appreciate the original invitation of VUU's administration, but I will abide by the students' wishes. He said he accepted the student government's invitation for future dialogue and honest conversation on issues of race, reconciliation and equity.
So, I mean, this because the context of litigation puts some pressure on the litigants to withhold data, it means that the public good is finally not being served. I mean, what we believe is that scientific research should be freely shared.
Ten years later, America has rebounded from the Great Recession and the housing crash. The stock market has recovered. Unemployment is lower than it was during the housing bubble.
In 2018, Wood explained how the years he spent performing in comedy clubs in the South and Midwest — sometimes in places where he felt unsafe as a black man — prepared him for The Daily Show.
Philip Roth wrote millions of words, 29 novels and scores of short stories and essays. My God, exclaims his signature character Alexander Portnoy in the 1969 novel Portnoy's Complaint. (Reading) The English language is a form of communication. Conversation isn't just crossfire where you shoot and get shot at, where you've got to duck for your life and aim to kill. Words aren't only bombs and bullets. No, they're little gifts containing meanings.
No matter who takes power in the United States, its true nature and its policy toward our country will never change, he added.
We hesitate to use the word 'crisis,' because we don't think that this is a threat to the country, said Joanna Williams of the Kino Border Initiative, a humanitarian group that operates a migrant shelter in Nogales, Mexico.

You see, he was a doctor. He was a good doctor. We really, all of us feel really sad for his death. But he was a devoted doctor. He was a good professional. And he saw some coming danger from the specific cases he dealt with. As a doctor, he was alerted, but not everybody quite understood and appreciated him at the very beginning because this is a new virus. Nobody knew anything about it.
William Ketchum III is a journalist based in New York City. He tweeted that about a conversation that is had ubiquitously between parents and children in the black community about how to interact with police. His father had a similar conversation with him about visiting businesses.
The White House carefully staged a series of events this week to try to show that it had taken charge of the coronavirus response: meetings with Congress and industry leaders, a tour of a vaccine lab at the National Institutes of Health, and Vice President Mike Pence's trip to Washington State to meet local leaders grappling with the outbreak.
Mr. WEINBERG: Then we have to go to the theoretical drawing boards. I mean, there are theories that manage to explain masses and explain why the different interactions don't have the same properties, so-called broken symmetries.

To help end the exodus, Springfield is banking on a revival of downtown. And on a recent warm weekday evening, a farmers market was in full swing as a good-sized crowd shopped for artisanal cheeses, locally grown produce and baked goods. The mood was friendly and relaxed. Exactly the kind of scene tourism and development officials dream about.

KANDER: This was very early in our collaboration. And Fred had an idea for writing a comic song about a coloring book. And my memory of it was that I think when he suggested it, for some reason I had some sort of mild annoyance. And I think I said to him, why does everything have to be funny? And we started talking about how you could take a song about a coloring book and make it real, poignant, somehow or other truthfully emotional. And so we went in that direction. I have to preface this by saying Freddy I wrote a lot. We were pregnant all the time. So the idea of writing a song...

Thompson, the former bureau director, worries that trying to convince people to work for the census could be a particularly sensitive issue, especially among retirees over the age of 60. Given the low employment rate, they've been among the groups targeted by the bureau's recruiting efforts. But now they are at higher risk than younger age groups of becoming seriously ill with COVID-19.

You know, I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran. That's what I intend to do. I know what our Ukraine policy has been now for the three years of this administration. I'm proud of the work we've done. This administration delivered the capability for the Ukrainians to defend themselves. President Obama showed up with MREs (meals ready to eat.) We showed up with Javelin missiles. The previous administration did nothing to take down corruption in Ukraine. We're working hard on that. We're going to continue to do it.

NPR's Leila Fadel reports that organizers are trying to avoid potential pitfalls from last year, when hundreds of thousands of people descended on Washington, D.C., in one of the largest demonstrations in U.S. history.
That energy can now shift to examining what the administration is doing and putting forth other ideas and other proposals, some of which might generate bipartisan agreement, she said.
The overall racial and ethnic diversity of the news and information division remained virtually unchanged as of Oct. 31, 2017, when compared with the year earlier. Figures supplied by NPR's human resources department showed the division of 377 people to be 75.10 percent non-Hispanic white (as self-identified). That compared to 75.4 percent the year earlier, when there were 350 newsroom employees. I'll repeat what I said of the 2016 numbers, which showed only incremental change over the last five years: this was a disappointing showing.

RUWITCH: Desperate because China offers a huge market. And while other economies are struggling because of the pandemic, China's is humming. The China-EU agreement isn't ratified, and yesterday's arrests may put it at risk. A trade agreement with Pacific nations inked a few weeks ago may also be in play, but Chinese leader Xi Jinping seems to think otherwise and not without reason, says Wasserstrom.

That decision is a relatively small segment of the diagnostic testing world. We had been working with all of those folks over this period of time and continue to do that. And again, as I said, when we had feedback from the stakeholders that they would like that flexibility, that that would help them, we did that.

Steve Harris believes that pressure also ruined his well. He lives on 14 acres south of Dallas. Shortly after a driller fracked a nearby well, he and his neighbors noticed a change in water pressure.
If interest rates rise, the situation Trump described, the market value of long-term debt falls. For example, a 30-year bond issued in 2015 at an interest rate of less than 3.0 percent, might sell for less than 70 percent of its nominal value if the long-term interest rate crosses 6 or 7 percent, which it certainly could. The Treasury could buy up long-term debt in the market at its current market value, and replace it with new debt that paid a higher interest rate. This won't change the interest payments owed by the government, but it would reduce the nominal value of the debt outstanding.

There is literally a playbook for the use of these tools – one that the states and local public health have exercised, she said.
Water stagnating at a construction site. A dwindling number of mangroves along the shore. Lakes choked with algae and hyacinth. Sewage pipes leaking into the sea.
It could also go the other way, with lower-cost hospitals demanding a raise, driving up spending.
Better reinforcement of the well might have prevented the spill. But Union Oil had received a waiver from the government that allowed the company to drill without installing steel casing pipe to the depth usually required by federal regulations.
And ours was Fort Indiantown Gap, Pa. And in order to leave one of these camps, you had to have sponsors take you. No sponsor would take my family of four. So my brother went to one family, my parents went to one family and at 4 years old, I was sent to live with a white family. And that's when my memory begins and - of being separated from my parents. And even though that was only for a few months, it was really traumatic for me.

Unidentified Woman: You guys briefly mentioned the importance of public understanding of the value of scientific discovery, the idea that a non-finding can be equally as important, if not more important, than a tangible discovery. This is something that's clearly important to you, gentlemen, because you're participating on a public forum. How do you feel that academics in general are addressing this issue in terms of funding and also in terms of just increasing public understanding of science?

Can you shed some light on that?

The agreement must still be approved by a Federal Court, the CBC explains. It adds that compensation claims will be paid at six different levels, based on the severity of the acts and the impact on the woman's welfare and career. The process will be confidential, but does not compel women to refrain from speaking about their experiences publicly.
ESPUELAS: Yeah. I mean, I think this is the fallacy of polling, which is that if you ask any human being what is the most important thing that they're thinking about, obviously they're going to think about their first needs - jobs, housing, health. And so that's what comes across in polling. But very quickly thereafter, you're going to hit those issues which are emotional markers. And for, I think, Latinos in general, but immigrants in particular - or the other way around - basically, immigration is a proxy for how we are being seen in this society.
Her data, pooled with that of participants around the world, will give scientists a better idea of how weather and climate change may influence bird populations or migration patterns.

And then I said - and in the bill, we have a provision that gives people a right to sue their rapist or their batterer - I boiled it down - and that is the closest we can get to holding them accountable.
In his conversation with NPR, Anton was a bit more gentle in his description of the world situation. His new boss, he says, views Britain's exit from the European Union as both a hopeful sign and as a reassertion of nationalist sentiment.

The other way is to start combining organic with inorganic parts and creating cyborgs. For four billion years all of evolution — not just of humans but of all beings — was confined to the organic realm, but very soon we might be able to break out of the organic realm using things like brain-computer interfaces, which combine organic parts like an organic brain with inorganic parts like bionic hands or eyes or ears.
MARTIN: Well, there is a dispute about that, Fernando, which I'm sure you know is the case. I mean, there is a matter of dispute about that, I mean, about the effect on wage rates and so forth. The other thing - but just setting that aside for now, just setting that sort of argument aside for now and just focusing on the political argument, it is said that one of the reasons that there is not more progress on this is that this is really not the top priority of Latino voters. People say that other issues come first.

It's true the Supreme Court has now frozen Guaido's bank accounts and that he's been banned from leaving the country. But this is a man who Maduro says is attempting a coup with the collaboration of the United States. So you can see that those measures, when you consider that, are carefully calibrated by Maduro.
Student Petition Supports Teacher Who Resigned Over Racy Photos Taken From Phone
David Zonderman, an expert in labor history at North Carolina State University, said safety concerns like factory fires and mine collapses have often galvanized collective action in the past, as workers felt their lives were endangered. But labor laws can make it difficult to organize, he said, and many efforts to unionize are unsuccessful.
Dissatisfaction with that election and its aftermath fueled debate over the presidential election process. Finally, nearly a dozen years later, Congress enacted the Electoral Count Act of 1887.

You know, we never talk about private conversations that are taking place, but the diplomatic effort on this front has been vigorous, robust and enormously successful. We built out a significant coalition that has put pressure on the Iranian regime to do what we've asked: to cease its processing of uranium, reprocessing of plutonium, to stop its missile program and the development of its missile program. President Trump made clear they're not going to have a nuclear program that is capable of delivering these weapons around the world. And then finally, working to convince them that their model, this proxy model that they've used to conduct terror campaigns, assassinations in Europe, assassination attempt right here in Washington, D.C., is not tolerable.
NGUYEN: Right exactly. Well, you know, I certainly knew that the confession or the autobiographical self-criticism was a really important part of Chinese and Vietnamese Communist efforts to reeducate - that's a euphemism - reeducate the people that they had defeated. And I hadn't actually read any of those but I'd heard about them repeatedly. And I had read autobiographical accounts of people who had survived these kinds of reeducation camps or reeducation experiences. So I had a pretty good idea of what these kinds of autobiographies would look like. And to me it seemed like this was a great literary form, to try to adapt and to integrate with the spy story that is a part of the novel because the confession certainly has other roots - Christians have been writing confessions since Saint Augustine, at the very least - and it meshed very well with the idea of a political confession, too. And my narrator struggles with both what it means to be a communist and what it means to be a Catholic.
KHALID ALI: The government is broke, essentially. There is no money - right? - because we are not exporting anything. We are not producing anything.
He says he'd love to get his hands on avocado varieties that grow well in the Central Valley. If they could come up with a variety that's similar to the Hass that we could plant down at ground level instead of having it on the hills, I'm sure a lot of people would plant them, Stearns says.

Portnoy, Zuckerman, Neil Klugman in Goodbye, Columbus - Philip Roth's best-known characters were Jews, beginning at a time in the 1950s when the Holocaust and American anti-Semitism had animated Jewish identity. But he didn't want his work to be consigned to any category. I have never conceived of myself for the length of a single sentence as an American-Jewish or Jewish-American writer, he wrote in The New Yorker.
CHAZELLE: ...That's what the characters learn a bit, that it's - you have to preserve what you believe in. You can't compromise too much. But sometimes it's not compromise. Sometimes it's actually, you know, finding a way to push something forward, whether it's a musical or a - or an idea of Jazz you might have.

She would, by the dint of determination, be sober for months at a time and then be unable to continue. And all of the problems that had been building up and she had been stuffing under the rug of her emotions would burst forth, and she would start drinking in the day. And she would not stop until somebody found the bottle and took it away and pretty much held her captive in the house until she sobered up and we were able to plead with her to stop. And then she would try again.

Mr. ALLEN: Oh, absolutely. Look. I mean, this crisis today has broken in - it broke first, really, in Canada in the late '90s, then Australia, the States, Ireland, to some extent the U.K., now Germany and some other places in Europe. And now that's a lengthening list of countries, obviously. But, I mean, let's bear in mind that two-thirds of the 1.2 billion Roman Catholics in the world today live in the Southern Hemisphere - that is Latin American, African, Asia.

There are elements in the police and intelligence services who've tortured and kill. And they know that the amnesty that's being offered at the moment by the opposition may not apply to them. And there are numerous criminal gangs, Steve, dealing in drugs and gold who flourish out in the countryside where the government grip is very weak. And add all that together, and you have an alarming picture.
At the time, in 1993, the Princeton professor was taking a break from academia to direct scientific research at the U.S. Department of Energy. He turned a skeptical eye toward one of then-Vice President Al Gore's favorite issues: the risks posed by chemicals eating away at ozone in the stratosphere and letting in dangerous ultraviolet radiation. As the story goes, Happer went to the White House and told Gore's staff he saw no evidence that the ozone hole actually was hurting anyone.

And it turned into a massive upheaval in just the way school was experienced by children and families in Newark. And it was done, again, without a process of vetting with the community to see, well, how if, you know - will this new system work for these children and families? When a school is closed, children had to walk through very dangerous territory, you know, sometimes through gang territory, through drug dealing neighborhoods. And none of that was kind of vetted in advance to see what can we do for these kids to make sure they're safe?

Denman was steam rolled, said Melinda Haring of the Atlantic Council, a Washington, DC, think tank, who believes the language the Trump campaign approved is weaker. And she says it's anyone's guess what Trump would do regarding Ukraine and Russia, and that perhaps he might not even back appropriate assistance.
GUNTON: (Laughter) Yes. One of the essential elements of the series is that you feel close to the animals. You want to - we want the audience to feel in their world and kind of experiencing the world and the challenges that those animals are facing. And so how you do that photographically is part of the way we get that to work. We're not actually as close as often as it might appear because there are certain things that operate when you're doing this. If you get - you always have to consider any impact you might have on the behavior. And if you get too close, there comes a point where you do start to influence their behavior. You distract them or they become aware of your presence.
Every vote will count, of course. But the investments that the campaigns make in certain areas could be especially important.
CORNISH: What do you think Donald Trump has to say to offer that olive branch? I mean, what would you like to hear?

You know, this is a big problem, and nobody really knows what to do. But at the moment, we certainly haven't seen or heard about any actual action taking place to get people off the ship earlier or to change that kind of a setting. I mean, the news today from the State Department was that the CDC says, this is best place for you all (inaudible). And so here we are.

As the Rodriguezes' mortgage payments ballooned, the economy collapsed. Her husband lost his job in 2008. They began to struggle to hold together their marriage. In the end, they divorced, leaving Adriana Rodriguez to pay for the house on her own. She sold her car to help with home payments, but she was only delaying the inevitable. In 2010, she defaulted on the payments, and she and her daughters moved out within a year. They've rented ever since.
On Friday. the Senate voted not to call witnesses in the trial. The vote was 51 to 49 against witnesses. Democrats had pleaded for two weeks to hear testimony from, among others, former national security adviser John Bolton. But most Republicans resisted. Just two Republicans — Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine — voted with the Democratic caucus.
So one of the things I think government can do very well is to help create the right kinds of mindset, frame of mind, by providing ladders of opportunity so that people can really see what's going on around them. A lot of times if you go to a disadvantaged neighborhood, you ask the kids, What do you want to do when you grow up? You get about five different answers. But there's a thousand. We need to show people the other 995 and how you get there. And those are the kinds of things that create that can-do attitude that is so important, and that for such a long time was a part of the American mindset. And there are those now who want people to think that somebody else is in control of you and that you're a victim. We want to find ways to make sure that people understand that the person who has the most to do with what happens to you, is you.

PERALTA: Mannzoor and her family stayed. Despite the sting of rejection, she says, she's always felt Kenyan. And that reaction in the '80s always seemed out of place in a country as diverse as Kenya, which today is home to 43 tribes. This month, the Asian community led by Mannzoor officially asked the president to recognize Asians as the 44th tribe. In essence, he would be declaring Asians an intregal part of Kenyan society. For Aleya Kassam, an Asian writer who has been tackling issues of identity, that recognition would be a mind shift not just for black Kenyans but for Asian Kenyans, whom she says for reasons of survival and even because of some racism have always kept their eyes elsewhere, never really accepting that Kenya is their home.

Secondly, Maduro's climbed down from his decision to expel U.S. diplomats after severing diplomatic ties with D.C. He had given them until this weekend to go. He's now suspended that order for 30 days for both sides to work out what the future relationship is going to be. And three, he's talking about negotiations, although the opposition don't appear to be at all interested in that because they don't recognize him. And they want him to leave.

SMITH: It's not just that Abdulaziz doesn't pay taxes. He gets all kinds of perks from the government. Electricity is so heavily subsidized it's basically free. People leave their air conditioners on when they go on vacation. Healthcare is free. Gas costs around 50 cents a gallon. And all of this is paid for with oil money. The Saudi government gets so much oil revenue that it spreads the wealth around in the form of subsidies and also jobs. Eighty percent of Saudis who work work for the government. Abdulaziz told me over Skype almost everyone he knows has a government job.

So it was as if someone who went to a bar assumed the risk of rape.

You know, not just in their estate planning documents, what we, you know, typically think of as, you know, a will or revocable trust, clients are also increasingly more concerned about their powers of attorneys, their health care surrogates, their living wills, the documents that would - you know, what we call life documents because they're effective while you're alive.
Both women looked at Dr. Stanton. He was using a ruler to plot out information on a graph. His intent concentration made him look like the smartest student in any class he'd ever attended. The resident genius. Claire understood Patsy's reluctance to approach him. When Claire's mother, Anna, was dying of cancer through increasingly tortured months, her doctors refused to share any information. The physician in charge didn't even want Anna to know that she had cancer. Anna demanded the truth, in a conversation that quickly turned hostile. The physicians' creed seemed to be that the fewer facts patients and their families knew about an illness, the better for everyone, especially the doctors. Physicians justified their approach by claiming that patients and their families lost hope when they knew the truth.

But the GCF has a lot more flexibility in how it can spend its money, notes Jessica Brown of the Climate Policy Initiative, a research center that advises policymakers on green strategies. The World Bank, for example, mainly gives out loans, which, by definition, must be paid back by recipient countries. The bank can only give outright grants to a small subset of extremely poor nations. And it can't generally be a direct co-investor in a for-profit enterprise. The GCF faces no such constraints.

So I think a couple of things are really important for the American public to understand about this. One is the FDA started working with CDC on January 9. That's a fact. The CDC obtained the viral sequence. Then they subsequently obtained patient samples, all of which are important and necessary for developing a diagnostic test. And CDC developed that test in a very short period of time. So, you know, we had been working since January, January 22nd, to be precise, with developers of tests and have done so throughout this period of time. And, you know, this is a rapidly evolving situation. We have responded to stakeholders when we got feedback about the necessity to provide more regulatory flexibility. The end of February guidance we provided, we did that, that was directly in response to requests from developers so that it could ease the pathway for the development of diagnostic tests.

I do think that the edifice constructive by long - for a very long time in the GOP by intellectuals who are conservative is falling down, breaking down because of the use of certain tropes by President Trump. So for instance, the idea of race, gender and the us-versus-them dialectic and then the idea of the strongman are at least four elements - are really quite visible in the case of Trump.
You see, despite what many of us learned in elementary school, there is no single scientific method. Just as scientific theories become elaborated and change, so do scientific methods. The randomized controlled trial — which we now take for granted as a method for evaluating the causal efficacy of a drug — was a methodological innovation. Statistical significance testing — which is often taken for granted as a method for evaluating the probability that an outcome was due to chance alone — was a methodological innovation.
CHANG: All right, so Congress plans to return to business tonight, this business of counting Electoral College votes. Usually this is just a formality, but tonight, obviously, is so radically different. Can you just tell us what is being done to strengthen security on Capitol Hill, and how is returning even possible given all that has happened today?
What are the specifics of that framework?

Rounding the bend in the dirt path that leads to Prospect Park's bird feeders, Cyrus Baty, a volunteer at the Brooklyn Bird Club, heard a peculiar sound for February: two sharp clicks ending in a throaty trill.
It may seem counterintuitive, but health officials say that even after you get vaccinated against COVID-19, you still need to practice the usual pandemic precautions, at least for a while. That means steering clear of crowds, continuing to wear a good mask in public, maintaining 6 feet or more of distance from people outside your household and frequently washing your hands. We talked to infectious disease specialists to get a better understanding of why.
He's bright, he's experienced, he's confident. He certainly understands these issues backwards and forwards, says former U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, who negotiated NAFTA under the Clinton administration and says he disagrees with many of Lighthizer's views.
GROSZ: This is a bold stand for her. Like, if she can't even pick - like, just pick one of the teams - like, because you can say let's run the numbers and see who likes the Yankees more than the Mets. Like, you could run the numbers and, like, 95 percent of America would be, like, no, we're not cool with UFOs. She's actually picking something that nobody likes, which is very rare for her.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: So, real quick, the 14th Amendment was ratified in 1868, and it granted citizenship to all people born or naturalized in the U.S., including formerly enslaved people. This is the amendment that guarantees each of these citizens equal protection of the laws. Now she had an idea. She went back to chief counsel, Ron Klain.
When looking for the best cell phone plans, coverage and price are the most important factors and with cell phone plans coming up every weekend is really hard to choose the best plan that will fit your needs and budget.
With its already-huge pool of talent, Noyer says, Paris is also able to attract the kind of young, talented workers that smaller or regional cities just can't.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions and other immigration hard-liners say that backlog allows people who should be deported quickly to stay in the United States for years while they wait for a court date.
The tweets also telegraph a message, he says, not just to the specific companies Trump has targeted, but also to firms in other industries which might be thinking about expanding elsewhere besides Mexico.
BURKE: Yeah because you intercepted it.
Conducting a climate survey. This project is being led by a cross-functional employee team who will work with a vendor to conduct an evaluation of the corporate culture, provide recommendations to strengthen the work environment, and provide skill building for all employees.
It's a possibility, said Tia. We'll design the protocols to test the hypothesis in mice. She noted it on her clipboard.
GROSS: That's Vic Chesnutt from his first album recorded in 1988. You described it as an atheist manifesto. And, you know, this song proclaims: I'm not a victim. I am intelligent. I am an atheist. Why did you feel that you needed to declare in a song that you are an atheist?
The very limited number of employees with whom the individual was in contact have been notified by public health authorities and are in self-quarantine, Cook says in a written statement to NPR. We will continue to provide support to any and all impacted employees and follow all public health authority guidance.

I can't get a shake out of my voice ... I [had a] nightmare last night where the shooter had a gun to my head, he tells North Country Public Radio's Brian Mann. I just stared at my wall all night.
The Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem has reached its carrying capacity for bears. It's exporting bears, says Dan Ashe, director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service under President Barack Obama. The question this point around, about whether they should be delisted, is more of a values-based question.
So she wrote a children's book called Ambitious Girl, in the hope that no young woman in the next generation would have her dreams characterized as a liability.
Salma Ali says she had low self-esteem when she was younger. It's something she thinks a lot of darker-skinned young women experience.

The only thing required by the Constitution (Article II, Section 3) is that the president shall from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.
The TV company that bears his name continues to produce programs, including the animated Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood. You can still get boxed DVD sets of some of the Mister Rogers shows and specials, which ran on PBS until 2001, two years before his death.
Not everyone in Congress even feels compelled to attend. And even the vice president has been away: In 1969, Vice President Hubert Humphrey decided to attend the funeral of the first United Nations secretary-general instead. That meant the Senate president pro tempore, at the time Georgia Democrat Richard Russell, had the job of announcing that Humphrey, who had been his party's nominee for president, had lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon.

SAGAL: ...Which is just like the famous magic bus of the 1960s except for everything.
BUSH: That that work was dangerous - and for those that were not a part of it, they need to condemn it. You need to hold your people accountable, hold your party accountable, hold your colleagues accountable because you put the lives of people in danger today over Donald Trump that, at the end of the day, wouldn't stand up for you; at the end of the day, will throw you under the bus, you know? And so we want to make sure that regardless of where you stand, Democrat or Republican, that you cannot come and storm the United States Capitol. You cannot break windows and break down doors. There is a way to make sure that your voice is heard, and this is not it. This is not it.
Seventeen NCAA colleges are ready to start women's wrestling teams if the NCAA will sanction them — including the University of Iowa, which has won 23 men's NCAA championships and produced World and Olympic medalists.

Back across the border in Tucson, Ariz., a shelter for migrant families and children called Casa Alitas has had to grow quickly to keep pace with the growing number of migrants.
MCCLURG: The facility is in the midst of its second internal outbreak. Health care workers themselves are getting sick. Doctors like Dawn Harris at Sierra Nevada Hospital sincerely want these holiday surges to be the last. The vaccine offers a glimmer of light.
Allowing a lower-court ruling to stand, however, is not a foolproof strategy. That raises the possibility of having someone [else] intervene, said Keith. For example, Democratic attorneys general stepped in to defend the ACA in a case now pending at the Supreme Court when the Trump administration chose not to. So, you have to be pretty strategic about not appealing, she said.
INSKEEP: Hawley raised some. Supporters of the defeated president did call for an audit of election results, to which Republican Mitt Romney of Utah said, no.
While there were some interpreters before the 2016 requirement was put in place, they were not mandated by MLB and were hired at the discretion of the teams.

STAM: To put that in context, that would take years for that process to unwind. And after the process is finished, the state or any other academic institution would have 30 days to comply. So the idea that this is some imminent threat is an empty one.
I mean, part of the problem here, Neal, is that on the one hand, it may well be the case that accountability is going to require more bishops to resign. On the other hand, there is a cultural and historical problem here, which is the Vatican never likes to see bishops step down under fire, because in their mind, thinking historically, this is an invitation for people to mount pressure campaigns to try to bring down bishops for various reasons. That makes them very uncomfortable, and this is what communist regimes try to do, and so on. And the Vatican, thinking globally and thinking historically, can't help flashing on those kinds of memories.
And other writers, some well-known but not on Woodward's level, were not able to do much more in altering perceptions. Journalists such as Jonathan Karl of ABC News (Front Row at the Trump Show) and Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig of The Washington Post (A Very Stable Genius) were able to take readers inside the operations of the White House and Trump team and marshal reams of evidence concerning Trump's mercurial personality and haphazard governing style.

And one of the ways that this changes the culture is when female Marines become 1 in 5 of every Marine you have, at least it's no longer female Marine, male Marine. It's Marines at that point, which is how we should be looking at things anyway. But you no longer see them as the - oh, there's the token Marine for the squadron. Oh, there's the token female Marine for the section, you know? It's just Marines. It's normal. It stops being an oddity. We stop being other.

And my biggest fear — and I always end up writing my worst fears, really — my biggest fear was what would happen if I lost her now?

Can Trump Turn Pennsylvania's Disaffected Democrats Into Believers By November?
Mr. ALLEN: Neal, I think there are some bishops and some other church leaders who sort of on their own have taken it upon themselves to try to, in effect, to diffuse the bomb before it goes off - that is, who are well aware that this crisis could erupt in their zone of competence and who have tried to look into among their own, to establish what the record is, and to be transparent about it. And I certainly think anyone who has watched this crisis play out in other places ought to draw that conclusion, that it's far better for the church to get this out all at once and on its own terms rather than to suffer death by a thousand cuts.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: No. (Laughter). I think that a part of where I am right now is that I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment. And, frankly, that is something that I think the president did do, in that he was able to take his profile and say, here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous, but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him, that's his wall. And obviously, I'm diametrically opposed to it. But I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing, despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America, except an America with a huge wall on the Southern border.
My mom opposed the system as a whole, so she never let that stand in her way, and I think I have a lot of my mom's demeanor. Even when she told me the story she was never angry, she just went, It's a stupid thing, and so I refused to listen to it.

And to see them desecrated like this and to see people killed - it was just - I can't imagine being there. It took me back to, you know, the baseball shooting where I was on the field. Or 10 years ago, Gabby Giffords was shot - and just kind of reliving some of these things. But I can't imagine what it would have been like to see your own citizens, some of your own constituents, doing this.
The industrial space was filled with strobe lights, twinkle lights, light-up plants (OK, just a lot of lights), Instagram-worthy faux-grass pillars with the word TOM in glowing red and blue, food, drinks, a DJ and a performance by TLC, whose hits Waterfalls and No Scrubs kept the 500-person crowd dancing and singing.

Even as union membership in most industries has declined in recent years, health workers unions have remained relatively stable: Around 7% of health care and social services workers are in unions Experts say it's partly because of the focus on patient care issues, like safe staffing ratios, which resonate widely and have only grown during the pandemic.
The IRS is expected to make roughly 60 million direct deposit payments in mid-April, but paper checks will take significantly longer, according to a copy of the memo obtained by NPR. The IRS is expected to begin issuing paper checks about three weeks after the direct deposits are completed and can issue about 5 million checks per week. The timeline is subject to change, the memo states, but the estimates are based on extensive conversations between staff on the House Ways and Means Committee, at the Treasury Department and at the IRS.
There has been, for years, a very difficult relationship within the regulatory agencies like NOAA, that have regulatory functions, like EPA that have regulatory functions, of what happens to research. They've got an inherent conflict of interest. They're both regulators, and they have to perform the research in an unbiased way that's going to support their regulation. That's a real challenge. And I think we're going to have to take a look at all of these kinds of agencies in a more close fashion than we have in the past.

Additionally, Democrats are changing the rules regarding motions to vacate the chair, a procedural tool that could be used to force out a sitting House speaker. It is the procedural weapon that conservatives led by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., were planning to use to try to oust Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in 2015 before he made the decision to step down.

But then, for a factory worker whose plant has moved to Mexico, it could be tough to make the case that trade isn't a destructive force. This is the hard truth of the trade-offs of trade: trade does bring widespread economic benefits (a wider variety of goods, lower prices) but it can also be harmful to particular people.
Hand-washing with soap and water continues to be a top recommendation to protect against the virus, since the abrasiveness of soap helps remove infectious particles from the hands. Experts say that commonly worn surgical masks aren't very effective protection. A heavy-duty mask called an N95 respirator is considerably better protection, but it is uncomfortable to wear and can make breathing more difficult.

And so I — we've seen already the surveys that say, number one, people are paying attention to this; and number two — it's not just Democrats, but a sizable number of Republicans who vote against me, have said this is — this can't be the way we run our government.

VON VACANO: Personalism is where an individual leader uses their connections and their - sometimes even their friends and their families in order to become more popular, to gain support. In President Trump's case, it's been quite evident in the last few years - right? - that this use of the family, his connections, even the use of Twitter itself - so that his followers will see him almost as their - he's talking to them directly, skipping the institutional apparatus.

Early in the pandemic, staffers struggled to find masks and other protective equipment, said nurses interviewed for this story. The hospital discouraged them from wearing masks one day and required masks 10 days later. The staff wasn't consistently tested for COVID-19 and often not even notified when exposed to COVID-positive patients. According to the nurses and a review of safety complaints made to federal regulators, the concerns persisted for months. And some nurses said the situation fueled doubts about whether hospital executives were prioritizing staff and patients, or the bottom line.

Democrats' criticism of the White House's failure to brief Congress ahead of the operation touches on a years-long debate that the president's war powers are woefully outdated. Democrats are leading calls for a new legislation addressing the president's Authorization for Use of Military Force, or AUMF.
MARILYN MARKS: The reason this is so concerning is because while it appears that the malicious attacker got in in 2014, they could have clearly stayed in quite a long time. This server was not shut down until the end of 2017. But the records that were on that server - and these would be millions of records. This would have been the hub for all of Georgia's elections. Those millions of records could have been, certainly, infiltrated. And then as copies of those records were removed from the server to put on new applications, they could have carried with them malicious code. There is still quite a lot we don't know. But there is no reason to believe that anything that an attacker did in 2014 and beyond is not still present in the system.
In November, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch issued reports about mistreatment of the female activists in prison. Coogle says the rights groups' allegations were firmed up by Hathloul's sister Alia, who wrote a Jan. 13 op-ed for the New York Times in which she revealed that Loujain had told her parents that she had suffered brutal torture, including beatings, waterboarding, whippings, as well as electric shocks.

GUNTON: Well, that's the key thing. When I was thinking about how this might work and sort of selling the idea to my bosses, who were actually going to have to pay for it, you know, one of the things I was saying to them is that these will end up feeling quite like drama but they cannot be plotted because these are true observational documentaries. We have the confidences that if we know enough about these animals and enough about the situation that we're pretty certain something is - dramatic is going to happen. And we will just follow that action as it happens. There were certainly times when things weren't happening or things were happening we weren't predicting. And we weren't being able to kind of work out what was going to happen.
JOBRANI: But the priest isn't the driver.

Claire couldn't help herself: there was Emily, lying on her bed at home, too weak to fight on, lost to infection, strands of her curly, light brown hair sticking to her cheeks. The well-meaning doctor who visited each day couldn't help her. Claire held Emily's hand long past the moment when Emily's spirit or soul or spark—whatever constituted life—slipped away. In a wave of delayed recognition, Claire understood that Emily was no longer simply resting after her terrible, twisting struggle, but was lifeless. Without life. Dead. After a moment Emily's eyes opened, staring at the ceiling without seeing it. Her pale blue eyes seemed to turn white while Claire watched. Screams of torment consumed Claire in waves, even though someone else seemed to Claire to be screaming, a kind of ghost self within her. Charlie woke from his nap in the next room. Mama, he called.
DON GONYEA, BYLINE: And so a night at a Bernie Sanders rally begins. There are often celebrity activists on hand. In Manchester with a basketball hoop and a Bernie sign as a backdrop, it's actor John Cusack.
GROSS: My guest is songwriter, singer and guitarist Vic Chesnutt. His new album is called At The Cut. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
We're now joined by Diego von Vacano, a professor at Texas A&M University. Welcome.
GROSS: OK. So you found out that your ancestors were, like, 18 miles away from where you lived.
CORNISH: Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at The New Yorker and professor of journalism at Columbia University.
MWANGE: Because I still have hope that maybe this time around, things might change.
TRUMP: ...For president of the United States.
AYMAN SAFADI: We've always coordinated, and we trust that we will continue to coordinate. And our security is something that has always been taken into account by our allies in Washington. This is a solid partnership, particularly when it comes to defense and security against ISIS.
The Ford team was so relieved to have it resolved, to know that he would get his first and only chance to run a full campaign for president, that the idea of letting Reagan unite the party was appealing, and if he was more poetic than the more prosaic Gerald Ford, so be it, Compton says. The delegates sitting in their chairs on the floor loved it.
He grew up in a working-class town and he knows how people have suffered by losing jobs, and I suspect that that's part of why he went into that part of the legal profession, says Leo Gerard, president of the United Steelworkers.
I don't like you up my skirt
Arpaia say lunchbox and the nameless variety should be on the market within a year or two. That's good news for California avocado growers who want options.
RUSSAKOFF: I - I'm sure that he wishes that he hadn't made himself as available. But I don't think it would've really changed. In fact, I think that the book's helped. And he's helped by, you know, seeing the passion and the - the ability that he has to bring national attention to issues, often issues that other people aren't focusing on, like, you know, inner-city schools and currently, you know, the issue of mass incarceration. I think that what he has an incredible talent for is that - is framing issues and getting the nation to pay attention to them or at least getting a wide audience of people to pay attention to them and to pay attention to him in the process. But what he wasn't strong on was in the patient, tedious, kind of unglamorous work of taking those promises and hammering them out into a different reality. He tended to have - you know, to be ready to go on to the next thing.
RANDY GENTRY: Well, thank you for having me.
There's not an incentive to travel in smaller groups or to try to hide from immigration officials, said the Kino Border Initiative's Williams. So these migrants are crossing in larger groups because in many ways, it's safer, she said.
SAGAL: Answer 2 out of 3 questions correctly, you'll win our prize for one of our listeners - the voice of their choice on their voicemail. Bill, who is Doug Jones playing for?
The coalition is also taking lessons from past attempts at climate actions including the comprehensive climate package, known as Waxman-Markey, that attempted to create a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions. The bill, colloquially named for then-Rep. Henry Waxman of California and Sen. Ed Markey, then a representative, passed the House in 2009 and died in the Senate. Leaders of the effort say that one of the reasons that effort collapsed was that it was too much of an insider play and did not engage organizers and workers in the field, mistakes that organizers say they won't repeat.
On a native rangeland or grassland, nitrogen is the nutrient that is the most limiting, Voleski says. There just seems to be enough to get by with each year.
DOUG JONES: No, actually, I started as a mime back at Ball State University in Indiana. And being 6-foot-3 and 140 pounds and having a mime background, it's like, oh, the creature-effects people were just all over me the minute I got to LA.
DAVIES: You know, there are some cases where animals - I think in the lion episode, where one of the young ones is ill and can't travel. And at some point, I mean, the pride will come back to check, but in the end, they can't do much. And the animal has left. And it's interesting that the painted wolves, who travel in packs, seemed just fiercely committed to taking care of each other. Even, like, when one of them was - had a lame leg, they just wouldn't let go.
DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So this version has actually 17 mutations. And mutations in viruses crop up all the time when the virus grows inside a person, specifically when it reproduces and makes a bunch of copies of itself. I talked to Bettie Steinberg. She's a virologist at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research on Long Island. She says that to grow inside a person, the virus has to make copies of its genes.
Nooria used to be a teacher, but after the pandemic began, she says her employers couldn't pay her, so she quit. I didn't even have biscuits and tea to feed my daughter, she says. Her husband's work as a rickshaw driver dried up, and it hasn't really picked up since the lockdown ended.

The Census Bureau is charged with counting every person living in the U.S. every 10 years. But some populations have been more difficult to tally up accurately than others.
The Trump campaign believes the road to the White House runs through places like Scranton. It's banking on reshaping the electoral map and carrying traditionally Democratic industrial states like Pennsylvania by riding a wave of working-class votes.
JOHNSON: You know, one of the things that I've heard the Biden transition and the decision-makers among the president-elect and the vice president-elect that really swayed them was this parallel. After Watergate and the abuses of President Nixon, the Justice Department brought in a very well-respected University of Chicago president, Ed Levi, to run the place. They think Merrick Garland can be that kind of transformative figure to make sure that criminal cases are brought for the right reasons and to put the law above politics. That's the goal for Merrick Garland if he gets confirmed by the Senate this year.
I mean, if you find nothing at the LHC, that would be really exciting to us, but imagine going back to the funding agency and saying you know what? Here's what we found: nothing.
Bob Blakely, of the trade organization California Citrus Mutual, says he hopes the disease does not make it to the Central Valley. I hope that we're able to come up with resistant citrus varieties before we have to think about going to another crop. I'm just hopeful that the science is able to move quickly enough.

The onion routing protocol - it's not as anonymous as you think it is. Whoever's in control of the exit nodes is also in control of the traffic, which makes me the one in control.
MCCLURG: Another doctor in Orange County recently urged folks to stay home over the holidays in an Instagram post. Dr. Victor Cisneros says it was met by an assault of profane pandemic denial. He likens that to denying a soldier's experience on the battlefield.
Process for considering and voting on an objection
Redemption starts with someone saying 'I'm sorry', says State Rep. Byron Rushing, and Yawkey never publically apologized for the sins of his ball club. So, Rushing says, no amount of charity after his death can absolve him.

And when you hear Judge Garland's background — when you hear that story about him as a valedictorian speaker standing up for a fellow student who was about to be censored by the parents, when you hear about the care with which he dealt with the victims and the families who had been affected by the Oklahoma City bombing — you get a sense of who that person is. And I spent a lot of time on that.
BLOUNT, JR.: I don't tweet, no.
Mr. ALLEN: Yeah, that's right. I mean, the saying around the Vatican is that they think in centuries. I mean, I have to sometimes joke that the working motto is talk to me on Wednesday, and I'll get back to you in 300 years.
WOOD JR: You just have an iPhone case. I figured you could just pop that open. No, I ain't popping [expletive]. You put it in the bag.
What's clear, both analysts say, is that the North is working quickly toward its ultimate goal: a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). And it's making pretty good progress.
Despite all that was at stake, they gave their opinions matter-offactly. Claire was impressed.
FLATOW: And of course, because we have two conflicting parties in a lawsuit here, potential lawsuit, being BP and the government, they both have a vested interest in what numbers you come up with.
The problem is that what Lighthizer is asking the Chinese to do is quite radical, to significantly reduce the role of the Chinese state and hence the Communist Party in directing Chinese economic development. And it's not at all clear that the Chinese leadership is prepared to do that, Alden says.
Mitchell also testified that one of the 9/11 defendants was subjected to excessive abuse because he'd been used as a teaching tool for CIA employees learning interrogation techniques. Mitchell said the man had been used as, in his words, a training prop.
QUINONES: My impression is that they are simply not going to be promoting it to doctors at all. They have been promoting it as a reasonable painkiller. And my impression is now that they will be ceasing that, which would be a big step for them - considering that I think it's one of the few drugs they actually have.

U.S. Manufacturers Brace For Trump's Next Trade Targets
There are certain things I can't express in my journalistic work that I can express in my studio work. My studio work is an exploration of color first and foremost. I approach it almost like a painter, focusing on the basics — which are the primary colors.
Min'yō folk music was originally sung by Japanese fishermen, coal miners and sumo wrestlers hundreds of years ago, and the Minyo Crusaders are on a mission to make these songs relevant to an international audience. For their performance, the Crusaders found a unique take for their desk: a kotatsu, which is a heated Japanese table traditionally used for gathering in the winter months.
In a desolate stretch of desert outside Yuma, Ariz., there's a spot where more than 350 migrants, including children, burrowed under the steel border fence a few weeks ago.
And we have always been entrepreneurial and had that spirit of business creation. I think, even today, African-American women are the largest fastest-growing number of entrepreneurs. So, you know, they owned restaurants, and beauty parlors, tourist homes. And they're all through the book. And it's really a wonderful way to bring that history through The Green Book.
Critics argue the administration's single-minded focus on hard power is short-sighted, and could ultimately be detrimental to national security. They point to past comments from Defense Secretary James Mattis, a retired Marine general, who once told lawmakers, If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition, ultimately.
The results of the investigation are an example of how the #MeToo movement has had little traction in Russia so far. Russians often dismiss sexual harassment allegations as political correctness run wild.
But it then allows states to opt out of that requirement.
College football is inching closer to the end of a tumultous year. And 2020 has been a year of firsts for women in major league sports.
But that kind of that kind of process you're talking about, I mean, I know obviously safety is so important. But when it comes — we're in a health crisis where people are describing having a shortage of hospital beds. I mean, if we're going to get to a point really soon where there are that many sick people, doesn't the risk assessment change? I mean, can't you speed up the kind of things you're talking about to get these kind of drugs to people right now?
The biggest impact for the community their organizations serve may be for PrEP — a daily pill that helps prevent HIV infection, says Carl Schmid, deputy executive director at the AIDS Institute, an advocacy group. A 30-day supply of PrEP (brand-name Truvada) can cost nearly $2,000. Gilead, the drug's manufacturer, offers a copay assistance program that covers up to $3,600 annually in copay assistance, with no limit on how much is paid per month.
Today you have a very young crown prince who is ambitious who needs to push the envelope ... because demand is changing for oil, technology is changing, he says.
You can see sort of large piles of dirt to the left of those little houses, says Melinda Hunt, an activist with The Hart Island Project. Hunt first visited the island as an artist for a photography project. Now, more than two decades later, she's pushing for the cemetery to be more open to the public.
In some ways, Haley seems to face the same conundrum former Louisiana Gov. and failed Republican presidential candidate Bobby Jindal did — not seeming brown enough for some voters of color, while being too brown for others. (We won't bore you with the details, or subject you to some of the graphic tweets, but just take a look at the #JindalSoWhite hashtag to see what we're talking about.)

But that was after test votes on the two parties' dueling proposals to reopen the government had failed on the Senate floor earlier in the day. The Democrats' plan attracted six Republican votes but still fell eight votes shy of the three-fifths majority required to advance the bill. The GOP alternative, based on the proposal Trump offered over the weekend, fell 10 votes shy and had the support of a single Democratic senator.
But, for roughly half of our history, this ritual did not require anyone to go anywhere.
SAGAL: Yes, that's true. It was an elaborate stunt. He didn't want to do the stories anymore. And it worked. Now he has his own news channel on YouTube.
Jussie Smollett took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career, Johnson said at a news conference Thursday after Smollett's arrest.
LOTTE LENYA: (As Fraulein Schneider, singing) With time rushing by, what would you do? With the clock running down, what would you do? The young always have the cure - being brave, being sure and free. But imagine if you were me, alone like me. And this is the only world I know, some rooms to let, the sum of a lifetime, even so. I'll take your advice. What would you do? Would you pay the price? What would you do? Suppose simply keeping still means you manage until the end. What would you do, my brave, young friend? Grown old like me, with neither the will nor wish to run; grown tired like me, who hurries for bed when day is done; grown wise like me, who isn't at war with anyone - not anyone.
I think our students understand that we need a change and enough is enough, Noah Karvelis, a teacher and organizer of Arizona Educators United, said at a news conference Wednesday ahead of the rally. The grass-roots group is behind #RedforEd, the movement calling on teachers and their supporters to wear red in solidarity.
Happer is an intriguing and controversial figure. He was born in India when it was a British colony, the son of a Scottish military officer and an American medical missionary. His mother, with young Will in tow, spent part of World War II working as a physician at the secret Manhattan Project site in Oak Ridge, Tenn. The family later settled in North Carolina.
SIMON: Phyllida Lloyd herself - her new film, Herself, - thanks so much for being with us.
Bernie Sanders, the principal challenger to 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton, is well-known, but between 1 in 3 and 1 in 4 Democrats have a negative opinion of him. There are a lot of questions about whether Sanders will be able to keep his base of activist supporters together, four years later, now that Democrats have so many more options.
SIMON: Nothing. I've never met him.
Roughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say.

And where were they going? Tang found that black residents left Austin for suburbs to the north and east of the city. Places such as Manor, Elgin and Round Rock. But these aren't suburbs as we often think of them.
The response to those lines, and other conciliatory notes in Haley's speech, was swift. And some of it was brutal. Conservative firebrand Ann Coulter probably went the farthest, writing, Donald Trump should deport Nikki Haley.
GROSS: Another thing we should mention is your teeth. He had - what? - four extra teeth in his upper mouth. And he had, you know, very buck teeth as a result. And so you had fake teeth that you used, made for you by a famous Hollywood prosthetic teeth designer.
A spokesperson for the King County Sheriff's Office, Sgt. Cindi West, says someone requested documents in May 2015, shortly after Brown's arrest, but didn't initially identify himself as an investigator for the NFL.

Tens of thousands of acres of wetlands in the Chesapeake Bay watershed will lose federal protection under a new Trump administration rule that was finalized on Thursday. It's the latest regulatory rollback that could impact the bay's health.
The discussion focused on the importance of the public health partnership at various levels of government and underscored the importance [of] community preparedness, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said.
The policy was toughened after the Ray Rice scandal in 2014. NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell wrote the following in a letter to team owners in August of that year:
Yeah, you could almost imagine this is a bit of a Montessori 2.0. I mean, the whole principle of Montessori is students learn by exploration, play, they learn at their own time and pace, they have mixed age. And mixed age allows older students to mentor and younger students to get that mentorship, and what we're doing is exactly that. But Montessori has historically struggled as you go into the more advanced subjects, as you get to your algebra and your physics and your chemistry, and that's where tools like Khan Academy come into play. Because now students can still learn at their own time and pace, and they can still explore, and they can pull the information they need to solve real-world problems. So we are inspired by Montessori, and I would like to think that Maria Montessori would be pretty excited if she saw what was going on.
The shake-up in the Saudi line of succession comes as the kingdom and other Gulf Arab states continue a feud with Qatar that has seen borders close and trade shipments halted, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports for our Newscast unit. The U.S. State Department appears to be losing patience with the Saudis and their allies, demanding that they reveal their list of grievances against Qatar.
Coca-Cola says the new fruit flavors are also an attempt to capture the tastes of young people, who have boosted sales of flavored sparking water, such as LaCroix, Polar and Sparkling Ice, by more than 10 percent each year.
WOOD JR: It's about safety. I'm black. I don't get the luxury of just walking out with [expletive] in my hand. That is a roll of the dice. That is a horrifying day if I - no, not only do I need that bag. I need that receipt.
As of Jan. 1, gas stations in counties with a population of less than 40,000 are permitted to offer self-service. While the change in the law is expected to affect a small number of people, Oregonians took to social media to express their discontent – and were subsequently mocked by residents of the other 48 states that allow self-service. New Jersey is the only other state that prohibits drivers from pumping their own gas.

In Hong Kong, dozens of pro-democracy lawmakers and activists were arrested — the biggest roundup under the new national security law since its introduction last summer.
In other words, women critics may be reluctant to express their own authority — or to believe in such authority in the first place. To do so would be to ignore their own gendered experiences in jazz. It would also mean embracing false ideals of merit that have historically been used to justify women's low performance and exclusion.
From an employer perspective, everyone under the plan has to be treated the same, says Brian Marcotte, president and CEO of the National Business Group on Health, which represents large employers.

Wetlands are really great filters of pollutants, McGee says. We would lose that filtering capacity.
A good example would be, if you were a minor league baseball player, and you were brought up to the majors and you look up on the mound and you say, Nolan Ryan! Oh no, he's a legend. He's got a 100 mile per hour fastball. I'll probably not even see the ball. You're probably not going to get a hit. If you come up and say, Nolan Ryan. He's an old man. I'm going to knock the cover off the ball, you are probably going to have a much better chance.

It was a country that was corrupted by American aid, and people brought those habits of corruption and brutal competition with them to the U.S. And they also brought the memories of Vietnamese people killing other Vietnamese people to the United States. And I'm sure that affected them and their children and created the conditions for violence and brutality towards each other in this - the very same community, as you said, that was created in order to protect each other.
By law, Michigan's more than 3 million absentee ballots could not be counted until election day. That night, it appeared as if President Trump had the lead, but by Wednesday as absentee ballots continued to be counted, Biden pulled ahead and Republican groups began recruiting supporters to flood the TCF center in downtown Detroit where absentee ballots were being counted. Protesters banged on glass windows chanting stop the vote.
FAVREAU: Well, and every year he says it, it becomes more true (laughter). No, but there is. Look, and I think if you say it without acknowledging the very real anxiety that working people face - you know, wages still aren't growing fast enough. There's still too many people without jobs. But the fact is, if you look at the markers by almost every economic statistic, we're in a vastly better place than we were.

House impeachment manager Adam Schiff, D-Calif., also argued against the rules resolution, while calling on the Senate to allow testimony from new witnesses. He played senators a tape of Trump saying he would love to hear testimony from Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and others (even though White House officials have so far been barred from testifying).
As - you know, Hitchcock cast me in North By Northwest even though he saw me in a play in which I didn't play a conventional bad guy, though I was the catalyst in the piece. It was Paddy Chayefsky's first play on Broadway called Middle Of The Night. I toured with that, and that brought me to California. And Hitchcock saw me on opening night and had me in mind for North By Northwest as a result of that. Though the character was 180 degrees different than the role I played in North By Northwest.

It's like a tradition now, the 25-year-old says. You come to Yawkey Way, and you get sausage on the street before the game. I like Yawkey Way, and it would be weird if it changed from Yawkey Way now.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And we also heard about the challenges you face. A few themes came up again and again - lack of Internet connection, trouble accessing health care, and several people brought up education.
Over 40 regime changes in a century
As you were watching the footage of what was going on at the Capitol Building on Wednesday, what were you noticing? What stood out to you?
The budget says that slash in funding is necessary to ease the burden of unnecessary Federal regulations that impose significant costs for workers and consumers without justifiable environmental benefits.
Experts disagree on how much blame for the crisis should be placed on subprime lenders. Only about 5 percent of housing mortgage applications approved in 2006 were subprime. The racial disparities in lending practices helped drive foreclosure rates higher for borrowers of color. And mortgage discrimination persists today.
Of course, Twitter is not exactly or entirely representative of the real world, and even thousands of tweets for or against Nikki Haley might not accurately depict actual support or disapproval of her.
Health Savings Account Change In 2018 Could Trip Up Some Consumers
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Your family and your friends must be very worried about you.
ROCCA: Oh, that would be cute.
SAGAL: Here is your first quote.

SIMON: And what kind of conversations have you had with people on the other side who voted to keep the law?
The KCNA report said the congress blamed officials for botching implementation of the party's economic plans and failing to actively introduce reality-friendly and people-friendly methods in the ruling party's work.
GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is songwriter, singer and guitarist Vic Chesnutt and guitarist and arranger Guy Picciotto. Guy is featured on Vic Chesnutt's new CD, At the Cut. We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.
So when the history of 2016 is finally written, the smashing results from New York may well be cast as the key inflection point. Trump was declared the winner shortly after polls closed, tallying 60 percent of the statewide vote. When counting ended, Trump was poised to claim all 14 at-large delegates and about 75 of the 81 delegates awarded by congressional district.
In the last debate, newcomer Mike Bloomberg took the bulk of the attacks. The former New York City mayor is onstage again Tuesday, though once again is not on the upcoming ballot.
Brooks is one of the most majestic ranters and kvetchers is in movie history. And his verbal mania is only fueled by Hagerty's googly-eyed daffiness. Now, Brooks's comic approach is unsentimental and often uncomfortable. David may be all too human. Brooks clearly sees something of himself in the guy. But he's far from lovable. Indeed, pointing the way to Curb Your Enthusiasm, Brooks's work creates the prototype of the annoyingly selfish hero who stews in anxiety, bad faith and a sense of always being right. When Lost In America came out, it was instantly recognized as a trenchant satire of the emerging species known as yuppies, with their materialism, sense of entitlement and unidealistic belief that the world is their oyster.
Until late last month, Charles Lieber lived the quiet life of an elite American scientist. His lab at Harvard University researched things like how to meld tiny electronics with the brain. In his spare time, he grew award-winning pumpkins in front of his house.
SNELL: Thanks so much for having me.
I had visited with some middle school students in St. Louis, Mo., and these were black students and Hispanic students telling me about a field trip they had to take. And then they were talking about how on their way back they stopped at a subway and the teacher had handed out, you know, chips and drink to all of the kids, and then they each had like five dollars to go get a sandwich, Oluo says.
Policies that have nothing to do with China
The simple truth in this instance is clearer now than ever: The danger of coronavirus was never a creation of the president's critics, nor had it been imagined by the current and former members of the administration who had been sounding the alarm. It was real all along, and remains so today.
Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine (D) endorsed Joe Biden on Friday in his run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The hefty lift, just days before Super Tuesday, comes as a new poll shows the former vice president with a slight lead in Virginia, ahead of rivals Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg.
PERALTA: He built this house with money from his motorcycle taxi. It was never his dream to drive a motorcycle, but he was orphaned. He couldn't afford school. And with a motorcycle, he could hustle 24/7. He says he survived on soft drinks to save enough to build this two-bedroom house.

Did the thieves really get the idea from Hollywood? Perhaps we will learn more when the suspecys are arraigned in Dutch court on Tuesday. But until then, it's worth noting that two of the seven films from the Fast & Furious franchise are among Romania's top five grossing movies of all time.
CHANG: That is NPR's Mara Liasson.
Friedlander says she thinks people are uncomfortable with the big ideas of Sanders' campaign. But the hard truth is that that's why people vote for Trump, she says and sighs. They wanted big change and they followed the wrong leader and he didn't give them the change they wanted. Bernie Sanders is the change people want to see.
FLAKE: You know, it runs its course after a while. And it has. If you look across the country, overall, Republicans did OK down-ballot. But I think that there was a rejection of Trump and Trumpism. He lost by 7 million votes across the country and lost in swing states. So there has been a change. And I think that it'll be quickened by the events of the past week.
It's a political decision and we're going to see them in court, Trump said.

A few days later - there was Scott Kelly with his arms stretched overhead, and a big smile - looking up at a dark sky:
In Washington, D.C., marcher Debbie Droke expressed her amazement that these issues continue to pervade.
Putin has become the wild card in his own system, Hill said. If he goes, it seems destabilizing. And this seems like an effort to kind of put off the inevitable. He surely won't live forever.
SIMON: Without getting too much into the suspense that you build, does Buck risk losing his moral compass?
Thank you. From a zippered compartment in her camera bag, Claire retrieved the permission form. Placing her coat on the back of a chair, using the coat as a table, Patsy signed the form without reading it.
Saturday Sports: NFL Playoffs, Remembering David Stern
Earlier in the day, Guaidó issued a statement urging all foreign embassies in the country to disobey Maduro's 72-hour deadline and not to remove their diplomats.
So, either the Democrats have to alienate their own base by casting enough votes to kill their own filibuster, or the likelihood is that Republicans will change the rules to get rid of the filibuster on Supreme Court nominations. And Democrats would dearly like to preserve that tool, knowing that there is a strong possibility there will be at least one more Supreme Court vacancy during the Trump presidency.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that a Georgia man sentenced to death is entitled to a new trial because prosecutors deliberately excluded all African Americans from the jury based on their race. The 7-to-1 ruling was one of three high court decisions issued Monday involving racial discrimination.
SWITZER: At about a mile and a half into the race, the press truck went by us, and they saw that I was a woman in the race wearing numbers and they began taking pictures. And alongside of the photographer's truck came the officials' press truck. And the race director was on the truck and the guys were teasing him. And he got so angry that there was a girl in the race that he stopped the bus and jumped off it and ran after me and attacked me in the race and tried to pull off my bib numbers, screaming at me, get the hell out of my race and give me those numbers.
GROSS: Dynasties is a new five-part BBC series focusing on groups of animals from five different species, each with rich and complex social lives. There's an hour each on lions, chimpanzees, tigers, painted wolves and emperor penguins. Naturalists and camera crews followed each group for up to two years, long enough so that the episodes reveal the social relationships among the animals, their kinship and affection, as well as their rivalries and power struggles. Real plotlines develop and drama unfolds. The series is narrated by David Attenborough.
Spokesman Todd Breasseale says in an email: As part of our ongoing quality surveys, we asked a diverse and representative sample of Facebook users across the US to gauge their familiarity with, and trust in, sources of news. A source's broad trust is one of many signals that determine stories' ranking in News Feed. We boost links from sources with high trust scores and demote links from sources with low trust scores.
What about the children who did require care for asthma emergencies? There was no increase in the share who required hospitalization, suggesting most cases that made it to the ER weren't any worse than usual.
It's the kind of attitude that makes Nathan hopeful.
The Census Bureau is ready for you to do the same, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who oversees the bureau, said in a written statement. If you do, there will be no need for census takers to knock on your door.
That would undoubtedly provoke a constitutional crisis. Refusal to obey a Supreme Court order would normally be grounds for impeachment.
There are many, many other alternatives. Quantum foundations, the field that deals in resolving the measurement problem and the other basic questions of quantum theory, is a lively subject brimming with creative ideas. The hole at the heart of quantum physics is still there — there's still an open problem that needs solving — but there are many fascinating theories that have been proposed to solve these problems. These ideas might also point the way forward on other problems in physics, such as a theory of quantum gravity, the theory of everything that has been the ultimate goal of physicists since Albert Einstein.
I started to see things. I would see Democratic senators fondling interns or cornering them in elevators. Why was the world like this, when I saw people just assuming the power to corner the intern? This was the kind of thing that you saw literally. And I think this is what this woman was saying, you're in denial about how deeply sexist the institution may be.
It's a specious argument that not airing the briefings is tantamount to censorship. It's not as if NPR would be refusing to report any news coming out of the briefings if it did not carry them live. The daily news shows and hourly newscasts have reported extensively on what the president and others have said during the briefings, and continue to do so.
Not possible. His refusal was automatic. He wouldn't let an outsider get too close.
In May 2015, Brown was arrested for assaulting his then-wife Molly at their home in Washington state. Brown wasn't charged.
But in terms of U.S. engagement with Iran, is there any talks underway, any plan for talks?
So something that I don't want to be in that path, you know, since I'm putting a lot of effort for all those years. I don't know why I don't have a path. So I don't know why the government doesn't clarify for people they have doing the right thing here, paying tax, doing everything correct like a regular American citizen. But we still don't have - we don't have any idea how can we get it, how can we become a citizen, how we can get a green card. You know, of course, there is certain situations that you're going to go through and apply for other fees and everything else...
KELLY: Yeah, it would be. Howard Bryant of ESPN, thank you.
The NFL's actions with Brown are reminiscent of how it handled Rice's notorious case two years ago, when the league responded to the first reports of Rice's elevator assault on his then-fiancee with a two-game suspension.
Aside from the economics lesson, it provided a picture of one of the Trump campaign's biggest recent weaknesses. His clarifications on the U.S. debt also came in the midst of a weekend in which Trump clarified his position on two other major economic issues: Trump said he thought the minimum wage should be raised on a state-by-state level. In November, he had said in a debate that he thought wages were too high.
For Jim Battis, this was his second time hearing Joe Biden in person.
Freddy Rolón, vice president and general manager at ESPN Deportes, oversees the network's business and television's more than 4,500 live hours of Spanish-language content every year. When we look at the marketplace for the Hispanic audience, we see actually growth in both the English side and the Spanish-language side. And we're seeing a big growth in the overlap as well with the bilingual audience, he said.
Is this the best bread in the neighborhood?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: As long as I have you, I want to ask you about developments in the Mueller investigation. The president was having some trouble filling his legal team after John Dowd left. This week, Rudy Giuliani joined the team, saying he wants to bring an end to the Mueller investigation. Does that sound possible to you?
DAN BUSH: Yeah. It's right over there.
A poll shows 60 percent of Michigan Republicans want more trade restrictions on China, just to give one example that may help to explain why the candidates talk so much about trade.
It is during the tawaf that many women experience groping, fondling and grabbing, says Eltahawy, according to the responses she's heard from women. It's very crowded. At any given moment, there are thousands of men and women [circling Kaaba at one time].
Proponents of the bill argue it won't cost the state jobs because stations with convenience stores are still required to employ attendants during business hours. Only a handful of gas station owners surveyed by The Bend Bulletin said they plan to offer self-service. Many owners said they would have to install new pumps in order to allow it.
DAVIES: Wow. You know, among the individuals of the species in this series, one of the more interesting is a 92-year-old homo sapien named David Attenborough.

Iran's President Hassan Rouhani Wins Re-Election
GROSS: Yeah. And they stayed home, and they read. Or they stayed home, and they drew. Or they stayed home, and they listened to or played music. And I'm wondering if being laid up from an injury for a while affected your desire to - and your time to immerse yourself in books.
We're in the middle of a housing crisis, and that means more and more people are giving more and more of their income to rent and utilities, Desmond says. Our hope is that we can take this problem that's been in the dark and bring it into the light.
DAVIES: What dangers did the crew face?
Charles Peanut Tillman — a former cornerback for the Chicago Bears — is one of football's greatest defensive backs. So we've invited him to play a game called Now that's what I call an offensive line — three questions about offending people.
LIMBONG: Mahoney says Fred Rogers got help from a child psychologist named Margaret McFarland.
This infinite collection of numbers is called a wave function, because these numbers scattered across space usually change smoothly, undulating like a wave. There's a beautiful equation that describes how wave functions wave about through space, called the Schrödinger equation (after Erwin Schrödinger, the Austrian physicist who first discovered it in 1925). Wave functions mostly obey the Schrödinger equation the same way a falling rock obeys Newton's laws of motion: It's something like a law of nature. And as laws of nature go, it's a pretty simple one, though it can look mathematically forbidding at first.
YONG: Yeah, that's right. So there are millions, perhaps billions of coronaviruses out there in other animals. And of all the ones that scientists have found so far, the one that most closely resembles SARS-CoV-2 is one that is found in bats. So it's likely that the virus originated in some kind of bat and eventually hopped into humans either directly or via another intermediate species.
This part two of a two part series. Listen to part one here.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: But she didn't really have any other options.
Sandi Toksvig is an award-winning comedian and writer. She currently hosts the show Q-I on the BBC and will co-host the next season of The Great British Bake Off. In March 2015, she co-founded a new political party in the UK, the Women's Equality Party.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: The shutdown clearly isn't helping that.
And the - North Korea's point has been pretty consistent in past months. They say, look, since the summit, we have dismantled some of our nuclear and missile testing facilities, and now we expect the U.S. to reciprocate by providing security guarantees and easing sanctions. The U.S. wants to start off as a first move by providing an inventory of all its nuclear assets, but North Korea refuses to do that.
BQ: You're not talking about renegotiating sovereign bonds that the U.S. has already issued. DT: No, I don't want to renegotiate the bonds, but I think you can do discounting. I think depending on where interest rates are, I think you can buy back. I'm not talking about with a renegotiation, but you can buy back at discounts, you can do things at discounts. I'm not even suggesting that we don't borrow money at very low rates long term so we don't have to worry about when they come due.
I'm very lucky in that I never look back at it as a tough upbringing because it was the only upbringing I knew, and everyone was doing it with me. Essentially it's like being in a very stringent fitness class — if everyone is suffering together it doesn't seem so bad.

Prior to tightening water measures, the city attempted to shame residents into using less water by posting an online map tracking water consumption across the city.
Well, there's no doubt that what played a role, as I said earlier, was that, number one, I think he's the best person for the job. Number two, I think he's a consensus builder. And the court would benefit from that at the moment.
And actually, in the far future, everything we now see, except for our local galaxy and a region of galaxies will have disappeared. The entire universe will disappear before our very eyes, and it's one of my arguments for actually funding cosmology. We've got to do it while we have a chance.
FDA Seeks To Expand Treatment For Coronavirus As Part Of White House Response
On Monday, Lee apparently faxed a handwritten note to a colleague, saying he was in mainland China of his own volition.
One major win for students is an agreement by the board to consider freezing undergraduate tuition rates at current levels. Howard will also reexamine the adequacy of on-campus housing for students.

They conclude that the ancestors of these infants started out in East Asia about 35,000 years ago. As they traveled east, they became genetically isolated from other Asians. At some point during the last ice age they crossed a frozen land bridge from Siberia to Alaska called Beringia.
Episode 771: When India's Cash Disappeared, Part Two
Recently, Trump has hinted he may extend the March 1 deadline for completing the talks, which can only reduce Lighthizer's leverage over Beijing, Alden says.
LANDAU: Yes, but she doesn't know what the - you know, I mean, that's a very delicate thing. I mean, she knows that I'm having some problems. But she doesn't know the degree to which the problems are - I mean, this is a man who's - has a - who's having a major, major breakdown, a nervous breakdown, on top of the fact that he does something that is among the most heinous things a, quote, unquote, leading character has ever done.
That's a big question we're posing at NPR. We can't easily report on the future, but we can ask smart people how they think we got to this point in history, and where they think we're going.
Heinrich made the statements as part of a plea deal related to child pornography charges, on which he was indicted last December. All but one of those counts were dropped as part of the deal.
But he's not — he's not a pol.
Essentially, the measures that were implemented before that have kept transmission rates relatively stable are insufficient against this new variant, says virus expert Eleanor Gaunt of the University of Edinburgh.
RICHEN: You know, Karen and Jennifer are from New York. They traveled through New England with their family, and that instance happened when they were traveling to New England. And I say that because it's important to understand that this was not relegated to the Jim Crow South. The dangers and the humiliations and the fear were really all over the country.
Yet, with speeches like the one in Miami, Trump was working to Americanize the crisis, according to Greg Weeks, a University of North Carolina professor who edits the journal The Latin Americanist.
But where does the new $23,000 a year ($25,000 for grades 6-12) brick-and-mortar Khan Lab School in Silicon Valley fit into that mission?

Kim reaffirmed that North Korea would not use its nuclear arsenal in a preemptive strike.
From day one, Healthier Generation knew our work with McDonald's could influence broad scale improvements to meal options for kids everywhere, said Dr. Howell Wechsler, Chief Executive Officer of Alliance for a Healthier Generation in a statement. Today's announcement represents meaningful progress.
Now the country has one of the fastest-growing Christian populations in the world, according to the World Christian Database, which tracks global trends in Christianity.
MALEK: Yeah. There are parts that are me. I think the parts that break, yes, that would be considered (laughter) Rami Malek.
Many theoretical physicists have argued the conclusion that we live in a multiverse is based on sound scientific reasoning. But that isn't so — and I will tell you why.
However, by 2016, China's leadership came to realize that the policy had been too successful and officially relaxed it.
PETE SAENZ: This rhetoric galvanized us. It brought us even closer together. And we interact, and we're so interdependent. That's life in the border.
We begin this hour in Venezuela. After a day of bloody clashes, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has warned the U.S. will take action. Vice President Mike Pence is headed to the region and will meet with Juan Guaido, the opposition lawmaker whom the U.S. recognizes as interim president. Guaido is calling for nations to consider all measures to oust President Nicolas Maduro. NPR's Eyder Peralta has been covering this story from the Venezuelan capital of Caracas. We'll get to him in a moment. But first, John Otis is at Santander Bridge, one of Colombia's crossings into Venezuela, where many of yesterday's confrontations took place. And he joins us from there now. John, good morning.
GROSS: What did you have to do to get in?
DAVIES: Were there white-owned businesses advertising in the book also?
Mr. ALLEN: In other words, there would be some kind of criminal prosecution. Look, I - first of all, I'm dreadfully sorry for what happened to you, and I'm glad that, ultimately, you are able to prevail. I don't know exactly what should happen, because I know that the Vatican has to set policy for a global church. But I do know that when I talk to just ordinary people, the kinds of disappointment that Bette is describing, particularly about how the bishops seem - how the church seems to have dealt with its priest problem, but not its bishop's problem - that, to me, does seem to be the single biggest sort of neuralgic point in all of this. And somehow...
CORNISH: La La Land has the verve of a Jazz Age musical, but it also questions any one person trying to be the gatekeeper of the tradition. Jazz is dying, Ryan Gosling's Sebastian declares at one point. And it's up to him to save it. Not so fast, says John Legend. He plays a successful bandleader in the film who asked, how are you going to save Jazz if no one's listening?
The street name Yawkey Way is nothing like the Confederate memorials that deserve to be dumped, he says. Yawkey's sins don't compare, he says, and must be considered in the context of the era, his personal growth, and his generosity. And he says, one must allow for his redemption.
MARK: A comment, more so. As a 30-year-old male from the Midwest - in Tulsa, specifically - of mixed ethnic background, many of us - we applaud the pope for what he has done, but it's all relative, more or less. When an institution, for centuries, has moved at a snail's pace and you're going to tell me that slightly faster than that is all we can do right now, we take what we can, but at the same time you throw your hands up in arms. Because as your guest just said, this has not erupted throughout two-thirds of the known Catholic world. And we look at Ireland, how that has flared up recently in the past year. We just dont know when it's going to end, or if it's even started, to tell you the truth.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: NOW is the National Organization for Women.
ALDA: I never really wanted to go to medical school. My father wanted me to go. He always wanted me to be a doctor.
So speculation about President-elect Joe Biden's health agenda has focused on the things he can accomplish using executive authority. Although there is a long list of things he could do, even longer is the list of things he is being urged to undo — actions taken by President Trump.
It took a building to bring down Donald Trump.
Rhodes fired star host Charlie Rose in the fall of 2017 after accusations of sexual harassment from multiple women. Rose had been not just a contributor to 60 Minutes but a fixture on the reinvented CBS This Morning as well as his eponymous PBS program. The morning show tailed off in the ratings after his departure. (Rose apologized for his past conduct but said he does not believe all of the allegations are true.)
TALAJIC: Thank you for having us.
For example, you can change RED to ROSE in five steps. Starting with RED, you could add a U, making RUED; drop the D, leaving RUE; add an S, making RUSE; add an O, making ROUSE, and then drop the U, leaving ROSE.
We make it in the laboratory downstairs.
But both writing and working in front of a live audience each week on SNL was not without its drawbacks. Meyers recalls ruminating over shows that didn't quite hit the mark: If you had a bad SNL, it stayed with you all week, he says.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Leana Wen is the president of Planned Parenthood. Thank you very much.
They have already sent an advance team to China. They are working in China. Secondly, people have to understand right now, people in China are so preoccupied with their work to combat this virus. So we have to have some ordered manner to have experts from other countries. And also there's a real risk that they might be exposed to the virus. We'll have to take good protection of them.
Whether through the appropriations process, the courts, or elsewhere, we must act to make sure an untested citizenship question is not on the 2020 Census, says Democratic Rep. José Serrano of New York — who now chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the census — in a written statement.
Trump said he would work to approve that quickly.
Already, the union is exerting its influence. After Facebook announced it would indefinitely ban Trump, and Twitter temporarily suspended the president's account for several hours, the Google union lambasted their bosses for not doing enough.
The danger of a one-shot regimen is that the vaccines might actually be — long term — less efficacious than they've been shown to be when using the regimen that's authorized for use, explains Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Georgetown Center for Global Health Science and Security. It could be potentially harmful if we decide to deviate from that just because of a short-term supply issue.
I can personally hear them, I can walk around the tables, I can observe what they're doing, she said.
Dr. HOOPER-BUI: Well, we found we've just, we've tried to find friendlier areas, friendlier people, people who are willing to allow us to have access to the areas and to the land. So we found adjacent areas. It's very time-consuming to do that, though.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Nick, I hear you are graduating from the University of Michigan this weekend.
Let me frame it a different way –
The smartest thing this new X-Files does is to establish instantly that Mulder and Scully became a couple and broke up in the years we haven't been watching them. So now there's no will they or won't they? tension — they did, then they stopped and now they're in a whole new place.
NTETA: Thank you for having me.
GROSS: One of the criticisms of how the money was handled was that $20 million went to consultants, and a lot of the consultants were paid, like, a thousand dollars a day. And you compare that to what teachers make in a year, and that what was their response to that?
SIMON: Please tell us the latest we know about Wednesday's shooting. Who was the victim, and what have we learned from police body cam footage?
Other areas are growing more deeply rooted in their own values. In Pensacola, Fla., which WUWF's Tom Ninestine describes as having a heart as big as their love of Old Glory and the military, residents steadily deliver Republicans solid support and will likely do the same this year.
However, the revision has also encountered broad criticism. As the proposed rollback was taking shape last year, 14 states sued the EPA over the impending rule change, saying it ignores science and the law and strips our waters of basic protections under the Clean Water Act.
Huffman said he's open to a compromise with drilling boosters — from the state of Alaska to Indigenous Iñupiaq leaders in Kaktovik, the only community inside the refuge's boundaries — that would provide them with alternative paths toward economic development.
But you know, by the early '90s and, you know - crack had really taken over. It was pretty much an all-black neighborhood. The one thing that I've kind of joked about sometimes - but it's actually true - is that if you're going to live in gang territory, it behooves you to live deep in gang territory because where I lived in Birmingham, most of the shootings were happening where territories met - like on border lines, almost, if you will. So there were a lot of bad people, but a lot of the bad stuff that happened in the hood happened more so on the outskirt areas of - in relation to where I lived.
This is what students like to call a physics for poets class — a class that explores the history of how humanity has confronted some of the deepest questions we can ask about the material world and our place in it, without the math. It is a class that tries to capture the true spirit of the liberal-arts education, mixing the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences as different and complementary ways of knowing the world and why we matter. In fancier words, as an intellectual history of physics and astronomy, the class requires that scientific thinking be contextualized culturally, so that students can situate the ways in which some of the most revolutionary ideas in the past 2,000 years emerged when they did.
I can just say that a lot of very bright people have broken their heads over the years, trying to understand the dark energy. At first, we tried to understand why it was zero, when we thought it was zero, and now the problem is to understand why it is what it is, and there are no very good explanations. There are some that have been offered, but none obviously is correct.
In Cosby Trial, Witness Recounts 1984 Assault At Comedian's Nevada Ranch
Some public health experts and scientists have been pushing for this move, arguing that the most important thing is to get as many people at least one shot as soon as possible, without being too concerned about scheduling the booster. They point out that while the vaccines are authorized as a series of two shots, data from clinical trials suggests that one shot is still protective, and many have argued there's a significant benefit to giving more people one shot.
SACHA PFEIFFER, BYLINE: Thanks for having me, Scott.
The isolation has made McLemore even more aware of the end of his marriage and the loss of the life he once had. Even though he knows he and his ex were not meant to be married anymore, he does miss their common language and inside jokes.
Epidemiologist Sergio Brusin who works on the European Center for Disease Control's coronavirus response, offered NPR a similar rationale in an interview. However, ECDC only mentioned that face masks aren't effective in protecting the wearer on its public-facing website. A number of other health agencies — like WHO and the CDC — offered little explanation on their website.

Noyer was once head of the Banque de France and vice president of the European Central Bank. Right after the U.K.'s 2016 Brexit vote to leave the European Union, the French government under then-President Francois Hollande put Noyer in charge of convincing multinationals that were planning to leave London to relocate their operations to Paris. The competition includes cities like Dublin, Frankfurt and Luxembourg.
LIASSON: Well, like everything else about Trump and the shutdown, it's unclear. He's been ping-ponging around this issue. Sometimes, he says he definitely would declare a state of emergency. Other times, he's said he's not in any rush. But that endgame of declaring a national emergency has been described to me by Trump's advisers as the only plausible way out of this for him politically, a way for him to keep faith with his base, show him - show them he's fighting, even if he's stymied in the courts.
Although there is no evidence that any votes were changed by a foreign power in 2016 or 2018, almost 4 in 10 Americans surveyed said they believe it is likely another country will tamper with the votes cast in 2020 in order to change the result.
The government's strategy is to try to avoid a spike in cases that could easily inundate the NHS.
JONES: So across to the cave, I hear - Doug, buddy, can you hear me? Randy Quaid. Yeah? He said, do what you're doing. It's great. We can go again. I'm fine. You're doing great. The next voice that I heard was a young PA, a production assistant, going - can I get some ice over here? I can't stop the bleeding.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: The bill would be called the Violence Against Women Act - VAWA.
If you're paying any attention to the news, teachers are complaining about needing to make more money, Albert Fontenot, the Census Bureau's head of the 2020 census, said during a public meeting in October. Teachers love to do the census. It's a great opportunity for them to partake in democracy and be able to tell their students about what they do.
Ron Daniels, an NHS critical care doctor, says that if the government's strategy works, the NHS will be able to cope. But if it doesn't, Daniels says, the U.K. could come to resemble parts of Italy, where more than 2,100 people have died.

We have not shared our plans for cybersecurity with the public intentionally to not give the opposing team, adversaries wanting to discredit the federal government, an advantage, the Census Bureau's chief information officer, Kevin Smith, wrote in a blog post in August.
INSKEEP: So if you get this resolution passed, of course, it's a framework, it's an idea, it's a proposal and then you would need specific legislation to encourage wind power, to encourage solar, to do any number of things - efficiency, on and on. Those proposals, just mechanically, would need to move through various House committees, like the Energy and Commerce Committee, on its way to becoming law, committees that are chaired by Democrats who you have questioned or criticized because they take, for example, energy money. Frank Pallone of the Energy and Commerce Committee comes to mind. Do you have confidence in your fellow, more senior, Democrats that they would move the legislation that is necessary to do what you think needs to be done?
SAGAL: There you go. There you go, right?
GARCIA-NAVARRO: NPR national political reporter Mara Liasson - thank you so much, Mara.
The President-Elect believes we must accelerate distribution of the vaccine while continuing to ensure the Americans who need it most get it as soon as possible. He supports releasing available doses immediately, and believes the government should stop holding back vaccine supply so we can get more shots in Americans' arms now, spokesman T.J. Ducklo said in a statement to NPR, noting more details would be available next week.
While talks may hold off the immediate threat of a military conflict, they also give North Korea time to continue to develop its arsenal.

I am fine right now, the note continued. Everything is normal.
A trade deficit results when a country imports more than it exports — that is, it buys more from the rest of the world than it sells to the rest of the world. Trump is talking here about what is called a bilateral trade deficit — a trade deficit that describes only what two countries buy from and sell to each other.
Of course we had the nuclear agreement, he says. 'The whole world witnessed that we extended our hand in friendship. But as the supreme leader has said, we cannot solve problems with countries we don't trust.
At 38, Bobi Wine has electrified young people across Uganda. And Museveni, who has historically clamped down on anyone who poses a real threat to his power, has unleashed his security forces on him. In a press conference on Tuesday, Bobi Wine said the military had killed his driver and that his home was raided.
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Oh, boy, yes. In some ways, this is the easy part. Right now, front-line health workers and long-term care residents are the groups CDC advises should get the vaccine. We've heard reports that that's not always what's happening, but that is the federal guidance. But in a few weeks, it'll be the turn of essential workers and people over 75. And those are much bigger, more diverse groups. So public health officials really have their work cut out for them.
SCICLUNA: Well, first of all, that is the law for the United States of America and Canada. Victims also need to be reminded that we need to be reminded of the very important words by Saint John Paul II, who said that people should know that there is no place in the priesthood for anybody who would harm the young, who would harm our kids. And this has to be the way forward.
FLATOW: Do we know why it happened?
Starr declined NPR's request to comment on this story, writing in an email that, for now, he's remaining silently on the media sidelines.
CORNISH: It's perhaps fitting that Chazelle had to fight to get this movie made. After all, La La Land is ultimately about struggle, packaged in a neon-bright musical.

If you look at the same things every day, if you eat the same things every day, if you hear the same things every day, it can produce some negative psychological effects, Binsted says. The creativity of making food and the way you can use the same set of ingredients in different meals—that those things were very psychologically important to the crew.
CARNEY: I did and I remember the location of it, and I remember the feeling of it, and I remember my age. I was 20, and I was sitting on a bed in the Columbia Hotel, which is a very famous rock 'n' roll hotel in London. And I was in a band and we had a record deal. And I had a - you know, I had a per diem. I had money in my pocket. And I was - you know, really as a young musician in school I had arrived. This was sort of perfect.
The public does not trust big social network and tech companies to prevent their platforms from being misused to present election interference, the poll revealed.
If Ockham could see what physicists are doing here, he'd pray for God to bring reason back to Earth. You should remove unnecessary assumptions, alright.

Democrats are seeking a face-saving way to oppose Gorsuch, knowing they cannot defeat him. But when McConnell announced this week that he intended to get Gorsuch confirmed by the Senate's Easter recess on April 7, that was a clock that forced the Democrats' hand.

PERALTA: Back in December of 2018, the government of Omar al-Bashir was facing a huge budget shortfall, so they cut the subsidies on bread and the price doubled. Sudanese took to the streets to call for his ouster.
MOORE: Right. They pointed specifically to - they used the term cupping under. And I can only assume that that meant, you know, my seat, that there was a little too much definition.

Still, Trump was confident the outcome would change in his favor, despite all evidence pointing to the contrary.
STOPULOUS: It's - yeah. It'll - in time. Yeah.
INSKEEP: Is that a yes or just come and talk?
SMITH: All of the country's money comes from one company - Saudi Aramco. It is almost unimaginably enormous. Estimates put it at around $4 trillion. To give you an idea of how big that is, take Apple, Google, Exxon, Walmart, Citibank and GE. Add them all together, and you are halfway there. And we know almost nothing about Aramco. It's controlled by the royal family, and it's notoriously secretive. But now that Saudi Arabia is desperate for new sources of money, it's floating the idea of selling shares of Aramco. David Ottaway says that would be tricky. If Aramco starts taking shareholders' money, those shareholders will start wanting to know things.

Ahhh, that's a hard one, sighs 53-year-old construction worker, William Celeste. You can go both ways on it, because everybody in the world is going to do some bad, so there's no such thing as somebody doing all good, right?
To no avail in terms of the big newspapers really picking it up like they did Trump. I mean, Trump walks across the street wrong and we have an impeachable offense.
BROOKS: Not much (laughter). You know, it'll winnow the field, but Iowa's become more polarized and more unrepresentative. So I'm - I'm a believer this thing is going to go on till April, May. And so, you know, this'll be a chapter. And it will be a chapter where I suspect - and this is my bold prediction - I can continue my consistency in being wrong - that we will report on Tuesday that Trump and Sanders underperformed. I think that it's just risky having a big part of your support being nonvoters. Nonvoters tend to not vote, and I think that's going to happen.
And that's unfortunate because St. Louis seems to be our Selma, where you've got a handful of business leaders who really control this region. And they control the politics of this region. And that was reminiscent of Selma, where you had five business families that controlled all the businesses in Selma so everything was linked. And until the business community takes some leadership, until the business community has a social conscience and realizes that it has got to take care of the least of these, then, once again, nothing in this region will change unless the business community takes the leadership in changing it.
I think of that as being the most insidious, the worst thing the oil industry has done to our community, McCauley says.

Then she noticed the woman standing at the far side of the bed and clutching a camel-hair coat to her chest. When had she slipped in? The woman's shoulder-length straight hair, a bright, pure blond, was pushed behind her ears uncombed. Her youthful skin was splotchy, her eyes swollen. She wore a blue cashmere twin set that was stretched down on the left side, as if she'd slept in it. Her plaid skirt had twisted so that the zipper was halfway toward the front. Her perfect pearls, glowing with a pinkish sheen, made her appearance even more bedraggled by comparison. She stared at the bed but appeared afraid to take the ten steps that would bring her to the bedside and envelop her in the reek of infection.
And there's a lot more money there than there ever could be in the federal government. And you also get those people vested in the project, so now their income stream is dependent upon that project being successful. And having that done at the local level is going to be so much better.
According to Fatimah Baeshen, a spokesperson at the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington, D.C., the harassment law is part of a broader set of reforms taking place in the country under a program called Vision 2030, which levels the playing field and facilitates the advancements of women.
The Boston Red Sox have won their bid to change the name of the tiny, two-block street outside Fenway Park. Team owners say the change is needed to distance themselves from a history marred by racism under the late, former owner Tom Yawkey, who was known for his philanthropy, but also for his historically racist ball club.
Milwaukee saw a decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 of 41,000 voters. So if a Democratic candidate could invigorate many of those voters who stayed home, that could be decisive. In July, the Democratic National Convention will come to Milwaukee, in part with the hope of energizing some of those voters.
STEIN-SPENCER: If it comes to that point, you would look at alternate staffing measures. And you would look at, you know, triaging. The sickest patients would come to hospital. The other ones would not get an ambulance.
It seems from the amount of social media criticism that appeared in China on Weiboand other other sites after his death, that people saw the specific story of Dr. Li as a symptom of a problem with China's system, of a lack of openness, of a lack of transparency. Does this story reveal a problem with openness and transparency in China?
NPR intern Maya Fitzpatrick contributed to this report.
It's worth considering, then, the low number of women critics who participate in the poll. In its first year, there were none among the 40 participants; in 2019, women critics comprised 10 out of 141 critics total, or 7%, the highest number in the poll's history. By comparison, women are 19% of the voting members of the Jazz Journalists Association, and 16% of those within the organization who specifically identify themselves as jazz writers.
Prof. NELSON: Well, you know, the - there are two major industries that have long compromised the freedom of science inquiry, and that's the tobacco industry and the pharmaceutical industry. I mean, they have the longest histories of essentially, sometimes, suborning whole departments and limiting the research that they do and purchasing testimony.
It's a process of trial and error. You work through the material, you talk to the people. It also helps to live here, which is something I could only do with time. So for instance, in America there's a huge sensitivity around fat. If you say somebody's fat, because there's been a culture of fat-shaming and there's clearly an epidemic, partly because of the food and just because of the lifestyle and so on that this is no longer being seen as a choice thing anymore.

Once the takeover is complete, Whole Foods will retain its own brand and keep its headquarters in Austin, Texas, Amazon says. Co-founder John Mackey will remain as CEO.
Weeks before the first votes of the 2020 presidential election, Americans report a high level of concern about how secure that election will be and worry about the perils of disinformation, according to a new NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll.
In 2010, the college got a loan in order to buy a $10 million headquarters building on more than 30 acres of waterfront land just a mile north of where Bernie Sanders would launch his presidential campaign more than five years later.
Already, presidential candidates are being asked whether they support the idea of a Green New Deal, meaning it's easy to see the issue becoming a litmus test for some voters in both the 2020 congressional elections and the presidential election.
There is something burning inside of him - this dream that he wants to see realized, this music that is so vibrant and yearning to exist outside of him. And everything stands in his way. But when he gets out on a stage, he holds everyone's attention and says, hey. I may have been an outcast and a misfit. And I may feel like I don't belong. But here on this stage, we belong together. I had to demystify him somehow. I thought to myself, here's a young man, immigrated to a country, defied all obstacles to do what he loved. And that was one thing that I could understand. Not to compare myself to him in any way, shape or form, but I am a first-generation American. My family came from Egypt and sought a better life for their children in the U.S. And, you know, obviously, like so many people, they would have loved for us to be doctors and lawyers. My sister is a doctor, so she fulfilled that aspect. But it was very difficult to convince anyone that I wanted to do this and that I could do this.
GREENE: I want to ask you - I mean, there are Bernie Sanders supporters - and you could say the candidate himself - who has talked about the party kind of being against his candidacy. But, you know, I look back to 2016. I mean, you had former DNC chair Donna Brazile writing extensively about these discoveries that the DNC had been financing Hillary Clinton's campaign at the cost of Bernie Sanders in 2016. Can you reassure Sanders supporters that the party is not lining up against him to try and stop him from winning this nomination even if he gets the votes?

Willisch says creating an emotional connection for consumers is what his brand does. For a car company to succeed, it has to capture the feeling and emotion of being on the road.

Trump and Kim are expected to meet with each other one-on-one and to participate in sessions with expanded bilateral delegations, and Trump has now arrived in Vietnam.
NTETA: That was surprising. We actually - I didn't think we would find what we found in terms of the impact of race. But also shocking was the impact of attendance at a Power Five school. So we found, amongst our respondents who attended these Power Five schools, which are just simply schools from conferences that have high-powered college football and college basketball teams, that attendance at this school actually leads to stronger opposition to pay for play.
HALIHAN: Right, so we've had a lot of seismicity that's happened out in rural areas, and the folks in the rural areas don't appreciate it very much.

Well, you know, I'm going to make the case — I'm going to make the case for a fair process. Give Judge Garland a hearing; give him a vote. And look at the qualities of the man. That's what the American people expect. And, you know, one of the most puzzling arguments that I've heard from Mitch McConnell and some other Republicans is this notion that the American people should decide — we should let the American people decide, as part of this election, who gets to fill this seat.

Mr. CHESNUTT: Well, there was a great deal of friction because they were trying to bring in healers and things. And I ended up for a month living with this faith-healer-type person in Tupelo, Mississippi, who tortured me with acupuncture and he didn't know what he was doing. But my parents firmly believed that faith - this guy was a faith healer - could heal me. And I went through with it just because I love my parents but I had zero faith in this guy. You know, the Holy Spirit fixing my spinal cord injury, I had zero faith in that.

God only knows what we gave up, he says. We had 19,000 centrifuges. We reduced them to 6,000. Fordow nuclear facility was our eyes, it was our reputation.

Despite all these good gestures, we see that every single day, the Congress of the United States of America, they are constantly speaking of imposing other sanctions.

GONYEA: After the rally, the cleanup crew stacks the folding chairs. Music still pipes through the sound system. And with Senator Sanders tied up with the impeachment trial in these days before Iowa and New Hampshire, he'll need the people who show up at events like these to reach out to potential backers and to show that the grassroots can turn out the vote, even if the candidate is around a lot less.
Uber's leadership already has a lot on its plate, starting with finding a new CEO after former chief Travis Kalanick resigned abruptly last month. But that's not all the tech giant has to do.

The best known of these alternatives is the many-worlds interpretation of quantum physics, which states that the Schrödinger equation always applies and wave functions never collapse. Instead, the universe continually splits, with every possible outcome of every event occurring somewhere in the multiverse. Another alternative, pilot-wave theory, states that quantum particles are guided in their motions by waves, and that the particles in turn can exert faster-than-light influences on far-distant waves (though this cannot be used to send energy or signals faster than light).
The Green New Deal doesn't even mention some of the usual ideas for addressing climate change, such as a carbon tax or cap-and-trade program. Instead, it calls for lots of spending to create, among other things, infrastructure and transport that don't rely on fossil fuels.
Mr. KRAUSS: Well, I mean, all right, your question went in different directions than I thought it would. I think the answer is no to that particular part. I think - I mean what we're measuring things we can see here now. We're measuring the acceleration of galaxies away from us. We're watching them speed up. And so we're seeing things in our universe. But what it does point out to me - and I think this is really - maybe we should be humble. Because one of the things we've recently discovered, which I think is fascinating is that in the far future - because these dark energies persist, than astronomers in the far future will come up with a picture of the universe which is completely wrong. There every bit of the evidence will suggest they live in a static, empty universe, exactly the universe we thought we lived in the 1900.
VIET THANH NGUYEN: Well, when my agent told me I should write a novel, the first thing that came to me was a spy novel and partly it was because it's a genre that I really enjoy and I wanted to write a novel that was actually entertaining, that people would actually want to read because I knew that I would also be dealing with a lot of very serious political and literary matters. And then the other inspiration for that was that there really were spies in South Vietnam that rose to the very highest ranks of the South Vietnamese bureaucracy and military.
The seven Somali women Adawe interviewed for her study reported mixing several different creams into one concoction and storing it in the refrigerator.

The group will work as an independent partner with NPR's management, HR and Legal departments, as appropriate, to make sure NPR staff are getting the right support and follow-up when misconduct has been reported.
FLATOW: Gentlemen, feel free to jump in at any point if you want to add something. Hey, I'm struck by what you said about the dark - the holy grail now is the dark energy because just a few years ago, we talked about uniting the forces of nature as the holy grail, you know, uniting gravity with the other forces, and that's sort of gone into the background, Michael, and it sort of faded a bit.

No, no one financed it. I did it myself. No one paid for my trips. No one paid for my lodging. By that, I mean, first of all, I didn't charge the president for a very special reason. I didn't want people to think that I was doing this for the huge amounts of money that lawyers make when they represent people. And I couldn't do it, he's a friend of mine. And number three, I felt from the very beginning he's being framed. Some of the trips would be paid for, but they'd be paid for more in the context of I was going for two other clients to do something. I do have other businesses.

KATHRINE SWITZER: Thank you very much. It's wonderful to be with you.
On today's show, we head to some of the cheating-est places on earth to bring you tales from some of the roughest, toughest tax collectors around. These tax collectors have tricks and mind-games that they play to get people to do the right thing.
SWITZER: Absolutely. You know, it was amazing. You'll never be - ever have children, they said. You're going to get big legs. You're going to grow hair on your chest. It was hilarious, the myths. And, of course, when people hear myths, they believe them because to try otherwise might mean damaging yourself. So people were afraid and they just went about their lives that way and restricted themselves.
A new report from the Southern Poverty Law Center says the number of hate groups in the U.S. increased for a second year in a row with a growing number of right wing extremists operating in cyberspace.

RUSSAKOFF: I think it's almost like the difference between FedEx and the post office. The district schools have a lot of legacy costs, and some of those are just extra jobs and incredibly sweet, fat contracts that, you know, people who were friends of politicians over the years have gotten. And there needs to be some kind of - almost a forensic accounting of where the money in the central office of the school district is going so that more of it gets to the classroom. And I think that charter schools are just an illustration of what that money could be doing if it were spent differently. The problem is, of course, that, you know, you run up into, you know, union protections and civil service protections and political organizations that have a real stake in keeping things the way they are. So it probably sounds naive to say that that needs to happen, but if it doesn't happen, I don't see what the future of school districts is in cities like Newark.
MOORE: Yeah, I did. But I was seldom alone except when I moved to New York. And then I was alone, and then my drinking really escalated. And I found myself not going out after 5 o'clock and making sure that everything was set up for me to have my dinner there on the bed that was by the air conditioner, that was near the phone, that was near the television set. And that I had my blender full of drinks that I was concocting in an attempt to do something worthwhile in the kitchen. It was a pretty sad lady that was emerging.

GUNTON: Yeah. But then what would they then - would the lion turn on you? Would the hyenas turn on you? Also, you have to take a kind of a judgment call that you're interfering with what is, you know, the rhythms of life, if you like. He had made a mistake. And that was what was going to happen. And I think if you'd intervened in that way, I think you'd - I think it would be a very difficult thing to justify. It's heartbreaking.

At least he would try to get some sleep; he felt so jazzed up he doubted he'd be able to.

Various Democratic presidential hopefuls are getting behind an idea long thought to be on the outer edge of progressive politics - so-called Medicare-for-all. Senator Kamala Harris endorsed the idea the other night in a CNN town hall. She also suggested getting rid of all private insurance.
Other Medicare beneficiaries have made similar mistakes by assuming they didn't need Part B if they had a marketplace plan, or retiree coverage from a former employer, or health coverage through the Department of Veterans Affairs, or via a current employer with fewer than 20 workers. Beneficiaries didn't realize that none of these is a substitute for Medicare Part B.

I'm learning. I think that really what I hope we're able to do as a party and as a nation is rediscover the power of public imagination. I think that this is a very special moment and frankly that is something that that I think the President did do. In that he was able to take his profile and say here's this hugely impossible thing that seems ridiculous but I'm going to seriously push for it. And for him that's his wall. And obviously I'm diametrically opposed to it but I think that the reason he's so attached to this thing despite the fact that it's not what voters want, despite the fact that it's not what the American people want, is that it's the only vision he has. He has no other picture of America except an America with a huge wall on the southern border. And I think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what is another America looks like.

Why China Supports New Sanctions Against North Korea
SNELL: You know, this last Senate seat really does change everything if Ossoff wins. There is a 50-50 Senate. And Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would break any tie. His win would mean Democrats control which bills get a vote, which committees consider things, basically how the Senate operates entirely. It's a significant power. But it also puts a lot of pressure on ideological divides within the Democratic Party. You know, moderate Democrats have shown a willingness to work across the aisle. And a narrow split could favor them. But progressives have a long list of priorities if Democrats were to recapture full control in Washington.

I coach soccer here, and I educate young Americans and people from other countries here, too. You know, every time I speak with them, I tell words like dream, work hard and you're going to succeed. If you do the right thing, you're going to get a reward in the end.

During those three years, the majority of jazz recordings ranked in the poll included no women musicians at all among their core personnel: 67% in 2017, 65% in 2018 and 58% in 2019. We can also slice the data a different way, by totaling the core band members for each project and counting the number of women among them: Women comprised only 11% of all core personnel in 2017, 13% in 2018 and 16% in 2019.

Beth McGee of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation says that within the Chesapeake watershed, Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania have state protections in place for isolated wetlands, but D.C. and Delaware do not.

MARK (Caller): Yes, hello. How are you?
There's nobody who would suggest that our founders anticipated that a new rule is read into the Supreme Court nomination process in which for an entire year, we don't do that because there's an election going on. George Washington nominated a couple of Supreme Court justices in his last year. And obviously George Washington had better poll numbers, I'm sure, than I did, but nevertheless if you care about original intent, I think, you know, you don't want to see this becoming — degenerating into just a pure political battle.
In the run-up to Tuesday's New York primary, Clinton and Sanders have been engaged in multiple battles — over who's more New York, who's more qualified, and who can make the most change.

The 47-year-old coach has been coordinating the state's only standalone wrestling tournament for girls since 2012. Bailey wants to see more girls involved in the sport, and says that parents can often be reluctant to have their daughters wrestling boys. She also thinks that girls have a better chance at long-term wrestling success — like making it to the Women's National Championships — if they're able to compete against each other at a young age instead of having to compete against boys. Some [girls] will never know how good they would have been had they been wrestling their female peers, Bailey said.

GARCETTI: No, it's much more. This is about making sure that our economy thrives for everybody and that we all have opportunities, especially here in Los Angeles in our trademark industry - that it shouldn't matter your zip code, your cultural background when it comes to telling your story and having access to the industry that greenlights or doesn't the stories of this country and, in many cases, this world. While Latinos are more than a quarter of U.S. box office, we're between 1 and 6% of the folks that are making decisions and making the movies and television shows here in Hollywood. And so what can we do not just to give lip service or a few unpaid internships that go nowhere, but really steadily get Latinos into Hollywood in positions where they can tell the stories of America through their eyes?

It was John Wheeler who had mentioned that - his idea was that the reason the universe exists is because we are here to observe it. It needs the process of observation to create the objects in the quantum world.

And he would absolutely deny it to the bitter end. He said the complexity and the nuance and the emotion that those animals show was, you know, we did our best to show as much of that as we can in the film, but it's - you never can perhaps - you can never completely reflect the realities of that.

Since the 1980s, for example, every time the presidency has changed parties, one of the incoming president's first actions has been to issue an executive order to either reimpose or eliminate the Mexico City Policy that governs funding for international family planning organizations that perform or promote abortion. Why do new administrations address abortion so quickly? Because the anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court abortion decision Roe v. Wade is two days after Inauguration Day, so the action is always politically timely.
People ... feel that their rights are being infringed upon
SHAPIRO: You're talking about limiting global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius.

ISABEL CHANG: You know, Hong Kong's the only place in China that we have the freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, you know, to express our woe. But not much people are exercising that, yeah, so I'm a little bit disappointed.
Before - when the president was about to give the address - even before that, Speaker Pelosi put out a statement. And she said that Democrats want stronger, more effective border security. Two of the bullet point she included, which was more immigration judges to deal with the backlog and also basically allowing for counternarcotics technology. Those are two elements that are included in the president's proposal.
RICHEN: Yeah. I mean, it's pretty incredible, right? He did this all before computers. He was kind of the - one of the original crowd-sourcers. He had his network of black postal workers. And that was one of the industries, of course, where African-Americans could break into, the Postal Service. And he had a network of black postal workers who he would get information from. So you know, where are the black businesses? Where are the black communities? Let me know.
I have no idea why did it. I have no idea why he did it. Or he may have not talked directly to Zlochevsky. And that was Zlochevsky's motive. And that's why the money came to him. The important thing is when push came to shove in February of 2016, which is a month that should be studied in great detail because it's the key month, the prosecutor who they said was dormant, corrupt, wasn't investing any case — arrested Burisma. So to say the case was inactive is not only a lie, it's proven as a lie from the record. So [Ukraine's top prosecutor, Viktor] Shokin issued a warrant of arrest for the company Burisma that substantially interfered with his business. Should Zlochevsky come back to Ukraine he'd be arrested immediately. And the business was effectively shut down. It is not a coincidence that in that month, Joe Biden called Poroshenko four times. Never called him four times before. And it's in that month that he got Shokin fired. The deal was: protect my company, protect me, protect your son. When push comes to shove if you have to. The push came to shove in February of 2016. On February 2, 2016, the prosecutor — who was said to be doing nothing, the case was dormant, the charges have been debunked — the prosecutor issued an arrest warrant based on substantial facts that Burisma had been laundering billions and billions of dollars. Some of it to Hunter Biden.
The experiments use something called the wave-particle duality of light and of matter, the fact that the physical nature of quantum objects is undetermined until it is measured. In other words, this means that a particle of light, or of matter, can behave either as a wave (spreading out in space, showing interference) or as a particle (staying together as a small bundle) depending on the measuring apparatus. Long and ongoing discussions about the nature of quantum physics are still trying to work out what this actually means. Do our minds determine the nature of physical reality? The interested reader can see what I wrote about this in more detail in The Island of Knowledge: The Limits of Science and the Search for Meaning.
CHANG: So, Mara, I just want to get sort of a personal response from you because you have covered politics for such a long time. Tell me just what has been going through your mind as you've been reacting to the events of today.

Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, who's a candidate for the 2020 presidential election, has endorsed Medicare for all. But the details of what that means are rather elusive.
Trump administration officials say the approach adds incentive for the state to save money, unlike the current system, in which increased state spending is matched with more federal dollars. If Medicaid enrollment grows, the state can secure additional federal funding. If enrollment drops, it will get less money.
But figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to Congresswoman Ocasio-Cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. And deficit spending - obviously something that Democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of Republicans on in some of their tax cuts.

Well, I think there's some reality to that notion that these lectures are lectures. And if you look at a Khan Academy video, they're these kind of traditional chalk-talk explanations. What's different is how someone consumes, or the attitude. You know, if you go to a traditional lecture hall, it's pushed onto you. While a Khan Academy-like video, you only watch it if you need to watch it. You're like, Hey, wait. I don't quite get that. Let me go get a 10-minute explanation, and now I want to learn the next thing. So when you have lectures on demand, it really just kind of takes them off the table. They're there and they are useful sometimes, and then it allows you to work at your own time and pace, and you only watch the videos if you want an on-demand explanation.
This latest iteration is different both in the political energy that it has amassed and the grand scope it is taking. While it was a product of the progressive activist community, Ocasio-Cortez has been perhaps the most visible proponent of the plan and has helped it gain nationwide attention.

I think it's absolutely appropriate to talk about the racial disparities that are so crucial and so obvious. Mostly peaceful demonstrations, not just this summer, but over the last six years, calling for fundamental rethinking of our use of police and the status of African-Americans in our society have been met with very high levels of police violence, massive restrictions, criminal investigations, the labeling their movements as black identity extremists by federal law enforcement. The posture of police towards their demonstrations is entirely different. Cori Bush, a member of Congress newly elected from St. Louis, said if there had been Black and brown people pushing through police lines, running up the Capitol steps, people would have been shot down and at the very least, tear gassed and beaten. And I think that's absolutely correct.

#3 Think about the present. Sensitive periods and snowballs are important because they're investments in the future. By timing things just right, some future reward will be greater.

Skills like emotion regulation, for example, may or may not involve sensitive periods or snowball over time (perhaps there's research that can tell us).

So the skill, I think, of the crews out there - and they're all fantastic natural historians, biologists, in their own right - is just constantly gauging that proximity barrier, if you like. Now, some of this is done on telephoto lenses.

Like, you're cool, but the yellow shirt up there at the door - he doesn't know, or he's not going to assume. I have no bag, no receipt. I'm just walking out with something in my hand. That concept is so foreign to me as a minority and having been harassed and followed around stores before and suspected of shoplifting.

Now some genderqueer people are taking they into new grammatical territory, using it for alternative genders exactly the way you'd use a personal pronoun like he or she. So you could say, Pat shrugged their shoulders, or Ronnie bit off more than they could chew. That's the usage that the American Dialect Society was focusing on when they made they their word of the year. It takes quite a bit of getting used to, and it's launched a whole new conversation. But that's the advantage of having a messy pronoun system like ours — in every era we have to thrash things over again.
Massive may be in the eye of the beholder here. The U.S. ran a trade deficit of around $65 billion with Germany in 2016. That's substantial — around one-eleventh of the total U.S. trade deficit — but it's not gargantuan. The U.S. deficit with China, by comparison, was $347 billion in that year. And the total U.S. trade deficit was around $734 billion.

To change the culture regarding masks or any other public health intervention, the U.S. needs to issue consistent messages from many different levels of government, says Ross Brownson, professor of Public Health at Washington University in St. Louis. He researched how research is translated into evidence-based policies.
So we believe that pay for play is very similar. If you just look at the percentage of African-American men in college basketball and college football, they far outdistance any other group. The picture in your head when you come to think about pay for play in terms of who will benefit if there's a change to the policy are going to be young African-American men. So for some whites, this is a subliminal connection. They're not aware. It's implicit. And for others, it's more explicit. They don't want African-Americans to benefit financially in this sense, and they use those attitudes to sort of frame, or structure, their opinion on pay for play.
Housing economists say part of that is likely due to the fact that prices are just now on average returning to their pre-crash peaks (in nominal, or non-inflation-adjusted, terms). That means that in many parts of the country people don't have any or much equity in their house if they bought during the bubble or used up their equity with a home equity loan back then.
Fifty-one percent of the drugs with copay coupons had no substitute at all, or only another brand drug as a close therapeutic substitute, the analysis found.

Let's get started. Abruptly he turned away and walked into the hospital room. Tia followed with the vial of brownish yellow powder. Claire experienced a satisfying sense that both Dr. Stantons had forgotten her. At the long counter along the wall, the two had a quiet discussion and checked the information in Stanton's binder.
ALDA: Yeah, Sky Masterson. And I was out in the opening scene. And I didn't - I couldn't even afford my own suit. So they loaned me a suit that had been hanging on a rack for six months someplace. And I kept my hands in my pockets because they were shaking so hard. And I started - I was so nervous I was playing with a piece of lint in my pocket. And, you know, I'm out there on stage playing the scene with the mission doll. So I - halfway through the scene, I take my hand out of my pocket with the lint in it. And I - you know, I casually look down at the lint, and it's not lint. It's a cockroach.

A video released by Romanian police shows surveillance video from 2012 of a similar night raid on a truck that gives an indication of how it might have gone down (if in fact it isn't the work of the very same gang). The footage shows a van pulling up behind a truck, someone getting out and opening the truck's doors. In the video, the thieves apparently change their minds and break off the heist.
OTIS: Well, Lulu, Juan Guaido is not calling for further efforts to get the supplies into Venezuela today. He's not telling people to go back and protest and try to force the aid in. There were hundreds of people who were injured yesterday. And people came away really quite demoralized about what happened. You know, it kind of seems like Juan Guaido and the opposition lost yesterday's aid battle. But again, the optics were really bad for the Maduro government. It's not often that you see aid trucks being set on fire when they're trying to get into a country where there are chronic shortages of food and medicine.
But the audio recording of the hourlong call details that Raffensperger and representatives of the secretary of state's office continued to patiently knock down some of the more inflammatory claims made by Trump and other top Republicans who allege hundreds of thousands of votes were illegally counted.

GARCETTI: No. I mean, we'd love to see people making commitments to numerical goals and art. We certainly have one, which is to double the number of Latinos that are in Hollywood as creators and developers. But we have our first five deals. We didn't want to just say, hey, go do this and pound people over the head. There's a finance development deal of a feature script with Endeavor Content. Warner Media's 150 has a scripted proof concept deal. Shine Global, a company here, has a development deal that they committed to for a documentary. And we will just continue making deals. Hollywood's all about making deals. We felt that by collaborating and convening and cajoling that government could play a really positive role in making this industry even stronger and, of course, more representative.

Saving Assad from defeat and perhaps making him impervious to demands that he step aside are no small feats, Fred Hof, who follows Syria at the Atlantic Council, said of the Russian intervention.
Actually, of course, in the last year or two we are seeing a retrograde movement away from globalist thinking and into more nationalist and isolationist thinking, and this is very dangerous. I mean, traditionally, people said that nationalism is dangerous because it leads to war. But now nationalism is far more dangerous because not only it leads to war, it also may prevent us from having any effective answer that can help us cope with dangers like the rise of artificial intelligence or the implications of bioengineering.

COBB: I think that we've seen - this is anecdotal. I don't know that there are hard numbers around it. But this seems to be a boomerang dynamic where once people become aware that there are attempts to ward them away from the polling places, it really does incense them. And it makes people more likely to come out and vote.

Remember how it was being distributed. It was being distributed by a white-owned business. So it wasn't going to be too political in its pages. But it did have - I mean, the way...
NPR Justice Correspondent Ryan Lucas: I do. I do have a couple. You say that people like Shokin had their visas denied, other folks from Ukraine had their visas denied, you say that the evidence is overwhelming that Biden was engaged in corruption in Ukraine. Attorney General Barr is someone who you know. You're friends with the president, you're the president's personal attorney. Have you delivered the report that you said you were going to to the Justice Department. And if there is so much evidence, why hasn't the DOJ opened an investigation into Biden's alleged corruption?
Some of the more stinging U.S. moves included the ouster of democratically elected governments in Guatemala in 1954, in Brazil a decade later and in Chile in 1973.

And it also meant that there was competition for those African-American dollars. And with that competition, you also need money in order to have your place meet certain standards or to have it, you know, be able to compete against the Holiday Inn or what have you. And that was a challenge for black businesses. You know, we had these businesses. And we're entrepreneurs, but we didn't necessarily have the economic support from the banks, for example, that could help us maintain these businesses. So what you find is that after the passage of the Civil Rights Act, many of these businesses started to close.

If you should trust it, if there's reason to believe as whole, it's telling you what you think it's telling you.

That doesn't mean that effect couldn't be documented in the future, it just means the existing evidence for it doesn't have the value that you wish it.

And there's an Irish word in the film, meitheals, which means when neighbors come together to help each other accomplish a task like reroofing a barn, for example, in the village.

The questions Holmström and his co-authors considered are concrete ones: How do you reward CEOs for improving a company's performance, without just showering them with money when the company is thriving because of luck? How do you evaluate teachers' performance without encouraging them to teach to a test?

How can a team be rewarded for effort without incentivizing free-loaders to slack off and profit off their colleagues' work?

But they are being pressed hard by liberal groups and their base to do the impossible — stop Gorsuch. The task is impossible because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has made clear that if there is a filibuster, Republicans will change the Senate rules, just as the Democrats did for lower court judges in 2013 when they were in the majority.
But instead, the front-runners ran roughshod across the landscape. Cruz finished a weak third with scarcely 1 vote in 7, earning zero delegates. New York Republicans preferred Ohio governor John Kasich, who got 1 vote in 4 statewide and gained perhaps three or more delegates (his first since he won his home state a month earlier).

Some passengers expressed frustration over what they described as a lack of communication from Amtrak. They said they had no idea about when the train might move again, with many people missing days of school and work.
Congress certified President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris' victory early on Thursday, the end of a long day and night marked by chaos and violence in Washington, D.C. Extremists emboldened by President Trump had sought to thwart the peaceful transfer of power that has been a hallmark of modern American history by staging a violent insurrection inside the U.S. Capitol.
People are scared, said Masood. They don't want to get into this. They think that it is for the state to take responsibility. But the state, for the same reason as individuals, tries to avoid it. I think the state, civil society, the media, the judiciary - everyone - has to play a role in order to try to reverse this.
We need to be asking ourselves hard questions as a state as to whether a settlement in bankruptcy might be better than something we get through this gas sale, warns Wara, the Stanford researcher.

The urgency and desperation we've heard from workers is at a pitch I haven't experienced before in 20 years of this work, said Cass Gualvez, organizing director for Service Employees International Union-United Healthcare Workers West in California.

Democrats have expressed frustration with Gorsuch's testimony before the Judiciary Committee, in which he sidestepped most of their questions aimed at getting a sense of how he might rule on the high court. Many are also still angry that President Obama's nominee for the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia's death, Judge Merrick Garland, was never given a hearing by Republicans.
He also said that he had received a threatening letter using racist and homophobic language a week earlier — though police now say that, too, was falsified in an attempt to gain attention. When that didn't work, Johnson explained, Smollett paid $3,500 to stage this attack and drag Chicago's reputation through the mud.
I hope [Republicans] can look themselves in the mirror and say, 'Was this really worth it?'  said Josh Douglas, an election law professor at the University of Kentucky. They should have known better.

Pennsylvania's swing state status was cemented in 2016 when Donald Trump eked out a win by 1% of the vote. Before his victory, George H.W. Bush was the last Republican president to win the commonwealth, though Pennsylvania has still been considered enough of a battleground in most elections for GOP presidential candidates to spend time and money here.
One particular area of focus will be election security. It's an area that plays to our strengths, and the strengths of member stations, and we have people in states who can look at this and cover it, Turpin said, adding, that it feels very true to our mission to be looking at the safety and security of our election process. That has a kind of public service mission to it.

Now, what we know about it is that based on modeling, it looks to be more transmissible, and it looks to cause a bit of a higher viral load, meaning that when you cough this variant, you may be expelling more of the virus, which could be the way that it's more transmissible. Now, there's no evidence it's more deadly, or that it's resistant to our vaccines, or that it's resistant to our treatments. But the fact that it could spread more quickly and that this is a potentially deadly virus is cause for concern. The fact that it could go through a community more quickly is enough to get all of us to pay very close attention to it.

How Biden decides to proceed with Iran will depend in part on his other priorities, as well as the views of U.S. allies. During the presidential campaign and transition, Biden and his aides indicated a desire to bolster the verification provisions of the nuclear deal and extend the duration of its physical restrictions. They have also expressed an intention to conduct broader, regional negotiations. All of these steps will require painstaking multilateral diplomacy. Ultimately, Biden should not feel rushed for these critical negotiations — and he should leverage his sanctions inheritance to advance these objectives.

According to Democrats, multiple potential witnesses have firsthand accounts of what they say is a quid pro quo scheme with Ukraine that forms the basis of the two impeachment charges that Trump is facing.

For example, the prosecution claimed that it struck Marilyn Garrett because she was divorced, and at age 34 was too young to serve in a case involving an 18-year-old defendant. But three out of four divorced white prospective jurors were allowed to serve, as were eight white jurors under the age of 36.
REUSS: No, nobody ever mentioned the Violence Against Women Act.
But Comey was part of separate stream, one that may matter more, at least to historians sifting back through the evidence. Comey kicked off a series of tell-alls that would come to include quite a few insiders. Early on there was Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey who had run against Trump in 2015 but jumped aboard the bandwagon as the primaries began. Christie was still steaming over having his extensive transition plan consigned to the dumpster when he himself was denied a White House job. (It turns out the West Wing wasn't big enough for him and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose father Christie had prosecuted in federal court years earlier.)
BRYANT: Well, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that, again, this goes back to something that you and I talk about quite often on this show - is that the game is hard. And I think you have to appreciate the game is. And I think after the last couple years, people look at the Chicago Cubs, and they started using the D word. D for dynasty. And it doesn't work that way. I think that once the Cubs won that championship last year, everything was going to change for them.
Undoing a previous administration's actions in a new administration is an exercise in trying to push many things through a very narrow tube in a short time. Department regulations have to go not just through the leadership in each department, but also through the Office of Management and Budget for a technical review, cost-benefit analysis and legal authority, said Bagley. That can take time.
Many workers say employers and government systems that are meant to protect them have failed.
Last year, this northeastern state of Pernanbuco lost 89,500 jobs, the most in the country. It's been a devastating turnaround for this historically poor region.
For decades, oil helped the Saudi royal family keep a compact with the population: Saudis would be taken care of — free health care and education through college, cheap utilities and gasoline, often a government job, and, until recently, no taxes. In return, they did not challenge the royal family's absolute rule.
Eventually, he faded off to sleep. And his breathing slowed down and eventually got a little ragged. And he had a couple moments where he took some really jerky, deep breaths. And he died. His heart stopped, and he passed away. But he did so with so much love around him. And I think that's really one of the key differences with a traditional death by a terminal illness, as opposed to choosing physician-assisted suicide - is that the person is in an uncontrollable environment. But yet this gives them some control. And we all die. We all have to die. And if you go out surrounded by friends and laughter and love and tears, I think that's not a bad way to go. I mean, there's certainly much worse ways to die.
Ten years is an unusually long time for a federally granted waiver of its rules, but the Trump administration has approved other long-term experiments in recent years to give states more flexibility.
Several organizations have stripped Sutton of awards. Auburn University had awarded him and his deceased wife Jean Sutton its Distinguished Alabama Community Journalist Award in 2009 – now, an Auburn official said that it has withdrawn Sutton's award and only recognizes Jean Sutton.

They were very, very conservative. Libertarian. If I wanted to use a prejudicial word I would probably say they were reactionary, says Nick Patterson, who helped hire Mercer at Renaissance in 1993 and is now a senior computational biologist at the Broad Institute.
This use of they has been around for a long time. It shows up in Shakespeare, Dickens and George Bernard Shaw. Jane Austen was always saying things like everybody has their failing. But the Victorian grammarians made it a matter of schoolroom dogma that one could only say Everybody has his failing, with the understanding that he stood in for both sexes. As their slogan had it, the masculine embraces the feminine.
But then his meaning got muddier. Anchor Becky Quick asked him twice if he really meant he wanted to renegotiate debt. On his second answer, he seemed to change positions:

A separate photo, showing five women wearing t-shirts calling for freedom for her and four other jailed activists, was published in September in Teen Vogue, along with an op-ed by Jamal and other group members. The women write that these activists are the real trailblazers behind the overturned [driving] ban and demand their release.

And they had amazing entertainers who were there - Sarah Vaughan, Louis Armstrong, Diahann Carroll. All the entertainers would come to Idlewild, and it was a safe haven. That's what - how everybody described it. It was a safe haven where African-Americans could go and go into the lake and own property and have friends and reunite and really have a community. And it's still there. Idlewild is still there. They are folks who are trying to redevelop some of the buildings, who've bought property there. They have events there. It's really a beautiful place.

The reasons women don't participate may be more complex. They certainly face barriers to fully participating in jazz criticism as a male-dominated field, to getting work where male editors are gatekeepers and establishing themselves as experts. They may be more reluctant to express their authority, to be seen as taking up valuable space, or to subject themselves to public scrutiny for championing artists who matter to them, specifically female artists — factors that all six of the authors of this study would like to acknowledge. Women may also feel disinclined to operate in spaces where their male colleagues' criticism of women's work as musicians seems so clearly gendered: in which women musicians may receive less press coverage; they are objectified by physical descriptions and their music is evaluated on traits that are thought of as gendered (where playing harder, faster, louder and more sophisticated music is gendered male).

And residents had few options of where to shop — or where to live. In 1928, the city of Austin approved a plan to cut off basic services to black residents unless they lived in east Austin. So, this area became a bustling black neighborhood, and remained that way for the next 60 years.

Beckerman of the Internet Association describes Section 230 as not a blanket amnesty but a call for responsible policing of platforms.

This expensive strategy was a haphazard approach to deal with rising homelessness in New York City, which has reached the highest levels since the Great Depression. According to the Coalition for the Homeless, there were nearly 63,000 people sleeping in the city's shelter system each night in March of this year.
But then, there's a related problem: Often when new jobs do pop up, they're not near the people who need those jobs, Bown pointed out. There's a related problem in the energy sector, as NPR's Domenico Montanaro wrote last week: The lion's share of the nation's new solar jobs aren't exactly in coal country. That means there could be some sort of way to help people relocate to where the jobs are, Bown added.

SIEGEL: I think, months ago, we all expected that, on the eve of the Iowa caucuses, we'd be talking about Hillary Clinton. I don't think we expected we'd be talking about Bernie Sanders. So the question is, what do we make of this phenomenon? David, what do you make of Sanders?
Ivo Van Hove is directing the stage show. He says he first saw Network in a Belgian movie theater when he was a young man. My memory of it is that it felt like science fiction, he says. Something which was impossible, which could never ever happen. When I read the script, now a few years ago, I thought well, this is the world that we live in today. So this was also the challenge, of course, how to make this work that was a little bit of a parody in its time — how to turn it into a tragedy.
GROSS: How do you do that?
The president — well, the president always makes the decisions based on the information that he gets. We had been talking about — when I first learned about it, I didn't tell the president right away because it was hearsay. And in fact, when I first heard about Biden, I didn't believe it. My first expression was, I don't know if I said bull, but I said, can't be. I've known Joe for a long time.

That changed. Coaches like Reeve benefited from the WNBA's link to the NBA. Even though not all WNBA teams are affiliated with NBA teams, the coaches talk to each other.
GREENE: Now, passage of the bill was swiftly followed by economic repercussions. Entertainers like Bruce Springsteen and Cirque du Soleil canceled shows in the state. Corporations from PayPal to the NBA canceled or are reconsidering projects there.
SWITZER: Well, I entered the race simply because my coach had been a 15-time Boston Marathon runner. And he didn't believe a woman could do it, but he loved running with me and telling me stories about the Boston Marathon. So he energized me. And, you know, when I told him that I really wanted to try and he said he didn't believe a woman could do it, I was bound and determined to prove him wrong.
AUBREY: The president kind of downplayed it. Some say he downplayed it, calling it voluntary, saying do it if you want to. And a federal official told me last night that the White House kind of leaned on the CDC to emphasize that this recommendation is especially aimed at people living in hot spot areas where there are a lot of cases. But the CDC, this source tells me, really wanted to encourage all Americans everywhere to follow the guidance because it's not just a few hot spots. So at this point, staying socially distant, obviously, and covering your face when you must go out into a crowded space could benefit all of us.

LIASSON: ...Gave him something but not very much and, certainly, not as much as he wanted. And he is kind of all over the place. He won but he's not happy. The wall's being built, but he has to declare a national emergency to build it. You know, the interesting thing is this is often put into the context of he is keeping a campaign promise. But what people forget is during the 2016 campaign, he signed something called the Contract with the American Voter, where he pledged that he would obtain reimbursement from Mexico for the full cost of the wall. So he's actually breaking a campaign promise.
Biden will flip this logic. The president-elect has outlined concrete diplomatic objectives concerning Iran — including reaffirming the importance of the 2015 nuclear agreement. The nuclear deal, signed by Iran and six world powers, imposed limits on Iran's nuclear program in exchange for international sanctions relief. Biden and his team, which played key roles in securing that agreement when he was vice president, have proved they can negotiate in good faith and keep their word. By taking a more realistic approach, Biden can unlock the power of the leverage Trump accumulated.
When asked if the WNBA, even though it's supported by the wildly wealthy NBA, ever worried about survival during its 20 years, longtime executive Renee Brown bristles a bit.
Manzoor: There is. It's this expectation that a woman is supposed to be pure, untouched, so that she's worthy of a man. That being why a woman is worthy, to me, it just diminishes us as human beings. So whether it's being covered in a veil or whether it's wearing a white dress because you're saying My virginity is the most important thing about me, that's oppressive, just inherently.
MARTIN: Well, I was going to ask you about that. I mean, how should we think about the fact that there are - at least a couple of states have reported cases of this new strain? And so far as we know - because we know that people have had a hard time with contact tracing - but so far as we know, the individuals weren't traveling, didn't have contact with folks who were in places where we knew this new strain had developed. I mean, how should we think about that?

What Latinos Want From Immigration Reform
No one has asked for my records. I have offered through my lawyers to sit down with them anytime they want.

Guaidó, the 35-year-old recently elected head of Venezuela's National Assembly, took the oath of office on an outdoor podium in Caracas, flanked by yellow, blue and red Venezuelan flags. He raised his right hand as a crowd erupted in cheers. He promised to serve as interim leader and call for general elections.
Again, I have found out in this investigation, so I think I've been pretty objective about it. You never are completely when you're investigating, but I've turned down a lot of evidence. I've proven some things not to be true, or I believe not to be true. I don't think the idea that, you know, there was this whole idea that the Ukrainians did the hacking, not the Russians. I think I can pretty much disprove that.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman would like to have the power to prosecute any people the president may pardon. And so last week, he proposed to change the state's laws so that anyone pardoned will not be protected from being brought to court in New York. Schneiderman and President Trump have had business before. The New York AG led the investigation into Trump University. That resulted in a $25 million settlement. Trump, for his part, has called Mr. Schneiderman, quote, the nation's worst AG. But the proposal is complicated. And here to break it down for us - we're joined by former U.S. Attorney of Alabama Joyce Vance. Welcome.

I also like Nosek's advice because it isn't restricted to science. Striving to be less wrong — rather than more right — could be a beneficial way to construe our aims across a variety of contexts, whether it's a marital dispute or a business decision. I may be wrong about who did the dishes last night, or about which stock is the best investment; if I begin from the assumption that I'm fallible and striving to be less wrong, a challenge may not feel so threatening.

SHAPIRO: So how did you hear about this?
Just 76 percent of Trump supporters, 69 percent of Republicans and 58 percent of white evangelicals say they will definitely vote for him. Many, if not most, of them will likely vote for the president, but their softness in supporting him for re-election is a sign of vulnerability.

This is FRESH AIR. We'll conclude today's edition of our 30th anniversary retrospective with a 1988 interview that has become an obituary. Tobe Hooper, who's best known as the writer and director of the 1974 film The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, died last Saturday. He was 74. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre was so gruesome, it helped inspire a wave of slasher films, but it was also so interestingly made that it was added to the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.
Money deposited in HSAs is tax-deductible, grows tax-free and can be used without owing tax to pay for medical expenses. Advocates promote the plans as a way to help consumers play a larger role in controlling their health spending, and say that the tax advantages help people afford care.

But ignoring the new limit could create headaches for people who have already made the maximum HSA contribution for the year based on the $6,900 figure, says Roy Ramthun, president of HSA Consulting Services. If you don't ask the bank that handles your HSA to return the $50 plus any earnings that have accrued before the next tax season, your taxable income will be off by that amount, plus you'll be on the hook for a 6 percent penalty for exceeding the maximum contribution allowed.

Third, Tehran continues to bolster its forces and lash out in the region, a not-so-subtle reminder to Biden about its capability to cause trouble. Washington noted with increasing concern last week that Iranian-backed forces were planning to attack U.S. soldiers based in Iraq to mark the anniversary of the assassination of Iranian Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani. (Foreign Minister Javad Zarif responded with the bizarre suggestion that Israeli agent-provocateurs are plotting attacks against Americans in Iraq.)

But what he, in the end, does, which, I think, is - he always had this one particular friend who supported him. But just the two of them together weren't strong enough.
The move — to hold a rally in a battleground state and miss the annual dinner known for glitzy elbow-rubbing between Washington journalists and Hollywood celebrities — seemed designed to thumb the presidential nose at the Washington press corps, with whom Trump continues to have a tense relationship, while also highlighting Trump's accomplishments on his 100th day in the Oval Office.

DICKINSON: In the 1930s and '40s, authors J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis were members of a literary society called The Inklings. The two fantasy writers were friends and rivals. This week, we find out just how petty their rivalry really was. Scholars at the British Museum have released correspondence between the two men fighting not over a woman or a cricket score but a pixie named Tinkle (ph). Tinkle was pink with a rosebud mouth, gossamer wings and a puckish air. And both men claimed her as a character in their novels. She is my Tinkle, my pickled, tinky (ph) wink, Lewis fumed in a letter. Tolkien replied, I conjured her. I brought her forth from the midst of my own fertile brain grapes, you moss-covered carbuncle. And lo, it came to pass. Neither author wrote of Tinkle the Pixie. However, the letters have solved an enduring mystery. The origins of an early draft of the Lewis novel titled The Lion, the Witch and the Foul-Mouthed Jackass.

The Republican leader has been a tough advocate of using judgeships to bolster the Republican vote. In 2013 when Democrats were in despair over GOP delaying tactics on lower court judgeships, Sen. John McCain worked out a deal with them to avoid changing the filibuster rule. The deal centered on three vacancies on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. President Obama had nominated three people for those vacancies, and all had cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee. Under the deal worked out with McCain, the Democrats would forgo a change in the filibuster rule if the Republicans would allow a vote on one of those nominees. McCain brought the deal to the Republican caucus. But it was rejected, whereupon the Democrats voted to get rid of the filibuster for lower court judges and executive branch nominees.

Now, when we come to the Green New Deal, I'm afraid I just cannot see how we could possibly go to zero carbon in the 10-year timeframe. It's just impractical. And if we start putting out impractical targets, we may lose a lot of key constituencies who we need to bring along to have a real low-carbon solution on the most rapid timeframe that we can achieve.

Thirty feet long, a bedroom, a bath, a kitchen, a microwave that browns, a little TV - beautiful, beautiful. Better than our new house - it has wheels, too. OK. Now, that leaves us $145,000 in cash. Now, play devil's advocate. Can't you live 20 years on $145,000 if you're living out of a motor home and just eating and painting and writing books? I mean, this is what we talked about when we were 19. Remember we kept saying let's find ourselves? Well, we didn't have a dollar, so we watched television instead. Linda, this is just like Easy Rider, except now it's our turn. I mean, we can drop out, and we can still have our nest egg. I just think that's unheard of.
So, when the unforeseen inevitably pops up, who decides how to deal with it? This is the field of incomplete contracts, and Hart wrote that a contract should identify who has the right to make future decisions — a significant kind of power.

The CDC guidance came as states and cities across the country acted on Sunday to limit large gatherings to help halt the spread of an outbreak that has infected at least 3,499 people in the U.S. and resulted in 63 deaths, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.
Twenty-one Republican women will be in Congress this coming session, 21 out of 535 members. That is a drop, even though the total number of women lawmakers will hit an all-time high. As NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben reports, some in the GOP are sounding the alarm.
Harris spoke with NPR on a number of wide-ranging topics, from her mother to her views on the death penalty and the Kavanaugh hearings to whether Joe Biden would make a good president. But she didn't commit to a presidential run herself.
Given that, some Democrats are hesitant to nominate a self-proclaimed socialist who wants to overhaul entire segments of the economy. And they worry that that kind of a message would, at best, fall flat with general-election voters.

Federal prosecutors say that after DNA tests linked Heinrich to the Scheierl case last year, investigators carried out a search that resulted in the discovery of collections of child pornography within multiple three-ring binders. That discovery evidently created the legal opening the U.S. attorney's office needed to compel Heinrich to talk as part of a plea deal.
Potter says during this great migration, either before or after they crossed the land bridge, this group (which the researchers call the founding population for all Native Americans) split again, into two populations.

MOORE: Exactly. He was probably going to be tall, dark and handsome. And instead, what walked through the door was Ted Knight, short, white-haired and handsome, yes, but not what you'd call a love interest. But the writers - the writer-producers, Jim and Allan, were so open, and I think that's an important part of being a successful artist is being open to new ideas and input. And they saw this man, and they began to think potential. All right, so it isn't our original idea but oh, wow, look and feel and salivate over all the juicy stories we could do in another direction. And that's what happened, and they cast Ted.

The original X-Files, as it developed, was divided loosely into three types of shows. Some were devoted to the ongoing story of Mulder and Scully's investigation into UFOs and government conspiracies — the show's so-called mythology episodes. Others were monster of the week episodes, similar to the structure of Kolchak: The Night Stalker. And still others were just flat-out weird and fun — usually the ones written by Darin Morgan, like Humbug and Jose Chung's From Outer Space.
Russia played a weak hand, at least in terms of Assad's domestic standing, very, very well, says Tabler. But the war in Syria is far from over. I don't think the Assad regime expected this, and it puts a lot of the military burden back on the Assad regime and its allies to keep their head above water.

BIANCULLI: Nothing else Mary Tyler Moore did in her career matched the popularity and the impact of those two sitcom roles. But to embody a decade, a gender and a generation not once but twice is plenty for any one lifetime. Terry Gross spoke with Mary Tyler Moore in 1995. She asked her about her first big break, playing the Happy Hotpoint elf for Hotpoint appliance commercials broadcast during The Adventures Of Ozzie And Harriet TV show.
While their number wouldn't have made up the vote margin, Zoller said, these split-ticket voters are important for Republicans to keep in mind going forward.
Whereas, she says, Nelli actually chooses sort of the key moment in which Christ announces his betrayal. And you have all of the apostles feeling the emotion of that very serious news. And so she is able to do a study of their responses, of their psychological responses.
It perpetuates the myth of the American meritocracy: that if musicians are good, they'll succeed, without allowing us to actually look and see what's happening. We have the same community engaged in the same activities under a guy who decides who's an expert and who's doing the work— and where critics face the same peer pressures that can shape how they vote, compelling them to consider what is currently trendy, who their peers voted for in the previous poll and how projects have been already covered by certain esteemed critics and publications in a pre-existing professional hierarchy.

Pallone is hopeful that Republicans may support some measure to shore up the ACA. In the last Congress, Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., proposed bills that would restore those payments to insurers, and he backed a plan to create a reinsurance program that could help reduce premiums.
The move has drawn extra scrutiny because that plant buys coal from a company headed by a large campaign donor to Trump, Murray Energy Corp. Chairman, President and CEO Robert Murray.

Because of the coronavirus pandemic, the bureau has decided to delay starting its early round of door-knocking by census workers in college towns to April 23. The bureau is also waiting until early April, instead of late March, to begin its outreach effort to send out representatives with computer tablets to help people submit their census responses online. That program, which is expected to cost at least $100 million, is designed to target people in high-traffic locations, from public transit hubs to grocery stores.
Analysts point out that there was actually something significant elsewhere in the speech. He said that North Korea would stop building atomic bombs, basically cap his country's nuclear program. But as you mentioned, there was also this warning that if the U.S. tries to sanction North Korea into submission or just runs out their patience, then all bets are off, and there could be a return to confrontation.
The race had been decided by the Supreme Court in December 2000, when the justices put an end to five weeks of contested counting in Florida (where the margin was just 537 votes). Gore had won the popular vote nationwide by about half a million.

Nobody's going to get kicked out of their houses, Mulvaney told reporters Thursday afternoon, reiterating that many of the HUD cuts were related to infrastructure and would be addressed in the massive infrastructure plan the president wants to implement.
Attacks like these have prompted the president to move to curtail the immigration system further. His critics argue that doing so emboldens recruitment for those trying to pull off or inspire these kinds of attacks. So that will remain an area of political tension.
So give it some time. I don't think it has - any particular thing has to be said. I think everybody, again, is going to get fired up, and I think our motivation at this point is we've been shut out of the White House for some time. And I think Republicans are going to get really excited about an opportunity to put a president back in the White House.

Nadia Owusu's first full-length book, Aftershocks, is about all of these parts of what is her single, complex life. It is a nonlinear memoir which Owusu organizes around a central metaphor: earthquakes. It opens with the day that her birth mother, who had already left Nadia, her sister Yasmeen, and their father Osei some years before, came to Rome — where they were living at the time — for a brief visit. The same day, an earthquake in Armenia destroyed the city of Spitak. Owusu had never been to Armenia; her mother's family hadn't either, not for generations, her ancestors having been exiled from Turkey during the Armenian Genocide. Still, the child Owusu made the link, and when a teacher asked her what was wrong, she could not explain:
The collapse of President Trump's administration in its final fortnight will surely downgrade his already damaged standing in history. It may also make all previously published books about his one-term presidency seem truncated.

But a big part of the problem with our polarized politics at this moment is that there's a massive demand for it. This isn't just a supply problem. We have a big chunk of voters. They're not a majority, but they're really loud and they're growing. There is a large group that is hopped up on on rage-clicks and they're demanding nonsense stunts like the objection to the Electoral College vote.

That rule wasn't really discredited until the 1970s, when the second-wave feminists made the generic masculine the paradigm of sexism in language.

On that January day in 2001, a procession of Democratic House members, including a dozen members of the Congressional Black Caucus, protested during the joint session. They spoke of alleged voter suppression in communities of color and said the votes that were cast had been miscounted. They begged for at least one senator to join them so as to force a debate and a vote on the Florida electors.
In November, under pressure from Trump, heating and cooling firm Carrier Corp., a subsidiary of United Technologies, said it would keep hundreds of jobs in Indiana instead of moving them to a plant in Mexico.
Texas has reported just a half-dozen confirmed cases, none of which has been found in Austin — but that fact did not dissuade the city's mayor, Steve Adler, from preemptively canceling South by Southwest, the city's signature music, film and technology event.
So Americans need to do things like start making plans to care for their children should schools and day care centers close, she said. They should talk to their employers about how they could work from home. And they should find out whether there might be a way to get medical care remotely, such as through telemedicine, Messonnier said.
SAGAL: All right, we skipped a bit. Why, out of all things, did you decide to become a mime?

Mexico's former foreign minister, Jorge Castañeda, warns that the United States should not take too large a role in Maduro's ouster. While Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua continue to back the embattled leader, Castañeda fears that a larger U.S. leadership role would rally more of Latin America's left to Maduro's defense.

SHOLTIS: Back at the Susquehanna EMS station, director Matt Baily says while mask shortages are new, agencies like his have long had a hard time getting other supplies. The federal government lists shortages of 12 drugs nationwide that are considered essential for emergency workers to do their jobs. With many drugs made overseas, Baily expects to see supply-chain issues like what happened in 2017 with Hurricane Maria.
Later Wednesday, he tweeted that these are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously & viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly & unfairly treated for so long.
Alabama's controversial system hearkens back to a different era, when county jails were more of a mom and pop operation and feeding inmates was often the responsibility of a sheriff's wife.

Hart found that privatized services have a strong incentive for cost reduction — but often at the expense of the quality of services provided. Hart accordingly raised concerns about private prisons.

It's a vital conversation at this transformative moment in our political and social order, here and around the world. Depending on where you stand, we're experiencing either a long-needed course correction or a feeling that the world has lost its way. Whatever your view, the rate of change has been dizzying.
INSKEEP: Now, this move has been popular, but there is some debate about how it was made. Megan Davis says Indigenous people should have been consulted. She's a professor of law at the University of New South Wales and identifies as Aboriginal. She says the process was disappointing and added, everything about us without us. Australian Indigenous leader and rights advocate Warren Mundine supports this change. He spoke with 7NEWS Australia.

Who wants to talk about sexual assault at a holy place? No one would believe it, she says, recalling the encounter, which took place in 1982.
It's likely that all the upgrades, at least at first, will cost a lot and will be available only to a small elite. So for the first time in human history we might see economic inequality being translated into biological inequality. And once such a gate opens, it becomes almost impossible to close it because then the rich will really be far more capable than everybody else.
Barack Obama had used his authority as president to join the Paris accord without a vote in Congress. That means Trump can remove the U.S. from the accord without a vote. But it will take awhile: Under the terms of the agreement, he wouldn't actually be able to withdraw until November 2020.
As noted, for Trump, immigration is tied to national security. So don't expect him to pull back on his push to curtail various programs and make the U.S. immigration system more merit-based.
That was a reassuring story then, and Fred Rogers had hundreds of others. He could calm little kids by telling them they were too big to slip down the bathtub drain, but he also tackled more serious subjects.

But first, very important - there was a big dump of Hillary Clinton's emails right on Christmas Eve, right? What were they trying to hide? Well, in one email in regard to a foreign crisis, Secretary Clinton says, quote, she only knows what she hears on NPR, unquote.
We interviewed Philip Roth five years ago when he announced he was done with writing and just wanted to be free to ruminate and nap.

Trump's anti-trade rhetoric was great politics during the campaign. But the hard truth is that getting those jobs back from China just won't happen — indeed, China isn't primarily responsible for manufacturing job losses in recent years. But if Trump is concerned about the jobs lost to China, there are other steps he can take right now, some of which don't at all involve negotiating with President Xi.
Wilson was a progressive Democrat and Princeton professor who apparently liked the idea of getting up to lecture in front of Congress. It was his improvement on the example of Theodore Roosevelt, who several years earlier had begun making the annual address a muscular agenda — rather than just a rundown on what was happening around the government.
The EPA's Obama-era WOTUS rule was based on a review of more than 1,200 peer-reviewed scientific articles. The review found ample evidence that isolated wetlands provide physical, chemical, and biological functions that could affect the integrity of downstream waters. Wetlands closer to the water, in the riparian zone, are physically, chemically, and biologically integrated with rivers, according to the review, published in 2015.
It's 11 days before the end of this president's scheduled term in office - a time when the national focus should be on what comes next under a new president. But after Donald Trump incited a mob to storm the United States Capitol this week, threatening the peaceful transition of power, congressional Democrats are preparing the groundwork for a second impeachment of President Trump, an extraordinary step that follows an extraordinary week in U.S. history.
The musicians with whom band leaders choose to record are often a reflection of who they work with in live performance. Together, these streams of income are significant if jazz musicians are meant to earn some semblance of a living performing, especially when studies show that their overall income is declining. In a profession that has traditionally employed an apprentice system, where up-and-coming musicians work as sidemen in the service of more experienced leaders before going out on their own, women do not have equal access to these rungs on the professional ladder, which impacts not only their musical development but also their critical recognition. Ready or not, they may have no choice but to lead their own projects if they wish to succeed.
Among the reasons for reluctance on the part of some health agencies and places to urge mask wearing is the concern about the shortage of masks for medical workers. That's why the World Health Organization has stayed consistent in its recommendation, Margaret Harris of its coronavirus response team told NPR. And that position is: yes to masks for health-care workers and people with symptoms, no for the general public.

But the mask-wearing policies in other country do not necessarily reflect a more authoritian government, say some of NPR's interviewees. Perhaps we have a bit too glibly dismissed the Chinese approach by saying that it's an authoritarian system. Lim says, People are obedient, but it's really not about being [in] authoritarian [systems]. It's fundamentally accepting that society comes before self and putting the greater good ahead of one's own interests.

When President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un discuss denuclearization in Hanoi, they are likely to focus on one North Korean nuclear facility in particular. NPR's Geoff Brumfiel introduces us to it.
PETRAEUS: Well, there's no question that, again, there was a presence of these different militias that was emerging during my time as a three-star. There is also no question that I insisted on the removal of key leaders - all of the brigadier generals and above in the police forces, for example. There was - these were actually paramilitary police forces, not just cops on the beat - two full divisions of them.

His office added, This is pure speculation. Spokeswoman AshLee Strong said, As the speaker himself said today, he's not going anywhere any time soon.
NGUYEN: Well, they weren't subjected to pogroms or anything like that, but they certainly lived a marginalized life. You know, Catholics who stayed in the North were subject to suspicion because the communist regime, which was a really hardline regime, was very paranoid about any kind of subversion and they thought the Catholics would be a kind of subversive anti-communist force, and so that meant that their economic opportunities were really circumscribed. And so when I went back to visit in around 2004, all of my uncles were still living in the same compound that my grandfather had built and they, you know, had been sustained for a couple of decades in the 1970s and '80s, early '90s by the money that my parents had sent home as remittances. So I think they definitely did feel that - even if they weren't murdered - that they were definitely discriminated against by the communist regime.

No matter how they vote every four years, you can't carve states out. I always say come and learn something instead of, you know, weaponizing all of this. But we know it's an old playbook. We know it's a way to speak to a base. But New York is a huge engine of this country. California is as well, just as the, quote, unquote, heartland is. We certainly would never cut out the heart of this country. But it seems like some days the president wants to do that to us.

The regulations.gov website discourages mass-generated submissions, warning that some agencies may choose to 'redact, or withhold' submissions containing duplicate/near duplicate examples of a mass-mail campaign. A tip-sheet further advises that Many ... mistakenly believe that their submitted form letter constitutes a 'vote' but in fact, while public opinion may guide policy, decisions are made on sound reasoning and scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes. A single, well-supported comment may carry more weight than a thousand form letters. (NPR reached out to Education officials with additional questions, but did not receive answers before deadline.)

We have a reality in this country, which is that we need more immigrants in order for the economy to continue to grow.

Our economy would come down. This is a fact. It's a demographic fact. What we don't have is a cogent system that we can actually apply in order to meet our needs as a country. And this is really a dynamic which has no party, has no ideology. It's just a need for the country.

VAN DYKE: (As Rob Petrie) Jerry and I put it on.
Koné says Americans need to show curiosity about each other, and a willingness to listen to the other side. He says America has been very focused on trying to spread democracy outwards. Now, he says, it's time to focus on what's needed at home, though he's not sure if Americans are ready to do the work it will take to repair the country.
For example, many academic journals have moved away from a narrow focus on statistical significance testing to consider a broader range of statistical measures. And some journals now allow researchers to submit papers that undergo peer-review prior to data collection, thus ensuring that decisions about the study are not made after seeing the data, and that the evaluation of the paper is not based on whether the data fit in with reviewers' preferences or expectations. These, too, are methodological innovations.
GROSS: You say you performed at strange places. Did you ever perform at a bar or a club that had a Confederate flag?
In the town of San Luis Río Colorado, right across the border from Yuma County, Ariz., hundreds of migrant families sleep out under blue tarps — the same kind you'd see emergency responders hand out after a hurricane.
A few years ago, Kansas City restaurateur Anton Kotar surveyed the local and national restaurant scenes and concluded his town's reputation as a steakhouse paradise had slipped.
Last month, an impassioned Twitter thread about Hathloul and her husband, comic Fahad Albutairi, went viral. Kirk Rudell, a writer and producer in Los Angeles, met them on the set of the TBS show American Dad! in 2017, after he'd hired Albutairi for a small part.
After this, we're going to walk down — and I'll be there with you — we're going to walk down, we're going to walk down to the Capitol, Trump said earlier Wednesday, and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them.
Dr. Stanton ignored his boss's injunction to hurry. He stood at the porcelain sink at the end of the counter and slowly washed his hands. Nurse Brockett held a clean towel for him. He dried his hands methodically. With care, he filled a syringe with liquid penicillin measured to a precise amount.

In her first speech as speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi made it clear that she knows that health care is key to why voters sent Democrats to Congress.
FLATOW: You're listening to SCIENCE FRIDAY, from NPR. I'm Ira Flatow. We're talking about doing scientific - doing research in the Gulf of Mexico and the legal problems in trying to do that independently, with my guests, Linda Hooper-Bui, associate professor at Louisiana State University Agricultural Center, Christopher D'Elia, professor and dean of the School of The Coast and Environment - also at LSU - Cary Nelson, president of the American Association of University Professors. Our number: 1-800-989-8255.
CATHERINE OSBORN, BYLINE: When the dam at Vale's iron mine in the small city of Brumadinho burst in late January, Brazilians thought back to a similar recent disaster. Vale co-owned a nearby mine where a dam burst in 2015. That killed 19 people, and the mine waste left a trail of environmental ruin. But no one was arrested, and the mine's owners paid less than 10 percent of the federal environmental fines they owed. Now state investigators are taking a new enforcement approach. Last week, they cited engineering reports from 2017 and 2018 that alerted Vale managers the dam was unstable and called for 14 employees to step down. Four of them did so temporarily on Saturday, including CEO Fabio Schvartsman (ph). Risk management professor Gerardo Portela from the Federal University of Rio says this shows a change in how Brazilian investigators understand accountability for this kind of disaster.

DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're speaking with filmmaker Yoruba Richen. Her new film, about the travel guide to help African-Americans find places they could stay and eat back in the days of segregation, is called The Green Book: Guide To Freedom. So how did the Green Book get started?
First, there was trouble with light and its propagation. After a debate that lasted for centuries, people were convinced that light was a wave. (The other option, defended by Issac Newton, was that light was made of little bulletlike particles.) That being the case, and as with any other wave, light had to propagate in a material medium. Water waves, for example, travel in water; sound waves in air. Light? Well, for us to see light from distant stars, the medium had to be transparent. It also had to be very light so as not to slow down the orbits of planets. Finally, it had to be very rigid, so as to allow for the propagation of very fast waves: It was well-known by then that light traveled at about 186,000 miles per second in empty space.
Already millions of people have filed for unemployment benefits nationwide. Washington is beginning to implement a $2 trillion relief program, and members of Congress are discussing the prospect of more such legislation.
He was not working for the president. I mean, I asked him for help, like on a friends basis. He was my client. That's how it began. He, Igor and several other people at a company — and they were developing a fraud detection program [crosstalk] — Fraud Guarantee. Yeah, actually, I always thought it was a bad name. And ultimately when they developed it, I recommended them changing the name. But I worked, I did work for them in helping to develop that company, largely because the underlying software they were using is one that I'm very familiar with for 10 years. And know probably as well as anybody knows it in the country. That started the relationship. Then it came about that we both were very, all three of us were very enthusiastic Republicans. We genuinely believe, whether people agree or not, the president is doing a miraculous job, haven't seen a president do this much since Ronald Reagan, and I think he's ahead of Ronald Reagan. But in any — and I'm delighted because I supported him when a lot of people didn't. And he's been a friend for 29 years. And think he's going to be one of the great presidents. And they were sympathetic with the idea that he was being treated very unfairly —
Happy to. As she followed him into the hallway, she sensed Reese studying them. Dr. Stanton walked with a certain insouciance, or maybe simply absolute confidence. Of course the confidence could be a veneer forced upon him by his position. Whichever, Claire found it stirring. The bottom of his white coat flicked backward with each step. He turned to her when they were several yards down the hall. Dr. Rivers told me you'd be working here today. Dr. Rivers was the director of the hospital. He was the one who'd contacted her editor about the story, following up on a casual conversation they'd had over lunch at one of their clubs. Frankly it wasn't my idea to invite you, but he's the one in charge. We don't have time for you, and we won't be making allowances for you. I'd advise you to stay out of our way. Good. I'm hoping to stay out of your way, too. I'm hoping you'll forget about me completely.
And one of the ways that they did that was to give me a pair of chopsticks. And they all had chopsticks. And they said, show us how to use chopsticks. At 4 years old, I had no idea how to use chopsticks. And I felt very badly about that. And that was, I think, my first initiation into the sense of being culturally and racially different than other Americans.
MARTIN: Shaughnessy Naughton is a chemist, an entrepreneur, she's the founder of 314 Action.

Outgoing Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue made last-minute pushes to support a challenge to the Electoral College, the chair of the Georgia Republican Party and other lawmakers backed lawsuits seeking to overturn the state's presidential results and the Republican-led legislature held hearings that promoted false claims of voter fraud and promised to crack down on voting rights.
Kelly and the White House have been brokering the conversations since Trump said on Twitter last weekend that he wanted to learn more about the FBI's use of confidential informants to interview campaign aides in 2016.

COLLINS: The shooting happened around 6:15 on Wednesday night. And I live in this neighborhood here, actually, and I heard a series of pops. What we found out since is police apparently pursued Dolal Idd as part of a crime detail about weapons, because violent crime has been rising in Minneapolis, like it has other places. And the body camera footage shows us that police tried to box Idd in at a gas station with their SUVs. Idd was in the driver's seat of a vehicle. He drew a gun. And it's hard to tell exactly what happened, but the glass from Idd's car window appears to explode out. Perhaps a shot was fired, and then there's a series of maybe a dozen shots that ring out. And Idd died at the scene. And there was a woman in the car with him. She was not injured, and no police were injured.
During the George W. Bush administration, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi took a trip to Syria and talked about improving U.S.-Syria relations with that government, irritating the White House.
MOORE: Maybe so. I don't think so, though, because once your speech is slurred, once you lose balance, you know, there's no way you can pretend that away. But I paced myself. I never allowed myself to drink any more than the company I was with. And there - that way nobody could judge me. Nobody could see.

U.S. Attorney William McSwain sued the nonprofit in February 2019, not long after it formed, claiming that a site where people could bring their own illegal opioids to inject under medical supervision would violate federal law. U.S. District Judge Gerald McHugh ruled in favor of the nonprofit in October 2019, writing, The ultimate goal of Safehouse's proposed operation is to reduce drug use, not facilitate it.
In the past two years the American people have spoken, Pelosi told members of Congress and their families who were gathered Thursday in the House chamber for the opening day of the session.
Various courts have mentioned the Logan Act, according to the Congressional Research Service, but it has mostly been used to try to shame political opponents.
He was a bigot, Carroll says. I certainly knew what the score was in the '50s and '60s. They were an out and out racist organization.
LIASSON: That's right. He was briefed about a month ago. He didn't make it public until the story broke. He was asked on Friday why he thought the story broke now, a month after he was briefed, and here's what he said.
First, the Iranian president and his aides are urging Biden to move quickly, before Iran's June presidential elections. Rouhani, a relative moderate, is serving his final term. A more conservative leader will likely prevail in the election, potentially creating a window of opportunity to deal with Rouhani on his way out the door. But, as analyst Ariane Tabatabai and I have argued, the impending election will not fundamentally alter Tehran's strategic outlook or its openness to negotiations. Rouhani's successor will not necessarily be more hostile to diplomacy even if he is more anti-American. Washington should not expect that its policies can dictate the outcome of the Iranian election, and it should not allow the election to dictate its own policies.
The view is shared by other prominent leaders, including some in Boston's African-American community.
The Vermont senator is beginning to expand his political network by helping upstart progressive congressional candidates and state legislators, lending his fundraising prowess and national fame to boost their bids.
The bears have nothing to do with it.
NGUYEN: Well, of course because I have my sister's story as an example. And I have the stories of many, many Vietnamese people who stayed behind or were left behind who are relatives of people who came to the United States or to other countries. And of course for many of them it was a really, really difficult time and a really horrible experience. And I know that when I talk about these kinds of things in this context that what people are hearing in your audience is that my family and myself are examples of the American dream - we've made it, right? And I really resist that idea.
They found some sick people and broken families and talked to them and prayed for them, and miraculously these people were convinced and began to follow Christ, said Tej Rokka, pastor of the C4C partner ministry, Savior Alone Redeems Asians. They distributed some food for the people, and clothes. Because of that, people began to listen to them.
SAGAL: They said - this was back in the '60s when the song came out. They did not play it for 10 years because they thought it was, quote, too morbid.
There are four basic camps that existing primaries fit into. Open and closed are self-explanatory, and there are several different variations of hybrid primaries. Some states allow independents to vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary, but block party members from crossing over.
SUMMERS: Events like these, though subtle in nature, are one of the ways that Warren's campaign is seeking a foothold in South Carolina. Black voters make up just under two-thirds of the Democratic electorate here. And Warren is specifically targeting black women. Vilissa Thompson is an activist who lives in Winnsboro, S.C., and thinks that Warren is talking about the right issues.
So these folks are going to have to do a little double take because if they boycott us, they'll have to explain why they didn't boycott Houston for the Final Four. And as far as cities, while there are a hundred cities with a Obama-type bathroom ordinance, that means there are 10,000 cities that don't. So they're going to have a real tough time finding a place that will suit them.
COBB: Yeah. I think that that's a kind of distinction without a difference. We could have said the same thing about Black people voting Republican in the South in 1880. And so it was more a matter of removing people from contention politically.
For Jeremy Lim, Adjunct Associate professor of public health from the National University of Singapore School of Public Health, East Asia's threshold for taking action on face masks and more potentially preventive measures was sparked by SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, another coronavirus that swept through the region in 2003.
It's unclear, however, who sent the recordings to The Washington Post or who originally recorded the phone call.
Well, first of all, if you look at what Joe Biden actually said many years ago, he was saying if, hypothetically, there were to be a Supreme Court opening, then his advice to a president in his last year would be to not make the nomination unless he had consulted widely and arrived at a consensus candidate.
Would taking these four principles to heart change what happens in most preschools or grade-school classrooms?
SIMON: Fine, thanks. Robert Kraft, owner of the Super Bowl-winning New England Patriots, faces misdemeanor charges of solicitation at a day spa in Palm Beach County, Fla. He denies the charges. They are serious because police say that the solicitation at this spa is tied to human trafficking. Now how likely is it the NFL will discipline maybe its most powerful owner?

And it's always fun. I don't know how to say that without sounding goony, but it's true. Whatever else is going on in our lives, sitting together in a room and writing a song is always a good time, even when it's - even when our work is bad.
Now Lieber faces charges of trading knowledge for money and lying about it. Prosecutors allege he set up a lab in China in exchange for hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments from the Chinese government and then denied knowledge of those payments to U.S. investigators.

Pence agreed with experts who, in recent days, underscored that his role in the session is a ceremonial one: As the president of the Senate, his actions are prescribed by law and the Constitution.
It is a disgrace, boomed Walter Carrington, a former U.S. ambassador, who once headed up a state investigation into alleged discrimination by the Red Sox organization. Calling Yawkey Way Massachusetts' confederate statue, he said, Every time I — or any black — go into Fenway Park, it's an insult.
PFEIFFER: Well, you know, this was so interesting. At first, he had a very casual, matter-of-fact way about describing his methods. In fact, he does not call it torture.

MELISSA ORTIZ: Hi. I'm Melissa Ortiz (ph).
This year's increased average game attendance, 7,655, is the sixth lowest in the league's 20 years. It's more than 3,200 per game less than the league's top average attendance in history, in 1998.
Now a cartoon from Randall Munroe, a former roboticist at NASA and founder of the website xkcd, helps put the numbers into perspective.
Let's understand all heroes probably have feet of clay. And let's be honest about those feet of clay, and learn from those feet of clay, he says. And maybe bring even a little level of humility to it ourselves, because when our kids evaluate us, they're going to also find feet of clay.
GROSS: So I want to play another clip from your comedy special Father Figure. And in this, you know, you're talking about how we live in two different Americas and that when white people don't understand what African-Americans experience, it doesn't necessarily mean that the white people are racist. Sometimes it's just that the white people are uninformed. And then as an example, you talk about going to a Best Buy where you had to educate a white salesclerk. You had just bought a cellphone case.
For a time, Trump and Vice President Pence sustained a vision of a phase in which at least some locations could relax their efforts on pandemic mitigation to bring portions of the economy back to life.
Washington state doubles down on CDC guidance
KELEMEN: While Jordan and the U.S. tried to get on the same page, Turkey's president was railing against Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton. Bolton had warned Turkey not to mistreat Kurdish fighters who Turkey considers terrorists but who help the U.S. battle ISIS in northern Syria. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, accused Bolton of making a serious mistake by demanding such concessions. Pompeo has been far more careful in public not to talk about timelines for a troop withdrawal or any conditions for it. Speaking to reporters on his plane on the way here, he denied that Bolton and Trump are giving mixed messages.

No, of course not. Of course, we don't want them to do those things. And we've raised the cost for doing this. The response in the previous administration when they undertook those actions was to reward them — to reward them, to give them billions of billions of dollars to allow countries to trade with them, to allow them to do all the things that you're seeing today, the ramifications, the tail, the end result of what the previous administration is the activity that we're seeing today. The money that underwrote Hezbollah, that underwrites Hamas, that underwrites Shia militias in Iraq is a direct result of the resources that were provided to them for the eight years prior to us coming into office. We are turning this around. We have reduced resources. We've seen it. They have fewer dollars available. This is beginning to place real choices in front of the Iranian regime. And you can see it, too. You can see in the protests inside of Iran. You can see the Iranian people not happy with their own government when they have to raise the fuel cost. All the things that are undermining this regime's ability to inflict risk on the American people are coming to fruition as a direct result of President Trump's strategy.
But left unanswered is whether the case of Josh Brown serves as an indictment of a league that appeared to learn its lesson two years ago, but in fact didn't.

Last week's challenge: Last week's challenge comes from listener Joe Krozel of Creve Coeur, Mo. There is a city somewhere in the United States with a population of about 24,000 people. Change the last letter in the name of its state. If you now read the name of the city plus the altered name of its state together, the result is a palindrome — that is, it reads backward and forward the same. What city is it?
I'm actually hoping that this horrific attack on the Capitol is an inflection point in that sense, that if the numbers are to be believed, people are awakening more quickly even than I expected to what's really going on here. But it will take time. It'll be earned by the work and by transparency and communication with the American people.
Harder to change are formal regulations, such as one effectively banning Planned Parenthood from the federal family planning program, Title X. They are governed by a law, the Administrative Procedure Act, that lays out a very specific — and often time-consuming — process. You have to cross your i's and dot your legal t's, said Nicholas Bagley, who teaches administrative law at the University of Michigan Law School.
Still, that comment raised eyebrows, especially combined with his campaign chairman Paul Manafort's past work for deposed Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, a Putin ally.

Some forecasters were expecting even stronger job gains, after an encouraging private payroll report earlier in the week. Hiring in February was roughly on par with the last month of the Obama administration, as well as hiring this time last year.
Another perennial problem he cited is the relative lack of diversity at local public radio stations, which are logical places for NPR to look when recruiting. According to Corporation for Public Broadcasting-supplied numbers, public radio stations reported that 20.6 percent of their full-time employees as of January 2017 were minority. For part-time employees, the figure was 24.6 percent. (It should be noted that those numbers include all employees at local stations, not just newsrooms.)
But then Markle herself appeared for the first time, making public a dress that had been treated as a secret only slightly less important than spycraft. And while she had an elaborate veil, with flowers from every country in the Commonwealth embroidered on it, her dress was very simple. Aggressively simple, even, other than the boat neck. Her hair and makeup were simple as well: her hair was in a low bun that was a touch loose, and her makeup was natural-looking enough that it didn't obscure her freckles. Even in a tiara, she looked like an American actress might look when marrying anyone — not just a prince. It will be a snap to copy the dress for its look, if not its quality.
HO-FUNG HUNG: What they fear most is this U.S. pushback for sanctions and things like that that now that U.S. is in the transition mode. So it is a kind of a time that they think that they can do whatever they want.
NPR's Shannon Bond contributed to this report.
Of course, photons are not people, and to sustain a quantum superposition is very difficult, especially as the size of the object increases. Still, there is something quite amazing and mysterious about this behavior, where the path in space taken by an object seems to be impervious to time; it is as if the two choices (particle or wave; one slit or two) are suspended in time and are only enacted once the spatial arrangement is decided upon. No wonder Wheeler liked to called such ideas as being indicative of a participatory universe, that is, of a universe where our minds are somehow deeply connected with the very fabric of space and time. After all, the choices of the apparatus may be made by a random number generator, but the apparatus and the interpretation of the data require our intent and design.
But what if you're not familiar with that world? The X-Files left TV nearly 14 years ago — an eternity, in TV time — and shouldn't expect viewers, especially younger ones, to know, remember or care about this show's long, extremely complicated past. The good news is, it doesn't. Instead, it serves up a helpful recap via Duchovny's opening narration as Mulder, which kicks off Sunday's new premiere episode.

It also would allow insurance companies to offer health plans without the consumer protections included in the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. That means insurers could sell stripped-down policies that cover fewer conditions and offer fewer benefits than currently allowed under the law.

You know, I know the concept is rough, but let's hypothetically talk about a sequence that I have. A sequence, for instance, where a girl is - a big guy hangs a girl up on a meat hook. And if you don't see penetration and you see the girl hanging on the meat hook and you've suggested penetration in a kind of Hitchcock way, you know, what will I get? Does that get an R? Does that get an X? Or how about PG?

One such incident of lackluster coverage happened last year when Brian T.

Gómez, born in the Dominican Republic, speaks English, but not with native proficiency. When Smith quoted Gómez as saying, For the last year and this year, I not really do much for this team.

Of course not. Flint is this egregious example of environmental injustice. It never would have happened in a richer, whiter community. There's a long history of racism in Flint, and it was also perpetuated during this crisis.

Showing early inequalities in who received promotions, she found that women received significantly more critical feedback than men, much of it on the basis of personality traits that were contradictory. For example, women's behaviors were described as bossy, abrasive, strident and aggressive, whereas men were considered confident and assertive. Men were also perceived as being naturally more competent at technical work than women. It is not difficult to extrapolate how similar biases might impact female jazz musicians in critical appraisals of their work, a professional realm in which there is no HR department to whom one can complain.
It has not been my favorite year [laughs]. It's really hard not to tour. Being able to travel and meet people all over the world, I'm so thankful to have had that opportunity because I feel like it's helping me expand my perspective and understand other people's perspectives. Especially because the kind of music I make is [enjoyed] pretty widely across the board: Maybe it's not your number one thing, but generally people don't hear soul and soul-adjacent music and go, Oh my God, I can't stand this. So yeah, not playing shows has definitely made me feel disconnected. But it's also been a time to take stock of what the last few years have been.

With the way things have been going in Oklahoma, this didn't come as a surprise. The state opened 2016 with a 4.2-magnitude earthquake this morning. There have been at least a dozen earthquakes in the state just since Tuesday. Now, for all of 2015, Oklahoma saw more than 800 earthquakes at magnitude 3.0 or greater. This is not the way it used to be. Regulators and researchers say the rise in quakes is due to oil and gas production that involves re-injecting vast amounts of salty water into the earth. To talk more, we turn to Todd Halihan. He's a professor in the School of Geology at Oklahoma State. Welcome to the program, Todd.

A high-profile example in that category is the Trump administration's efforts to allow states to set work requirements for many low-income adults who gained Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act's expansion of the program. The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case challenging HHS approval of work requirements for Arkansas and New Hampshire in the next few months. Some Democrats are concerned about how the high court with its new conservative majority might rule, and the Biden administration will have to move fast if officials decide they want to head off that case.
Why Analysts Aren't Laughing At These Silly North Korean Photos
Bernie Sanders and the other senators running for president are trapped in the president's impeachment trial. But later today, they will zip out back onto the campaign trail using every precious hour to try to make their final pitch to voters. For Mr. Sanders, that's often at sizable rallies, a hallmark of his campaign. NPR's Don Gonyea takes us to New Hampshire to see how the Vermont senator has been rallying his loyal base.
BUSH: President Donald Trump needs to be impeached again. I know that there are people who are probably working on that right now. I hope to see that happen. He incited what happened today. He told his folks to stand by and stand down, you know, and now it was time for them to come out. And so now what did he tell them? You know, you're special. You're very special. So go ahead, and go home. The thing is, you're very special. You did a good job. You did your work today. Now go ahead and go home, you know, so I can save face, you know? No, it's done. This was a racist Republican attempt to overturn this election and disenfranchise the voices of Black and brown and Indigenous voters who delivered this election for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and how it has led to a crisis of our democracy. And now it has incited a domestic terror attack. It must be condemned in the strongest possible terms. And I believe the Republican members whose actions have incited this violence must be removed in Congress. And so let me tell you I am introducing a resolution calling for the removal of any and all members of Congress who have, for months, tried to steal this election and invalidate the votes of Black, brown and Indigenous people.
Questions about Jane Sanders' time at the college are putting Bernie Sanders on the defensive at a time when national speaking tours and regular appearances on cable talk shows have some of his supporters predicting a 2020 presidential run.

If the citizenship question does stay on the 2020 census forms, the responses collected could dramatically reshape the political maps of some states and local communities. According to a Federal Register notice submitted by the Commerce Department in December, the Census Bureau is planning to ask state and local officials in charge of redistricting whether they want citizenship data from the 2020 census. That data, if it becomes available, could be used to redraw voting districts based on the number of U.S. citizens rather than on all residents regardless of citizenship.
BIANCULLI: Her defiance and her humor also were on display in another flashback sequence when Rob and Laura have just come back from the hospital with their new baby. Rob suspects the hospital accidentally switched infants, giving their kid to another couple on the maternity ward named Peters.
BRYANT: Yeah. Well, in my opinion 15, 16, 17 and 18-year-old players - and you watch tennis - Tracy Austin was 14 years old when she played up against Chris Evert. And so to me, it's always been collusion. You always look at what's taken place between the leagues and the colleges. If you have the ability to play a certain sport, you should be able to play it. I think that we remember not too long ago - it was only about 15 years ago - where they had the rookie age limit when they raised it because they didn't think that the players were mature enough for their millions because they didn't like the look of the new hip-hop generation walking around with gold chains instead of three-piece suits. And so there was a lot of consternation about that.

Tens of thousands of public events were held, hundreds of thousands of people turned out, millions of calls were made, countless families, even sick little children — our little lobbyists, our little lobbyists — bravely came forward to tell their stories and they made a big difference, said Pelosi, a California Democrat.
LANGFITT: Not much. Basically, they've gone into an 11-month transition period. So free trade and free movement will be the way it has always been. And what they now have is a very short window to work out a new free trade deal by the end of this year. And then there's the risk if they can't - I certainly hope this doesn't happen - the U.K. could still crash out of the EU with no deal at all.

How is a patient to know? Schmid asks. They learn of the change only when they get a big bill midway through the year. And then they're stuck.
PFEIFFER: Exactly. And, you know, listening to Mitchell's testimony made me think about how much the United States is still wrestling with having tortured people. Now, many people think it was morally reprehensible and many others believe torture was deserved after the horrific ways so many people died on 9/11. But torture is also why the 9/11 case is still dragging on nearly 20 years after those attacks because so much evidence cannot be used at trial since it was gained through torture. And as a result, the 9/11 defendants still have not been convicted of anything, yet billions of dollars have been spent at Guantanamo imprisoning them and trying to prosecute them. So whether you think it was right or wrong, torture is this enduring expensive legacy that still has consequences to this day.

GATES: And then there was The Late Late Show. And at the time, the airwaves were so segregated, they only put black films on The Late Late Show. And then black people would tell each other - they would say, you know, be sure to watch The Late Late Show tonight because Imitation Of Life, which is my favorite film - 1934, with Claudette Colbert. And when this little girl's passing for - she passes for white and breaks her mother's heart. And she come to - it's the woman who invents box pancake mix - right? - like the Aunt Jemima figure. And she's the cook for Claudette Colbert. And she and Claudette Colbert are both unmarried mothers. And she invents this pancake mix, and they become fabulously wealthy. And the black woman says all she wants is enough money to have a New Orleans-type funeral. So everybody knew that this whole thing was building to the climax when Delilah - is her name - the character. And she dies of a broken heart because her little girl passes for white and goes off - and never sees her again.

Comey's first book marked the point at which Trump literature moved to a new and serious phase, leaving behind the campaign accounts, the ghost-written business bragging (The Art of the Deal) and the magazine exposé mongering of previous decades. Trump was no longer just a tabloid subject or a TV reality show star. The man was leading, in some sense, the free world. His decisions were upending policies, precedents and principles on a daily basis.

When Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's lawyer, appeared in Lansing with witnesses to present allegations of election fraud, state Rep. Cynthia Johnson, a Democrat who represents Detroit, asked why witnesses weren't testifying under oath and why there were no Democratic election workers testifying.
Democrats said the measure didn't go far enough for worker protections and too far for aid to major industries, and had insufficient oversight for the assistance fund based at the Treasury Department for impacted industries.
I'm picking the moment [crosstalk] when the president pulled out of the nuclear deal, and since then, they are closer to having a nuclear weapon.
NPR wants to know more about your midlife career shifts, so we put the question to Facebook, and the response was overwhelming, with more than 1,000 posts.
NOURSE: The federal judges launched an incredible campaign. And technically, under the judge's ethical code, they are not supposed to lobby. And, in fact, when the women judges were asked what their position on the bill was, one of them said, you know, I don't know if we should take a position because if we do, and then we have to rule on it, that would be a conflict. I never heard that from any of the male judges.

Missouri Republican Sen. Josh Hawley, who was the first senator to announce he would join the House GOP effort, has indicated that he is focused on Pennsylvania. Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, who just lost her seat in a runoff decided overnight, announced Monday that she would sign on to a challenge to her home state's results.
Until 2019, LaJeunesse was the global head of the company's international relations. He says he was forced out of Google for raising objections about working with the governments of China and Saudi Arabia, saying such business ventures would make the company complicit in human rights violations.
INSKEEP: I want to ask about the president of the United States and what happens to him now. I know there's talk of urging the 25th Amendment. We haven't heard that Vice President Pence is a fan of that. There is talk in the House of impeachment, which would take a while. And we had Jeh Johnson on this program, the former homeland security secretary, earlier today, who told Noel King simply that he thought the best option was for people around the president to urge him to leave town. Go to Mar-a-Lago. Delegate authority to the chief of staff, the vice president or somebody. Just stop working. What would you have the president do in the final 12 days of his term?
If You See Dirty Water, Don't Just Gripe. Talk To The Cloud!
News of Gohmert's suit, or its dismissal, may have been the first time many Americans realized that the vice president has any role at all at the end of the presidential election process. But the Constitution did create such a role, and it has been an uncomfortable one on numerous occasions.
KELLY: Bottom line, given how many questions there have been in this election cycle about the integrity of our elections in this country and how many specific questions there have been about Georgia raised by the president and his allies and others, what do you want to say to people about the integrity of the election that you are overseeing?
JENKINS: And I'm Jimmy Jenkins in Arizona.
KODJAK: She says more than a third of transgender adults said in a survey that they had experienced health care discrimination in the last year. I reached out to several people who have worked with Severino and none would speak with me about him on the record. Those who spoke on background say he's a straight shooter who has a way of connecting with his clients. And they say they expect he'll apply the law fairly. Alison Kodjak, NPR News, Washington.

And in this golden anniversary year of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, there are many other plans afoot. Monday in his hometown, Latrobe, Pa., St. Vincent College is scheduled to host a screening of the very first Neighborhood episode.

NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to former U.S. Attorney Joyce Vance about a proposal to change New York's criminal code to allow the state to prosecute people already granted presidential pardons.
Senate lawmakers voted late Wednesday to reject the challenge to Biden's victory in the state of Arizona, and the House followed suit, but with many Republicans in favor of overturning the state's results. A similar result played out for the state of Pennsylvania, with both chambers voting to reject the challenge to Biden's victory there.
FLATOW: Yeah. We have 12 million downloads of our Podcast, so it's pretty - you've given them the opportunity to listen to it as much as they can.
While other leaders like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has also proven critical to progressive fundraising and excitement, like-minded groups say they're excited to see how Sanders uses his newfound popularity beyond the presidential cycle.
FLATOW: A great compliment to the panel coming in on the Twitter from somebody who says - (unintelligible) says, I finally know what a Higgs boson particle is. Thanks.
PERALTA: Yeah. I mean, yesterday was a really interesting day here in Caracas because it was a huge planned confrontation. Tens of thousands of Venezuelans marched to La Carlota, which is an airbase in the middle of the city. And they were at the fence staring at the soldiers. And there, I met Sofia Torres (ph). She's 19, and she was just holding a poster at the fence - trying to get any of the soldiers to talk to them. I asked her if she ever expected to have been out here, to be here confronting soldiers. And let's listen to what she told me.
LIASSON: Nowhere. We're nowhere. Negotiations usually have a couple things associated with them - first of all, round the clock talks, a willingness for both sides to find a deal where both sides would win or maybe a creative solution that makes the problem bigger, like exchanging a path to citizenship for the DREAMers with $25 billion for a wall. That was a deal that was tentatively made over a year ago, but Trump walked away from that.
At the end of the day, I just don't think there's enough angry old white people in Pennsylvania to make up for the fact of what Trump is doing on the other side to motivate the Democratic base, said Christopher Nicholas, a longtime Pennsylvania Republican strategist who ran several campaigns for former Sen. Arlen Specter. I hope I'm wrong.

CHANG: Patti and Jheri's jam sessions are the beginning of something potentially epic. And the juices really get flowing once they meet a mysterious goth loner with the memorable name of Basterd The Antichrist, played by Mamoudou Athie. Basterd is a punk rocker, but his rage-fueled performances hide a gentle, tender soul, and he reluctantly agrees to lay down some beats for an album. Also getting in on the action is Patti's wheelchair-bound Nana, played by Cathy Moriarty of Raging Bull fame, whose raspy line delivery becomes a pretty killer hook. The band is called PBNJ, an acronym of everyone's first initials that also happens to sum up the appeal of Patti Cake$. It's sweet and messy and a little square around the edges, but it's also pretty irresistible.
In total, more than 2,800 people worldwide have died from the virus so far, mostly in China, where the death rate is estimated to be around 2 percent, much lower than the death rates for previous coronavirus outbreaks like severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory syndrome, which had death rates of 10% and 34% respectively. The death rate of this new coronavirus could also be lower than it appears if mild cases are not being reported.
MALEK: Yes. The teeth were difficult to get used to. Initially, I put them in my mouth a year prior to shooting and immediately felt insecure. I felt like I was on my back foot in a way. I didn't feel like myself, which did help me quite a bit. But it was a feeling of insecurity that I had to cover them up as well. And I'd been watching so much footage of him. You see him covering up his teeth so often that I thought, how am I ever going to do that?

That viewpoint suggests that the populist inclination to cast certain kinds of experts as an elite and to regard science as a challenge to tradition and belief is insulating or even isolating many Americans. Millions seem unconvinced that this disease is as widespread or as virulent as reported – even when those reports from respected government officials such as Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health.
All politics are local. And then when you go into that little booth, and you are tapping those names, you just want decent people, she said. You just want decent people that in times that you need them, to have the courage to stand up for what's right.

And more than 6 in 10 are in the mood for compromise — 63 percent said they want their elected officials to compromise with people they disagree with rather than stick to their positions, including a majority of Republicans. Just 31 percent overall said they want their elected officials to stick to their positions no matter what.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. My guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel, The Sympathizer, won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It's written in the form of a forced confession by a spy from North Vietnam. The novel is about the end of the war from the points of view of Vietnamese characters. Viet Thanh Nguyen fled Vietnam with his family in 1975 after the fall of Saigon. He was 4 when they came to the United States. So after - what? - about three years or so, your family moved from Pennsylvania to San Jose. And why was there a big Vietnamese community there?
KANDER: Yes they did. And I - and I like them.

Yes, there's some energy for it on the left — some House Democrats have already said they will support the bill. However, there are indications House leadership isn't prioritizing the idea as much as those more liberal Democrats would like — Speaker Nancy Pelosi frustrated Green New Deal proponents by not giving them the kind of committee they wanted to put the policies together.

Leaders had warned members that the process is likely to last several hours and could involve late-night votes. Democrats hold the majority in the House, and roughly two dozen Republicans in the Senate, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., have indicated they will join Democrats to certify Biden as the winner, so the outcome is not in doubt.
Mr. TURNER: So I think that's what gets everyone excited in cosmology. That's the next big problem. And there we feel like the solution may be a lot longer out, so we're not so focused in what it is. It might be something as simple, and I put this in quotes, as the energy of nothing, quantum vacuum energy. Or it might be something as complex as the breakdown of general relativity. And right now, if you asked any one of the panelists, we could wax poetic about either solution.
ALECCIA: You know it varies some in the states that have opted for it. California, for instance, has a 15-day waiting period between - the people have to have to say they want this verbally twice.

Any review would directly contradict the agency's current scientific integrity policy, which was published in 2012. It prohibits all EPA employees, including scientists, managers and other Agency leadership from suppressing, altering, or otherwise impeding the timely release of scientific findings or conclusions.
NTETA: If we really want to drill down - and to be fair, we don't have the specific answer to your question with our data - but if you really want to drill down, I think that's what's going on here is that there's a long history in political science of whites, when faced with policies in which African-Americans are the beneficiaries or African-Americans are the targets, their negative views of African-Americans tend to be a good measure of understanding their opposition to these particular policies.
EDMUNDS: Well, storms bring massive waves that - 20, 25 feet in height to the surface. And those waves bring tremendous forces underwater that drag things across the bottom and break things off the bottom and cause a tremendous amount of scarring. And so in the Virgin Islands, we're accustomed to calm, sheltered waters, sunny days and spectacular underwater visibility. And then after a storm, everything has changed. And it's a remarkable game trying to imagine what it was like on that night of the storm.
It is extremely disappointing that even though the request for Mr. Assange's extradition to the United States has been denied, he will continue to be held in a maximum security prison in London, under lockdown during a pandemic, Assange's attorney Barry Pollack said after the ruling.

We have worked very closely with the coronavirus task force. Vice President Pence has done a terrific job. I've been personally involved in those meetings and I have been very impressed with the leadership from Vice President Pence and from the entire White House. David, I've been involved in situations in medicine before that were crises that were significant situations. It isn't the first time that that's happened to me, although not, certainly not of this magnitude or scale. And I can tell you that I've been very impressed with the leadership and with the great approach that Vice President Pence has taken with the task force.

But these findings do demonstrate that our sort of trichromacy gives individuals a clear benefit in exploiting the variation in skin coloration associated with important aspects of individual condition, such as intra-cycle variation in female fertility.
But methodological reform hasn't come without some fretting and friction. Nasty things have been said by methodological reformers; nasty things have been said about methodological reformers. There have been victims (though who they are depends on whom you ask). Few people like public criticism, or having the value of their life's work called into question. On the other side, few people are good at voicing criticisms in kind and constructive ways. So part of the challenge is figuring out how to bake critical self-reflection into the culture of science itself, so it unfolds as a welcome and integrated part of the process, and not an embarrassing sideshow.
Asked who he credited for the good times, he said he voted for President Dilma Rousseff in the last two elections, and before that, for her predecessor Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, known as Lula.
Under the Constitution, the final step in the 2020 presidential election is for a joint session of Congress to meet on Jan. 6 to count the votes and officially declare a winner. Governors certified and sealed their states' results after electors signed off on them on Dec. 14, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won with 306 electoral votes to President Trump and Vice President Pence's 232 votes.
It's important for the data to get the right kind of attention, proponents say. Ensuring universal access to safe and affordable drinking water for all by 2030 requires serving the unreached and underserved in remote and difficult areas, says Allakulov.

And at that point, was he directing you? Saying, Rudy, I want you to go find more. I need more information.
DALE RUSSAKOFF: Yes. I think this is one city where the ideas of the education reform movement were tried all in one place. Cory Booker, the mayor of Newark, had the idea that just to bring of these ideas to one city and use the extraordinary powers of a governor who controlled that school district and the money from Mark Zuckerberg of a hundred million dollars to try everything that - as he said, what was working in the school reform movement. So in that view, it was dramatically expanding charter schools, getting rid of teachers whose evaluations found them to be weak, judging other teachers by their test scores and rewarding them and streamlining the management of the school district so that it ran more like a business.
MALEK: Yeah, I walked around with the mic attached to it. I just never wanted to lose focus of what I was doing. And that was a very constant reminder.

CUMMINGS: Patreon is the equivalent of a tip jar. You can reach out to your supporters and say, would you be interested in giving me a dollar a month? And then one dollar is taken off your credit card every month.
LIASSON: Republicans would've never agreed to that. They know this is something very popular with the president's base. And that's their base, too. They don't want to get in between the president and his base. Of course, now we're going to see how many Republicans vote against it because the House will pass a resolution opposing this. It will go to the Senate. And it will have to be voted on. And there are Republicans who have objections to this on many different levels. On one reason, they don't like, as you said, money being taken from the Pentagon for important projects in their districts some - in some cases to be spent on this.
FAVREAU: I do. I think - I think it's a moment where he has to try, certainly, because I think, you know, if all people hear when they turn on the TV or the radio or read the news is dreary and dismal accounts of what America is going through, you know, it ultimately affects the national mood. And I think the president has the opportunity here to say, no; we have a lot going for us as a country.

#1 Capitalize on sensitive periods. Research suggests that many organisms have sensitive periods for learning — windows of opportunity during which the right kind of environmental input can have an impact that won't occur at all, or in the same way, outside of that window. Some of the most dramatic examples come from birds: a greylag goose will imprint on its mother (or on a suitable alternative) in a critical period hours after it hatches.
Prior to his election, President Trump promised to do away with the Obama-era rule known as Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, which defined which waters are protected under the Clean Water Act. Trump's replacement for that rule only protects wetlands if they are directly touching a major body of water. It's known as the Navigable Waters Protection Rule, and the EPA says it will result in economic growth across the country.
In recent years, members of Congress from both parties have supported expanding eligibility for health savings accounts and also expanding the list of ways that money can be spent. To date, though, those proposals, as well as other changes regarding the accounts, haven't become law.

KLAIN: Well, look - I think the ways to grade our metrics, they're in front of all of us. Is a test easy to get? Is it free? Is it something you can get if you're sick, if you suspect you're sick? Right now that's nowhere near true. Three weeks ago, Vice President Pence said we'd have a million tests that week. Last night, he announced we're only at 330,000, three weeks later. We are so far behind on testing. And even more critically, we have this crisis in our hospitals. Patients who are getting sick, you know, are being treated by doctors who are inadequately protected.
MOORE: It was 11 years ago, yeah. I guess that was the mid-'80s, yes. '86.
And the other reason why the confession became really important to the novel is that it's confession written from one Vietnamese person to another Vietnamese person who was the interrogator. And what that meant was that what I could do in the novel was to construct an implied audience of Vietnamese people. So it was Vietnamese people talking to Vietnamese people, which is not how minority literature typically works in this country. Typically if you're a minority writer in this country you're expected to write towards the white audience. I mean, the literary industry is 89 percent white. They're the first line of defense in terms of getting published in this country and minority writers understand that. And I really did not want to write this novel with a first audience of white Americans. I wanted to write it with a first audience of other Vietnamese people. And I knew that this would fundamentally change the way that the novel was written and how it would situate the American readership.
Bender says he wouldn't do it now, though. It's partly because of the scientific dispute, because he thinks Happer is misreading the evidence. But it's also because of Happer's style — he's labeled climate science a cult and accused other scientists of whipping up climate fears to boost their own careers. Most offensive for Bender: Happer once said the demonization of carbon dioxide is just like the demonization of the Jews under Hitler.
While the overall number of ER visits went down for patients between the ages of 2 and 22 after the shutdown, the decline was much steeper for the proportion of asthma-related visits in contrast to other types of pediatric emergencies. This held true when compared to the two months before the shutdown and the same time periods in 2018 and 2019, and across ethnicities.

For example, you can change RED to ROSE in five steps. Starting with RED, you could add a U, making RUED; drop the D, leaving RUE; add an S, making RUSE; add an O, making ROUSE, and then drop the U, leaving ROSE.

And so it wouldn't take a genius to figure out the same thing might have happened here.
And I was cheering for the American soldiers until the moment in Apocalypse Now where they started killing Vietnamese people.

What had happened was that at that time, and this was immediately after graduating from high school, I also got married immediately after graduating from high school. And about a month after that, I was pregnant, and these commercials were almost impossible to do anymore because I had my breasts bound down to begin with even before I was pregnant because pixies are supposedly of neuter gender. And to try to do that after I was even 1 month along and certainly into two and three was impossible, and so we had to stop. And I think they just went to straight commercials after that. And I went on to happily have my baby a few months after that.

The way we make progress is not by just hoarding our data and keeping it all quiet. We talk to each other. We try to interact, and we try to advance knowledge in a collective way. And this is sort of antithetical...
Nadia Manzoor: I think it made me much more self-conscious of my body, frankly. Walking down the street I was always very aware of the male gaze or people looking at me, and always trying to cover that. As a result, I think it really affected my confidence. I think it put me in situations where I made bad choices, kind of not trusting men in a way that made me more susceptible and vulnerable to situations that didn't turn out so well.
SNELL: Yeah - no, they don't have a new candidate, and they don't really have a path. But what they're saying is the only way to get a leadership change is to fight. And Kathleen Rice, who is one of the people who's been leading this charge, came out and talked to reporters. And she said this is something that Pelosi herself would want them to do.
Uh. He hasn't told me not to do it. He hasn't told me not to do it. And the fact is a lot of it has to do with the collusion. I've developed more — I've found out more things than I knew then. I mean I found — I've had a very, very long conversation with a person who's been investigating this case for five years. I've had a very intimate conversation with someone who is completely familiar with the prosecutorial file, has read it all, made notes of it — yeah, I've gathered more information all throughout this period. And sometimes I just get people to call me up and say, you want to talk to this person, you want to talk to that person? Most of them I don't talk to. Sometimes I hit — I get gold.
America in the run-up to the Revolutionary War wasn't just a period of dramatic political change, it was also a time of great religious and social instability, anxiety and experimentation. And in the midst of it all there arose a self-proclaimed genderless prophet — the Public Universal Friend. This week, how the Public Universal Friend rocked society's norms and paved the way for others to reject religious and gender expectations for centuries to come.
'It's Just A Shame': Trump Voters React To Insurrection At U.S. Capitol
It's constitutionally difficult for senators to be quiet and sit that long. It's not how we're built, Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, told reporters on Thursday.
The AMOC plays a key role in the distribution of heat across the Earth, but that is being disrupted by melting ice, particularly from Greenland, causing larger volumes of freshwater to flow through the oceans, says David Thornalley, a geologist at University College London and the lead author of one of the new studies.

Please, call me Tia. Her tone was more youthful and friendly than Claire expected from her appearance, and her appearance was the opposite of what Claire would have expected from a woman who studied mold. Jamie told me you were coming today. I wish I could shake hands, but as you see. She held forth the towel, and Claire glimpsed a glass vial of brownish yellow powder cradled within it.
Bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Corp. Will Replace Half Of Its Board Of Directors
This information does not suggest a jazz landscape where women and men participate equally, but where a small, selective group of women sometimes receive attention as exceptional talents. The names of female artists who frequent the top of the poll would likely be familiar to jazz fans: big band leader Maria Schneider, saxophonist Jane Ira Bloom, pianists Myra Melford and Carla Bley, clarinetist Anat Cohen, drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, vocalist Cécile McLorin Salvant, flutist Nicole Mitchell and the late pianist Geri Allen prominent among them. They appear in the poll time and time again. (It is also worth noting the labels that these women record for: Although a handful appear on jazz stalwarts like Verve, Concord and ECM, and some self-release their projects, more of them record for prominent indies favored by critics such as Intakt, Motema, Greenleaf, Clean Feed and Firehouse 12.)
Here's what to look for as the count — scheduled to continue through July — rolls out around the country:
SAGAL: That's a very good idea. But what he really did was he commissioned the ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David...
Three days earlier, the nation was able to hear an exceptionally clear hourlong tape of phone call of Trump urging, cajoling and pressuring state officials in Georgia to find enough votes to change the outcome of the November election in that state. It was stunning, undeniable and potentially incriminating.
NOURSE: If your husband raped you, you could not bring a criminal charge in many, many states. That was on the books. And that shocked me. I didn't think that in a world where the Constitution provides for equal protection and that I'm an equal citizen - I certainly thought I was an equal citizen - that that could possibly apply. And I kept thinking, what if that had happened to me?
FLATOW: Is that because we think nature is symmetrical or likes to be symmetrical?
Although Alberto, the first named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, was downgraded to a subtropical depression soon after it made landfall on Monday, its affects have continued to be felt, even at the fringes of the system.
These migrants are afraid to leave this spot because they might lose their place in the line to request asylum. But some do venture to a migrant shelter in town called Casa del Migrante la Divina Providencia.
In a separate incident, the National Transportation Safety Board launched an investigation Tuesday into the fatal crash of a Tesla car equipped with a self-driving system. The vehicle struck a highway barrier, caught fire, and was later hit by another in Northern California.

FRAZIER: In some places, when a work crew has removed a public side of the line, loose chunks of that private lead pipe right next to it have broken free. The long-term solution is to replace the entire line. The city is pushing a state bill to allow it to do just that.
KODJAK: Well, that's the big unknown.
Remarks like those may have been on the mind of the 51% of the Americans surveyed who said Trump had encouraged election interference. Eighty-eight percent of Democrats and 51% of independents backed that assertion.
NPR is already bulking up on staff to cover Washington. It announced just after the new year that Asma Khalid would return to NPR to cover the political impact of America's changing demographics, and Tim Mak, formerly of the Daily Beast, would join NPR to cover movement conservatism, among other topics.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: Since the Morrison decision in 2000, VAWA has been reauthorized numerous times with revisions that aim to be more inclusive and intersectional. For instance, the act didn't fully protect same-sex couples until 2013. There's still criticism from advocates who say women of color have paid the price for a law focused on criminalization. While seen as a victory for women by some, many are still asking - which women? - not to mention which genders.
I want every American to be prepared for the hard days that lie ahead, Trump said. This is going to be three weeks that we haven't seen before.
Mr. Reese, I'm Dr. Stanton. He took his time. Stanton believed that reassurance and respect were part of the treatment process, too. Everything that's happened to you in the past few hours must be a little confusing.

INSKEEP: Early this morning, the vast majority of lawmakers voted to do so.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's right. I mean, it's going to get taken from the Department of Defense and possibly from funding things like the opioid epidemic. If lawmakers are uneasy with this national emergency - and they are. Democrats and Republicans alike have said that they consider it a bad idea. Why didn't Congress put actual language in their compromise legislation to avoid it?
SAGAL: What I read was that your wife...
Again, thank you. Well, that crucial task was easier than Claire had expected.
We think we have to have a DACA solution, House Speaker Paul Ryan told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Nov. 30.
A push to give Colorado an open presidential primary, for instance, died in the state Senate earlier this month.
SHARP: Well, their child should absolutely be protected against bullying, harassment or anything else. And we've seen schools across the country do a great job of protecting every student under their care. But part of that duty of protection is also protecting the right of privacy. And so we're hearing from lots of students across the country and parents saying this violates our right to privacy when we're forced to share locker rooms, showers and restrooms with someone of the opposite sex. And so that's actually what motivated, I think, over 130 parents and students in Chicago to actually sue the federal government because they came in and forced the school to open up their restrooms and locker rooms to the opposite sex.
NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks with Leana Wen, a physician and the president of Planned Parenthood, about how a rule change from the Trump administration on Title X will affect her organization.

One, because, I think, it is a - it was a new - it's a new approach. And I think the audience needed to be introduced to the, you know, what are - what we were trying to do with this story and how it was going to work.

PG&E signaled a leadership shakeup last month when NPR first reported that the utility company, beset by potential liability claims associated with California's devastating wildfires, was looking for ways to avoid bankruptcy. The company filed for bankruptcy in late January.
But it is possible with the Large Hadron Collider, long-shot possibility, that some of the features of string theory could be approved(ph). It is idea of extra dimensions, you know, slamming these protons together at very, very high speed and some of the debris gets jammed in other dimensions and you recognize that by having a little bit less energy in our part of the universe, and it's leaked away. That would be great. Finding these super symmetric particles, that'd be great. Creating a little microscopic black hole, again an idea that really has its origin in string theoretic ways of thinking about things. That would be spectacular.

If you look at the candidates that really run on being unapologetically progressive, those are the candidates that end up winning, Blizek, the MoveOn.org field director, argued. Candidates that are willing to be authentic and really speak to these voters are going to be rewarded.
EDMUNDS: Most folks who visit the Virgin Islands and snorkel around the Virgin Islands will snorkel in water that is five, 10 to 20 feet deep. And those are the areas that are most prone to the damage. And sure enough, when we swam over those areas, we saw the damage, the toppling and the scarring. But once we got below about 20, 25 feet, it was a different story. And certainly, you can find broken corals and toppled sea fans and the damage. But I think what was remarkable was the amount of coral and soft coral that survived.
JONES: Oh, the joy has been mine. Thank you all so very much for having me.

You spent a lot of time in his SUV driving around Newark back when he was mayor and was one of the people - people pushing through this education reform plan in the Newark schools that we've been discussing. Do you think he's sorry that he talked to you? Because you've pointed out so many things that didn't work out right, you know, so much conflict that ended up as a result of this plan. He left while it was being implemented 'cause he was elected to the Senate.

Some hit a midlife career rut, others lose their jobs in their middle years — and some, like Hagerty herself, who reexamined her career as a radio reporter after developing chronic pain in her vocal chords, have other reasons for rethinking their careers in their 40s and 50s. Career experts, Hagerty says, say when you do start this process, you should change your career within the boundaries of your natural talents, skills and personality — and they caution against fantasies of reinvention.

These unprecedented numeric quotas are so onerous that many judges will rush through cases to protect their own jobs, he said.
MOORE: Right. That was played by David Janssen, and it was - I guess it had started on radio. And one of the successful elements of it was a character called Sam - short for Samantha - who was the answering service woman who took Richard Diamond's telephone messages. This was, of course, predating answering machines, and he would check in with me two or three times every episode. And I would answer in the sexiest imaginable voice, hi, Mr. D., I have some messages for you. And nobody ever saw Sam. You were allowed to imagine her to be your idea, your fantasy of the most gorgeous creature ever, certainly far from the reality of Mary Tyler Moore who, at the time, was a fast 23 or 22 years old freckle-faced, all-American, girl-next-door type.
David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard University who studies ancient DNA, says genetic material like this tells a more detailed story of how people came to America, but not the whole story. There were presumably many related populations like this, he says, one of which split to form these two lineages that have diversified into Native Americans today.
Everything we advocate — and this was some of the ideas of the Lab School — is that students should work on problems. [That] could be traditional problems or more open-ended inquiry-type projects, and while they're working through those they say, Hey, wait, I need to figure out how fast this thing is gonna fall. I need help here. So, yes, I agree with that — the best way to do it is look at it from a problem-solving point of view, try to struggle with the problem, and then pull the knowledge as you need it. It could be an on-demand lecture, it could be looking at a reference book, asking your friend, asking a teacher, finding an article on the Internet. Whatever it is, it's going to stick much more than when it's pushed on to you.

Some people in upper management made the point last April that significant changes had contributed to NPR sounding more diverse on-air, despite a lack of change in overall numbers.

I could hear the reaction. In most cases, that would be true. I mean, I would - then if I'd see it played in front of a live audience, I'd be happily surprised to see that I had guessed right.

LIASSON: Well, Biden now has an incredible opportunity to unite the nation. That's what he ran on. He is the antidote to Trump. That's why he got elected. In terms of the Republican Party, they already were getting branded as the party of voter suppression, the party that wanted to throw out - undermine the will of the people. Now are they the party that believes in violent insurrection if you don't like the results of an election? - or at least one wing of the party might. We don't know that. But I think today is a turning point in American politics, and we're going to have to wait for it to shake out. But it's not good for the Republican Party.

And the hyenas decided that they were going to take him out, and they just would not leave him. And they - what - of course, if he got one of them in his jaws, he could kill them instantly. But they were very clever. They'd run in. Some of them would run in, and he'd snap at them. And the others would then run in and bite him on his rear. And they were, basically, trying to wound him and weaken him so that they could eventually - well, we don't know if they would've killed him. But it looked like that was what they were trying to do. And he was - and this was going on and on and on. And he was trying to fight them off, and then they would fight. And you could see he was getting weak, tired. And it didn't look like it was going to end happily.

But when it got to the point where he was losing coordination, and he could no longer text messages or write messages, he was almost completely incapable of speech. And it was extremely frustrating for him. He couldn't communicate at all with anybody.

And some of the Green New Deal's goals are indeed aggressive. For example, Ocasio-Cortez told NPR that in 10 years, we're trying to go carbon-neutral.
Pourvahab seems to know an awful lot about the nuclear accord, but then again, Fordow, the underground nuclear site now being converted for research, is just 20 miles away. Pourvahab sounds a bit like Secretary of State John Kerry when he says the deal boils down to major cuts in Iran's nuclear program in return for limited sanctions relief.
MCCAMMON: Well, you know, he has not said he plans to resign. Let's be clear about that. In fact he said in that statement later on that - he talked about serving out the remainder of his term and expressed desire to work toward healing after this event and after this came forward. But a lot of other people have called for him to resign, and those calls this evening have been coming in kind of one after another, Ari, initially mostly from Republicans but also now from a lot of Democrats.
GATES: I'll never - I love you, Mama. I love you. I love you being black. I'm going to be black.

The fear of retaliation has always been great and we've seen retaliation, so this is our chance to protect ourselves, Muthukumar said.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: This was such a bruising fight, Mara. Over the last month, as we talked about the possibility of declaring a national emergency, you said it was kind of like a life vest. He could use it to show his base he did everything that he could, and that would satisfy them. Do you think, after all this, it still holds?

My own story runs deeply through the history of Marvel comics in culture. In the 1970s, when I was growing up, Marvel's stories were a profound source of comfort and inspiration to me. Much to my parents chagrin, I waited with anticipation each week for the release of titles ranging from Spiderman to Iron Man to the X-Men.
But now Salgado says the majority of migrants are women and children seeking asylum.
The nun's works were prized by Florentines during the 16th century because they were believed to be imbued with spirituality. Her contemporary, the art historian Giorgio Vasari, wrote that she would have done marvelous things if, like men, she had been able to study and to devote herself to drawing and copying living and natural things.
MITCH MCCONNELL: President Trump claims the election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories.

Even William and Kate's wedding in 2011, while a considerably happier affair, wasn't particularly surprising. It felt — from my perspective on the street outside — like a beautiful but utterly traditional event. Perhaps even beautiful because it was utterly traditional, but carried out with some actual pleasure.
Before, this was a place to bunk for a night or two. Now many of its beds are empty. But Salgado says the shelter has found other ways to serve the migrants. They come during the day to eat, to shower and to wash their clothes before returning to the line.
REEVES: Well, he's piling on the pressure. He's calling for people to walk out today, out of their homes and offices, for a two-hour nonviolent protest. And then he's also called for a mass demonstration nationwide on Saturday. Remember; he successfully summoned hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets last week. So I expect today's event to be large. And the big question is, how will Maduro's security forces react? Forty people have been killed since this crisis erupted just over a week ago, mostly by Venezuela's security services, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office. And, you know, the worry is that there'll be more bloodshed. But he is piling on pressure.
You know, there's a level of respect you have to have for someone who's bold enough to say that they don't like you and that they'll call you one of the most hated words in the history of this country. Somebody like that might be motivated to come find you after the show. And I'm the only person in town with Alabama plates. So yeah, get the hell out of there. And, you know, thankfully, every gig wasn't like that. But I'm thankful for those gigs. So, you know, it's - if nothing more, my first nine, 10 years of comedy were just a very, very bitter education on the psyche of the middle of the country.
According to The Associated Press, the testimony of Thomas and the other women could help prosecutors insulate Constand from the defense's contention that she is a 'con artist' who preyed on Cosby's vulnerability after the 1997 killing of his son, Ennis, and then framed him to score a big payday via a $3.4 million civil settlement.

Sanders continues to say that he likes Biden and that defeating Trump is the most important thing this year. Sanders has pledged unequivocally to support his opponent if he himself loses the nomination, something he has done more vigorously and more often than he did in 2016. Despite disparaging the party, and though some of his supporters often get into vitriolic arguments, particularly online, Sanders is clear that he does not want to hand the election to Republicans.

As President Trump himself said Monday: If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we're going to have a big celebration altogether.
He said his next step will be pushing for permanent protection for the Arctic refuge. He's likely to have support from a Biden administration. The president-elect and his appointee to lead the Interior Department have both said they oppose drilling there, and Georgia's run-off elections give Democrats control of the Senate along with the House.
Then, things went south pretty quickly, Sheehan says. He held his breath while lawmakers duked it out, but in the end, there was no additional money for public schools, or their teachers.
No. He wasn't directing me. I mean, I pretty much was acting on my own instincts, my investigatory instincts, which go back a few years. I mean, I was pretty good at it. I would investigate, and if it proved important enough, I'd come to him. If not, you know, I'd just have it in my files as something to be followed up later. But by the time you get to that telephone call, the president of the United States had been briefed by many, many sources on Ukraine. And he had an overall view of Ukraine that was superior to mine, because when I had arranged to go see President-elect Zelenskiy, I spoke to some of the people who advised him — actually I looked at notes that were provided to me and they had a lot more information about Ukraine than I did. And the reason I didn't go is because they had leaked my visit to the press. He was gonna have two people there who, if you look in our files, are very seriously corrupted people.

But some Trump backers were unsettled by the invasion, and in some cases deny it really happened. Adriel and Kristina Leddy from Northern California arrived in D.C. too late to witness the breaching of the Capitol. Adriel Leddy said he believed it had been carried out by leftists impersonating Trump supporters. Trump's people and patriots and people who just care about personal property and their country don't vandalize and break, nor do they use violence, he said.

When he took a shower, there was a foul odor, and the water left rashes on his grandson's skin. His horses stopped drinking from their trough, and there was an oily film on top of the water.
FLAKE: No, he won't. The 25th Amendment isn't going to be invoked. And so impeachment, I guess, is the question. I would rather not see that happen. It's not going - there will be no conviction in the Senate. The Senate isn't returning until the 19th. It would take unanimous consent to return before then. It's not going to happen. And so I fear that the president would treat a second impeachment as a badge of honor, much like he did the first one. And I just don't think that that is a fitting punishment. I think to just see him go away (laughter) is the best we can do.
And there are some very smart people working to get tax cheats to change their ways.

Added Kate Bedingfield, the Biden campaign's deputy campaign manager and communications director: In accordance with guidance from public officials and out of an abundance of caution, our rally in Cleveland, Ohio tonight is cancelled. We will continue to consult with public health officials and public health guidance and make announcements about future events in the coming days. Vice President Biden thanks all of his supporters who wanted to be with us in Cleveland this evening.
As for Valli, he predicts the real future of this technology isn't to banish sugar from gelato completely, but to make it possible to cut the amount by a half or a third. After checking out the Carpigiani workshop, that's what appeals to Monica Maccioni, who runs Bobboi Natural Gelato in La Jolla, Calif., with her husband, Andrea Racca. They have wanted to find ways to reduce sugar, but are wary of substitutes that clash with their philosophy of working from scratch with real ingredients.
Few elections are perfect. There are mistakes for sure. However, it is an unreasonable leap to equate mistakes with fraud. Quite simply fraud is not a mere mistake. Fraud requires intent.

So I'm sure you must have studied it move by move, including learning Freddie Mercury's microphone technique because he'd, basically, be handed the mic on the stand but not on the bass.

GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. Let's get back to my 1990 interview with Martin Landau. He died Saturday at the age of 89. One of his best-known performances is in the Woody Allen film Crimes And Misdemeanors. He played Judah Rosenthal, a philandering husband whose mistress is threatening to tell his wife about their affair. She's also threatening to reveal information about Judah's questionable business deals. In this scene, Judah's brother, played by Jerry Orbach, tells Judah that he has friends who can take care of Judah's problems. Martin Landau as Judah speaks first.

So all those dollars going out aren't necessarily a bad thing. And here's one big reason why: Other countries are investing in the U.S. at the same time, as economist Chad Bown told NPR's John Ydstie in April.
And I think if that African-American officer had started shooting people, then I think the national crisis we're experiencing right now would be worse. And we know that in one case, an officer did shoot someone to death, and I've seen those videos as well. This was someone trying to climb through a window into a more secure part of the Capitol. And a lone officer made the decision to kill someone rather than to allow them into this more secure part of the Capitol. And that, too, in my view, is a failure of policing.

So what should we expect in 2018? There are four areas of domestic policy the president is particularly focused on, according to the White House — immigration, infrastructure, welfare and health care.
But the local administration and police department of Nalgonda were responsive: The water authorities promised to monitor the filtration plant and close off contaminated wells.
The March For Our Lives funding, according to organizers, came from crowdfunding and other donations — including from household name celebrities such as Oprah Winfrey and George Clooney.
[A] young, female colleague ... was groped by an older male opposing counsel at a holiday party. After she fled the scene, the man followed her and asked 'in the crudest possible terms' about what sexual activity she might be planning with her husband that night. The woman went to her bar association to file a complaint, only to discover that the man's behavior violated no ethics rule — unless he had been convicted of a crime. Despite concerns that she'd never work in her field again if she prosecuted, Roberts said, she filed a police report.  'Now the opposing counsel has a criminal conviction,' said Roberts. 'So be careful what you wish for when you say [victims] should pursue criminal remedies first.'

Because Curry was a black minister in an overwhelmingly white church at an overwhelmingly white event, the cadences of his speech — unusual for a British chapel but utterly familiar in an American black church, as commentators from both countries noted just before the BBC America coverage signed off — embraced parts of Markle's public identity that she's been adamant about maintaining. Its very presence at the ceremony acknowledged her, and her mother, Doria Ragland. It acknowledged the rest of her family, and even the racism that she's faced in public.
It's what makes those revelations so explosive, because ultimately, what's at stake here is his moral authority to deal with this unfinished bit of business. Because what people will ask is: Is it credible to believe that Benedict can crack heads with other bishops if, at least prior to 2001, his own record really isn't any better? And that's the hard question the pope is going to have to answer.

The qualifier is an easy out for Biden. If Sanders' single-payer, Medicare for All system passed Congress, that would mean the political winds had shifted dramatically — that at least some Republicans and moderate Democrats who opposed that plan came on board, because their constituents were also on board.

Newark, throughout all time, had been a city where kids walked to school. There were many small neighborhood schools, and there was no bus system that took kids to school, except in the case of kids with special needs who had to go to special schools. But the average child in Newark just walked to a neighborhood school. And the feeling that she had - and this is a strong feeling in the reform movement - is that children and families should have choice. They should be able to choose to leave a failing neighborhood school if they want to.

Mr. TURNER: But I think the goal is - I think we've got a very good chance at the LHC to produce the dark matter particle. And that would end this 70-year-old mystery that started with astronomers, Fritz Zwicky, showing that there just wasn't enough mass in the stars to hold the universe together - going through this period where this connection between the very big and the very small came together, and dark matter was a central focus point, recognizing that there's not enough atoms in the universe - that's the four percent we do know about - and that implicating a new particle. And the LHC could be the place where we tie that story up, produce that particle and give it a better name.
And then a month later, the communists came and took Saigon. And according to my brother, you know, we tried various ways to get out of the city - went to the airport, couldn't get out.

And without knowing where my father was, my mother decided to get on that boat. And then later we discovered my father gotten on that boat, too. So my parents have always been risk-takers. And for us, most of the time, it's worked out.

ROTT: Yeah. You know, and look, President Trump is not wrong there. Bad or misguided forest management, let's say, is one of the big reasons that we do have these big fires, you know, as well as climate change. The irony here though is that in a place like California, where I am now, the president keeps berating our forest management, threatening to withhold emergency funds. But more than 50 percent of California's forests are managed by the federal government. And right now, due to the shutdown, federal management isn't happening on those lands.
BRYANT: Yeah, but those checks cash, that's for certain. And so Zion Williamson has an $8 million insurance policy now. The bottom line is that this has to change, and the NBA should do its part. If you're good enough to play in the league, go play in the league.
MONIZ: Well, actually, first of all, let me say I stand by that Paris statement. I believe it's true, and the recent polls show that there is increasing understanding and acceptance in the public both about the realities of climate change and about the need to address it. Now, in reality, you're absolutely right. But I think the trend remains and will remain going towards lower carbon. The problem is that we were not then and we are not now working on a sufficiently accelerated path to low carbon to meet the 2 degrees, let alone the substantially less-than-2-degree, goal.
It's the only big, comprehensive city where you find all sorts of activities — like in London, he says. Good international schools, plenty of housing and adequate office space.

And my grandfather, who had an arranged marriage to my grandmother, and this was in the 1950s that my mother approached them, my mother said she wanted to go and study at UC Berkeley California and my grandfather said go.

MOORE: There was a store in Los Angeles, in Beverly Hills called Jax, J-A-X. And a man named Jack Hanson owned it, and it's now no longer there. And he designed these trousers. And they came in all fabrics and all price ranges from cotton to the finest moire silks. And I adored these pants. I loved them. I lusted after them. And I could just barely afford the cotton ones.

QUINONES: It's hard to say because by now Purdue Pharma and OxyContin, they're household names. In any doctor's office, certainly everybody knows the drug. Most pain patients know the drug. It's not clear to me how much more promoting they actually have to do to get this drug well-known. It's also got a very bad reputation too. A lot of people are very wary of it. Doctors are very wary of it now, I think. And so what exactly is - how this will help? I'm not sure. They may have their own calculations as to what effect it will have.

SHEHADEH: Well, you know, for me at 16, it was the most crucial time when I needed to be free and explore life and go into the world. And instead, the war meant perpetual curfew. So we were under at first a 24-hour curfew, and then it was reduced a little bit. And then, of course, there was also utter confusion because we felt totally defeated. And the feeling of being defeated is a very hard one, especially when you don't understand why and how to move out of it.

I walked into the room, as the entire team that mobilizes for post-cardiac arrests do all the time. They were very efficient about organizing.

There's an incredible amount of change that has happened in a relatively short period of time, and it has understandably had a lot of people feeling displaced, wondering and asking a question about where do they fit in, their relevance, are they obsolete. I think it brings into question questions of identity. What does it mean to be an American? What does it mean to be a productive American?

In the summertime we do some cooling techniques with our emitters and some foggers when it gets really hot — you know, over 105 degrees, Stearns says.
I come out here with my buddies, talk about life, enjoy the scenery, he says. It's one of the great pleasures of his life.
BEARDSLEY: Well, Foreign Minister Le Drian said for the moment this is it. They've achieved their goal, hitting weapons, you know, chemical weapons depots and a research facility. He says he thinks they've pretty much knocked out nearly all of the Syrian regime's capacity to use chemical weapons. But he added this when he spoke on television this morning.
PETER GROSZ: No, it chooses you.

The power dynamic doesn't go unnoticed by ranchers though, many of whom are already suspicious of the federal government.
As people head to their cars, they pass a for sale on the front lawn. The church, soon, may follow its congregants.
DAVIES: One of the other interesting things about the film is that you note how many businesses that were advertised in the Green Book were owned by African-American women.
As that became increasingly clear, a sort of testosterone hangover took hold in the nation's capital. Small crowds of Trump supporters, not quite willing to let the day's events go, dispersed slowly in front of an impassive line of police in riot gear and drifted down streets back toward their hotels.
Journalist Paula Span, who writes regularly about aging for The New York Times, published a recent feature about the widespread use and risks of benzos in the elderly, for whom they pose a particular danger.

Since the start of the month, the State Department has advised U.S. citizens not to travel to China, where the outbreak started. Most of the U.S. cases involved people who had traveled to China or abroad.
SIMON: Morning. And, you know, before we go to the playoffs, I know you've talked - been talking about this all week, but I want to ask you about what happened at Fenway Park. Monday, Adam Jones with the Baltimore Orioles heard racial taunts from a fan, bag of peanuts was thrown toward him.
No decision on Olympics, Trump says
Why, in this resolution, do you make a point of saying the United States bears disproportionate responsibility for the problem?
Let me also add that these examples of predictive multiverses are ad hoc constructs invented for the very reason of convincing skeptics that some types of multiverses can have observable consequences. Don't fall for it. Just because a theory is falsifiable doesn't mean it's scientific. For a theory to be scientific its predictions must also have a reasonable chance to accurately describe reality. Construing up one of an infinite number of multiverse variants has no reasonable chance.

The person Pourvahab does not sound like — at all — is his own country's foreign minister, Mohammad Javad-Zarif, who has called the deal a win-win solution for diplomacy and mutual respect.
I'll give you a crude analysis. I mean, if we had hour upon hours, I could get into much more depth and specificity. But here's my take on it: Over the last 10 years in our country, at least, we've seen an incredible amount of change — the Great Recession, the term Great Depression was already taken. But in America, then and today, people are literally walking around with the proverbial tin cup. Economic upheaval like we have not seen in generations. People lost their homes, they lost their jobs, many of whom will never be able to buy a home or have a permanent job again. People are reading about the browning of America and the immigrants are coming. And we had Barack Obama as president and then we had a women running as president and we had a Jew running for president and gay people can marry and: Oh my God, Oh my God. And then you talk about the impact of technology and automation ...
(SOUNDBITE OF SONG, WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN)
Moreover, women and nonwhite respondents are considerably more likely than men and white voters to say that their own vote won't be counted. And half of women and slightly more than half of nonwhite respondents said many votes will not be counted, in contrast to men and white Americans, who are more confident that all ballots will be tallied.
FLATOW: I'm having a senior moment about what's-his-name, the famous physicist who recently died who was the first proponent of that, in Texas. I'm forgetting what his name is.
And moments before Pence, at a White House briefing, somberly announced that some 2,500 passengers stranded on the Grand Princess cruise ship off the California coast would be brought to land to be tested and quarantined — Trump said he would rather they stay on the ship.
GROSS: That might sound like an expression of sympathy (laughter). But right after that, Rami Malek's character is offered money by the coffee shop owner to cover this up. And Elliot, Rami Malek's character, the hacker, says that he doesn't care about money. And it turns out he's tipped off the police. And as he gets up to leave the coffee shop, the police get out of their cars. And they start walking in to bust the coffee shop owner. It's a great scene, and it kind of hooks you right at that - right at episode 1. How did you get the part of Mr. Robot? You weren't very well-known at the time. I mean, Mr. Robot is really what made you well-known.
Three of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern Italy, Ferrer said at a news conference. Two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. The sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, Ferrer added.
People are looking for compromise right now, Miringoff said.
And it's taken me a long time to understand how deeply traumatic that was, that that experience remains an invisible brand stamped between my shoulder blades. And in many ways, I've been - I spent a lifetime trying to make sense of what that trauma has meant to me.

More than half a million people a month in the U.S. drive for Uber. The company has not disclosed how many choose to leave the platform. But as Sallenave acknowledges, in the gig economy it's easy to leave one job for another, to switch from Uber to competitor Lyft or a food delivery service.

This knee jerk reaction is to remove it, he says. But I really feel that's begging for history to repeat itself by not making all those moments teachable moments.
President Trump said last Friday, after the CDC updated guidelines were announced, that he would not follow them: Sitting in the oval office, behind that beautiful resolute desk, the great resolute desk, I think wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens. I don't know, somehow I don't see it for myself.
Hart, meanwhile, explored a fundamental shortcoming of contracts — namely, that no one can predict the future and there are too many future variables to possibly codify all of them in a contract.
Similarly, the prosecution struck prospective juror Eddie Hood because his son was the same age as the defendant. But the prosecution allowed white jurors with teenage sons to serve. When called on that, the prosecution shifted its focus to Hood's son, claiming he had been convicted of a similar crime — a claim the chief justice scoffed at, noting that Hood's son had been convicted five years earlier of stealing four hub caps.

Nixon himself was no environmentalist, Alagona says, but he realized during a time when there were many other extremely controversial, divisive issues like the Vietnam War for instance, that as American public concern grew about damage to the environment that this could potentially be a winning issue for him.
Days after its official publication, a new Trump administration rule dramatically overhauling the federal Title X family planning program is facing multiple legal challenges. Several medical and reproductive rights groups, as well as 21 state attorneys general, have filed lawsuits challenging the rule, which bans any organization that provides or refers women for abortions from receiving funds through the program to provide services such as contraception and STD screenings.

You may get a good price, but it also carries with it a lot of regulatory and political risk, Miller says. There's no good outcome for ratepayers under any scenario and not an ideal outcome for shareholders, either.
ALDA: Yeah. I was in a - not in school. I mean, it was after I was out of school that they were doing productions of it. But I got a - when I was a young, out-of-work actor, only about six or seven years after I stood in the wings watching them do it every day, every week, I got a call. A little theater in Illinois was doing it and, would I come out there and do it? Did I know the show and did I know the part? And I said, of course, I do. You know, when you're out-of-work actor, you say yes to everything.
Had Mississippi stayed with us instead of going as a block to Ford on the procedural question that we raised, I think we might have been nominated, says Reagan campaign manager John Sears. But it was that close.

A coalition of progressive groups say they are organizing a sweeping network to mobilize around climate change, racial and environmental justice, making a new unified push as President-elect Joe Biden is days away from taking office with Democrats set to control both the House and the Senate.
The 2016 election. There was Ukrainian interference in the election that will boggle the mind. He said it almost sounds like the Democrats are projecting what they did in Ukraine to Russia and blaming him for it. But there was complete involvement of the Ukrainian government from the president and all — and that Joe Biden played a material role in it. Originally, it was alleged that he helped to launder funds illegally to Hillary Clinton. I found no evidence of that, I should tell you. But then it was said to me that he — I'm not sure if Bart told me this or if he did it, maybe I didn't believe it. Then I met with the source after a week of due diligence, of checking him out and spent a lot of time with the source and with Bart. And the source told me, first of all, he said, I don't know this of my firsthand knowledge, very honest guy, I don't know it firsthand. But I go to Ukraine a lot. I spent a lot of time there. He had a bit of an investigatory background, which I can't — he had a bit of investigatory background, let me just say that. And he said, I've been told by many Ukrainians — and now it's so many I can't ignore it — a lot of things. Some of it I don't think is true, some of it I think is exaggerated, some of it I think is true, he said.
Trump put a stop to that talk, however. In September of last year, Trump told reporters that he had directed Pompeo to not get into the time game.
CISNEROS: But they think there's, like, microchips in the vaccines, or they think that there's, you know, really bad side effects. And so I think that's very demoralizing sometimes as a health care provider where you're doing everything - you're putting so much work. And then there's a stronghold on the other side increasing the spread.

DAVIES: The Green Book was published over, like, a 30-year span. But I'm curious whether the copy in the book addressed issues of racism and discrimination, or did it simply accept it as a fact of life and say, this is how we're going to get around it?
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: This is audio from a 1995 HBO TV special called Violence: An American Tradition.
SAGAL: So as we've discussed, you were the lead in The Shape Of Water, so we thought we'd ask you about actual shaped water - that is, ice and snow sculptures.
The researchers conducted a series of experiments that included 400 children. In one, they took 96 kids and asked them a series of questions about brilliance and gender. For example, they were told a brief story about a person who was really, really smart and then asked to pick the protagonist from four photos, two of men and two of women.
Some students also complained about the smell of the plastic backpacks. Student Kyrah Simon tweeted that the backpacks were a waste of community resources:
President-elect Joe Biden has promised principled diplomacy with North Korea, implying a break with President Donald Trump's high-stakes summits with Kim Jong Un. He has also indicated he will work more closely with U.S. allies South Korea and Japan.
MARTIN: Their answers for that question are different, too. It's going to shape Dan's political choice this year. He says he'll caucus for Elizabeth Warren for a lot of reasons, including her plans to fight climate change. Tim, on the other hand, is a conservative. His primary issue isn't climate change at all. It's the economy. And he's voting for Donald Trump. We say our goodbyes...

My mom had always known I disagreed with her and figured that was going to pass, but it didn't, he said. She looked at it as me getting vaccines for a gesture of rebellion and not for my own sake and for the sake of people around me.
...the challenge and the response is also unprecedented. I think this is quite true. I know we are doing our utmost to contain, control the virus, and provide treatment to the people, and reduce its impact on economic and social activities, and we're still doing whatever we can do right now.
GROSS: And you got this information from the 1870 census. So reading this - that she's a mulatto; she'd been a slave - the first question that comes to my mind - and I don't know if it was the first question that came to yours - was, was she raped by the man who owned her?
And that has profound implications, by the way. In fact, one of the biggest implications of dark energy - and I find it poetic - you ask me to wax poetic -I think one of the most poetic things is that it means the universe is speeding up.
LIASSON: The Washington Post said they broke the story when they had the story. Bernie Sanders didn't call the Post fake news or enemy of the people, but he sounded a lot like President Trump. To his credit, Sanders says he doesn't want Russian interference. Putin isn't a friend of his. He's making it clear that he is reacting to this news in a completely different way than Donald Trump, who denies Russian interference, pretends it isn't happening. But from what we know about the intelligence briefings, the intelligence community thinks that Russia seems to want Sanders to win the primary and Donald Trump to win the general election. And coincidentally or not, Donald Trump also wants Bernie Sanders to win the primary.
REUSS: I also wanted to be a baseball player - a doctor who played right field for the Yankees, I announced. I know. And then my father - remember; we're in the mid-'50s now - had to explain to me why girls couldn't play baseball. So my revenge is all my work in the women's movement.
The CDC has advised against nonessential travel to China and South Korea, countries that have seen the highest numbers of cases.
SAGAL: The citizens of Paris now have the freedom to say screw it, I want skittles and ground beef. A butcher has installed a 24-hour vending machine outside his shop. It offers everything from pork chops to a filet of beef. It works just like a vending machine does. You put in your money, select your meat, it pops out. There are some differences. Instead of crumbs or broken M&Ms scattered in that dispenser tray on the bottom, this one is filled with blood.

Going back to the Brett Kavanaugh hearings, do you regret how that unfolded for her [Christine Blasey Ford]?
NGUYEN: Yeah. I've asked my parents certain kinds of questions that I thought were the important ones, you know, about their life in general. And then there's certain things that I have - I don't know if I've passed over them deliberately or not. I just - why? Why reopen old wounds? I think that's been my parents' attitude towards many issues.

The session, which was scheduled to last eight hours on Wednesday, will continue for a further eight on Thursday. This stage in the proceedings comes a day after the president's legal team rested in its defense of Trump.

They're not going to take them away, but they are going to deny their ownership to our kids and grandkids, JT says. You know, when you've got big, big money coming out from foundations and donors to advocate for those soft bans, the NRA counters that. And though I don't agree with every piece of their message, they are effective at doing that. And I do think that that's very important that I participate in that.
Coca-Cola is also likely to face challenges in getting current Diet Coke drinkers to try to the new flavors. The company, which alienated customers in 1985 with a reformulated version of Coke, said it tested more than 30 flavor combinations before introducing the new products.

Patsy Reese. She held out her hand with instinctive courtesy. Her palm was overwarm and damp. Nevertheless Claire shook it firmly. I'm a photographer with Life magazine. Claire paused to let the name sink in. Life was wildly popular, the most popular magazine in the country, defining and reporting on everything that was newsworthy and exciting. We're doing a photo essay on penicillin, the medicine they're giving your husband. We're hoping other people will learn about the drug and be helped by it.
She added, Whether this is prosecutable is a different question from whether it's antithetical to the rule of law and the Constitution and democracy itself, and I would say clearly it is. It's very disturbing.

Many longtime residents told Tang the the new businesses aren't catering to them — an anecdote indicating a larger shift. In 2014, Tang published a report detailing how among the fastest growing U.S. cities between 2000 and 2010, Austin was the only city to see a decline in its black population.
In a statement offered by de Leon's office, Holder said he was honored to help the Legislature as it considers how to respond to potential changes in federal law that could impact California's residents and policy priorities.

However imperfect the TPP was, Hanson said, the U.S. did give China a lot more trading power by giving up the deal.
And then Mark Zuckerberg's intent was to go to more and more cities with this model and use his philanthropy to basically solve the urban education crisis. He's not trying to do that anymore, and he's not looking for far away cities with kind of star quality politicians leading them. He's already committed another $120 million, but he's committed it to schools and school districts around the Bay Area, where he is located, so that he and his staff can know the communities where they're going to be working and, as he said, know the desires of the communities and listen to the parents and the teachers and the educators and the community leaders to understand the complex needs of children. So it's a very, very different and much more humble approach to trying to change education.
So did that play a role in your choosing him, the fact that Republicans really do like him?
Four years later, the January 2005 joint session of Congress heard the Electoral College result from Bush's reelection over Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts (who did not attend). A House member of Ohio, Stephanie Tubbs Jones, rose to object to the count from her state. It mattered, because without Ohio's electoral votes, Bush would not have had the 270 needed to win.
Trump has also created new shock waves by saying — in this case quite clearly — that the U.S. can't default, because it prints money. That's true, but that doesn't mean it's good policy (as in, it could easily cause massive inflation).
If this bill passes, we will have an effort to repeal the bill, House GOP Leader John Boehner (R-OH), said on NBC's Meet the Press Sunday. I'd have a bill on the floor the first thing out.

Freelon appreciated the stance the Grammy nominees took to support diverse artists. I just couldn't think of another example in my memory of white men specifically revoking their privilege in this way, he says.
Whatever the reason, Ebeling says it didn't justify the risk.
OTIS: Well, it's a lot quieter than it was yesterday. The Colombian government has actually closed down the border to kind of take stock of what happened yesterday and try to get the bridge cleared off. There were aid trucks there that were burned yesterday that are still smoldering today as we speak. But the masses of people that filled this bridge yesterday are gone. I did run into about two dozen Venezuelan protesters. But they were pretty quickly scared off by the Venezuelan military. On the other side of the bridge, they shot off some tear gas and were actually throwing some rocks at the protesters. So it wasn't quite the violent scenes that we saw yesterday.
Voepel calls Cheryl Reeve Exhibit A of the evolved WNBA head coach. Great at working with talented professional players and getting them to play together, and an outstanding strategist who understands nuances of the game such as defending the pick and roll, or deciding when her team should gamble defensively. Reeve has become, says Voepel, the premiere coach in the league. Reeve was honored accordingly this year – she's the 2016 WNBA Coach of the Year. Also during this postseason, she passed her Detroit mentor Bill Laimbeer for most playoff victories in WNBA history.

In contrast to the NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll, Bandcamp recently announced a decision to stop ranking its year-end list, presenting albums thematically as an alternative that prioritizes storytelling. Time magazine has also published unranked lists including All-TIME 100 Novels and All-TIME 100 Movies, offering its critics' choices for the best of these forms since the magazine was founded in 1923. The ZORA Canon, the 100 greatest books ever written by African American women, published last January, offers an alternative canon to those like Time's, selected by a panel of experts with whom the editors worked to vet and shape the final list.

At the time, he and about 40 other educators were running for office in the state, wanting to make a change because, as Sheehan puts it, lawmakers weren't prioritizing education. Funding for schools in the state has been cut tremendously over the past decade and teachers in Oklahoma are some of the lowest paid in the country.
MONIZ: Exactly. And of course we are already about 1 degree on the path to that 2 degrees. So there's no doubt we have to pick up the pace. And there are some elements of optimism here. First is that the states which have been the leaders in driving low carbon continue to do so - and in fact cities as well. Secondly, starting right after President Trump's announcement on the Paris Agreement, the reality is an enormous part of the business community came forward and said, we're staying the course. And we've seen, if anything, a pickup in that commitment in the last years. We are seeing the oil companies, the big utilities all going in this direction.
A critical risk rating, for example, means credible evidence of forced labor or child labor has been found within the fishery itself. Albacore, skipjack and yellowfin tuna caught by the Taiwanese fleet gets a critical risk rating. A low risk fishery, like Patagonian toothfish in Chile (also known as Chilean seabass), is one with good regulatory protections and enforcement, with no evidence of abuses in related industries.

Prior to the ACA, employers could delay covering workers' chronic and other health conditions for up to a year after they became eligible for a plan. Under the ACA, that's no longer allowed.

KAPLAN-LEVENSON: OK. Now back to Victoria Nourse who, if you remember, didn't identify as a feminist, hadn't learned any of this history in law school and had no plans to make gender a focus of her career in any way - until Joe Biden told her to take on the issue of violence against women. All of the history I just described was new to Victoria but ancient history nonetheless. She had to catch up on what was on the law books now - or in 1990.
So, that's sort of one approach. There also are some experimental hints that this actually is a better way of describing existing data. So there are a number of avenues of thought that lead to this idea, and we'll look for the particles and see if they're found.
GATES: No. Race is a social construction. But mutations exist. Biology matters. When my daughters were born, I had them tested for sickle cell because - black people are not the only people in the world that have sickle cell. But we have a disproportionately higher risk of sickle cell. You might have prostate cancer that runs in your family. You might have breast cancer. We know that BRCA1, BRCA2 - they're genetic. And if you're Ashkenazi Jewish, you might have a higher risk for those kind of things or Tay-Sachs. You can say on the one hand that race is a social construction. But on the other hand, you can't say that biology doesn't matter because it does matter. So I just wrote an essay that was published by Yale University Press about race. And the title is Race Is A Social Construction, But Mutations Are Real (ph).

Nathan says the Daly twins are not an anomaly. Eating better and exercising is incredibly effective in helping to manage Type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes. Though Paul Daly is living with the disease, he has been able to make progress by stepping up his daily walks. His battle is tougher than his brother's, so he has vowed to try harder. And there is now strong evidence that exercise — even in the absence of weight loss — can help improve blood sugars.

This is FRESH AIR. On Sunday, Alan Alda will receive the life achievement award from the Screen Actors Guild. The SAG award acknowledges both Alda's humanitarian efforts and his long list of acting roles for the large and small screen. His starring film roles include California Suite, Crimes and Misdemeanors and The Seduction Of Joe Tynan. But his most famous role is on TV as Dr. Hawkeye Pierce. He was drafted during the Korean War and assigned to a mobile army surgical hospital, a MASH unit. Alda won several Emmys for that series, for writing and directing as well as acting. In the very first words we heard Alan Alda speak as Hawkeye in the 1972 pilot, he was reading from a letter he was writing to his father back home.
Abu Saud has to bring in his two sons — both are doctors — to help run his shops.

Specifically, he said, announcements are coming soon about NPR's use of temporary employees, who have been a mainstay of the newsroom for years. He said, A) there were too many of them and b) we weren't doing a very good job of looking after them and making sure they were integrated into the organization. We're going to announce some steps very soon around that which will include better training, and possibly evaluation systems so they know where they stand and what they need to work on so they don't feel that they're just wandering around the building without ever getting any feedback. Additionally, NPR is looking at whether it should make some of the temporary positions into full-time staff jobs, he said.

And another experiment asked 6- and 7-year-olds about the appeal of two similar imaginary games, one intended for children who are really, really smart, and one for children who try really, really hard.

From that point on, David and Linda find themselves living in a reality far different to the one they imagined and far funnier in part because its stars are so perfectly matched.
Now, the people in this area felt that those kinds of per home, per farm investments are OK because what the Internet can do for education and health care is amazing.

But I was concerned that - I was concerned about what would happen after the show went into production. I didn't know if Larry would be part of it. And I was worried that it would become a high jinks at the front and that the war would just sort of exist as a pretext for silly stories.

It was a terrible, terrible idea. And you don't lie to the American people. And that's what's been going on. The American people have been lied to chiefly by Donald Trump. And lies have consequences. And those consequences are now found in five dead Americans in a Capitol building that's in shambles. And there's a lot of work that has to be done to rebuild, and legislators should not be aiding and abetting those kinds of lies.
It's a million dollar question, isn't it, says Heather Barr, co-director of the women's rights division at Human Rights Watch, who has done research in Afghanistan for the group. She says for years, international aid spending in Afghanistan was chaotic and largely focused on short-term goals. It wasn't meant to solve complicated problems like malnutrition, which isn't just about providing food aid. It must be addressed by other development efforts ranging from improved access to water to educating women about proper nutrition.

Democrats also objected to the wording of the section pertaining to votes to call new witnesses before the Senate.

Adrian Burgos Jr., a professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in Latino and sports history, says there is a history of English-language media being insensitive in the coverage Latino players have received in the past.

Hart says she chose the name because of Dirty Dancing and plans to raise Baby exclusively in round rooms, so nobody can put Baby in a corner. Benz named her baby Baybi years ago, though she spells it B-A-Y-B-I. It is pronounced baby. Benz is reportedly outraged that Hart copied her baby Baybi's name for her baby Baby. As an influencer, the last thing she would ever want to do is to influence somebody. It is not yet clear if either mother will change Baby's name as Baby grows to a more mature name - for example, Old Baby. We'll see.

So that's something that I inherited from my mom — that in my family we're not quick to anger, if anything, obviously there are moments where you find things ridiculous or ludicrous, but not quick to anger, rather find a way to laugh about it or to minimize it using humor. ...
Russia's intervention also made clear it would defend the Mediterranean naval base it's had since Soviet times, and Russia also added an new air base in the same region. Even as it draws down, Russia plans to keep about 1,000 military personnel at the two bases, according to Russian officials.

Democrats plan to tweak the rules so that a motion to vacate can only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either the House Republican Conference or the House Democratic Caucus agrees to do so. The change limits the ability of any one member to wreak havoc on the floor and ultimately bolsters incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., against potential agitators in either party.
In Colorado, SEIU Local 105 health care organizing director Stephanie Felix-Sowy said her team is fielding dozens of calls a month from nonunion workers interested in joining. Not only are nurses and respiratory therapists reaching out, but dietary workers and cleaning staff are as well, including several from rural parts of the state where union representation has traditionally been low.
It does not help, of course, that 2020 is also a political year in which we have elections for president, Congress, and other offices. Political awareness is everywhere; political antennae are extended to the max. Everything that happens is instantly interpreted for its prospective election impact.
This year it may be an issue. In fact I think it is, in part because of the circus that has been the presidential campaign season so far.
To this point, the West Coast has borne the brunt of coronavirus in the U.S., with the bulk of confirmed cases so far reported in California and Washington state. But that's likely to change soon, with reports of cases now in Florida, New York and the Washington, D.C., area.

But that behind of mine, that backside of the fish man — which was very sexy — that sexy backside came at a cost. There was no back flap.

Guillén also joked that when you're good you don't need to learn English, but if you're not you had better learn English. However, he did say it was important that players learn English. But he added that a language barrier is accompanied by a cultural barrier in how that language is used: what is being said and how it is interpreted by the public. Guillén says that gap in cultural translation landed him in trouble because what is appropriate in Spanish and his culture might not be perceived the same way in the U.S.

Armed with gloves and a small kit the size of four decks of cards, they did basic tests for five hours a day out in the hot sun. The Akvo app on their mobile phones let them log, map, and upload data on contamination and chemical run off.

But thank you for writing this because you make me feel better.

Of the 14 men featured in the Haikus with Hotties calendar, 13 are pursuing careers as entertainers (the sole exception being Mr. December, Viet Pham, a chef from Utah who bested Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America), including several viral video producers, a stand-up comic, a reality TV star, and actors with credits in film and television. There was a political angle to the calendar, that there should be more hot Asian men in Hollywood, says Tseng. I would guess that most of the guys, if not all, in the calendar have been asked about this issue at some point in their careers.
GROSS: That was my next question. Yeah.

The bureau usually takes about five months after the end of counting to review the results of each once-a-decade census to make sure no resident is counted more than once or in the wrong place. But after ending counting early in October, the Trump administration forced the bureau to cut short the time for running quality checks to try to get the first set of results out before Inauguration Day.

The Catholic Church remained quiet during the country's heated debate this spring, and the clear embrace of abortion rights undermines its legacy. It is the final nail in the coffin for them. They're no longer the pillar of society, and their hopes of re-establishing themselves are gone, Gail McElroy, a professor of politics at Trinity College Dublin, told The New York Times.
Before the outbreak, the bureau estimated that about 7.9 million households — or just over 5% of the around 147 million home addresses it's planning to include in the 2020 census — will be counted using administrative records, according to a regulatory document filed in January with the White House's Office of Management and Budget.
The constitutional amendment proposed by lawmaker and former cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova — who gained fame in 1963 as the first woman in space — resets the current term limits, which limit Russian presidents to two consecutive six-year terms.

Mrs. Claire continued to use her married name, both because she'd made her reputation with it and because it felt like a protection for her son. The stigma of divorce was bad enough; she didn't want the parents of Charlie's friends to wonder if he'd been born out of wedlock.

GONYEA: It could be. There won't be many more opportunities like a debate. But Biden's lead and his momentum will be extremely tough for Sanders to overcome, even with a lot of primaries to go. Sanders himself is admitting that his broad movement of especially young voters has not been showing up at the polls quite as he expected. Last week, he gave a speech that really made it clear, A, he is not dropping out. But there was also a shift in tone. He's not pushing for Biden and the Democratic Party to address the issues he's been running on and those issues that are so important to young voters. And he says to the future of the party. On Wednesday, he even gave Biden a heads up of how that would go.

Russia has taken hits on other fronts as well. Assad and his government are dominated by Alawites, an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

We were working with over 100 developers of tests during that period of time, including commercial laboratories. And David, it's really important understand getting an accurate and reliable test on the market's important. Our team can provide you with an abstract that was recently published in the literature about a test that was performed in another country that demonstrated a 47% false positive rate. Now, think about that, David. What that means is that if you had a positive test, it was pretty close to a flip of a coin as to whether it was real or not. And that's not to beat up that one test. It's just to point out to you that this is not as simple as folks might think. Our manufacturers that we've been working with throughout these last couple of months have told us that it normally takes them six months to develop a test and they've done it in four to six weeks in collaboration with the FDA.
The change in releasing more of the previously reserved doses of vaccine preempts a policy change the Biden team announced last week. Officials from the Biden team declined to comment on Tuesday's policy announcements.
Today, Medicaid pays for all the care people need, and state and federal governments share the cost.
Hospitalizations and deaths are more concrete numbers, but they're delayed. So trends aren't seen for weeks since it takes more time for patients to develop serious symptoms. Hospitals and public health officials have also been unable or have refused to release hospitalization data.

Dr. D'ELIA: Well, they were very fortunate. They got in early, and they did get permission from incident command to do it. They had NSF rapid funds, as Linda does, and they used very sophisticated instrumentation not available to the government to find this oil. And I think that is -another dimension here is the way that the government does its science is really pretty conservative and based on established and old practices. And the way that the research community and the academic world operates were constantly trying to be at the cutting edge. And I think the Woods Hole group was definitely in that area.
Many Stoneman Douglas students took issue with the clear backpacks they're required to carry. The bags were donated to the school by Walmart and the Broward Education Foundation, the Sun-Sentinel newspaper reported.

Wey says that when customers come up to his window to place an order, he tells them that his food stall aims to engage people on the topic of racial income and wealth disparities and to share statistics on these disparities. He then informs them that customers who identify as white are being asked to pay the higher $30 price to reflect these disparities. Customers also have the option to pay the listed $12 price. The difference between the $12 and $30 meals, all customers are informed, will be redistributed to minorities who buy food at the stall. How do white customers react to the proposition?

KATE PAYNE, BYLINE: This year, Iowa Democrats are allowing what they're calling satellite caucuses. They're places for people to go to participate that aren't their regular neighborhood precincts. Some are at hospitals to catch people on the night shift, others at college campuses. And there'll be a site here at Hoover Elementary School in suburban Cedar Rapids. It's geared towards people whose native language isn't English.
NOURSE: There are two things that are happening in their arguments. One, they're demeaning the problem as insignificant and not significant for a federal judge. So it doesn't matter. You can go back to state law. Whatever Mississippi said is fine, even if what Mississippi says is entirely different from Alaska. There's nothing federal about this, where federal means something important, right? The second thing they're saying is they're feeding into the very stereotypes the law was supposed to push against. From the very first witnesses, they were telling us stories about how they weren't believable, that they weren't credible.

DUNNE: (As Sandra) It's cold out.
He explains this in a series of illustrative anecdotes about cases he handled over his years as an assistant U.S. attorney, then as a full-fledged U.S. attorney, as the deputy attorney general to John Ashcroft under President George W. Bush and finally as FBI director. He cites an early case in his career where the actual currency seized in a raid had been replaced with an equal cash value in different denominations. He brings this to the attention of judge and jury knowing it may cost him a conviction.
Mr. WEINBERG: Yes, exactly, and that's a problem that faced a lot of us for decades, and many of us assumed, well, we know it's 120 orders of magnitude smaller than we would naively expect. So clearly it's zero, for some reason that we haven't yet been smart enough to figure out.

ESPUELAS: Well, I think ultimately there is national consensus. Gallup published a poll about a month ago or so which showed over 70 percent of Americans want immigration reform with a path toward citizenship. But at the same time, there is a group within the Republican Party - maybe the Tea Party would be the right name for it - that is adamantly against it and has pledged to oppose it. So since we've learned with the shutdown that perhaps Speaker Boehner is not totally in charge of his caucus, he might want to bring it up, but that may not mean that they will bring it up.

On Sunday evening, a member of the state election board called for an investigation into whether any part of the call constituted criminal behavior. David Worley, a senior Democrat on the board, wrote a letter to Raffensperger asking him to launch an investigation of the call to determine whether violations of the provisions of the Official Code of Georgia Annotated which prohibit solicitation to commit election fraud have occurred. Worley said the election board could then determine whether there's a possible crime to refer to Georgia prosecutors.

But when it's clear the Nazi's are coming to power, she rejects him to save herself. And she sings this song, What Would You Do? as if to ask, if you were in her position, would you stand up for your principles or save yourself? Let's hear a little bit of the song.

BUSH: You know, I come from protests. You know, I've been to hundreds of protests, even though this was not a protest. But the idea that I am seated now to be able to affect change with stuff like this, with an insurrection like this - because I am seated, that gives me hope. And it also helps me to remember my place. You know, my place is to use what I know. Watching what happened on the television and looking out of the door, seeing what was happening while I was there - it's not what we were doing fighting for Black lives. This is not it. We were fighting in defense of people's lives, making sure that people could have a decent quality of life. And the thing is, what we were witnessing today was a bunch of people who were upset because they want to side with a president who is not for all the people; a president who has decided that he wants to hold on to something that isn't his. And so they want to stand with a person, with a character, with a personality versus making sure that they are upholding and uplifting our democracy. So that's what we were witnessing. It was not a protest. It was a coup. It was a domestic terror attack.

REUSS: Then, of course, as I start working on it, my cousin comes up - whisper, whisper - well, just that he - you know why I got divorced? 'Cause he just beat the you-know-what out of me.

And she says that she became a social worker 'cause her first husband - I always wondered why they all got divorced. And she said, don't tell anybody. And I'm going - oh, my God.
But, of course, with great power comes great responsibility. The Marvel universe is also full of villains who are equally adept at using science for, you know, evil. So these stories are not just about science, they are also about the choices individuals make with the power science and technology can grant. Much ink (and many electrons) has been spilled over the links between superhero stories and the storehouse of myth all human culture draws from. It was Joseph Campbell who first articulated the universal myth of the hero's journey when a man or women undergoes superhuman tests to bring back some boon to their community. At their best, superhero comics have found ways to personalize these struggles by imagining how science-granted superpowers do not change the dynamics of human longing or grief. Heroism then becomes recognizing there must be a repayment made to the human community.

Well, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination is finally going national this week. It has been state by state until now, but tomorrow, voters in 14 states will have their say. If we look at the delegate count, the front-runners are Bernie Sanders, who has won two of the four contests so far, and Joe Biden, who secured a big victory in South Carolina over the weekend. They will be up against one fewer candidate after Pete Buttigieg ended his campaign last night. He addressed his supporters in his hometown of South Bend, Ind.

Eight years earlier, Nixon himself had been the vice president and had presided over the counting of the electoral votes by which he lost his White House bid to Democrat John F. Kennedy. In the course of that count, Nixon was even called upon to choose which slate of electors to honor from the new state of Hawaii. The first tabulation of votes in the islands had favored Nixon, but a recount put Kennedy ahead. So two slates were submitted, both with the governor's signature.

But that is not the only possible way to imagine these things, right? There is going to be accountability for this, which is that these movements are going to become politically isolated. The politicians who support them are going to become politically isolated. We're already seeing that happen. I think that this is going to be a turning point in the kind of extremist Trump ideology, and I think that the voters of Georgia helped cement this, because this problem didn't just emerge yesterday on Capitol Hill. This was in Charlottesville. This was in the streets of Portland, Oregon. This is an ongoing problem. And I think a majority of Americans have spoken clearly against this approach. And I think that trend is going to continue.

Immediately after the November election, misinformation was warped — some unwittingly, some in deliberate disinformation campaigns — into broader conspiracy theories. One theory alleged that widespread voter fraud had occurred at the absentee counting board in Detroit. Another claimed a clerical error in a rural Michigan county was evidence of a Dominion Voting System software manipulation. In Wayne County, some argued that disagreements should have prevented the certification of election results.
In the 1960s, when almost all of the situation comedies were dumbed-down fantasy shows like My Mother The Car, The Dick Van Dyke Show was a singularly modern and believable comedy about, in part, a loving husband and wife.

But for Loeffler, he said, there was no indication in a post-President Trump world, what kind of representative she would be. We had two years of Senator Perdue before President Trump. I knew what that was. I knew what that looked like.

Other choices fared less well. The replacement of Scott Pelley with Jeff Glor as anchor of the CBS Evening News caused some internal dissent. It was also accompanied by falling ratings.
WOOD JR: I need that in a bag. What do you need a bag for? I don't understand why you need a bag. It's wasteful. Recycle. Don't you care about the Earth? I go, sir, this has nothing to do with the Earth. I'm a black man in America. I've got to leave this store with a bag, bro.

YOUNG: Well, I can't say it's the new normal forever because it may change. Right now, it's normal. And it was a - it's a, again, a result, I think - and I'm very critical of the media because we do not get news anymore. We get opinions. It's opinionated information. And so they don't really look or read or understand that there is another side to the issue. And again, we are a reflection - the Congress is a reflection of the people they represent. That's all we are. And if the public has this feeling we can't work together, the Congress is not going to work together.
GROSS: One of my favorite recordings on this collection is sung by Linda Emond, who is the performer who I heard in the role that Lotte Lenya originated in Cabaret. I saw Linda Emond in the revival of it. And on this new collection of your songs, she sings a song that you and Fred Ebb wrote for the musical adaptation of the Thornton Wilder play, The Skin Of Our Teeth.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates only 54% of children who take asthma medications use them as prescribed, which can lead to more frequent, and severe, asthma attacks.

So they're taking these big drilling pipes and shoving them back down the hole and these gigantic steel blocks on top of that to seal off this blowout, McCauley says. It worked, but only for a few minutes.
These are called peremptory strikes, and in 1986, the court faced up to the fact that they can sometimes mask racial discrimination. The justices ruled that if minorities are disproportionately excluded from a jury panel, the prosecution has to justify its peremptory strikes with non-racial explanations.
OTIS: Well, you know, some of them have just gotten, you know, more radical. And some are calling, you know, for a U.S. invasion or some kind of a foreign intervention to help them out. After the violence broke out yesterday, I met a young lawyer named Lizbeth (ph). She didn't want to give her full name because she still has a lot of family back in Venezuela. After losing her job, she came to Colombia with her husband and three children. And I met her under a bridge pouring sand, motor oil and gasoline into beer bottles. So here's this lawyer making Molotov cocktails to throw at the soldiers. And this is what she had to say.

It's a deep hole. Yet it's not a hole that prevents the theory from working. Quantum physics is, by any measure, astonishingly successful. It's the theory that underpins nearly all of modern technology, from the silicon chips buried in your phone to the LEDs in its screen, from the nuclear hearts of the most distant space probes to the lasers in the supermarket checkout scanner. It explains why the sun shines and how your eyes can see. Quantum physics works.

True story: This past Valentine's Day I was walking out of the office when I overheard a group of younger colleagues saying that they were staying in to watch the sequel to Netflix's To All the Boys I've Loved Before, called P.S.

The audit comes as Georgia's legislature gets back to action, and some Republican lawmakers have promised to crack down on absentee ballots after spending weeks spreading misinformation and false claims of fraud.
GROSS: Why were you even booked in places that had such a kind of racist audience?
Those themes have been echoed and amplified on countless media platforms that regularly support the president. On Fox and Friends last Friday, viewers saw Jerry Falwell Jr., the president of the evangelical Liberty University founded by his televangelist father, explaining why his school would stay open when so many others were sending students home. Falwell wondered whether it was all a conspiracy between China and North Korea, then he turned his fire on the media, saying: It's just strange to me how many are overreacting. It makes you wonder if there's a political reason ... their next attempt to get Trump.
Grimes says her sister couldn't afford the new marketplace premium and had to drop her plan last year. After that, the Social Security Administration denied her appeal to reinstate her Part B coverage with no penalty or wait period. Then she learned about the new Medicare waiver — from a Missouri counselor at the State Health Insurance Assistance Program.
QUINONES: I think they are seeing a groundswell of concern across the country and communities everywhere because this is a problem. Opiate addiction is a problem all across the country from coast to coast. They're also seeing, of course, as you mentioned, dozens of lawsuits filed by states' attorneys general, by counties, by towns alleging that several companies, Purdue foremost among them, lead a kind of a campaign to dupe the public into believing that their drug was not addictive. And these lawsuits, particularly in the last - I would say - year and a half, have really gained steam as local entities, counties and towns, have seen themselves buckling under the cost of paying for the consequences of this epidemic and having done nothing to really create it - are looking for ways of paying for the increase in foster care that they now have to provide, the full jails, the courts that are that are overwhelmed with new addicts.
These days, I rely on a digital calendar synced to my email and smartphone; I couldn't tell you the last time I consulted a paper calendar hanging anywhere, least of all the bathroom (though at my mom's house, that decorating choice still persists).
Mr. ALLEN: Sure. Well, look. I think you can always find individual problems of abuse if you're looking around. But let me take a step back and say that I think from the beginning, what we now talk about is the sexual abuse crisis in the Catholic Church has really been two interlocking, but distinct problems. There's the problem of priests who abused, and there's the problem of bishops who covered it up - that is, who should have known better and failed to act.
Can you imagine telling someone they can never have another french fry or potato chip? It's like people will give up right away! Tim says he recalls thinking.
So Sankarnarayan launched an app called Climatix to measure climate resilience by crowdsourcing.
And the recently-strong economy is a particularly appropriate topic in South Carolina, which is tied with two other states for the lowest unemployment rate in the nation, at 2.3%. And two of the other three early states, New Hampshire and Iowa, are also among the 10 states with the lowest unemployment. That has made these early states a test for Democrats of their economic messages amid a good job market in particular.

Mr. CHESNUTT: It's from McTeague, a Frank Norris book, and I wrote it down in my notebook, where I write lines that I come across. And it was a very telling line because I was coming to see myself as a coward, and it was a very illuminating line in my own personal story.
A Hong Kong woman who suggested last week that her husband had been abducted by Chinese police has withdrawn her missing person's report.
Before, when the Christians had a party, they slaughtered a chicken. Now, they slaughter a goat, says Pokharel, who has been reporting on the conversions. That extra meat, he explains, is necessary to feed all of the new people who've joined the guest list.
SHAPIRO: And we heard a bit of that apology. What else can you tell us about his response?
So it was the 9th screenplay of Woody's that I read in four days, and it was the best one. And it was one of those times when you - well, your heart starts beating faster, and adrenaline starts flowing. First of all, it was the biggest male role he'd ever written outside of the Woody Allen character because his protagonists generally have been women - Diane Keaton, Mia Farrow, even recently Gena Rowlands, Geraldine Page in Interiors. So he'd never really written a big male character that wasn't played by Woody.
JONES: That's when you know they sculpted a fine ass, OK?
ROXANNE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the problem with that is that if the eggs drop they're going to break.
Those penalties — $695 or 2.5 percent of your household income, whichever is greater — are also in force for 2018 coverage. But starting next year, you won't owe a penalty no matter how long you may be uninsured. The tax reform law eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance in 2019.
Workers were also busy improving roads across from the Navy base last week in a housing complex known as the Airmen Neighborhood. Lined up to look like a Russian MiG jet when viewed from above, the apartments and homes were built for pilots who worked at the former Warsaw Pact base.

For centuries, progress in the foundations of physics has been characterized by simplification. Complex processes — such as the multitude of chemical reactions — turned out to arise from stunningly simple underlying equations. And simplicity carried us a long way. According to physicists' best theories today, everything in our universe emerges from merely 25 elementary particles and four types of forces.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Since we have you on the line, I'd like to ask you this past week, as I'm sure you know, the Department of Homeland Security kicked residents of an entire state, New York, off its global entry program because of New York's so-called immigrant sanctuary laws. President Trump is threatening to expand that list. LA is a sanctuary city. Are you worried?
Those comments range from short expletives and insults aimed at DeVos, to personal and sometimes graphic accounts of sexual assaults,and pleas not to return to the bad ol' days, when victims were not believed and incidents were swept under the rug.

Right now, another holiday surge of COVID-19 is crushing California's hospitals. Every day, the virus is killing an average of 360 people across the state.

RICHEN: Yeah. Yeah, I mean, I would imagine that there is certain - you know, he knew what he had to do in order to get wide distribution.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Several European countries yesterday gave Maduro an ultimatum - call new elections within a week, or we'll recognize the opposition leader Juan Guaido as president. Maduro, in an interview broadcast this morning, rejected that demand. It's been four days since Guaido declared himself Venezuela's interim president before a vast crowd of supporters. Yet the actual levers of power remain with Maduro and the ruling Socialist Party. Joining me now is NPR's Philip Reeves, who is in Caracas. Good morning.
Janet Merlo and Linda Davidson, the former Mounties who filed the two separate class actions, welcomed Paulson's apology at the emotional news conference. According to The Toronto Star, while serving in the force, Merlo endured sexist comments, sexual pranks, verbal abuse and double standards, while Davidson was groped by a male supervisor who shoved his hands down her shirt and grabbed her breast.
While scientists disagree about what's behind the sluggish ocean current, the shift could mean bad news for the climate. The Atlantic Meridional overturning circulation [AMOC] – often called the conveyor belt of the ocean – exchanges warm water from the equator with cold water in the Arctic.
INSKEEP: You also have DHS leaders, former DHS leaders - five of them, including John Kelly, the former White House chief of staff and the president's DHS secretary - saying that it's unconscionable that Homeland Security workers are not being paid. We have the FBI Agents Association saying that investigations are being hampered. So that leads to another question. If the shutdown leads to a terror attack that gets Americans killed, is the wall worth that - yes or no?

I think it's not exactly the right time to call China a currency manipulator right now, the president told the crowd.
In a Jan. 31 op-ed for CNN, Hathloul's brother Walid wrote that his sister described being taken at midnight to a 'palace of terror' that is 10 minutes away from the prison. She said she was taken blindfolded and thrown into the trunk of a car on the way to this secret place. The torture sessions, she said, normally occur in the basement of this palace.
LANGFITT: And so the key points here is what Boris Johnson is focusing on, Renee, is really the domestic situation, the economy. And the argument he's making is, well, when we're free from the European Union, we can build a better economy, a fairer economy for other parts of England, for instance, that are post-industrial that haven't been doing very well. The one word he never mentioned was the word Brexit because it's totally toxic.

Many Oregonians were outraged this week when a new law took effect allowing motorists in rural counties to pump their own gas, representing a shift in the state's decades-long history of requiring an attendant to pump gas for drivers.
NOURSE: There were times working on it that I got flooded. There are times when I didn't know if I could continue. And it was an extraordinary awakening.
But I think you take a view. It's this sort of rule that you judge every situation on its own merits. And there was another situation in the series when - there was a difference - where we took a different view. But in that particular case, I think, you just observe what you're seeing. And let nature take its course.
I don't think people will [see] Bernie … as someone who can really unify the whole country, she says. I think people are looking for a more civil approach to doing things, a more civilized proposal for talking to people and a more civilized approach with a candidacy.

But the question when you have a team like Milwaukee is, are they built for 162, or are they built for 81 and 100? In other words, somewhere in there in those dog days of August, are they going to realize, oh, we're tired, and, oh, we're not supposed to be that good. And, suddenly, the moment begins to overtake them. If not, could be a very exciting year. The Milwaukee Brewers have not been to the World Series since when, Scott? 1982. A good year, wasn't it?
After Haley gave the Republican response to President Obama's seventh and final State of the Union address this week, some conservatives were not impressed. Haley said in her speech that fixing immigration means welcoming properly vetted legal immigrants, regardless of their race or religion. Just like we have for centuries. She offered a tacit rebuke of Donald Trump when she said, During anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation.
Getting that recognition is a goal of the Colorado-based group called Wrestle Like A Girl. Sally Roberts, a two-time World bronze medal winner and three-time U.S. National Champion wrestler, founded the organization to provide resources for women seeking to wrestle in college. Roberts, a 37-year-old former Marine, says the sport changed the course of her life from a young age. It's a sport that teaches girls life skills and how to own their space, own their bodies, own their voices, she said.

Here's the problem we have, though: If in fact we've gotten to the point where they can't confirm somebody because a Democratic president is nominating them, what's to stop them from saying next year, We've got another excuse for not confirming a Democratic president's nominee?

JAKE SWAMP AND THE PINE: (Singing) We should left long ago and just gotten out of town.
RICHEN: You know, I think it's because the South had legal segregation. I mean, it was legal. And that's where you know, obviously, with the history of slavery and all that, there was a system that was set up to discriminate against African-Americans. And in the North and the West, that system was not as sort of visible, even though it was still there. So I think that the - those sundown towns, I mean, there were - you know, they were all over. And that racism that was throughout the country, these were specific places where African-Americans were either run out of the towns for various reason, or they just never allowed African-Americans to live in that town.
BUSH: You know, I don't know that it will calm it, but I will say I'm excited about it. And we are all going to work together. This is what we need right now to fix what Donald Trump is broken.

I finished the first class asking students what they expect from a teacher. The answers were great: be passionate about the subject matter; be available to students after class; be clear about expectations; have a sense of humor. I reminded them that I was once a student, too, and I swore then that if I ever became a teacher, I'd never repeat the things I hated in my teachers. At least, I try not to. But then I reminded them that the onus is not all mine. That to learn you must engage with the subject matter, that learning is an active state, not a passive one. Finally, I reminded them that not even the best teacher in the world can teach someone who doesn't want to learn.
Nah, that's impossible, James told reporters Friday. I ain't playing. If I ain't got the fans in the crowd, that's what I play for. I play for my teammates. I play for the fans.

In the heart of New York City, the obvious birds one might first expect to spot are pigeons, or perhaps more accurately, rock doves. But through their binoculars, the Brooklyn Bird Club managed to spot 43 different species of bird.
That MASSIVE trade deficit is what we're going to focus on here. Trump often brings up trade deficits with other countries, but economists say that this is the wrong way to think about trade deficits. Moreover, to cast trade deficits as uniformly bad — as some sort of score of who's winning and losing in global economics — ignores the substantial gains that countries make from trade.
Harvard Professor's Arrest Raises Questions About Scientific Openness
FAVREAU: You know, I think it's tempting at first to use a speech like this to only look backwards and sort of talk about all the accomplishments and the administration, everything that we've achieved. And I think there'll be a little bit of that. But for the president, it's more important right now to look forward with this speech. I think in some ways, this is the morning in America speech in response to the malaise speech that the Republican candidates have been giving the entire primary season.
In a word, time. Dr. Larry Corey is a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and helps lead the COVID-19 Prevention Network, a federally funded consortium of vaccine experts who've been testing vaccines.

Truth be told, I believe that the plan was that she would then get that degree and come back and have a good arranged marriage in India, but my mother being who she was, the daughter of a father who fought for India's independence, she was naturally attracted to the civil rights movement that was exploding all over the United States — but also in the Bay Area... She became very involved in the civil rights movement, and met my father. Instead of going back to India and having an arranged marriage, she had a marriage based on love. And that really was, in many ways, an ultimate act of courage and optimism and really set in place the foundation for how I think of the world.

Springfield's population is older, less educated and whiter than national averages. And that population has fallen over the years — from more than 80,000 in the 1970s to less than 60,000 today. Many young people go to college and leave — the brain drain.
Well, you know, I — I — that just shows his wisdom once again, because when it comes to things like getting — being nominated for the Supreme Court, it's probably always wise to not count your chickens before they're hatched.
Bernie believes that the path toward bold change requires leaders to take back control of state capitols around the country and ensure fair redistricting in 2020, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver wrote in a release announcing the endorsements.

Yet the hole remains: Despite the wild success of the theory, we don't really understand what it says about the world around us. The mathematics of the theory makes incredibly accurate predictions about the outcomes of experiments and natural phenomena. In order to do that so well, the theory must have captured some essential and profound truth about the nature of the world around us. Yet there's a great deal of disagreement over what the theory says about reality — or even whether it says anything at all about it.

The mystery of who did it was quickly solved as a TikTok video of 17-year-old Nathaniel Rogers (ph) spraying the words on the wall went viral. But then a second TikTok video of a different 17-year-old by the name of Cole Yang (ph) also spray painting the exact same words on the blank door also went viral. Obviously, I'm King Steez, Rogers stated in a follow up video, calling Yang a loser and a poser. Yang responded with a video in which he says he is the rightful King Steez and is willing to take Rogers to court to prove it if, quote, that's even a thing. Police solved the crime by seizing the students' phones and examining the videos they found there. In one, Rogers spray paints the words on the door. In another, Yang gives the door a fresh, clean coat of paint and then spray paints the same words himself. In a third, Rogers paints over Cole's work and then paints the same words for the third time. At this point, the police gave up looking at the video, saying it was like watching paint dry.
INSKEEP: Well, tell me about something else that I think is in peoples' heads and that is part of the argument here. There's a sense that jobs may well be created. But jobs are also destroyed. People are thrown out of work. And the people who are really profiting are investors or stockholders. It may be good for the broader economy to do a trade deal. But it's really people at the top who are benefiting. Is that statistically true?
GROSS: Can I ask you about the neighborhood you grew up in and if your parents worked, what they did for a living?
ROCCA: Do you have a Clydesdale in your marching band?
For her part, Clinton did almost as well as Trump in percentage terms with 58 percent, while she outpolled Trump in the raw vote by nearly half a million. She did not dominate the delegate count quite as much as Trump, but only because the Democrats divide their delegates proportionally — both statewide and district by district. She took home an estimated 135 new delegates to Sanders' 104. She already had 39 of the state's 44 superdelegates (who are free to change their minds).
This is FRESH AIR. I'm David Bianculli, editor of the website TV Worth Watching, sitting in for Terry Gross. Mary Tyler Moore died Wednesday at age 80, and many radio and television programs have been offering salutes and appreciations ever since. Today, it's our turn. We're going to replay a 1995 interview Mary Tyler Moore did with Terry Gross back when the star of The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Mary Tyler Moore Show had just released her memoir. But first, an appreciation from my perspective as a TV critic. Mary Tyler Moore managed to star in one of the best and smartest comedies of the decade in two different decades.
Pelosi also noted the diversity of the 117th Congress.
BILL KURTIS: And if any of that happens, we'll ask you about it on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
Public health officials warn that infections and deaths may not peak for the next few weeks; it isn't clear when, except that the disaster will get worse.
And then - so that ended up being the kind of - the song ended up having this groove, and it was - you know, when I saw him play it before, you wouldn't have called it a - it didn't have a groove, per se. And then it - the song just kind of - it was, you know, a series of - the way songs like this kind of come together, there's like a series of accidents or ideas or people putting things out there, and then it's like weird LEGO where things just start fitting.
Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska was in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday when rioters attacked. As Congress was preparing to reconvene, Sasse issued remarks saying that lies have consequences and that the attack on the Capitol was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the President's addiction to constantly stoking division. And then Sasse voted to affirm the election results.
We laughed about it, we joked — that's really the hallmark of my family is a few days afterwards in the hospital — my mom was the person who cracked the first joke. I was crying by her bedside and she said to me, Don't cry. Look on the bright side: Now you're officially the best-looking person in the family.
One of them, quite modestly, is geography. Some trucking distribution companies have come to Springfield because it's convenient to two big interstates. And incomes did tick up last year. But that doesn't get Springfield closer to the knowledge economy of tech or finance or design.
Perkins' family still drives into the city for things Manor can't offer: a museum or a dip in a pool. She misses living in Austin. But asked if she would move back, she said no.
Facebook Moves To Decide What Is Real News
We don't agree that you have one, Raffensperger said.
FAVREAU: (Laughter). President Obama, he usually adds words when he writes himself because, you know, I think sometimes he has a frustration with the sound bite culture that we have right now, right? And so sometimes, he wants to take the time to make the exact point, even if it takes a couple extra words or a couple extra sentences. And then, once he's comfortable that he's achieved that, he'll then come to the speechwriters and say, OK, you guys cut it down.
CONAN: Hi, Bette. Go ahead, please.
Anytime you're in a position of uncertainty, you're going to be more willing to accept things that are false or misleading, so long as they just make you feel better, says Dustin Carnahan, who studies misinformation as an associate professor of Communications at Michigan State University. And I don't think that was unique to us.
If this situation has shown us anything or taught us anything, it's that none of us know what tomorrow is going to bring. But we know what today holds, so prepare your documents so that you're comfortable with them today and you can sleep tonight. If circumstances change in the future, you can always update these documents. As long as you have capacity to do so, you just have to make those choices.
This is really about providing justice for communities and just transitions for communities. So really the heart of the Green New Deal is about social justice and it's about allowing and fighting for things like fully-funded pensions for coal miners in West Virginia, fighting for clean water in Flint, and fighting for the ability of indigenous peoples to take a leadership role in in where we're moving as a country.
In a case of literary serendipity, right after I read Beck's piece, I stumbled onto an essay called The Simplest Course I Ever Taught in The Chronicle of Higher Education by Paula Marantz Cohen, dean of the Pennoni Honors College and professor of English at Drexel University.
GROSS: John Powers is film and TV critic for Vogue and vogue.com. Tomorrow on FRESH AIR...
S. LEGGETTE: You know what? I would've never imagined that in a million years. I always told him that he was going to change the world, and I tell him and his sister both that.
She's a young woman living in London, Waller-Bridge tells NPR's Rachel Martin. The relationship that she treasures most in the world, treasured most in the world, was that with her best friend who she recently lost in a terrible accident.
The influential Christian law firm also has offices in Washington, D.C. and has become nationally known for challenging nondiscrimination protections. The Alliance has logged nine high court wins in just seven years.
Yeah, it did piss me off, and I think I internalized a lot of that because I didn't have the articulation and the confidence, frankly, to kind of rebel with my parents against that, but I think in my own way I did, because I continue to follow the things that inspired and attracted me, and I didn't fall down the path of just blindly getting married when I was 20.
SIMON: And my gosh, I will attest, the results are absolutely stunning. One of the themes that weaves in and out of the story of the building of the house is, as you note, how daunting it is legally and socially for a battered woman to find support in Ireland. And I - my reporting tells me it is not dramatically different in the U.S. and the U.K.
One document was titled, Josh Brown – Contract for Change. It was dated March 28, 2013, more than two years before his assault arrest; it was drafted as part of marriage counseling he was then undergoing.
TERRY GROSS, BYLINE: Roy Wood Jr., welcome to FRESH AIR. So that bit sounds like it has a lot of truth behind it. Did you feel, when you were growing up in Alabama, like Confederate flags warned you away from places and people that spell trouble?
It took several hours for Grimes to find the right letters and other documents needed to apply for the waiver, since her sister's filing system was a large shopping bag. But with assistance from the Medicare Rights Center, a consumer advocacy nonprofit, her sister eventually received Part B coverage without a late fee or waiting period. It was retroactive, so she may even be reimbursed for the medical bills she paid last fall and winter when she had no insurance coverage for doctor visits.
So I thought, well, I guess that's just something that happens when you enter your 40s. And it's a nerve-wracking city, so I'll just have to, you know, take a little more time with it or use a thinner brush, whatever. And I had nobody to point out to me the lack of sense that I was making and the deterioration of my thinking.
Kim also warned that the U.S. should not test North Korea's self-restraint.
Like many states, Iowa doesn't offer separate sex divisions in high school wrestling, meaning that boys and girls must wrestle each other. Despite the local popularity of the sport, there's not much of an infrastructure for its female athletes — only two girls have ever qualified to participate in Iowa's state high school tournament since it started almost a century ago. Many athletes, coaches and fans of female wrestling want the status quo to change, including Charlotte Bailey.
And while the Democratic side has its own passionate voters, like the throngs of young voters who support Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, turnout just isn't close to where it was eight years ago. Democrats, many of whom turned out for Obama's hope and change, appear to have lost their fervor.
Eyder, what are you hearing there this morning about the meeting between the vice president and Guaido?
At first glance, the scene probably looked familiar to many people in Phoenix: tens of thousands massing outside Chase Field on a bright Thursday afternoon in April, clad in red and rippling with anticipation. But that scene, if it were typical, would feature fans of the Arizona Diamondbacks — not the teachers who gathered near the baseball stadium with quite another event in mind.
To understand why mask guidelines have been so varied, NPR reached out to specialists in academia and in government. What we learned is that face mask guidelines are about science — but go beyond. The reasons for a policy may have to do with practical considerations like the national supply of masks but may also reflect cultural values and history.
Because Trump scrapped the TPP, which had been in process for nearly a decade, the two leaders come to a table where the game board for trade has been overturned and reset. China was not a party to that deal, but the deal was written to allow the U.S. to hem China in on trade by setting stiff and transparent rules on trade in Asia.
KELLY: Twenty weeks - that was the caption of a photo Serena Williams shared on Snapchat on Wednesday. Her spokeswoman confirmed the news that night. She's pregnant. I'm joined now by Howard Bryant of ESPN and ESPN The Magazine. Hi there, Howard.
The Pharmaceutical Federation of Venezuela estimates the country is suffering from an 85 percent shortage of medicine amid an economic crisis also marked by severe hyperinflation and food scarcity.
Wave Of Capitalist Optimism Sweeps Across Paris
Tim volunteered to take part in a huge national research study aimed at determining exactly what it takes to prevent or delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes.
PERALTA: He deserves better, he says. Uganda deserves better. He says in the past, he didn't care much for politics. But this time, he made sure to stop by his polling station to pick up his registration.
But it's unclear whether there will be an impact on the authorities in Saudi Arabia, which is in charge of the mosque.
GROSS: Let's talk about The Mary Tyler Moore Show, a show which I still love to watch. I'm so glad that Nick at Nite (laughter) carries the shows. I still love to watch The Dick Van Dyke Show and Mary Tyler Moore. The Mary Tyler Moore Show got started because CBS wanted to build a series around you. And you and Grant Tinker hired people to, you know, write - come up with the idea, write a series. What was the original premise?
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: But like you said, you didn't identify as a feminist.
Those onboard were resourceful in other ways, working to make the best of the situation. A woman with a ukulele serenaded children with Old MacDonald Had A Farm. And a coloring station was set up for kids, according to Bigby.
SHAPIRO: Let's start with that Green New Deal that we were just hearing about. It calls for eliminating the U.S. carbon footprint by 2030, just over 10 years from now. Does that goal seem attainable to you?
ABDULAZIZ: I was a little bit scared.
Early-childhood and elementary school programs reflect a diverse set of commitments about what children ought to learn, and about how they ought to do so.
TILLMAN: I sound real stupid right now talking.
DAVIES: Right. And it was really striking how many more sundown towns there were in the North and Midwest and West than in the deep South. Why would that be?
For candidates who have received the Sanders blessing, it's changed the trajectory of their campaign almost overnight.
SAGAL: On Monday, over 200 workers at search giant blank announced they had unionized.
P COURTER: I think as Gay said, we've been really very cheerful (inaudible) point where we realized that - you know, that we've read a lot. I think there is a real concern about the possibility the virus could be transmitted through the circulating air system. We're fortunate we have a balcony, and we've been keeping our door cracked open a bit and letting fresh air move through the room all the time. But we're just kind of, you know, hunkering down and taking our temperatures and trying to, you know, keep ourselves feeling healthy and safe. We're certainly eating well. I'll give them credit for that.
Trump Administration Urges States To Open COVID-19 Vaccination To Everyone Over 65
This challenge isn't too hard. Name a unit of measurement. Remove two consecutive letters. The letters that remain can be rearranged to name what this measurement measures. What is it?
A December report from the United Nations finds that nearly half of all children younger than 5 in Afghanistan, a total of some 3.1 million, are facing acute malnutrition. That's a 16% jump since June 2020.
As a local driver doing port work, I have a lot of down time. Most of my day is sitting at the port waiting for a box to be taken off or put on, Donker says. It's times like that when I'll go on the Internet, goof off with people, read up on interesting things, get into arguments — whatever I can do to pass the time.
As of Monday, the federal website only had information for 22 states. (Washington was not among them.) But hopefully that will change very soon, Sabo says. I know the government is as motivated as we are to make sure people know how to access this medication and to try to avoid hospitalizations.
WOOD JR: Yeah, yeah, but they figured black people are funny. But you just better not date my daughter (laughter) or hang around town too late. Like, I did a show in Johnson City, Tenn., which is a eastern Tennessee mountain town. And people would come up after the show. And there's some town - there's some neighboring town over. And supposedly, there's a sign that says, don't let the sun set on your black ass here in this town, where you basically had sundown warnings where you had to leave by the time lights were out. And this is 2002, 2003. This is recent.
We'll get through this. This is a particularly dark time. But we always say in this country, our best days are ahead. We mean it. It's always been true.

At the recollection of tucking a wool scarf into Charlie's coat this morning, Claire confronted the dying man before her. Outside, he'd been easy to objectify. Here, with the movement of his eyes, he became an individual. Someone's husband, dad, son, brother. His fate became personal. Focusing on his eyes, Claire opened the camera's aperture to narrow the depth of field. She wanted to portray the staff and equipment as blurry and ominous, the way he must be experiencing them.
Trump has a lot of work to do to be able to reassemble the coalition that voted for him narrowly to win in the Electoral College in 2016. He lost the popular vote by almost 3 million votes and won just 46 percent of the vote. He won by about 70,000 votes combined between Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, all states that have trended away from the president during his first two years in office.
JACOB: Feedback on how kids like science.
After lengthy negotiations with government officials, the protest came to an end on Wednesday. Attention is now focusing on what kind of deal might have been made to secure the departure of the 2,000 protesters. Until then, fearful of attracting official accusations of fanning extremism, Pakistan's media had greatly underplayed the story. But editorial writers weighed in, once it emerged that a deal may have been struck.
ALLAM: Pushed past the barriers. They're now going up the steps to the Capitol. It's absolute pandemonium as far back as the eye can see.
In his statement, Northam said he admires the actions the Richmond 34 took to fight segregation, and he added that he would pay his own tribute to them at the governor's mansion later this week.
SAGAL: How she's doing these days?
CHANG: OK. Of course, what would have been the big news out of your beat today, out of the Department of Justice, was that Merrick Garland was nominated to be the new attorney general under President-to-be Joe Biden. Remind us why that in itself would have been the seismic news of the day.
Next week's challenge: Name part of the human body. Switch the first two letters to get a two-word phrase for something that is worrisome. What is it?
'Following the letter of the law'
Specifically, that person isn't allowed to talk with a foreign government or its representative and try to influence foreign policy — directly or indirectly.
But he has a sneaking suspicion that rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are contributing as well. Increased CO2 levels have been linked to fewer nutrients in plants like rice, wheat and potatoes.
SWITZER: In 1967, when I pinned on that bib number, I really wasn't trying to prove anything because a woman had actually run the Boston Marathon the year before by just jumping out of the bushes and running. There was nothing about gender in the rulebook in those days because everybody assumed a woman really couldn't run and didn't want to run, and why even bother with it in the rulebook or on the entry form?

Allin-Khan says she thinks the country's health care system could be heading for a reckoning.
Beyond that, the changes that have overtaken our communications, our social interactions and our political conversation have greatly complicated the process of information sharing. In the time of the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, the fundamental difficulty was getting even a basic message to a population that had no general system of electronic communication at all. Roughly half of all Americans still lived in rural areas a century ago, and the idea of hourly or even daily bulletins was utterly unknown.
The first question from the Democratic side was whether the Senate could render a verdict without hearing from key witnesses, such as Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.
On Twitter, there were complaints about the noise. Some joked about the candidates' ages.
But, Trump said Friday that troop draw downs are not on the table.
FINNEY: Exactly (laughter). Exactly. Right, as much as we try to predict. No, I - look - I think if you - for the people who are looking for a moderate solution, you know, Vice President Biden is the person in this race who offers that. Now, it may be the case that we come out of Super Tuesday with it being much more clearly a Biden-Senator Sanders competition and, you know, that there are more splits within some - you know, we've got some Tom Steyer supporters out there, as well as Pete Buttigieg supporters out there.
If you prefer paper, all households that haven't responded by early April are expected to receive a physical questionnaire in the mail. Some households in areas with low Internet subscription rates, and communities with higher shares of residents over age 65, are set to receive paper forms by March 20.
FLATOW: Well hang on. We have a lot to talk about. We have a whole hour to do it. We have to take a break and pay some of the bills here. So we're going to take a break and come back and talk more with Lawrence Krauss, Michael Turner, Brian Greene and Steven Weinberg.
KIM ROYSTER: (Singing) Oh, say, can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?
Republic Wireless is one of the top cell phone carriers in the market and had been among the simplest service providers in the U.S., and is a no-contract carrier, which means you can sign-up and leave whenever you feel like. The carrier will reimburse you for the unused data in your account, which is a very good service.
SHAHANI: Yahoo did not inform Verizon, the company which had agreed to buy them over the summer for nearly $5 billion. Verizon issued a curt statement yesterday, saying it was just informed this week of the break-in, while after, they jointly announced their deal.
SHAPIRO: Do you remember the first thing that made you interested in science?
Last year, Congress significantly boosted funding for the agency, reversing years of lawmakers not matching the funding levels agency officials said they would need. Past funding uncertainty has forced the bureau to cancel some field tests for the census, including ones designed to work out the logistics of counting rural areas and collecting Spanish-language responses.

Immigration, Infrastructure And Iran: The President's Plans For 2018
These are common sights in India.
And it is from these bigger systems that close to 300,000 New Mexicans receive their drinking water, she says.
(She confirmed on NBC's Today show the next day that she was, in fact, referring to Trump.)
10 Years After Housing Crisis: A Realtor, A Renter, Starting Over, Staying Put
Giridharadas in his New York Times article wasn't just critical of Haley; he said it was thrilling to see Haley attempt to create a broader, two-party consensus on the simple, exceptional idea that an American is defined by shared hope, not shared blood.
For NPR News, I'm Kate Payne in Iowa.
Step across the cracked flooring to an audiovisual installation of a topical subject, migration - a raft on the water from Senegal to Paris. Artists from Algeria via Nigeria to the Democratic Republic of Congo in the heart of Africa - all are on display. And it's impressive, say these Paris-based African visitors.
Haji Rizva says her sons can't find work. To get to the hospital, she had to borrow $8 for the taxi — a huge sum for her. The medical treatment is free, but Haji Rizva didn't know that. So she left Parvana's baby brother at home with the family. She says the boy is too weak from the hunger to move but she didn't think she could afford to treat them both.
There are other candidate COVID-19 vaccines in the pipeline, and tests will need to be done on them as well. Volunteers in an experimental trial of the AstraZeneca vaccine tested themselves for the virus. The results so far, posted Dec. 8 in The Lancet, suggest that the candidate vaccine may partly, but not totally, protect against viral shedding. In a commentary posted the same day in The Lancet, researchers from Johns Hopkins University said that the observation provides some hope that the vaccine stops some asymptomatic shedding but that the evidence gathered so far is too slight to be considered conclusive.
With respect to judicial philosophy, I have the advantage of having taught constitutional law, so I don't need to get into the weeds on their thinking on a lot of these cases — because I can just read their opinions and the quality of their work and I have a pretty good sense of how they approach cases.
PERALTA: There is so little wheat in the country that the flour to make bread is mixed with sorghum. Sudanese eat flat bread - soft, puffy goodness that almost tastes buttery. But you can't make flat bread out of this wheat and sorghum mix.
Oh, more than that. Biden was, first of all, bribed by [Burisma owner Mykola] Zlochevsky to do that. Zlochevsky is the multi-billionaire, organized criminal who employed his son for five years and gave his son somewhere between $5 and $8 million. Some of it in laundered payments. Zlochevsky made a deal with Biden so that Biden would protect his company. And when —
The White House is celebrating some encouraging numbers this week. Factory jobs are up. Illegal border crossings are down.
A CDC staffer was suspected of having contracted the virus, so the White House canceled the stop out of an abundance of caution, Grisham said.
Canova, a law professor who's challenging Wasserman Schultz in her Southern Florida district, was driving by himself to a campaign event when his phone started buzzing last Saturday. A staffer told him they had gotten a call from a CNN producer that Sanders had just endorsed him in an interview with Jake Tapper set to air Sunday on CNN's State of the Union. The next phone call was from that producer asking for a reaction.
In December, an 8-year-old girl died in U.S. custody after crossing with a large group of migrants in a remote corner of New Mexico. Her death, as well as that of a second migrant child a few weeks later, prompted the Border Patrol to expand medical screenings for all migrants in its custody.
DAVIES: Well, that's a big deal because corporate America were not exactly open to, you know, black employment, certainly not black management back then.
GROSS: I mean, you have the receipt, but it would probably be in your pocket. And then if you reach for it, who knows how that would be interpreted?
SAGAL: So that was Lindsey Weber from the podcast Who? Weekly. Unfortunately, as you heard, you did not get the question right. Disappointing your wife, no doubt. But you did win a point for Joel for his convincing lie.
Sonic, though, isn't stressing the saving-the-planet angle. In a press release, the company's vice president of product innovation and development, Scott Uehlein, said that its new blended cheeseburgers, which contain 25 percent mushrooms, will deliver the juicy savory deliciousness you expect from a burger in a way that makes you feel like you're getting away with something.
Ahead of Tuesday, advance turnout has lagged in heavily Republican parts of the state. Trump suggested Raffensperger was responsible for the drop in GOP enthusiasm, while the secretary of state has said the White House and state lawmakers spreading misinformation is to blame.
Americans in many places are under more stringent restrictions than those in the federal guidelines. Governors and mayors have ordered people to stay at home and business to close through May and into June in some cases.
Technological change is intensifying. We're becoming terrified by social media, by information, and in this state of high anxiety, we're looking to attach that anxiety to something, he says. And cultural change, demographic change, is what we're attaching it to.
It makes sense for these rural counties to allow self-service because there are so few motorists on the road, especially at night, Lizzy Acker, a reporter for The Oregonian, tells Here & Now's Meghna Chakrabarti.
Trump Administration Rescinds Obama Rule On Transgender Students' Bathroom Use
The Yawkey Foundations, which advocated keeping the name, called Thursday a sad day and said the effort to change the name has been based on a false narrative about his life.
The White House has not responded to a request for comment. Jason Miller, a Trump campaign adviser, wrote on Twitter that Raffensperger is a hack and that Trump is spot-on in his criticisms of the terrible job Raffensperger did.
The next time I heard about him was a couple of weeks later when a colleague read me Drew's obituary in the local paper. There was no cause of death listed. But I knew he could have run into serious trouble if he had mixed alcohol or other drugs with his lorazepam.
US Mobile offers nearly any combination of minutes, texts, and data including an unlimited plan at $40 per month. You can upgrade your unlimited plan to high-speed data with hotspot connectivity for $10 more per month.
Last week's challenge: This challenge came from Ben Bass of Chicago. Take the title of a famous Hollywood flop. Change an A to an R, then rearrange the letters to spell a famous box office hit — which went on to spawn sequels. What films are these?
Like much of science, early findings are tentative and should be followed up. That's at one level and at the other level, psychology has been changing a lot in the last five, six years. People have been doing more rigorous, more large sample studies, more careful descriptions. And this study was conducted before all the change was happening and so the standards were lower; at least as seen from the current perspective.
Even if Iran does escalate its nuclear program or its provocative regional activity, Biden has tools to deflect the pressure. He plans to strengthen relations with key U.S. allies, including France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which are party to the nuclear agreement. Under Trump, European states spent as much time condemning Washington as they did Tehran. With unity between the U.S. and Europe, new Iranian provocations will only further isolate Tehran. The three European states on Wednesday issued a sharp condemnation of Iran's latest nuclear steps, a sign of future U.S.-European unity. Russia and China, the other signatories to the agreement, will also oppose Iranian efforts to significantly expand its nuclear program. Israel will remain laser-focused on Iran and probably will set clear red lines to box in Iranian activity.
The MS Westerdam with nearly 1,500 passengers aboard had been rebuffed by Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines and the U.S. territory of Guam before ultimately being allowed to dock at the Cambodian port of Sihanoukville.
The audit was released in the immediate weeks following Floyd's killing, just as national protests calling for a reckoning on race, police brutality and social injustice were gaining momentum.
But in this moment, in this crisis, the portents are not good for such unity. So far, the sudden emergence of a killer disease rampaging coast to coast has served less to unite us than to emphasize what divides us.
Donald Trump crossed the threshold of required delegates to secure the GOP nomination. The change came as a small number of unbound delegates said they will support him at the party's convention.
Well, sometimes I just ask about family and background and what made you want to be a judge. You learn a lot just by talking to people about what their story is.
Note that this is true whether or not earlier learning brings other rewards, such as feeding into a sensitive period, starting a snowball, or improving the child's immediate experience. And note that these other processes can impose their own deadlines: If being a proficient reader can snowball other kinds of learning in the grade school years, then achieving that proficiency imposes a deadline that might justify introducing key building blocks in advance. I'm going to speculate, for example, that teaching phonemic awareness to young children doesn't lead to deeper friendships or greater happiness (though I could be wrong). What it does do is set children up to be better readers and writers when those skills really start to matter.

NOURSE: And I had just been hired to the chairman, and that was Joe Biden.
While the decision for who is eligible to get a vaccine is up to states, recommendations from the federal government are influential.
Critics charge that Trump has violated the long-standing independence of the Justice Department to pursue investigations without political interference and called it inappropriate for administration officials to join briefings about an investigation that bears so heavily on the president and his aides.
While all of the Republican candidates are Christians, some, like Cruz and retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, have made their faith a more central part of their message than others. At the Cruz event in Emmetsburg, his supporters said they appreciate his faithcentric campaign.
GATES: Now, we don't do blood anymore, right? We'd spit in a test tube.
I know we've raised enough that these kids are gonna have several million dollars that they can start their fight after the march, Katz said.
GOLDMAN: Yeah, I think they already are wondering that. And, you know, the big worry by Major League Baseball is that large numbers of fans won't trust the product on the field if they perceive widespread cheating. It's not baseball season right now, as you point out, so it's hard to survey large numbers. But as you said, spring training starts in about a month. We'll get a first sense then how deep the suspicion runs.
And one of the first movies that I remember watching was Apocalypse Now. I was probably about 10. And I think that was the first indication, also, that I had that there was something called this war and that this was how Americans saw this war as one that had divided them. And that was my first glimmering that there was something like a civil war happening in the American soul and that we as Vietnamese people were caught up in that because I watched that movie as a good, American boy who had already seen some American war movies - John Wayne in World War II.
PERALTA: On the outskirts of Kampala, Ronnie Mwange, who is 28, shows me his house.

And so I think it became - he had distributed 15,000 copies because of the Esso connection. That really, you know, gave it a visibility that I think other travel guides didn't necessarily have.

In addition, the U.S. Embassy has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars to refurbish the local school and build a new kindergarten.
Even with Democrats technically in the majority in Congress, the party split is so slim that passing major health care legislation will be extremely difficult.

At least 21 people have been reported dead in Iran, as the regime has moved against the protesters. But it's still unclear what this president wants to do tangibly to effect change. Vice President Pence has brought up the difference from past administrations' approaches, but remember, back in 2009 when protests also cropped up, it was a very different kind of Iranian leadership that then-President Barack Obama was dealing with. Now, there is a more pragmatic leader in President Hassan Rouhani than there was in Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. So what would change in Iran actually bring?

There are still a lot of people that wonder why we are giving foreign aid to Puerto Rico, Rubio told USA Today. You have to remind them, Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and its residents are U.S. citizens.
Congressional rules allow for any member of the House joined by a senator to contest the Electoral College vote. The challenge will prompt a floor debate and vote in each chamber.
WOOD JR: You're stopping for gas at a strange place at 2 in the morning. You see that flag hanging from the window. You know this is not the place to get gas.
This new innovation instead tackles the issue with precisely calibrated cold and hot gas and advances in computer algorithms. Machines have long relied on temperature control to maintain the small ice crystals that give gelato its signature structure. With Carpigiani's latest program, the machine's batch freezers have become smarter and more responsive, so they're able to recognize an unconventional mixture and make whatever adjustments necessary to keep those small crystals.

AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: No version of the story looks good for Yahoo. Either the company had an inkling about being hacked back in 2014 and just didn't say anything, or what the company claims is true - they just discovered the breach this summer, which means it took them two years to detect that half of their user accounts were stolen.
One of the things I took away from interviewing people was a greater awareness that people of color have thought about wealth disparity and how it has touched their lives and the kinds of things they've lost out on because they didn't have access to the resources their white friends did, says Prasertong. Not that [white people] weren't aware, but they never really thought about how ... that might have affected where they are in the world in relation to people of color. They never stopped to think, 'Oh, that car my parents gave me in college allowed me to drive across town to get a good job.' 
Aren't you saying there, on video, that this was about the 2020 election?
Then Claire followed Patsy's gaze out the window. The East River was green-black and roiling. Tugboats pushed barges piled with construction beams, gravel, garbage. A police boat patrolled the harbor. Ferries labored across the blustery current. Sunlight glinted off the steel trusses of the Queensboro Bridge. Welfare Island, with its maze of dilapidated public hospitals, seemed to shine in the winter light. The tide was coming in, rolling against the embankment, tossing the small delivery boats that plied the river. The East River wasn't a river at all, but a strait. Manhattan was a coastal island, and the sea was close by, surging and unforgiving.

Or, you know, you come across something and think, you know, what if we were just six months away from a potential cure? The reality is that Ron didn't have six more months. He was suffering, and he was miserable, and he was lonely. And everything that made him who he was was being taken away from him. But as a mother, to sit there and walk that path with your child, that's a hard road. And she struggled with that.

SYDELL: It's chronological, and people have really liked that because it allows a lot of things to bubble up. You don't have to be famous to get to the top. If a tweet is good, it makes its way to the top. So, you know, something like Black Lives Matter started at the grassroots, bubbled up, and that's why people really like the way it is. So the rest in peace was the fear that they were going to change the algorithm.
Like a schmuck, I endorsed him and he got elected, but I will tell you, he is a disaster, Trump said of Kemp. I can't imagine he's ever getting elected again, I'll tell you that much.
Let's say you run a government agency in a low-income country and want to identify the poorest 10% of villages — or determine how many people live within easy reach of a medical facility or close to bodies of water that could be a source of mosquito-borne diseases. Satellite imagery can help you answer those questions, Burke says, in a way that's much less expensive and time-consuming than traditional boots-on-the-ground surveys. Cars, large buildings and well-tended farms can all be indications of income and population density and are easily spotted from space.

Following a heist that's being compared to something out of a Fast & Furious film, Dutch police have arrested five men who allegedly snatched $600,000 worth of iPhones from a moving truck.
However, it doesn't make sense to make too big a deal (as Trump does) out of any single trade deficit with any country.
Prof. NELSON: Yeah, Ira. I mean, there's another - a couple of other issues that are worth raising. One is that - one of the principles that we argue is that when a scientist signs a research contract with a corporation, that contract should not include either restrictions on testimony in court or a commitment to testify on behalf of the corporation. I mean, to keep science clean, those really should be separate documents, and someone who signs a research contract should not have to also sign a separate document...
Yes, there are discussions about what's developmentally appropriate for children of different ages. And there are discussions about what's valuable to know at any age. But what, specifically, should a child learn now? Are there good reasons to teach reading in kindergarten rather than in 2nd grade, or to expose children to music as toddlers rather than teenagers? Why not wait until children are more mature, and better at engaging in structured study? Beyond the basic premise that we shouldn't teach children something before it's developmentally appropriate to do so, are there general principles that govern what's valuable to learn sooner rather than later? And might recognizing such principles transform the way we think about early-childhood education?
We must be careful and practical, the commission's president, Michael Picker, said in a statement last month. This process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. Crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.
There's a lot of discussion right now about how sales should be more robust and they're not, given where we are in this stage of the economic recovery, he says. Americans are buying the same number of homes they were 18 years ago. And Wheaton says the population has grown since, so sales should be stronger.
RUSSAKOFF: Well, it played disastrously in the community because, immediately, nobody understood why do we have to turn on Oprah at 4 o'clock to find out what's going on in our own city? And if you want to save the schools for the benefit of our children, why weren't we told? And, by the way, there's a very large consensus on the ground in Newark at this time that the schools really need change, that the schools are failing in unacceptable ways. And so there wasn't really, you know, a roadmap for how to do that, but there were a lot of people, including some very skilled, experienced teachers, who deeply understood the needs of the children in Newark who would have been eager to be part of that conversation. And not only were they insulted that they were left out, there was an agenda that was crafted that didn't have the benefit of their really important insights into what was needed in Newark.

The objecting senators' statement cites the 1876 election between Republican Rutherford B. Hayes and Democrat Samuel Tilden as a precedent.

The commission ended up giving the victory to Hayes by one vote.
The new rule, first proposed last year, is popular with social conservatives who have long campaigned to cut public funding to Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortion is already illegal in most situations, but many abortion-rights opponents have cheered efforts by the Trump administration to redirect funding for family planning services to organizations that do not provide or refer patients for abortions.

Our system of laws depends on not just lowly citizens, but presidents as well, abiding by court rulings. Throughout our history, the Supreme Court has been inserted into national crises, often preventing presidents from doing what they want to do. Indeed, sometimes the Supreme Court's verdicts are not vindicated by history. And yet, presidents have complied with those rulings.
The secretary of state has chosen a new system. They've spent over a hundred million dollars on it. It is absolutely as vulnerable, if not more vulnerable, according to many experts, than the old system that we're talking about. So not only could the old malware have been transferred into the new system in various places, but the fact that it cannot be audited is really troublesome.
Many federal agencies employ scientists to help conduct research. Those findings are crucial in ensuring that regulations and government policy are based on the best information available. Data collected by federal scientists is also used by state and local governments as well as private industry.
But winning Pennsylvania in November will be a very steep climb for Trump. The state has about 1 million more registered Democrats than Republicans. And while many of them stay home in other years, Pennsylvania Democrats typically show up en masse when there's a presidential race on the ballot.

In fact, instead of a theory of everything it would be a theory of anything in that sense that, right now it looks like that it predicts a multitude of possible universes in which almost anything can happen. And science is sort of based on falsifiability, and if you could predict anything, then you really predict nothing.

That would have to come in later legislation. Instead, the congresswoman aims to promote big goals.

A couple of generations of younger women writers, what I'd call cohorts, have emerged in non-jazz music criticism, Powers observes. Many of the best music writers are now women. There's a lot of support for each other. What's interesting is that with that shift, with that critical mass, there's a comfort and sense of their own authority. I've also seen a re-emergence and interest in participating in legacy-making spearheaded by women. Some younger women that I know in the pop world actually love to make lists. I think that's great — but I don't know. Is jazz there yet?
Events like short sales can stay on a credit report for seven years. Because of that, many Americans who missed payments, sold short or went into foreclosure during the recession are now returning to the housing market with healthy credit. They are called boomerang buyers.
And we truly celebrated his life the night before. We made all of his favorite foods and had great wine and conversation and lots of tears and a lot more laughter and more tears. And the following morning on the day he actually died was much of the same. We surrounded his bed. My mom crawled into bed, laid next to him. And my sister and my stepdad and I all kind of piled around - and the friends back around us. And we had stories that everybody shared and favorite memories of him and really surrounded him in the love and support.

For the 2016 season, MLB mandated that all teams provide interpreters for players with limited or no English proficiency.

Gomez believes interpreters are a step in the right direction. Players used to have to grab a coach, a teammate who spoke both languages and kind of use them as a translator and of course these people weren't trained as professional translators, Gomez said.

High-quality health care for all Americans.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn't yet analyzed the new bill. It weighed in on the earlier Senate bill, saying that proposal would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage in the next 10 years, compared with under the Affordable Care Act. Of those, 15 million would lose Medicaid coverage. That version was projected to lower the deficit by billions over 10 years — but that may have changed as the latest version offers billions more for state grants and also doesn't repeal as many of the Obamacare taxes.

KAPLAN-LEVENSON: Native Americans were just one of many communities with concerns. People of color were active in the coalition all across the country, but white people were the main authors of the bill, which caused blind spots to say the least. Who was this bill going to actually protect? And who was it going to potentially endanger even further? There were feminists who publicly spoke out against the bill, like Mari Matsuda, a professor at Georgetown Law in the '90s who published her opinions in Ms. Magazine. She wrote, we know that the police are a source of violence in our communities, not just a deterrent to it. We also know that violence against women is endemic and that police don't come when a woman from the wrong part of town dials 911.

Senators voted on Tuesday to allow the 24 hours of opening arguments to be spread over three days instead of two, but the sessions were still managing to test fortitude and patience, especially because, for most senators, the arguments are not likely to change their position.
The people of Georgia know that this was a scam, and because of what you've done to the president, a lot of people aren't going out to vote [in the runoffs], Trump said in the remarkable Saturday call. A lot of Republicans are going to vote negative because they hate what you did to the president.

The call, which was first reported by The Washington Post, reveals the extent to which the president knows minute details of claims of irregularities. Trump was fixated on the latest rumors that counties shredded ballots from the November general election, spurred on by dubious claims made in Georgia state legislative hearings.

The purpose of science is to explain observations. In theoretical physics, we use mathematics for that. Our theories need a set of assumptions plus a way to identify math objects with observables. But none of the assumptions should be unnecessary, a criterion known as Ockham's razor (named after the 13th century theologian and philosopher William of Ockham). Ockham's razor is extremely important — as without it you could literally add invisible gods and angels to any scientific theory.
ERICKSON: Correct. These are very small towns. Our largest town is 2,300 people, and our smallest town is 400. Some people say its a market failure, you know. And here's this new technology that people want and they need, but the business plans of the incumbents just don't allow them to make that necessary investment.
Many speculate that these kinds of lopsided numbers (and, therefore, potentially lopsided enthusiasm) will mean a similarly lopsided advantage for the GOP leading up to the general election. But then, while enthusiasm for Trump may be driving many Republicans to the polls now, it may in a general election also drive turnout for voters who hope to defeat the highly polarizing candidate.
JONES: OK, I'm going to go with A one more time.
RUSSAKOFF: Well, I think a key reason is that the charter schools get a lot of more money to the classroom and to the school building than the district schools do. District schools, although they get $19,000 to $20,000 per pupil in public funds to spend, get fewer than $10,000 to the district schools for the principals and teachers to spend on educating the kids.
Dr. HOOPER-BUI: No, sir. We are not signing, and will not sign a confidentiality agreement. I view my job as I'm a public servant, so that I'm not serving the public and keeping my data quiet.

Whether these factors are sustainable, pandemic-driven lifestyle changes have brought the pediatric community closer to solving a problem that has long plagued them: how to better protect children with asthma and save lives.
Trump's decision not to provide the remaining $2 billion effectively cuts the GCF's total expected funding by about 20 percent — hardly peanuts. And various analysts say the loss of U.S. engagement in the day-to-day running of the fund could have less tangible but no less impactful downsides because the U.S. government has particular expertise when it comes to keeping multinational organizations accountable and effective.
For too long we have watched as President Obama and Hillary Clinton have ruined our economy and decimated the middle class. I am going to be the greatest jobs President our country has ever seen. We will do more for the hardworking people of our country and Make America Great Again.
The result of these sometimes incomplete messages: I think that if you talk to even the highly informed members of the general public and ask[ed] them a week, or two or three weeks ago, if the face masks work, they would say 'no' because they would have read CDC guidance, WHO guidance, says Lawrence Gostin, professor of global health law at Georgetown University and director of the World Health Organization Center on National & Global Health Law.

Rep. Mo Brooks, an Alabama Republican and outspoken Trump loyalist, has said he will object to the results from swing states that went from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020. Dozens of other Republicans say they will do so as well. This will likely begin when the third state in the alphabetical roll call is reached. That will be Arizona, where Biden won by one of his slimmest margins.
Some Republicans in Congress, including several representing districts particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, also rebuked reports of Trump's decision. Climate change is a serious issue, tweeted Rep. Vern Buchanan of Florida — with a photo of development near a Florida beach.

No retailer is going to go out and talk much about the fact that there are labor rights issues in the supply chain, but it's critical that retailers stay in the game and continue to be involved, says Dick Jones, CEO of Ocean Outcomes, an international NGO focused on improving fisheries and fish farms in Northeast Asia. He likens it to the routine testing that retailers do for E. coli in ground beef. They don't tell their customers there's a risk. They just do it because it's the right thing to do, he says.

But Section 230 is also tied to some of the worst stuff on the Internet, protecting sites when they host revenge porn, extremely gruesome videos or violent death threats.

If you find ways to repair the memory damaged by Alzheimer's disease or dementia and so forth, it is very likely that the same methods could be used to upgrade the memory of completely healthy people. And if you find ways to connect brains and computers, you can rely on memory's immense databases outside your own brain. We are starting to do it, in a way, with our smart phones and computers, but what we may see in coming decades is humans actually merging completely with their smart phones and computers.

In some ways, science is already the poster child for critical self-reflection. As a community, we actively try to falsify our own and other people's ideas. Peer-review is basically structured peer criticism, and the methodological innovations that fuel science come from science itself. But scientists are still humans and, like any human community, the scientific community can benefit from norms that make it easier to embrace our overarching values. These values include a commitment to seeking out and pursuing scientific methods that yield reliable conclusions — even as we use the tools of science to determine what those methods ought to be.

In the following sections, Owusu moves back and forth through several main fault lines that she closely examines from varying angles. One involves her stepmother telling Owusu that her father died of AIDS rather than the brain cancer Owusu knew he had. Another involves the many ways in which she was racialized in the nations she lived in and made to feel foreign even in places she was taught to believe were home. A third examines her mothers, the long and complicated relationship with each.
SIMON: Let me ask you about a couple things that happened this week shattering glass ceilings and follow a theme this year. Becky Hammon became the first woman to serve as head coach in an NBA game when Gregg Popovich got the toss for rejecting - for arguing a call from the Spurs. So she, for about a half, coached the Spurs. And then the Red Sox are hiring Bianca Smith as a minor league baseball coach, the first African American woman in that position. 2020's been quite a year.
The collective formed in early 2020, inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement. Smith says the Recording Academy seemed open to recommendations such as restructuring the nominating committees.

As the mob drew down on the Capitol, Trump remained largely silent and did not make widespread remarks condemning the violence, or attempts to quell it. At one point, he tweeted a short video in which he repeated claims — without evidence — regarding voter fraud and a stolen election, while saying we love you to the mob that had descended on Washington and urging them to go home.
DAVID PETRAEUS: He sent me a message via the president of Iraq during the surge in Iraq at a time - about a year into it, March, late March of 2008 - when we were supporting the Iraqi forces that were attacking the Shia militia - the militia, in large part, that he supported - in the second-largest city in Iraq, Basra. The message he sent indicated that he controlled the policy for Iran and that we should deal with him. It said, General Petraeus, you should know that I, Qassem Soleimani, control the policy for Iran when it comes to Iraq and also Syria, Lebanon, Gaza and Afghanistan. In other words, you should deal with me if you want to try to reach some kind of resolution of this issue, short of having to continue the battle in Basra, which was quite tenuous at that time. We did not deal with him. I essentially told him to pound sand.
REUSS: Get in the car, Sally. And don't talk about business anymore. Talk - ask about his kids, whatever. Just - and then - and be friendly. You lobbied him; you're through.

So you just sort of enjoy the dream. And then it becomes somewhat a little more difficult to handle when you have to start compromising, when you have to start doing things that adults do, when you have to start paying the bills, when you have to start dealing with people's responses to your art. When you're an adult, it's hard to kind of sustain that.

INSKEEP: Hannah, I want to ask one other question. I'm just thinking about what these protesters are trying to do. They're trying to overturn a democratic election. They're trying to keep President Trump in power. This is a president who was so uninterested in a second term, he didn't even put out a platform for what he would do. And they engaged in this operation, which utterly failed to change the result of the presidential election. At dinner last night, I got a question from a 15-year-old. I'd like to put it to you. What did they think they were going to accomplish?
One of the big problems is people thinking as individuals and not as a global population, she says. The actions of one person have the potential for enormous impact on people they've never met. People need to be thinking that their actions can lead to the deaths of other people's grandparents. We need to be working together as a global population to do everything we can do as individuals.
Not all projects will be successful and not all projects will live forever. There's a constant evolution in the frameworks and tools that we use to build any kind of software, she says.

RUSSAKOFF: Yes, it has. I mean, they spent millions - literally millions of dollars on a human resources consulting firm to, you know, get a new teachers evaluation system and teach everybody in the district - you know, principals, department heads, senior teachers - how to use it and how to use it to hold teachers accountable. And the state, which - and, you know, this was an initiative that came straight from the federal government. The Race to the Top that President Obama and Arne Duncan, the education secretary, put in place encouraged states to change their laws so the teacher evaluations were based increasingly on the student test scores - how students - whether students grew or not on their annual tests would determine whether teachers were rated effective or ineffective. And interestingly, I spent some time interviewing the measurement scientist who developed the system in New Jersey for measuring whether students grew or not from year to year on their standardized tests. And the state is using that measure of growth to say whether a teacher is effective or ineffective to some degree. And this measurement scientist said that the system was never intended to judge teachers. It was only intended to measure whether children are growing or not because it doesn't tell you why they're growing or who caused them to grow or why they're failing and who caused them to fail. All it tells you is whether they are progressing or regressing.

If we could get the Klan to go up there and clean out D.C., we'd all been better off, Sutton told the Montgomery Advertiser. We'll get the hemp ropes out, loop them over a tall limb and hang all of them.
Let me thus stick to the facts: To our best knowledge, assuming the existence of any universe besides our own is unnecessary to explain anything we have ever observed. In the best case, then, the multiverse is an interpretation.
Hillside Pharmacy, by name, still exists, and it's rather controversial, said Tang. It is now a restaurant and Pharm, P-H-A-R-M has been replaced by Farm F-A-R-M to highlight the farm-to-table service that this restaurant provides to its customers.

Hunt, meanwhile, has been requesting regular copies of the city's burial records. Some have been lost to fire.
LIASSON: They couldn't change the outcome.
I don't think so. Of course, the other part of that story is a number of places, like Bergen County [N.J.], have reported there's no homelessness there. It's been eradicated. We're going to continue to make that a high priority, fully recognizing that it actually costs more to leave people homeless. That person sleeping under the bridge who's going to wind up in the emergency room, sometimes getting admitted for a week in the hospital? That week hospital stay costs more than it costs to put them in a place for a year. But putting them in a place is not enough. That's only Part 1. Part 2, we have to diagnose why they're in that condition. And Part 3 is we have to treat it.
So, Kaplan says, if you want to live in Kansas City or Phoenix, maybe to stay close to friends and family, there's a more diverse range of job opportunities in more parts of the country. Kaplan calls this the decline in geographic specificity of occupations. That's a mouthful but, he says, it basically means you can do everything everywhere. Or maybe not everything, but at least today people have more options.

The rule goes into effect on Wednesday and applies to all future EPA regulations. It puts a premium on scientific studies that are based on underlying data that is available to other scientists or to the public. Studies that do not meet that standard, which could include major epidemiological studies, will be given less weight by regulators unless the head of the EPA personally intervenes. The rule also requires that the agency disclose which studies it uses to set future pollution limits.
He had no idea that some of that money was laundered.
At the coronavirus task force briefing on Thursday, Mnuchin denied the 20-week timeline, and said if we don't have your information, you'll have a simple web portal. You'll upload it. If we don't have that, will send you checks in the mail. He said that process would take weeks and not months.

In your case, you'll file federal form 8965 with your tax return to report a short-term insurance coverage gap and claim an exemption from the coverage requirement.

She's been playing tennis since she was four years old. She turned pro in 1995. She's been doing this her entire life. And my attitude has been that if, indeed, Serena comes back, then it would be an amazing story.

Racial Preferences in Dating, a 2008 Columbia University study of more than 400 individuals in speed-dating sessions, found that while women of all races expressed a higher preference for dating a man of their same race, non-Asian women were up to 65 percent less likely to indicate interest in seeing an Asian-American man again after the four-minute speed date, the highest rate of rejection across the board.

But I couldn't forget, as I watched Harry get married, that my first real memory of him as a fully formed human was seeing him as a gutted 12-year-old redhead, walking behind the carriage that carried his mother's casket, his goodbye letter to her in view. He's talked about how agonizing that experience was, and how broken he felt for years after Diana's death. So how can it not be some relief to see him and his brother, joking and grinning, not only happy but seemingly at least a little normal, marrying women who looked happier to be marrying them than their mother looked when she married their father? How can it not be a relief to see their father lean over to chuckle with William, and to see him step in to walk Markle the rest of the way after her own father tagged out? I empathize with other people's sympathy, I suppose: if one family is to be born into a completely bizarre set of duties and rituals, better that they invite a fiery speaker who advocates for justice; better that they marry people they seem to like and mutter sweet nothings to each other when they don't have to. Better that they place conviction on that platform than simply tradition.
And I watched in real time as hundreds of people commented on this photo and said things like, you know - they wanted to rape us. They immediately reduced us to our sexuality, as to whether we were doable, not doable, every amount of vitriol. We were called the worst names. And I mean these were leaders in the Marine Corps. I guess for myself, I was less upset because I've dealt with stuff like this before, but these seven other women who I highly respect and admire who have deployed multiple times, gone to combat, are Marines just like everybody else were being demeaned in this way.

ESPN.com writer Mechelle Voepel says however, some sports fans still haven't gotten used to the WNBA being a summer basketball league. It's not regular basketball season, plus the league's playoffs are happening the same time as the Major League Baseball postseason, as well as pro and college football.
Of course, there had been those who were quicker on the trigger. Magazine profile artist Michael Wolff had managed access to the president's inner circle in the early weeks and months to produce a fast Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House by January 2018. It is 'reality' journalism in the same way Trump is a 'reality' character, said The Atlantic. Wolff would produce a sequel the following year with the somewhat eerily predictive title of Siege: Trump Under Fire. While there were again many blind quotes, the second book also identified former Trump strategist Steve Bannon as a major source.
There is a record from Latvia to Ukraine that settles the whole matter. It says: we have evidence, substantial evidence, and one of the subjects of our investigation, Hunter Biden, for $14.8 million money laundering scheme that went from Ukraine to Latvia, Latvia to Cyprus, somehow Belize was involved. And then it went into Hunter Biden's account. And the only way we got the records of Hunter Biden's account is because his partner, Devon Archer, the other guy being paid off, was convicted of insider trading.

LANDAU: I mean, he didn't want Anjelica to know what kind of life my home life was because I don't let her in on that. So Anjelica's character was not privy to that part of the story. You know, a lot of times, actors are bogged down by obligation. An actor knows much more about a character than the character knows about himself. And to know everything there is about a character consciously may not enable you to play the character, necessarily.
The narrative that Ashe is referring to — that the Endangered Species Act is flawed because animals don't come off it — is a popular one with Congressional Republicans and others opposed to the law.

RICHEN: Yeah, absolutely.

And - you know, and they would just drive and not stop, or they knew only where to stop, specific places. We had one woman say, you know, she never knew why we only went to certain places. But, you know, as she got older, she knew that that was because they were using the Green Book. The family was using the Green Book and only going to the places that were designated. And they did. They had to prepare for these long journeys.
Raffensperger also told the president that social media was a problem, and Trump interrupted to say that social media is Big Tech and was on Raffensperger's side.

Second, Tehran is trying to create a ticking clock with its nuclear program. The parliament passed legislation that sets up a series of dates when Iran is to take new nuclear steps. The most provocative next step, a significant reduction in international inspector access, is slated for late February. But these deadlines are purely artificial. Iran's nuclear policy is ultimately under the control of Khamenei, not the rambunctious, hawkish parliament or the lame-duck president. Deadlines can and will be fudged depending on the overall political environment.

And now you walk into a club house and there are more and more bilingual reporters covering Major League Baseball.

Keith Woods, NPR's vice president for newsroom training and diversity, also told me he believes that the lack of change in the overall newsroom picture does not reflect progress that has been made.

In China, where the virus was first identified in December, health officials reported 5,090 new infections and 121 new deaths, bringing the total number of cases in China since the outbreak began to 55,748, with 1,380 deaths. In its announcement on Thursday, the National Health Commission said the new toll takes account of some deaths in Hubei province, the epicenter of the epidemic, that were previously double counted.

And so that kind of thing used to be quite common in psychology. It actually is – to the surprise of some – it's also common out of branches of science and biology. It's not uncommon for people to run, say five miles and if things don't look that promising, they collect another five miles. And so, those kinds of things that seem innocent end up messing up the statistical analysis.

The agreement also, significantly, sets a global target to keep the rise in the average temperature to no higher than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. And it calls for some $100 billion a year in funding from developed countries toward developing countries to support green energy sources.

The drug is expensive — about $90,000 a year. Novartis, the company that makes Gilenya, helps defray that cost for Catton and other patients by making their copayments directly to the patient's health plan; Catton's copay for the medicine is roughly $3,800 a month.

The People's Climate March occurred in Washington and other cities across the globe in an effort to bring attention to the new administration's skeptical views on climate change, planned cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency and generally more solicitous approach to business interests that might adversely impact the climate and the environment in various ways.
It started when platform committee member Diana Denman tried to insert language calling for the U.S. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian government, which is fighting a separatist insurrection backed by Russia. Denman says she had no idea she was going into a fire fight, calling it an interesting exchange, to say the least.

The Russian airstrikes, which began last Sept. 30, allowed Assad and his forces to go on the offensive in the western part of the country, where most of the population and the major cities are. They advanced on several fronts in a war that had largely turned into a stalemate.
An administration official who was not authorized to speak on the record told NPR on Tuesday, The VP intends to follow the law and uphold the Constitution tomorrow. This official noted that Pence, who is a lawyer by training, has prepared for the joint session by meeting with the Senate parliamentarian, reading legal opinions and studying the Constitution.
DAVIS: There has certainly been a number of Republicans - a handful of Republicans, not an overwhelming number - who have come out and said that the events of the day changed their mind. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, a Republican from the state of Washington, a former member of leadership, was one of those Republicans. Also, Senators Steve Daines of Montana, James Lankford of Oklahoma put out a joint statement saying that they would no longer consider themselves objectors in the Senate. There is also increasingly some tension within the party. There has been Republican senators on the floor tonight really critical of their colleagues who have objected to the processing. It undermines democracy. It undermines the system. Mitt Romney of Utah, obviously a former presidential candidate himself, gave a really impassioned speech on the Senate floor just now, saying that if you want to give Americans confidence in their election, the most important thing you can do is tell them the truth - in his words - and the truth being that Joe Biden won this election. So a lot of recriminations, I think, still to come within the Republican Party for over how lawmakers sort of supported and tried to legitimize many of the president's false allegations here.
Seth Masket, a political science professor at the University of Denver, said those legal battles are a long way off. In the short term, he sees it as a way to center a familiar debate over the unique way the country decides its president.

If the outbreak ultimately makes it impossible to gather self-reported information from certain households in time, the bureau may have to turn to alternatives to fill in the gaps, including a cache of existing government records from other federal agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Postal Service.
KANDER: Right. We - Fred lives about four blocks from my house. And he likes to stay home to work, I like to go out to work. And at 10 o'clock or so in the morning, I'll go over to his house and we will sit around the kitchen table and have some coffee and gossip a little and then go to work. And we - if we're working on a moment in a show, for instance, we'll be talking about the characters and the situation that we're about to musicalize (ph). And Fred may have an idea or a phrase, and from that phrase maybe we'll develop a rhythm.

If North Korea is going to collapse, he says, no external force can prop it up. Frankly speaking, whether it collapses or continues to develop will mainly depend on its own domestic and foreign policies.
'This Was A Scam': In Recorded Call, Trump Pushed Official To Overturn Georgia Vote
Those channels broadcast an absolutely clear message, Zhuk said. 'Americans have lost their minds. Will Americans stop having sex? Will they stop having romantic relationships? They have pushed this to the point of absurdity!'
UNIDENTIFIED ACTOR #1: (As character) Please.
Economist Jared Bernstein says there is something to the idea that there are still underlying economic problems. He served as chief economist to former Vice President Joe Biden but has not publicly endorsed a candidate.
This is the time to prepare for the event of community transmission in the U.S., she said. For most patients who develop COVID-19, Schuchat explained, appropriate care would mean home isolation, using health care facilities only as needed for the elderly and for those with severe cases or other medical conditions.
INSKEEP: It's interesting to hear you say that you feel that he's become more patient over time because there are also moments in recent months when he has seemed a little fed up with his critics. I'm thinking notably of when his ISIS strategy was being criticized. And he said, well, if people want to pop off about that, they ought to come up with a better idea. That was taken as a sign of annoyance.
Mr. CHESNUTT: Yeah. I mean, it could - I'm not sure exactly. I mean, I don't have cash money to pay these people. I tried to pay them. I tried to make payments and then they finally ended up saying, no, you have to pay us in full now. And so, you know, I'm not sure what exactly my options are. I just - I really - you know, my feeling is that I think they've been paid, they've already been paid $100,000 from my insurance company. That seems like plenty. I mean, this would pay for like five or six of these operations in any other country in the world. You know, it affects - I mean, right now I need another surgery and I've been putting it off for a year because I can't afford it. And that's absurd, I think.

But the immediate focus in Washington and national politics has shifted to the Senate, control of which is up for grabs depending on the outcome of Tuesday's runoff elections in Georgia. If Republicans preserve their majority in the upper chamber, they'll likely prevent Biden and Pelosi from achieving many of their aims.
The phone survey of 1,259 adults was conducted by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion between Jan. 7 and Jan. 12. It has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points when adults are referenced and 3.8 percentage points when registered voters are referenced.

What makes this case so important is that the Supreme Court clearly decided not to weaken the [current] standard, Thompson said. And I think it will make it more difficult for prosecutors to engage in the kind of blatant and purposeful racial discrimination as the prosecutors did in this case.

KAPLAN-LEVENSON: A decade earlier, California Senator Alan Cranston had tried to get federal funding for battered women's shelters.
So there's a sort of an uplift in this song, a sort of an acoustic guitar-led (ph) sort of optimism and speed about its playing, which I really sort of enjoy. And it is - it gives the film a great sort of sense of forward motion and sort of uplift that I really like. That'd be a nice way to end on.
So we may have developed color vision to see faces. But this raises another question: Why do faces fluctuate in color in the first place?
With the invention of film and later photo sensors, it became possible to capture that screen image.
For many homeowners, rising values made it attractive to refinance their mortgages and use their home equity to pay for other things — investment properties, remodels, cars.
And that really is the dynamic of the film is how she managed with that and how each of those challenges made each other - harder thing to do and so why she almost lost the pride. But in the end, because she's an incredible lioness, she managed to keep them together and rebuilt the pride and is now - and it became a powerful one again with resident males who then became the protectors.
There were so many - you know, there were more than 9,500 listings in the book over the years and places like the Gaston, which was considered the finest Negro motel in the country. So that was frustrating to see that portrayal of the Green Book in the film. And the other thing is that they only used it - they only picked up the Green Book when they were in the South. And that plays into the mythology that this was - you know, racism was something that was only in the South. So those were my two big criticisms in terms of, you know, how the Green Book was portrayed.
SIEGEL: We have two competitive races for the presidential nominations on the Republican side. We have Donald Trump, of course, plus two Cuban-American freshman senators in their mid-40s - Ted Cruz of Texas...

So how does he separate his grief from that which the broader society is going through?
The funny thing is, on the record, we were convinced it wasn't powerful or howling or crazy enough, like, because we've done it live so many times that we were - live it just felt like the most, you know, monolithic hurricane of all time. And then we recorded it, and we just kept fighting against the fact that we thought it sounded small, and no one else seems to think it does. So I'm really glad. I think we were just - we were just used to, you know, being in front of the amps and hearing how massive it was that we kind of lost track of the scale of the song.
Twigby offers coverage anywhere on the 4G and 3G Sprint Nationwide Network and also provides Verizon network coverage as a secondary network.
Our hope is that the Biden team has gotten some of that information and feels that we can make this kind of a change and that there's going to be adequate continued supply of the vaccine, he says. So that when people do come back for their second doses, there will be a second dose for them to have.
A new post-season format threw out the old and brought in the new. Up until this year, the WNBA like the NBA, created a playoff bracket by taking the same number of teams from the Western and Eastern Conferences. Those teams would play the other teams in their conference and ultimately a conference champion would emerge. The finals would pit the West champion against the East.

Now, following his precepts, she took this woman's side and photographed her staring at the bed, capturing her pathos and her tragedy.
Yet this new variant is the same as its predecessor when it comes to subsidies to help individuals pay for insurance. It would mostly reduce subsidies and cause out-of-pocket costs to rise, as the CBO said about the previous bill. It's not yet clear how the state grants would alter that dynamic.
Local election officials get relatively high marks from voters, with 68% expressing confidence that officials will run a fair election in 2020. Nearly 6 in 10 respondents say they plan to vote in person on Election Day. Twenty-three percent say they will vote by mail or absentee ballot. Another 18% said they would cast their ballot at an early voting site.
The Trump campaign convinced the platform committee to change Denman's proposal. It went from calling on the U.S. to provide Ukraine lethal defensive weapons to the more benign phrase appropriate assistance.
RUSSAKOFF: Yes. I want to point out, though, that Chris Cerf, who was the - at the time, the state commissioner of education, did negotiate with the legislature a new tenure law that won a lot of new accountability measures from the teachers' union. And the one thing that the teachers' union insisted on was that they would make all these compromises, but they had to leave the seniority protections absolutely intact. And so that was the compromise that Christie made. And so the seniority protections became automatically a part of this new contract in Newark, which was supposed to be, you know, in the words that the reformers were using, a transformational contract that would become a model for how to reform school districts all across the country, and it was not.
Hartley says that for one thing, Mckesson entered the race at the last possible moment — months after the others. What's more, his many rivals are also talking about policing and inequality.
Once this site is finished, the entire $800 million ballistic missile defense shield for NATO countries in Europe, more than a decade in the making, will be complete.

MARTIN: So I understand that you called 314 Action an Emily's List for scientists, and for people who don't know, Emily's List is a group that's been around for - what? - a couple of decades now that raises money for promising democratic women candidates at all levels who favor abortion rights. Are there similar baseline positions that must be adhered to for your group to support these candidates?
JOSH HAWLEY: For those who have concerns about the integrity of our elections, those who have concerns about what happened in November, this is the appropriate means. This is the lawful place where those objections and concerns should be heard.

LIASSON: So he sympathized with the protesters, and many in his own party are saying he incited them. And now the question is, what happens next? Will there be any consequences for the president?
KLAIN: Absolutely. And that is impactful in this conversation, Steve, because that means that we're not in a kind of a national bubble where, after 14 days, this is all going to go away. Those people who are out there doing their jobs are going to continue to get the disease and - completely no fault of their own - spread it, as will our health care workers on the front lines of the hospital. So it's going to take more than 15 days for this to be behind us. That's what other countries have seen already. There's no reason to think that's not true for us.
Some of Happer's colleagues at Princeton are reluctant to talk publicly about him; it's like discussing a relationship that got messy.
SAGAL: All right, then. How many does Joel need to win?
I was probably early high school or late middle school, and I had one of those TI-85 calculators. I just started reading the manual, and I realized I could make video games on it. And so that was my first hook. And that was back in the day when you didn't have the Internet to look up things and to get help. But that immediately got me hooked, where you said, hey, you can create anything you want using a computer.
The industry giants are narrowly threading the needle. After the bill passed the House, the Internet Association said the industry not only is committed to ending trafficking online but also will defend against attempts to weaken these crucial protections of Section 230.
Increased bird feeding has something to do with it, but certainly the temperature changes and other changes associated with climate change seem to have a big impact on that, Brown said.

And I was, like, getting good at making them learn how to do this. And I, (laughter) - you could have long discussions into the night, especially if you're a sophomore in college, about whether that's a moral thing to do. But the interesting thing about it is, I understood just from doing that that when you're in a war, it's real. It's the real thing. People are going to get killed or lose their arms and legs. And when we did MASH, I wanted to make sure that at least that understanding that I had came out - that that's what we dealt with, and that we didn't gloss over that and make the show about how funny things were in the mess tent.

In the early 21st century we, too, are headed toward some destination we cannot know, but we can at least get a handle on the direction we are moving. Will we know by the end of these conversations which way the arc of history is bending? Maybe not, but it's worth trying.
By Thursday evening, the White House was reported to be preparing language for a declaration of a national emergency, a tactic that had been mentioned before but that Trump has so far chosen not to pursue.
Qadri was convicted under anti-terrorism laws because, in 2011, he shot dead the governor of Pakistan's Punjab province, a widely-admired progressive politician and businessman, Salmaan Taseer, for whom Qadri worked as a bodyguard.

From Refugees To Politics, Mohsin Hamid Writes The Change He Wants To See
The Capitol is the closest thing to a national civic temple we have or would ever want in America. People who have been there once remember the awe they felt. People who go there nearly every day can still have that feeling.
During the bust, Hahn would go out driving with investors, looking up foreclosed homes and evaluating their condition. Sometimes the departing owners would clean the place before leaving. More often, they did not. Hahn saw properties that had been stripped of cabinetry, doors, air conditioners, copper pipes, even the lightbulbs. The worst were the houses that had been intentionally defaced by their desperate, angry former owners.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: Teachers are demanding better pay and better funding for their schools. Protests have spread from West Virginia to Oklahoma and this past week to Colorado and Arizona, where teachers went on strike.
Below are highlights of the interview, edited for length and clarity:
We are in touch with local officials and will follow their guidance, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa told The Arizona Republic. There are no plans to cancel the debate.
While the change in the board is welcome, it's still taken way too long, said Dodd in a statement. And it doesn't make sense to wait another day on these changes with another fire season on the horizon. Time will tell if this new leadership instills the badly needed culture of safety at PG&E.
Even so, a more robust testing regime likely will reveal more cases, officials said.
Yes. Retrieving her coat, Patsy made her way to the leather sofa. Claire followed, careful not to touch her but close enough to help if she stumbled. Patsy shaped her coat into a pillow, unfolded the tartan blanket draped across the sofa's armrest to cover her legs, and settled herself on her side. She closed her eyes. A lock of hair fell across her cheek. Claire pretended to busy herself with the equipment. After several minutes, Patsy's breathing took on the steadiness of sleep. Claire used the Leica. Although she bracketed the shot, she trusted she had what she wanted on the first try: the entire scene a blur except for Patsy's now-innocent, sleeping face.
So last question, I suppose, actually two more. John Durham. You've been in touch with John Durham at all? Has he reached out to you?
At one point, they have a fight in front of the Hoover Dam. This is partly a visual gag about scale. Their personal squabbling is dwarfed by the dam. But we also sense the gap between the grandeur of this depression-era triumph of the collective spirit and the debased landscape they travel in, with its mini-malls and Der Wienerschnitzel fast-food restaurants. If there's more to America than this, they can't see it, which isn't to say that they don't learn anything from being on the road.
Mr. WEINBERG: What's a billion years here and there?
Andto get it going as quickly as possible. While that vaccine is in the works, you've also been talking about using existing drugs that could help treat COVID-19. How soon could people expect to be able to use these kinds of drugs if, you know, if at least one of them is already approved for other uses?
That word is really heavy, explains Salma Ali, 19, a Somali-American college student who grew up in the Twin Cities area. Her friend, Yusra Abdi, also 19, agrees.
What we actually saw before we had to leave the first time was one female did make it out. And she - what she did was she wouldn't give up. She had a little chick on her feet. And she used her beak as a kind of ice pick to give her this extra traction. And she sort of kind of chipped little bits into the ice and then would pull herself up. And she finally managed to get out. I think that gave us the thought that, actually, they can get out if they just had - could get a tiny little bit more traction.
GATES: And then when they did my admixture, I'm 50 percent sub-Saharan African and 50 percent European and virtually no Native American ancestry, which really pisses my family off.
Around dinnertime on Tuesday, just about four hours into the impeachment trial of President Trump, Sen. Jim Risch, R-Idaho, did not look enthralled by House Democrats' presentations. In fact, he looked the opposite. Eyes closed, he was slumped over and appeared to be snoozing.
In contrast to development banks and rich country governments, the GCF also has a governing structure that gives developed countries a say over which projects get approved. The GCF was set up within the umbrella of the United Nations system expressly for this purpose. And its governing board is equally divided between representatives of developed and developing countries — winning valuable buy-in from the recipient countries, says Brown, a former international climate finance negotiator at the U.S. State Department.
MOMTAZ: We communicate through secure messaging apps over the phones, over the internet really. So the way we went about finding her was to go through a wide network of sources that we've cultivated over the years of covering the war in Syria.

Medicare for all and student loan forgiveness, for example, the preference for Virginia voters are modest reforms, not the full monty that the Sanders campaign is offering.
But what's interesting is that he initially had thought that, you know - this is what Cory Booker had told him and what he banked on - was that in five years, they would have a model for how to turn around a failing school district, how - as Booker said, how to flip a city and take it from very, very poor schools and poor performance of children to what he called a model of educational excellence.
But this year's Republican race for the nomination is shaping up to be something different.
North Korea's most recent nuclear test has put Beijing on the back foot, undermining its diplomatic ties with Seoul and raising the possibility that the U.S. could install missile defense systems in South Korea.

ALDA: I really had a tremendous education watching the greatest comics that we had at the time - Rags Ragland, Phil Silvers, Red Buttons. All these people were - Hank Henry. He was another great burlesque comic. He was my father's partner, and my father and Hank would write their own sketches. Watching them from the wings, and then later watching Sam Levene when he acted with my father in Guys And Dolls, I would stand in the wings twice a day for two years watching them. And I'd especially watch Sam.
The approval is a 10-year experiment, according to Friday's announcement by Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The approach has been pushed for decades by conservatives who say states too often chafe under strict federal guidelines about enrollment and coverage. They think they can find ways to provide care more efficiently, she says.
Sometimes, needed information goes beyond simple observations on water levels or color; it can require doing a quick lab test on the go.
Finally, in a reference to the internal conversations that were convened following the ouster of Oreskes, Turpin said, we need to make sure that the newsroom comes out stronger from the mishegoss of the last few months.

A popular example of traveling back in time is the fascinating Canadian TV series Travelers: In a distant future, the Earth is in shambles; humans are controlled by a benevolent artificial intelligence that finds a way to project the consciousness of people into unaware hosts in the 21st century. The idea is that travelers from the future take over the minds of people in the 21st century right before they are about to die. There is some obscure talk about quantum entanglement of consciousness between traveler and host, but this is secondary. The point of the show is that the travelers go back to try to change the course of history — so that the future looks better.

And in fact, it's exactly that if we say we're guaranteed to discover all these new particles of Large Hadron Collider and we see nothing, then how can we come back and later say, you know, that was what we really wanted. Okay.
It is possible that Comey would write the Barr passages somewhat differently today, having seen the recent turnaround by the attorney general in rejecting Trump's false accusations of election fraud. It is also possible Comey would rethink his negative recommendation on seeking criminal charges against Trump based on the Mueller report. Setting those issues aside, would it make sense to charge Trump for pressuring Georgia state officials to find votes for him? Or for inciting rioters to breach the Capitol and disrupt the counting of electoral votes?
Shortly before the violence yesterday, the departing president incited a group of supporters outside the White House. He repeated the lie that he had won the election.

RICHEN: Yes. It was Standard Oil then, and it was owned by Rockefeller. Rockefeller was one of the owners. And Rockefeller was married to a woman. Her last name is Spelman. They were from a family of abolitionists. Spelman was - they started the HBCU Spelman College in Atlanta, the women's college. So there was a history of working to advance racial African-American rights that Rockefeller had. And he hired black chemists very early, or Esso did. They had - they marketed to the African-American community. You know, they were also smart, and they knew that this was a a potential customer base.

I totally disagree with that. I think you can have a lot of people who are in poverty who are not adversely affected by that at all, who have a winning attitude and who will do whatever they need to do to be successful. And I would encourage people to go to the Horatio Alger Society website, and read those hundreds of biographies there of Americans who rose through incredible odds and severe poverty to become leaders in our society

I think my mother would want me to do whatever she thought I wanted to do. My mother, I write about it in the book, when she was in the hospital — and it was when I was just starting my race for attorney general — she had, at that point, disassociated from many things. She was turning things off. She was otherwise a voracious reader and passionate. She'd scream at the TV when necessary, when some debate was happening. And she was laying with her face turning the other way so her back was where I was, because I was just spending time with her. And then she said, Kamala, How's the race coming along? And I said, Well Mommy, they say they're gonna kick my ass. And she turned around in the bed and looked at me with this big smile across her face — and that says it all.

SHARP: Well, it's completely wrong. For over 40 years now, Congress and courts that have looked at Title IX have all consistently said Title IX was meant to combat sex discrimination. It's never been interpreted to include gender identity, and so the idea was always to ensure equal opportunities for men and women. Importantly, Title IX was specifically written to protect student privacy. It allows schools to have separate restrooms and locker rooms and dormitories on the basis of sex. So what the Obama administration is doing here is essentially rewriting the law, ignoring Congress, ignoring the normal process they're supposed to go through to force their agenda on schools across the country.
A lot of people gave Sen. Sanders flack for not getting involved in these races earlier, but the reality is he's got a presidential campaign to run, Sroka said. As a campaign themselves they should be focused on winning their race. That's one of the reasons we've stepped in.

So really, the dangers we face are really driving around, flying around, going in boats or occasionally bumping into people with guns.

So we basically had half court, and we had the best basketball goal with a breakaway rim because the city park - the goals always break because they're rusted and crusty, and they replace them with other rusty and crusty rims.

I could be wrong about this, but I think when you look at the history of owners dealing with their own - it's not like they're dealing with a player because you have an owner-management-labor relationship where they are - they took a long time to go after their greatest superstar, Tom Brady, over a couple of years' worth.

SCHMITZ: Yeah. I mean, part of the reason is that this is not only Xi Jinping's first visit to Hong Kong as president, but it's also his first visit since 2014. And that's the year that pro-democracy protesters shut down the city's financial district for months. And that led to a violent police crackdown. And the protesters were angry because they felt China broke its promise from back in 1997 that it would ensure a high degree of autonomy for the city, and it would allow Hong Kong citizens to vote for their local leader.

Of course, educators and curriculum developers ask themselves these questions all the time — they're the ones deciding what to teach, and how and when to go about doing so. Organizations like the National Association for the Education of Young Children, for example, have articulated principles of child development and learning, and different educational philosophies embody their own commitments. If we started from these general principles, though, rather than preconceived notions of what formal education ought to look like, might we arrive at very different views about the value of emphasizing social-emotional development versus geography, or music versus mathematics?

Justice Scalia was a larger-than-life figure, and he helped to shape the dialogue and the debate. But if you think about when the Supreme Court has been held in the highest esteem and has moved the country forward in the most powerful of ways, generally it hasn't been divided just along 5-4 votes. And Judge Garland, if you look at his work on the D.C. Circuit, has been able to bring together conservatives, liberals and move them to find common ground. And I think that's a valuable quality that has been reinforced by the statements that were made by Republicans.

He says he wasn't in Vienna and he showed me his passport and he hasn't been in Vienna for seven years. Devin Nunez has shown his passport. He was not in Vienna. He was actually on that very day someplace else where he has a tape of it. So that's the third lie. By the time he gets up on the witness stand – before you even get involved in whatever else he did bad in the past, he's lied three times as part of his audition to becoming a witness.

If the new variant increases the risk of shedding or just provides more chances for it to happen, increased masking and distancing, crowd avoidance and hand-washing will help stop the spread.
The exhibit features images from a collection of mine called The World Is 9, which is an expression my grandmother would say. It means the world is never a perfect 10. A lot of the challenges that we face come from within us. It's not based on our geographical location, it's not based on our culture; it's not based on our education. Someone in New York — whatever they're going through — and someone in Ethiopia are not completely different. We share commonalities. We have to question our own humanity and understand the universality of our existence.
SAGAL: Hey, how are things in LA?
More than 76 million Americans are covered by the state-federal health program — a million more than when the Trump administration took charge in 2017. Enrollment has jumped by more than 5 million in the past year as the economy slumped with the pandemic.

Thomas' testimony against the 80-year-old Cosby on charges that he sexually assaulted Andrea Constand at his Philadelphia home in 2004 was meant to bolster the prosecution's case that the defendant has a long history of such assaults. Besides Constand, at least four other women are expected to provide similar testimony.
Amanda Johnson is hoping to buy some used fence posts. She and her husband, Matt, raise cattle and crops near Scribner, Neb. Making money looks tough for them this year. It really depends on markets, Johnson says. I'd say even if you can break even, that's doing pretty good.
The data collected will be used for a major reset in political power and federal funding through 2030. Each state's share of representatives in Congress, as well as votes in the Electoral College, will be determined for the next decade by the new population counts. Those counts are also used to distribute more than $880 billion a year in federal funds for Medicare, schools and other public services, according to the latest estimate by The George Washington Institute of Public Policy.

Democrat Raphael Warnock made history in one of Georgia's two Senate runoffs on Tuesday when he became the first Black person to be elected to the Senate from the state and the first Black Democratic senator from the South.
I have signed a declaration of local emergency for the City of Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced via Facebook. While there are only a few known active COVID-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.
There are other opposition leaders who have never even seen a police station. But these ones whom you are talking about, they want to use violence to influence people, and that one our society cannot allow.
Last week's challenge: A spoonerism is when you change the initial consonant sounds of two words in a phrase to get a new phrase. For example, Tames Jailer is a spoonerism of the singer James Taylor. Spark Mitts is a spoonerism of the swimmer Mark Spitz. The name of what famous entertainer — first and last names — has a two-word spoonerism meaning A runny variety of cheese?

During the campaign, Trump repeatedly called the government's unemployment numbers phony — arguing the jobless rate was higher than reported. Asked about the change in tune, press secretary Sean Spicer quoted Trump in Friday's press briefing: They may have been phony in the past but it's very real now.
But in 2020, confronted by the coronavirus, our national spirit of shared challenge and commitment has been uneven, at best. To be sure, many responsible leaders in the public sector have been stepping up, closing schools and other government functions. Many in the private sector are also voluntarily taking steps to mitigate risk. This includes many businesses and the major professional sports and the collegiate athletic programs as well. It includes many private colleges and universities, theaters and churches, and civic groups of various kinds.
For many in Latino and Black neighborhoods, trust in the Chicago Police Department simply doesn't exist. Years of policies detailed in a blistering Department of Justice report explains why.
Wolf on Tuesday also announced the GreenGov Council, a committee that will work with all state agencies to reduce energy use and bolster energy efficiency within state buildings. The council has several of its own targets:
MOORE: And the funny thing is, you know, women liked me. They were not envious of the fact that their husbands had a crush on me. It was OK with them. They were the first to - you know, when I would meet people, they'd say, my husband loves you so much and he thinks you're so sexy. And this was - it was an odd thing because they were also able to identify with me as a friend, as a girlfriend. There was no resentment and no fear.
Whatever may happen in the streets Wednesday, it will not prevent Congress from performing its role under the Constitution. But it will likely heighten public awareness of that role and how it is performed.
It's hard to find anything good to say about a government shutdown — especially the longest one in U.S. history. But at least we all know more now about something we all took for granted: the president's annual State of the Union speech to Congress in the Capitol.
Human civilization began about 10,000 years ago with dawn of agriculture (give or take a millennia or so). This seems like such a long time that it can be hard to reconcile with the short span of our lives.
As NPR's Scott Horsley reported, the Obama administration warned that schools that defied the recommendation could be at risk of losing federal funds. Thirteen states challenged the Obama guidelines, and a Texas judge put them on hold.
Patsy gave Claire a grateful smile, as if they were two mothers at the playground plotting a treat that was supposed to be for their children but was actually for the grown-ups.
But we knew that when you those - the heavy chords kicked in, we wanted everyone on top of them. I mean, it just made sense for it to be, you know, a real punch in the gut. And Vic's songs are deceptive, because when he plays them by himself, they're so beautiful that part of you is like I just don't want to touch this. It's like - and a lot of Vic's records are really just Vic playing and singing, and it's masterful.

Elis owns small .38, which she says she took a lot of time getting comfortable with shooting on public lands. She says the rural-urban divide might prevent people from understanding why she owns a gun.
Yet the protesting teachers have already rejected this proposal, calling it unsustainable as it is currently drawn up. Teachers groups, including the Arizona Parent Teacher Association, argue that under the plan the raise would simply cause woes for others in the state's educational system.
Until recently, Arthur worked at the Career and Technology Center at Union High School, teaching mechatronics — a field that includes elements of mechanical and electric engineering with computer programming. The students' petition praises her dedication to them and to the program.
The potential of a Logan Act violation was raised again when Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii met with Syrian leader Bashar Assad in January of this year, before Trump was sworn in.

The men who took part in the sit-in outside parliament are Barelvi Muslims, a branch of Islam followed by a large proportion of Pakistan's 190 million people. Barelvis are often loosely characterized as moderate in their faith, which is entwined with Sufi mysticism and ancient South Asian folk practices.
Kim Wehle, law professor at the University of Baltimore and author of How to Read the Constitution — and Why, told NPR's Steve Inskeep on Morning Edition on Monday that it's a crime to request, solicit or ask someone else to say falsify returns or falsify reports of votes, and arguably that's what we heard on the call.
By staying in the deal, the U.S. would have kept a spot at the negotiating table — and potential influence over how the agreement is enforced.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has an almost equally high favorability rating as Sanders, but is not viewed as negatively. Others are potentially well-positioned, too. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke and California Sen. Kamala Harris are in a next tier and have a capability of taking off if they make a good impression as voters get to know them.
And we well know that year-end lists have additional lives as listening lists, shopping lists, booking lists and hiring lists. Artists inevitably benefit from the prestige that the polls confer, creating a feedback loop that validates and fosters the visibility of their future labors. It is therefore important to understand whether or not they are reproducing and reinscribing gender bias.
One thing that has happened in the polling is that the border wall has gotten a little bit more popular. It's still net unpopular right now. Forty-two percent of people say they support a wall. That's up from 34 percent a year ago. But 54 percent oppose the idea, down from 63 percent a year ago.

When the injection was complete, Dr. Stanton withdrew the needle and placed the syringe on the metal tray Nurse Brockett held out to him. In the silence the syringe clattered against the metal. She placed the tray on the bedside table and wiped the injection spot with a fresh alcohol dampened cotton ball, pressing against the skin to ward off bleeding.
BRYANT: Well, obviously, you've got Roger Federer going for his 19th - the ageless Roger Federer. You've got Roger Federer, of course. He's pretty good, as well. And he is going up against a player who beat him in 2014 at the U.S. Open, the semifinals, Marin Cilic. Cilic is a big hitter. Cilic is 6-foot-6, hits the ball about 130, 133 miles an hour on serve. This is his first Wimbledon final. But I think everyone is looking for Roger Federer to win his second major this year and 19th overall in his 8th Wimbledon. There's nothing he can't do, and he's playing great tennis. It would be a big upset for Roger to lose tomorrow. But, once again, you look at a guy like Cilic. In boxing, we say he's got a puncher's chance because he hits the ball very hard.
KURTZLEBEN: On top of all that, she also ran for Congress in Tennessee last year but lost in the primary. She knows any number of factors played into that. For example, she was deployed for part of the campaign. But she thinks the GOP needs to do more to get women like her elected.

With social distancing rules in place during the coronavirus pandemic, voting takes longer, so each objection could result in multiple hours of debate and voting.
Aside from the politics, there's the fact that climate change remains an impending threat — one for which the world has yet to come up with a fix.
I'm an idealist guy, Guerra says. So I guess Bernie would be my guy. But, you know, people aren't going to vote for him. What he wants to do – everything is great and we need it, right? But people are not going to stretch themselves that far out.
Mckesson has gotten props for his detailed policy papers. But it's his activism that has drawn national attention, from a White House meeting with President Obama to an appearance on Stephen Colbert's show, with his trademark smartphone in hand. He's trying to leverage this attention and his social media savvy to amplify traditional retail politics. Mckesson says people will direct message him on Twitter to say they'll gather 50 friends at their house if he shows up.
Not only that, but that could also have the pesky side effect of launching a trade war. Still, there's plenty more that could be helpful to U.S. goods producers.

When Mrs. Roosevelt spoke to the nation in the early evening, Claire was outside Grand Central Station. I have a boy at sea on a destroyer, the first lady said in her high-pitched voice, always surprising to Claire in a woman who otherwise seemed formidable. A dozen people pressed around the open doors of a Checker cab parked in front of the station, the radio turned up loud. Many of you all over the country have boys in the service who will now be called upon to go into action. . . . You cannot escape anxiety, you cannot escape the clutch of fear at your heart.
We need to continue to elect women leaders and to appoint women to positions of leadership ... My grandmother had another saying, which was: You may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're not the last. ... Daring to be the first woman elected to do something, or the first black woman to be elected is, by definition, ambitious. And it's also not only ... achieving representation, but in doing so, you know, people are not able to tell us: Oh, it can't be done — it's never been done, so it can't be done. It's about challenging the status quo.

To be clear, I am personally opposed to the death penalty. I have always been — and I remain — opposed to the death penalty. I believe for a number of reasons that it is a flawed system both in terms of the way that it has been applied historically, which is disproportionately against people of color and poor people.
Everything is connected, everything attracts everything else. Unless — unless you are free-falling. When you fall, you don't feel your own weight and things work as if gravity didn't exist for you.

The strongly worded warning came in response to outbreaks of the virus outside China, including in Iran, Japan, South Korea and Italy, which officials say have raised the likelihood of outbreaks occurring stateside.
But in attempting to wage peace with angry Trump voters state legislators also allowed, Giuliani and his team put on an embarrassing show that ultimately exposed the clear lack of evidence of voter fraud and likely backfired with somewhat-questioning voters who then saw the entire thing turned into a skit on Saturday Night Live, says Sellek.

There's also a broader question as to whether it would be constitutional. The Electoral College is clearly written into the nation's founding document.

Because you have articulated it very well, David, and that is in an urgent situation, the risk-benefit calculus changes. So if we feel like a particular approach, like I just described, sort of a holding of something for 60 days, is not going to provide great benefit to the American people and still going to ensure safety, we're going to get rid of that one.

Robinson goes further to say that who is voting produces a notion of consensus because they're more or less the same demographic in terms of race and gender. That allows them to think of themselves as a unified group. In other words, a feeling of a unity is derived from the shared values and identity of those participating — mostly seasoned white male critics — rather than the process or outcome. Adding additional women critics might then have another, larger impact on the poll by challenging that claim of unity.

It's, you know, why does a bee so fine tuned to be able to see the flowers? Because if it wasn't, they wouldn't survive. And in this case, it's cosmic evolution.
Down significantly among suburban men, a net-positive approval rating of 51-to-39 percent to a net-negative of 42 percent approve, 48 percent disapprove. That's a net change of down 18 percentage points.

There are many reasons cited behind this gap, including slavery and institutional and governmental discrimination that excluded people of color from programs that helped Americans build wealth and pass it down through the generations. As Code Switch writes: Segregation and redlining by banks made it impossible for many black and Latino families to secure mortgages, for example. The GI Bill, which helped establish an American middle class by helping veterans pay for college and buy homes after World War II, mostly excluded people of color.
See what I did there? That paragraph encapsulates the most tired cliché of science writing: It sounds like science fiction but it's true. 
I felt it was essential that the audience see themselves in this character, and that the only way to do that - I mean, the character doesn't do one single thing of redemption in the entire movie. He's an awful person. And I - you know, you could - in this clicker mentality we're living in, where people click things off television in 15 or 20 minutes, it'd be very easy for the audience to say, hey, this guy's a jerk, I don't like him, in 20 - and you don't have a movie. So how to delicately deal with that and also, you know, the Claire Bloom character...
CORNISH: So your reaction to Donald Trump's win tonight...
KURTIS: Josh, John Philip Sousa couldn't have done any better. We're going to call you a winner.
In response to union actions, many hospitals across the country have said worker safety is already their top priority, and unions are taking advantage of a difficult situation to divide staff and management, rather than working together.
He was just sobbing, and apparently it had just spilled over at that particular moment. He said, I can't go on, I can't do this. I am a dignified man. I have standards, and I am proud and I'm well-read and everybody thinks I'm stupid. And so Allan pulled out all the stops and reminded him of all the great clowns in history who were cerebral and admired and who did great works in life by not only the good works themselves but by making fools of themselves by pratfalling, by doing all the dumb things that make people think you're dumb. And he was pretty much convinced and on his way out of the door when Jim Brooks came in and said, ah, Ted, Ted, Ted, Ted, the world's favorite schmuck.
''I am well, he explained, according to an Associated Press translation, so it was decided I will be isolated at home.''

STEVE: After 13 billions years of - and almost infinite number of photons, I expect some of them have collided with each other. What happens to that energy?
About 80 percent of all subprime mortgages written during the peak of the housing bubble were what was known as exploding adjustable-rate mortgages. Lenders offered two or three years at an introductory teaser rate. Then, interest rates would jump as much as 4 percentage points, and the borrower's monthly payments would skyrocket. Rodriguez says she believes they were taken advantage of.

One of Yahoo's more popular services is its free email. Now the tech giant has revealed at least half a billion user accounts have been hacked. It's one of the largest data breaches on record. Yahoo says the theft occurred two years ago but they only detected it this summer. Then they waited until now to warn customers. NPR's Aarti Shahani has more.

The Trump administration is now trying to apply the same strategy to China, betting that it can pressure Beijing to address longstanding complaints about practices such as intellectual property theft.
KYLE: Oh, that's cute. So, yeah, free speech is over.
Wu says he fears this new, and in his eyes heavy-handed, response could end up alienating tens of thousands of students and researchers of Chinese origin. These are researchers who he believes provide the U.S. far more than anything China is getting through its Thousand Talents Plan.
With a GOP administration in place for the first time in eight years, congressional leaders have mapped out an ambitious legislative agenda, with goals to have bills to repeal and replace Obamacare, overhaul the tax code and build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, all before lawmakers break for the annual August recess.
But, you know, I think the way he described it — and I'll let him, as he makes the rounds with senators, describe it himself — the way he described it is that he has loved the law for a very long time. He has loved being a judge for a very long time. He occupies the most honored position in what is often considered the second most powerful court in the land. He's got a great job.
IRWIN: Absolutely. And even our candy and confectionery industry depends on cheap sugar. And we have a sugar policy that keeps out cheap sugar. Marco Rubio from Florida defends that. But we've lost thousands of manufacturing jobs in our candy and confectionery industry.

We have multiple places around the country, more than 1,200, of individuals who are trained ... and we're working with them. We're also looking at some uses of social media and the Internet to help keep people well-informed on how to do things. Giving them little quizzes that they can take, and things of that nature. It's really just a matter of making sure people are well-informed. You know Americans are industrious people. That's how America got to be a great place. We're not a little feeble people who have to be spoon-fed. But we do have to recognize where we are right now and utilize what we have in order to help facilitate the use of the tremendous intellect and energies that exist within our society.

Grizzly bears are slow to reproduce. They require massive amounts of habitat. And they kill people, Servheen says, in the matter-of-fact tone that earned him admirers and enemies during a 35-year career.
And it's so - such a fascinating place. It was developed. It started being developed in 1910. So really, really early on, African-American middle and upper class were coming to this, you know, coming to buy lots and build houses. One of the early developers was a - the first African-American surgeon at the University of Chicago who started buying plots there. African-American developers, real estate owners. So it really allows us to see too the - how the African-American middle and upper class have always been a part of this country as well.
Even if the latest jobs report was not a barn burner, it was certainly encouraging. Unemployment inched down to 4.7 percent, and hundreds of thousands of new people started looking for work.

Trump EPA Erects New Barriers To Crucial Science
Case in point: The 2018 NPR Music Jazz Critics poll had a total of four projects led or co-led by women in its top ten. At closer inspection, that is less than it appears: Two are the same person, guitarist Mary Halvorson, who received recognition for her recording Code Girl (Firehouse 12) and as a co-leader of the trio Thumbscrew with bassist Michael Formanek and drummer Tomas Fujiwara for Ours/Theirs (Cuneiform). Halvorson has appeared as a leader or co-leader in the top 50 of the poll 10 times. Some of the women who play in Halvorson's bands appear in the poll as leaders of their own projects, most prominently pianist Kris Davis, whose Diatom Ribbons (Pyroclastic) was No. 1 in 2019; this was her fourth appearance in the poll's top 50.
The arrest Thursday represents something of a surreal twist to a story that first surfaced late last month, when Chicago police revealed that Smollett had reported being assaulted in a possible hate crime. The actor and musician, who is black and gay, said two individuals had accosted him with racist and homophobic slurs, beaten him and placed a rope around his neck before fleeing.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., is going to introduce a counterproposal in the House on Monday afternoon. It's unclear whether Pelosi's move is a pressure tactic on the Senate to reach a deal or a firm commitment to move a House bill. Moving forward on competing legislation could delay negotiations considerably.
Although I do hope that once we do have a funeral, whenever that is, we'll be further along the path of processing this and we'll be able to kind of have more of a celebration of life, Scott says.
Mr. CHESNUTT: Angry that they revived me, you know? I'd be like, how dare you? You know, how dare you people interfere in my, you know, what is obviously my life, my wish? But you know, of course, as the hours and days wear on, you realize well, there is joy to be had. I mean, this is how I - I'm sure everybody's different, you know, just how I, how it struck me. You know, when the days would wear on, you know, I would start to, you know, see some joy again in the world and be like whew, I eked - I squeaked that one out.
Radio producers Lauren Krenzel and Therese Madden and Web producers Bridget Bentz, Heidi Saman and Beth Novey contributed to this story.

If I remember correctly, the president, Gerald Ford, was winning, winning, winning from New Hampshire on, and then suddenly he hit a block in North Carolina and Gov. Reagan started to win, win, win. So suddenly they came into the convention almost tied, Hess says.
Last week's challenge: Last week's challenge came from a listener named Dave, who's from the city and state that's the answer to this puzzle. Name a U.S. city and its state — 12 letters altogether. Change two letters in the state's name. The result will be the two-word title of a classic novel. What is it?

When Einstein came into the science scene at the turn of the 20th century, physics was in crisis. The physics developed from Galileo up to 1899 had three pillars: mechanics, electromagnetism and thermodynamics, the study of heat. And the three pillars were on shaky ground, as physicists couldn't use them to explain a series of phenomena that had been recently discovered in the lab and in the skies. New ideas were badly needed, but not much was coming forth. It was the perfect moment for a trailblazer.

They deserve to be treated with respect. And as my grandmother would say, an honest day's work is worth an honest day's pay.

Many hope the formal events on Friday, Mar. 1, will help restore, or in some cases establish, a sense of trust in communities that have long felt neglected or abused.
Aside from clarifying voting categories and the particulars of ballot submission, Davis is hands-off in his management of the poll, not wishing to influence the results.

The administration argues that much of this spending is ineffective and inefficient and that the money would be better spent elsewhere. And Carson tells NPR his agency's approach is aimed at breaking cycles of poverty long term. Housing advocates say the cuts would be devastating for millions of Americans who can't afford a place to live without assistance.
Starting Feb. 1, Cape Town will force residents to cut their water consumption to 13.2 gallons per day, down from 23 gallons. The city has already banned filling swimming pools and washing cars.

SAGAL: Well, you got there. That's all I can say. So I got to ask because, you know, the Super Bowl is this big event that we all watch. What is it like to be a player involved in it? I mean, you're preparing for a football game. And I understand that's a pretty hard thing to do. Did all the distractions of, like, media week and the week leading up - did that get in the way?
But if he lacks Trump's pugnacious style, Lighthizer shares most of his hardball views on trade, a fact pointed out by the president last October, when he unveiled the revised version of NAFTA known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.
Luckily, Most Companies currently offer a wide range of choices for consumers, from well-known brand names to less known but surprisingly well-established companies. With so much competition from cell phone companies in the last few years, prices of phone plans have definitely fallen, along with plans being offered without contracts.
Other NPR year-end lists, including those for Turning the Tables, are composed not through independent voting, but a nominations process, the sharing of listening lists before any voting takes place, messages over Slack channels and face-to-face discussions. Even interns have a say. Decisions are made collectively in dialogue rather than mathematically. The process is collaborative rather than independent and positivistic.

To establish her prerogatives, Claire took her equipment bags to a narrow table against the wall on the far side of the room. The table held a blue-patterned porcelain vase filled with white, billowy hothouse roses. Claire placed the vase on the floor. Sensing the nurse's glare at her back, she slowed her movements, staking her claim. She took off her jacket, folded it, and stashed it beneath the table. When Claire heard the nurse's footsteps leaving the room, she felt relieved: first skirmish won. She arranged her cameras and film on the table for easy access. In her notebook, she wrote down the details about Edward Reese. She checked the picture count on the cameras and sketched out rough captions. Claire was working alone today, without a reporter to take formal caption notes and help with the equipment. Ever since the attack on Pearl Harbor several days before, the office had been topsy-turvy. This assignment had come in unexpectedly, and with staff heading to Washington and Hawaii, editorial had no reporters to spare. Just as well. Claire preferred to work alone, without a reporter's interference.
Workers could be reluctant to go to a place where the homeless receive services, Thompson says. The places could be reluctant to let people in.
No other state has sought a block grant, and for good reason, Johnson says. It gives state officials a blank check and creates financial incentives to cut health care to vulnerable families.
LANDAU: Therefore, what you - what people in that condition are trying to do is trying to convince themselves they're relaxed and trying to appear relaxed to other people when, in fact, what's going on is contrary to that. So the actor has to create the degree of unrest and then try to cover it.
As Compton recalls, the tone of the convention was a far cry from the tense moments leading up to the nomination.

It's more than semantics. Many Republicans have been demanding the Obama administration provide a more robust response to Russia's incursions in Ukraine.
She is also crowdsourcing for more story contributions from women and men who have faced harassment on public transportation. Wroblewski ultimately wants to approach the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority about using her photos for anti-harassment campaigns within Metrorail stations and buses, replacing the agency's current ads.

The American Civil Liberties Union's James Esseks says in a statement:
NGUYEN: I don't know. I was very young when that happened. And I was probably less than 10 years old because I remember I was - it was Christmas Eve. I was watching Scooby-Doo! Christmas. My brother got a phone call - said to me, hey, mom and dad have been shot. And I had no reaction. I just wanted to watch my cartoon. And it's not that I didn't care. I just - I didn't know what to do with that incident. And then I remember my brother yelling at me because I didn't react.
The president is no longer traveling to Atlanta today. The CDC has been proactive and prepared since the very beginning and the president does not want to interfere with the CDC's mission to protect the health and welfare of their people and the agency, a White House official first explained, in a statement.
African-American - I love to joke about this. African-Americans all think that they're a descendant from a Native American. And the average African-American has less than 1 percent Native American ancestry, but they have 24 percent European ancestry. So where does that come from? It comes from slavery. Was this an equal sexual relationship? Of course not. So obviously rape or, at best, cajoled sexuality was the cause, but there are exceptions. When I did Morgan Freeman's family tree, it was obvious through his DNA that he was descended from a white man who was an overseer on a plantation in Mississippi. And we knew the name of his great-great-grandmother and the name of this white man. So overseer, slave plantation - rape, right? Except in the next scene, I showed him their headstones. They were buried next to each other. As soon as the Civil War ended, they became common law husband and wife...
Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, indicated at the press conference at the White House that the person who died did not have any link to foreign travel. The death comes soon after U.S. health officials began warning the public that the coronavirus now appears to be spreading within the country from person to person, independent of travel to affected areas around the world. The CDC acknowledged three other such cases, known as community spread, in the U.S. late Friday night.
The student group HU Resist led the sit-in that began on March 29.
Mr. CHESNUTT: (Singing) I think it's my attention span eclipted by TV at an early age. Well, who heard the radio when you are five years old? I used to watch Speed Racer with that hyper attitude that carried me here to this, a fluorescent enlightenment. I'm not a victim, I'm not a victim. Oh, I am intelligent, I am intelligent. I'm not a victim, I'm not a victim. Oh, I am an atheist, I am an atheist.
And he expressed frustration not only at Smollett's conduct but also at the amount of media attention it has received.
GOLDFARB: I was there on the White House lawn watching President Clinton sign it.
Mr. KRAUSS: Yes. To jump in to what Steve was saying, one of the things we're actually going to have a discussion, if not a debate, at this meeting about is that one of the explanations that's been proposed is one that many scientists distasteful, but it may be true.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: What are the next steps though? For example, former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick was defrocked earlier this month. In fact, you were instrumental in that decision. Victims want zero tolerance and that all priests who are found guilty have the same thing happen. Will it?
I have always been a huge admirer of his. I've always felt that the way he approaches cases — the intellect, the care to follow precedent, the consensus building — were qualities that would make him an outstanding Supreme Court justice.
Back when world leaders agreed to the $100 billion goal, it wasn't actually clear how much the developed world was currently spending. The only really good data we have is starting in 2014, says Martinez-Diaz. That's from a 2015 analysis by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and Climate Policy Initiative. And it's not very promising: It finds that the public and private sectors combined spent about $62 billion.
Some of the concerns weren't completely dramatic. In fact, Disability Rights Oregon pointed out that the Americans with Disabilities Act requires self-service gas stations to assist customers with disabilities.
Until recently, the best people could do to try to draw attention to such problems was to tweet pictures to the government or write letters to the newspaper — hoping someone with the power to make changes would take note.
And in fact, in some ways the South was a bit easier to navigate because there were signs, so you knew exactly where you could and couldn't go. Whereas in the North and the West, there weren't necessarily the signs but still the same conditions. So African-Americans had to figure out where they would go, where they would be able to sleep and where they would be served. And as you just heard, they would walk into places sometimes and would be denied.
Trumpism Suffers Untold Damage In Its Collision With The U.S. Capitol
Well. You could read the media. Then you'll find out.
NICKLOES: With only - what? - 13 seats now in the House of Representatives as Republican women, that is not at all indicative of who the Republican Party is.
ANTHONY FAUCI: They're not talking about withholding and not giving the second dose. They are completely committed to giving the second dose on time, but they feel that the importance of getting as many people as possible is worth the risk. Hopefully the companies will get the doses back there in time.
MOORE: Right. I think it's better said that we triumphed over.
Roy Austin Jr. has been named vice president of civil rights with the mandate to oversee Facebook's accountability on racial hatred and discrimination on its platform. He's slated to start Jan. 19.
Being remote forced us to document more — so document decisions, document learning, training, etc. — and that actually reduced the amount of time and back-and-forth, keeping everyone on the same page and on task, Friedman says.
Stabilizing a home has all sorts of positive benefits for a family. The kid gets to finish school. The neighborhood doesn't lose a crucial neighbor. The family gets to root down and get to understand the value of a home and avoid homelessness. And for all of us, I think [we] have to recognize that we're paying the cost of eviction because whatever our issue is, whatever keeps us up at night, the lack of affordable housing sits at the root of that issue. ...
The front-runner is state Sen. Catherine Pugh, who has touted her role on state and national police reform commissions.
They don't eat enough, Binsted says. They don't eat enough for a couple of reasons and boredom is one of them, the food isn't appealing. And that's okay for a short stay on the ISS but it's really not okay for the 2.5 years of a Mars mission. That malnutrition could seriously affect astronaut performance.
But this is but the briefest of thumbnail sketches of the Trump lit to date. Carlos Lozada, the estimable book editor for The Washington Post, in October published What Were We Thinking, the result of reading some 150 Trump-related or Trump-themed books, adding, That's just a fraction of the Trump canon. And he's ready for more, listing Trump aides he hopes will pitch in.
The frustration built to the point that he and some of his neighbors don't even call bear biologists anymore when they need to, Bradley says. They don't see the point.
Drug and alcohol abuse hinder the people of this community severely, Charles says. The streets here are bleak, with dilapidated and abandoned buildings. Guys walk around looking lost or haunted. Some of them stop by Many Pathways for safety, companionship or to attend 12-step meetings.
A love story turned murder mystery led to the collapse of Slovakia's government last week. But that failed to quell the largest protests in the Central European country since 1989, when the Velvet Revolution brought down communism there.
It's also about pulling in elements from Ethiopia. Church wall paintings here use primary color. I want to show a different way of looking at my country.

Perhaps no book ever could be. At least not as a weapon against a candidate or officeholder such as Trump. Comey surely lifted the lid on that little secret well before Woodward did.

Perkins stands on the town's main street, pointing to Manor Grocery, a convenience store that once served as one of the town's few grocery options.
SIEGEL: And to Israelis who say the Palestinian leadership is just too weak, perhaps because of Israeli policies, but for whatever reasons - and too divided and the leadership can never reach a tough agreement with Israel, what do you say?
YONG: So it's really hard to say. And there are actually several papers out there now that seem to come to differing conclusions about the seasonality question. So in general, coronaviruses do tend to infect people in the winter, and they disappear in the summer because it's hotter and more humid. Now, it's possible that this new coronavirus will also behave in the same way. And a lot of the people I spoke to felt that seasonality was likely. The problem is that the virus is now spreading through a global population of people who have no pre-existing immunity to it.
Thyne says the industry also could agree to stop using harmful chemicals in the process. Already, several of the largest drillers have agreed to stop using diesel, which can poison groundwater with benzene.
Let's say you choose 101-500 minutes, 1000 texts, and 500Mb of data for $30/month. If you use that, that's what you'll pay. However, if you use less or more of anything, your bill will automatically be adjusted accordingly. The idea with Ting is that you only pay for what you use, ensuring you're not overpaying for service you don't need.

She left home to study in the U.S., where she has earned three masters degrees. After finishing her second masters, all of the sudden there was rampant inflation and no jobs in Venezuela. Facing uncertain prospects back home, she decided she wanted her future to be in the U.S.
DAVIS: You know, there's still - have a long way to go. They're only on Arizona. They still have 48 more states in the electoral count certification process. It goes alphabetical by state. There was an initial objection raised to the Arizona count. They're still in the debate time for that. It's a maximum of two hours. This was an objection raised by Paul Gosar of Arizona that was seconded in the Senate by Ted Cruz of Texas. They have to exhaust this debate, and then both chambers have to vote on it. It will be rejected, and then they go back into joint session and will continue their way through the alphabetical list of states in order. The question is, will there be any other objections? There has been some news tonight. Several senators who were initially going to object to the Electoral College results have withdrawn their objections.
SAGAL: On Monday, over 200 workers at search giant blank announced they had unionized.
The lawmakers' statement comes days after Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri promised to vote against certifying the electors' votes over concerns about the integrity of this election.
In initial meetings with members of the Advisory Board and Daw Aun San Suu Kyi, it has become clear that I cannot in good conscience serve in this role, said Richardson.
Trump's answer on Thursday suggested that he would be open to a situation in which the government might buy a percentage of the stock of a big company in order to provide it with equity to continue operating through the economic shock associated with the pandemic.
GROSS: But you don't seem to have trouble with that.
The move is part of a larger push by the Trump administration to use price transparency to curtail prices and create better-informed consumers. Yet there is disagreement on whether posting the prices for hospital services and procedures will actually achieve that goal.
STABENOW: Sure. But I also believe that they should've joined us to remove him a year ago during the impeachment process. So they have to be accountable and answer the questions on their own, you know, behavior - but certainly would welcome them joining us.
A September 2015 Winthrop poll found Haley's approval rating among South Carolina voters was 55 percent. That number was similar before Haley gained praise for helping bring down the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina statehouse in the aftermath of a Charleston church shooting that killed nine black parishioners. But she did drop 10 points with Republicans. (By December, she was back up to 81 percent with Republicans.)

I think sometimes they're just giving me lip service, said Dave Mouw before a Jeb Bush campaign event in Sioux Center, Iowa. They're telling me what I want to hear. You can usually tell by a guy if he means it or not.
Called The Second Life of Nick Mason, the novel is so good, it legitimately stands shoulder-to-padded-paranoid-shoulder with the classics of the crime-noir genre.
The top areas that supported the constitutional change were in Dún Laoghaire, a suburb of Dublin (77 percent), and much of the capital city itself, reported RTÉ News.

And that could be a problem for Pence, who is often talked about as a potential 2024 presidential contender, if Trump doesn't run. If Trump ends up turning on Pence or doesn't publicly forgive him, then there are people in the Trump base who will never forgive Pence either, DuHaime said.

The rally was the capstone of a past week the White House spent holding events, putting out press releases and otherwise seeking headlines intended to highlight what it views as the new administration's successes in the last 100 days. Even before his rally Saturday night, the president himself seemed keenly aware that the day is historically a symbolic moment for the media, pundits, the country and perhaps even much of the world to assess his young presidency.
We talked less than a month ago. The U.S. at that point had just reached 300,000 deaths. We are now at more than 360,000 Americans dead. Should we expect this trend to continue?

There are so many terrific elements in this novel — Nick's haunted character, a plot that never darts in the direction you expect it to and a truly ingenious climax — that I could be here till Labor Day singing its praises. Instead, I'll change directions and mention another seasoned hard-boiled writer who introduced a superb new series several months ago.
The U.S. Virgin Islands were devastated by hurricanes Maria and Irma, leaving homes collapsed and trees toppled on land. But there was also a great deal of damage under the water. In St. John, the storms churned up parts of the lush coral reef, depositing chunks on the beaches. Joining us now to talk about it is marine biologist Peter Edmunds of California State University, Northridge. He's been studying those reefs in St. John for more than three decades.

MARTIN: And just today, House Speaker John Boehner said that he is, quote-unquote, hopeful about bringing up immigration reform in the House this year. We wanted to talk more about this, if there really is the political and popular well to address this country's immigration laws. So we've called upon somebody who's been following the issue closely. Fernando Espuelas is the managing editor and host of The Fernando Espuelas Show, which is broadcast on Univision America. Welcome back. Thanks so much for joining us once again.
Success however, is hardly certain. Past efforts for example the one that generated millions of comments on net neutrality, ultimately failed to sway administration officials' minds.
There is one notable exception though.
I think miscarriage is kind of a solitary loss to begin with. You know, nobody else has ever held that baby. No one has seen a picture of that baby. That baby has never smiled at anyone. There's nobody who has memories of that baby but me. There's nobody who ever held or carried that baby but me, she says.
Internally, Pacific Gas & Electric has dubbed this strategy Project Falcon. Under the plan, the company would sell its natural gas division this spring. After years of deadly errors and safety violations, the utility giant is looking for ways to cover liability costs and avoid bankruptcy, a senior company official and a former employee with knowledge of the plan tell NPR.
But it was Kuciak's last story that investigators suspect ultimately cost him and his fiancée, Martina Kusnírová, their lives. Police discovered their bodies on Feb. 25 in the white bungalow they'd been renovating since last summer in the small village of Veľká Maca in southwestern Slovakia. He was killed with a gunshot to the chest and she, with a bullet to the head.

SAGAL: Who knew? President Trump's first foreign trip starts this weekend. It's a doozy with five different countries on the agenda. Sources say he's visiting so many countries because he's not sure which one will offer him asylum.
Can you imagine the Bank of China putting money on that, or putting money into a fund that has on it the nephew of one of the most well-known organized criminals in America, Whitey Bulger's nephew? They did that because they wanted money in that fund, or did they do that to buy Joe Biden? And that's classically known as sale of office. Now, when you do that as often as they do it, then your defenses like Joe's defenses, I didn't know about my son's business. Hey, Joe, you traveled to China with him on Air Force 2. You were there for eight days. He was there for eight days. You failed. He won. You couldn't back off China like you fail all the time. And he comes back with an investment in a $1 billion to $1.5 billion fund. You mean you guys didn't talk about it or you didn't notice that over the years your brother James, who also was in a lot of screwed up businesses, all of a sudden became a millionaire? And you didn't notice that your son, Hunter, although he's been in rehabilitation four or five times, has become a millionaire. You didn't notice that, Joe? And after they say to you, I don't know my son's business, and your son's business is so stinky and so involved in following you around where you have offices to sell. At some point, Joe, don't you have to ask him? And what about Obama?
In 1915, Einstein expanded his theory to include motions with variable speeds (i.e., with acceleration). His theory of general relativity, arguably one of the towering achievements of the human intellect, imprinted the plasticity of space and time into the fabric of the universe itself. Now, the presence of any material object (or merely energy) could bend space and alter the flow of time. Space and time became literally pliable. For example, a light ray from a distant star would be deviated from a straight line as it passed by the sun. (It does as it passes by you, too, but the bending is so small as to be literally immeasurable.) In 1919, two expeditions were sent to test Einstein's prediction of this phenomenon. Their data, despite bad weather and measurement issues, were conclusive: Einstein was right.

Transcript: NPR's Full Interview With Trump Lawyer Rudy Giuliani
In Texas, the biggest prize in 2020 is not at the top of the ticket. Republican Sen. John Cornyn is running for re-election, but the race is failing to generate the buzz of the 2018 Senate contest. That's when former Democratic Rep. Beto O'Rourke attracted national headlines for challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz — a race Cruz won by just 2.6 percentage points. (A Texas Democrat hasn't won a statewide race since the early 1990s.)
Even the most generous plans often had lifetime maximum coverage limits of a few million dollars before the health law passed, and some plans also imposed annual coverage limits. The health law eliminated those dollar coverage limits.
And it was also - there was another factor in all of this, which was money. Nobody had any cash. You couldn't afford to have two cars or two lives or two flats or two houses. You stayed together because it's cheaper to run a family, right? It's cheaper to run one family under one roof than it is to run two.

He sounds like he has flipped.
I wonder about what art is going to look like after this period. Because you've been in New York, which has been so affected by the pandemic, do you think that's going to make its way into your music in the future?
MATTHEW: ...than we think it is?
MOORE: Yeah. And instead, what's so odd from a morality point of view is that they found it acceptable that I had lived with this doctor, never married him. And then the relationship broke up. And I went off to start my new life. So I don't know. Morality, I guess, is a very personal thing.
RICHEN: Yeah, there is in some cases. One of the most exciting cases is the Gaston Motel where the National Historic Trust made the Gaston - designated the Gaston a historical landmark and is in the process of renovating or will begin renovating the motel for reuse. So that's a really big effort that was helped by the fact that it was - that President Obama named it a historical landmark. In places like Idlewild, there is definitely an effort to get African-Americans - and not just African-Americans but people to buy land there, to renovate, to hold on to that history. It's more of, you know, a - unofficial effort. But that - those efforts still are going on.
At least one source and one method have already been compromised: Press reports revealed that Cambridge professor Stefan Halper met with three Trump campaign aides in 2016 as a confidential informant for the FBI. Investigators wanted to know about the overtures that people on Trump's campaign were receiving from Russian agents.
KUHN: It is our party and republic's unchanging position and my unwavering will, he said, to establish a new relationship between the DPRK and the U.S. that meets the demands of the new century and to establish a permanent, stable peace regime on the Korean peninsula and move towards complete denuclearization. By DPRK, he meant the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is its formal name.

Fifty years ago Monday, when Fred Rogers showed up on national public television as the host of what then was a brand new children's show called Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, TV was a lot different. PBS wasn't even a network then — not by that name, anyway — and aside from CBS, NBC and ABC, there were only a few independent local channels to watch, if that.
On the y-axis, we've got time. The whole cartoon, which starts at the end of the last ice age, represents about 22,000 years. People have been around for about 200,000 years. The dinosaurs were around about 65 million years ago. And Earth is 4.5 billion years old. So the graph is only a teeny-tiny period of Earth's lifetime.
As the first person to circumnavigate the continent and the explorer who popularised its name, Flinders is a figure of national importance in Australia, where a mountain range, two national parks, a university in Adelaide and one of the main streets of Melbourne, among many other things, are named after him.

But neither does he spare Mueller, a former FBI director whom he served and who produced a report of 448 pages and 2,375 footnotes but failed to provide a salient summary in terms people could understand.

Trump had been particularly focused on Pence's role, publicly ratcheting up pressure on his vice president in recent days — including as he addressed supporters on Wednesday — to back his efforts to reverse the 2020 election results. Pence, though, said Wednesday that he did not have the power to change the outcome of the election or to unilaterally delay the certification of Biden's victory.

The new cases bring the total number of confirmed cases within the United States to more than 60; 44 of those cases originated aboard the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship and three other cases involve people who were brought back from Wuhan, China, where the first cases were diagnosed. Excluding those who were aboard the cruise ship or brought back from China, Trump said 22 patients within the U.S. have the coronavirus, four of whom are very ill. Another 15 are either fully recovered or are well on their way, according to the president.
The matter of masks is also tied up with the willingness of citizens to heed advice from the government.

So far, two people at the facility — one health worker and one resident — have tested positive. More than 50 workers and residents are showing symptoms of respiratory infection. Some are being hospitalized, and all are currently being tested. None of the new presumptive cases were related to travel, which health officials say could be an indication of the virus spreading within the community.

Now out on DVD, Blu-Ray and iTunes streaming in a gorgeous new restauration from Criterion, Sembene's debut feels as timely today as it did half a century ago. Black Girl centers on Diouana, a young illiterate Senegalese woman, played by the lovely Mbissine Therese Diop, who has worked for a French colonial couple in the capital city of Dakar. She's thrilled when they ask her to move with them to the Riviera. Filled with fantasies of her new life, she dons high heels and her best dress. She's going to be French. Diouana soon discovers the chasm separating her dreams and reality. Not only do her bosses live in a high-rise apartment instead of the villa they'd enjoyed in Africa, but the France she now inhabits is the space in which she cooks and cleans, an imprisoning kitchen, bath and living room that offer teasing glimpses out the window of the sea.
So much for the 'crystal clear' water President Trump promised. You don't make America great by polluting our drinking water supplies, making our beaches unfit for swimming, and increasing flood risk, McCarthy said in a statement.
Guillén agrees that there are missed opportunities for Latino players to take up leadership roles because they cannot be outspoken about what they feel and think. That, he says, is a reason some great Latino players never become managers or join a team's leadership ranks. Guillén says learning English and acclimating to U.S. culture is most important for young players in the minors who have less money and support, both on and off the field. During the 2016 Minor League Baseball season, Latinos accounted for more than 41 percent of the players.

ASKARIPOUR: Yeah. Well, you begin to see the humor transmogrifying into horror - right? - from page to page where the example that you just cited, Scott, it's funny in the beginning, but then by the end, you begin to question, does this actually happen?

The debate breaks down into three broad threads. One is that the briefings have become less newsworthy over time. While the briefings do in part provide important updates from officials as the nation attempts to conquer a raging pandemic, they can be meandering and contradictory, and the president has at times also used them to spread falsehoods and air personal grievances. KUOW, in making its announcement, cited a pattern of false or misleading information provided that cannot be fact checked in real time as its reason for discontinuing the live broadcasts. (It also said the decision was not politically based and that it would revisit this decision daily.)

So that when Benedict was elected, a matter of just months after his election, in effect, the hammer came down. Father Marcial was taken out of priestly ministry and was instructed by the new pope to go live a life of prayer and penance. This is widely taken to be a finding of guilt. And, essentially, the conclusion that Catholic insiders drew from that episode is that even someone as prominent and well connected as Father Marcial - if even that guy is not safe under the new pope, then no one is. I mean, in other words, the conclusion was there's a new sheriff in town.

Still, the outcomes may have been equally discouraging for challengers in both parties. Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders, winners in Wisconsin and in a handful of caucus states that lent them momentum in the weeks since mid-March, stumbled badly in the Empire State.

And he spoke very highly of you. He said that as a federal prosecutor, before you became U.S. attorney, if there were 100 people in the office, you were one of the very best in the courtroom. He is critical of you now says that if he had a chance to talk with you now, he'd ask why you're doing this. He would say, what's going to be the first paragraph of your obituary that you've taken an excellent career and made yourself a joke.
JONES: I'm going to go with the A because that sounds more narcissistic.
In November, the bureau's director, Steven Dillingham, announced that the agency had discovered processing anomalies that have occurred in past censuses. Records collected about college students, many of whom were displaced from dormitories around Census Day because of the pandemic, have been particularly troublesome for the bureau in recent months.

These are issue-by-issue determinations that must be made, and they require process evaluation, legal evaluation, resource consideration and timeliness, said Jennings. In other words, some policies will take more time and personnel resources than others. And health policies will have to compete for White House attention with policies the new administration will want to change on anything from the environment to immigration to education.
All told, the number of confirmed cases in the U.S. is well over 300 — 19 of whom have died, mostly in Washington state.

We keep to ourselves, says Nguyen Kien Trung, 32, who was born in Vietnam and now lives in Bratislava. We don't talk about our businesses. We don't talk about ourselves, our traditions.
And the arrangement is really Vic's. I mean, he wrote the melody lines. He wrote, you know, where the big chords enter, and really, I think it's just the fact that the group that backs Vic up, everyone's playing kind of diff- instruments in different ranges, and when you combine them all together, it just becomes a mountain, you know.
The best cell phone plans aren't necessarily the most expensive. In fact, some of the best plans are very affordable, which is great news for everyone.

It's life and death, frankly, Trump said. It's a matter of life and death.
LIASSON: That is the big question. Up until now, really only Mike Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg have been willing to go after Sanders. For the most part, the center-left candidates have been in a circular firing squad attacking Mike Bloomberg. Will that change now? There are already attack ads. Pete Buttigieg has one in South Carolina running against Bernie Sanders.

Republic Wireless is one of the best prepaid carriers right now. Republic Wireless has been improving its Hybrid calling system. All phone calls made from a Republic Wireless cell phone are automatically routed over Wi-Fi first, in case no Wi-Fi network is available, it is going to default cellular service which leads to lower bills, and Republic Wireless plans are clearly affordable.
Despite this host of problems, the Copenhagen interpretation was overwhelmingly dominant within the physics community for much of the 20th century, because it allowed physicists to perform accurate calculations without worrying about the thorny questions at the heart of the theory. But over the past 30 years, support for the Copenhagen interpretation has eroded. Many physicists still voice support for it — surveys suggest that a plurality or majority of physicists subscribe to it — but there are live alternatives that now have significant support.
Combs says he is not conservative — he has conservative values, but he describes himself as a libertarian, an independent thinker, and he is also gay.
MOORE: My mother and father were very much the couple that Grant Tinker and I became. They say that you do follow the patterns that you grow up in, and this was certainly true in my case - WASP, repressed, unable to deal with things that are uncomfortable, pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, not discussing anything that's ugly or unpleasant and just muddling through.
And then, of course, there's the danger, the potential threat of violence that met African-Americans. There were places called sundown towns that are all over the country, mostly in the North and the West. And these were places that African-Americans had to leave before the sun went down. Sometimes there were signs. Sometimes they rang a bell so the workers who worked, the black workers who worked there, knew they had to get out of the town. And these were all over the country.
(For another take on this theme read physicist Clifford Johnson's excellent essay here.)
On Wednesday, House Republicans mentioned some of those same conspiracy theories in objecting during the Electoral College vote-counting process. And less than two hours later, windows were shattered, at least one person was fatally shot and the entire Capitol building was overrun.
The team's current owners have said they're still haunted by Yawkey's legacy, and they asked for the street to be renamed to distance themselves from the team's checkered past.
The legal battle is expected to make its way to the Supreme Court this year. Whether the question stays or goes has to be finalized by June, the Census Bureau says, so that printing the paper questionnaires can be completed without disrupting the tight deadlines leading up to 2020.
CHAZELLE: (Laughter) More often than not, I feel like I'm Ryan. You know, I'm Sebastian sitting there somewhat uncomfortably, taking it all in, listening to John. And yet understanding that in a certain very fundamental way, John is right. I sort of jokingly think of that scene as, like, it's like, you know, the two angels on my shoulder (laughter) kind of arguing about what it means to, you know, not just be a Jazz musician.

President Trump and his legal team have targeted several states, including Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, in their attempts to overturn the election. But their legal efforts all failed because they couldn't provide clear evidence of fraud or misconduct in the 2020 election.
NPR's Kelsey Snell contributed to this report.
GROSS: Do you think your emotional character changed after you stopped drinking?
Because Bloomberg suddenly enters this race and appears to be competitive in it, I really don't think that Biden can win South Carolina and suddenly win the nomination, Bitecofer said. I think the party faces a real problem ... It's quite possible that Sanders will become the nominee because the moderate flank is divided between two candidates.
SAGAL: Bill, how did Amy do on our quiz?
GARCETTI: Great pleasure to be with you - thanks, Lulu.
The Price Tag Hasn't Always Existed, It Had To Be Invented
Hours later, in that late-night tweet, the president backed down. Tensions eased. Some read that as a sign the stalled negotiations over homeland security (read: the president's desire for $5 billion in funding to build a wall or barrier on the border with Mexico) might be revived. By the end of Thursday, the Senate leaders of the two parties were talking to each other again.
Gore was annoyed, and Happer lost his job.
Likewise, some of the more progressive economic policies — universal health care and a job guarantee, for example — while popular among some Democrats, would also be very difficult to implement and transition into.
The company in November said it had exhausted its revolving credit lines. And the ratings agencies, Moody's Investor Service and S&P, have downgraded the company's credit rating to near junk status.

Every registered voter has the same ballot in the primary. It has all the candidates in all the primaries on every ballot, said Kim Alexander, who heads the California Voter Foundation.
SHAPIRO: Back in 1989, there was another big issue with virtual reality, the cost. The whole rig - headset, computer - it ran a whopping $250,000. Jaron Lanier's venture into the business of virtual reality did not take off. His company filed for bankruptcy the following year in 1990. But Lanier has continued pushing the bounds of science and technology, and in 2010 Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Calls to the U.S. Department of Justice asking for more information about the rescheduling went unreturned, and emails to department press officers returned auto replies saying they were furloughed.
The plan would require a 32 percent cut in carbon emissions from power plants by 2030, although individual states have their own targets which in some cases are much stricter. Twenty-four states have sued the Environmental Protection Agency over the rule, arguing that it would hurt their economies and make power more expensive for consumers.
In addition, funding for the National Institutes of Health would fall by 18 percent, or $5.8 billion. That cut involves a major reorganization of NIH's Institutes and Centers, including closing some of those centers, to help focus resources on the highest priority research.

Herrera Beutler has easily held the 3rd congressional district since 2010, but faced a noteworthy challenge from Democrat Carolyn Long's inaugural campaign in 2018. Long, a teacher and political scientist, already has significant fundraising to make a 2020 rematch even more competitive. -- Ryan Haas, Oregon Public Broadcasting News Editor
I was not comfortable with Democrats having 100% control of the policymaking direction of this nation, he said. However, as someone who is not a fan of Trump, he found both candidates objectionable given how they tied their campaigns so closely to the president.

SAGAL: Yes, your confession, very good.
But the NIH has become aware of numerous ethical breaches related to the Chinese plan, Lauer says. Some researchers have submitted identical grant applications to both the NIH and Thousand Talents. Others have shared confidential grant applications from other researchers with their collaborators in China. And then there is the question of money: Researchers are failing to disclose the funding they receive from China to U.S. agencies like the NIH, as required by law.

YOUNG: Well, I see him as an individual that, very frankly, would make me a lot happier if he didn't tweet or Twitter or whatever you call that. I don't do that, by the way. So, you know, I don't know. I think, very frankly, he's doing a great job. He was not my candidate. He knows that. But he's my president. I'm not going to try to crucify him for every little thing he says.
Metro's 2016 study showed people aware of the campaigns were twice as likely to report harassment, and Metro is urging those who experience or witness harassment to report it, too.
What are they going to be able to repeal without 60 votes? says Robert L. Laszewski, president of Health Policy and Strategy Associates. The 60-vote rule suddenly works to their disadvantage.
MATEO ASKARIPOUR: (Reading) He says, believe it or not, when you come here and order something, you're not ordering a drink. You're ordering a solution, a solution to fatigue, irritability and anything else that a lack of coffee means to you. So if you'll indulge me, I'm confident that the Nitro Cold Brew with sweet cream is what you actually want. It has 10 grams less sugar than your regular, 40 fewer calories and 140 milligrams more caffeine. But at the end of the day, those are just numbers. So if you buy the Nitro Cold Brew and don't like it, you can come back, and I'll give you your regular free of charge. What do you think? Silence. I just stared back into his eyes until he said, did you just try to reverse close me?

Ultimately, officials are watching for the peak of the curve, when coronavirus cases and deaths begin steadily decreasing day after day. But even that can be elusive if people change their behavior.
SCICLUNA: I wouldn't say defrocked. He should not be in ministry. And that is something that people need to know. He will not be in parishes. He will not be around with kids.
It would depend on how soon we can control the virus.
But 14 years later, Tim still does not have diabetes. And he doesn't take any medicine to keep his blood sugar down. Instead, he has been able to make small changes to his eating habits and exercise to keep diabetes at bay. He isn't alone — a large national study conducted at 27 sites around the country, including Massachusetts General Hospital, found that small lifestyle changes are far more successful at warding off diabetes than a drug.
Still, he said, I fight constantly the urge to celebrate incremental progress because it's incremental, but the challenges we face to expand range from the finding of grant money to holding onto people. All of that has the impact that it does on our ability to grow quickly.

SEBRELL: It's very small, has one stop light, three or four restaurants.
There were these really extreme ideologies that I was trying to reconcile with, and there didn't seem to be a balance that I was able to adopt. ... There weren't role models that had adopted this East/West ideologies into one, and I was constantly being told that the Western world was a sinful world ... but obviously I was a Westerner.
The history of this is to turn what are essentially political problems over to the police to manage, whether it's mass homelessness or deep political divisions in our society or longstanding racial inequalities. The police are not capable of doing that. And to the extent that they attempt to do so, they often make those problems worse.
Yet many people have missed the warnings.

We could be criticized for not addressing, in my opinion, the policy of skill training for those who have lost their jobs to automation, and the majority of job losses have been as a result of automation, said Hills. But if you're someone who lost their job — whether it's a miner in West Virginia or on the floor of a Ford factory — you don't really care if it's automation or international competition.
And that drew a huge backlash from the right - accusations of supporting infanticide, which he roundly denied. And here, you know, just in the wake of that big controversy that really got national attention, this photo emerges, and now we're seeing calls, again, from both sides of the aisle for Northam to resign because of this.
District Judge Vanessa Baraitser — who gave Assange a court victory earlier this week by rejecting the U.S. extradition request — ruled that Assange must be held in custody while the U.S. government appeals, saying he poses a flight risk.
Andy stays busy as a father of two young children and a transaction lawyer in St. Louis, while his father, a retired public school principal, has a new cat and occasionally visits his 95-year-old mother in Indianapolis. Scott says although he and his son are dealing with the constant trickle of grief over the loss of Debbie, it's made them both realize that things are hard for everyone right now.
It seems we're returning to the bad old days of the Cold War when we used aid as a glorified payoff for [political] friends and allies, says Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and former U.S. foreign disaster assistance chief under the Obama administration.

CONAN: Well, just continuing along the lines of the question, just the case of Father Marcial, the cases we've heard about - North America and Europe, for the most part - are people concerned that there may be other shoes ready to drop in South America, in Asia, in Africa?
Half of the offered leases drew no bids at all.

That was way back in 1803, four years after the law was enacted.
Eventually the Heges sold their house in a short sale for $149,000 — about half of what they still owed to the bank. (In a typical short sale, the bank agrees to accept less than what is owed and release the remainder of the debt. In many cases, lenders prefer short sales over foreclosures.)
MCEVERS: He also called for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the U.S. Despite those remarks or perhaps because of them, Trump's support grew and grew.
Given the strong numbers Biden put up with African American voters and white, non-college men in Michigan — much stronger than Hillary Clinton four years ago — he would perhaps not need Sanders' movement to overcome the small margins Trump won by in the Midwest.
FLATOW: Well, let's go to our own universe, and a question right here in the front row, yeah.
Folks waited for months without getting any relief at all, and when we saw relief in the spring, too often it centered on large corporate businesses while small businesses were at the back of the line, he told NPR's King. Some people need immediate relief. And we've got to get this virus under control. We've got to get the vaccine safely and efficiently distributed, so that we can safely reopen our economy, get our businesses roaring again, get our children back into school, but in a way that's sustainable.

Keeping up with the pace of activity is exhausting, to be honest, says Melissa Hanham, a North Korea analyst at the East Asia Nonproliferation Program of the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif.
Yes, you have an ethical obligation to intervene, counters Ann Powers. One gradual change you could make is to look at who gets to be in your critics' circle. Do you have room for deejays who aren't necessarily considered critics? Do you have room for educators? For a certain kind of player? Why wouldn't a musician be as much of an expert about music as a critic? These are some of the hard questions we need to ask ourselves to challenge our ideas of what expertise is.
Erika Pohlman, 29, began Googling furiously the moment she found out she was pregnant.
INSKEEP: He was speaking just before Congress began its formality of counting the electoral votes. Many Republicans were honoring that democratic process. In November, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell had supported the president's baseless lawsuits. But yesterday, McConnell said the challenges have failed.
The collaborative nature of being agile means that people need to be close to each other, they need to be in the same room. Because we're making many rapid changes in sequence, we have to be able to communicate those changes quickly, he says.
There's a big philosophical split to consider, too. University of Denver political scientist Seth Masket said a lot depends on how you view the main function of a primary.
NPR's Scott Simon talks to Evan McMullin, an independent presidential candidate in the 2016 campaign, about the place for centrist politics in the U.S. political landscape.
Instead, they'll likely rely on hearings and turn to the courts to try to influence health policy and shore up the ACA.
LIASSON: It's totally ceremonial. It shouldn't have become an important moment. But because the president refused to accept the results of the election and continued to press this false narrative that somehow or other, there were hundreds and hundreds of thousands of fraudulent votes cast, he encouraged his supporters in Congress to challenge the election to see if they could overturn it. They know they couldn't. It was kind of a freebie for the Republicans who were challenging it because they - in the end, they wouldn't be undermining the will of the voters.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: But over the years, they watched as funding and respect for the profession eroded.
McDonald's says since 2013, the company has tracked a 14 percent increase in the number of Happy Meals ordered with milk, juice or water. According to the company, for the first time, more than half of Happy Meals ordered in the U.S. have included water, milk or juice as their beverage of choice.

Maduro has dismissed the National Assembly as a group of little boys masterminded by Washington imperialists and the far right, NPR has reported. Venezuela's Supreme Court, packed with Maduro loyalists, has declared Guaidó and the congressional leadership illegitimate. Security forces also briefly detained the opposition leader last week.
Most people are used to prices that don't change. You go into a store to buy some Quaker Oats, and they're going to cost the same for you as they will for whoever tries to buy them next.

I think within Europe at the moment it's the place to be, Pullen says. Look at the amount of investment that's been raised over the last year, which has hit record levels. Look at the level of confidence for startups in France at the moment. I think what you see is a real wave of positivity, of optimism.
Putting humans or consciousness traveling back in time aside for the moment, is there anything in science even remotely similar? Surprisingly, yes. At the level of quantum particles (we are talking individual photons, elementary particles or individual atoms), there is something called Wheeler's delayed-choice experiments that show that actions in the present can influence the past.
I want our avocado varieties to be in season for more than one week, Arpaia says, adding that she'd like different times of the year to be associated with certain varieties of avocados. I want it where you can say it's July — it's time to pick this variety.
JOHN: And I know how it's going to be twisted - OK? - by the media - that he's responsible for what happened, that he provoked it, that he was encouraging violence. The fact of the matter is the president never encouraged violence. We came here on our own accord at his invitation to support him.
As it turns out, the study found lifestyle changes to be twice as affective as the medicine.
Not particularly. I wasn't aware of it until maybe 2003/2004. The alarm's bell for me came up recently, maybe a year or so ago when a team of researchers in Switzerland failed to replicate it. And then the original authors summarized the entire body of work that had looked at this and me and some co-authors, we have a tool – have a physical tool – that will also tell you if a body of work has what you call, evidential value.

In lieu of government action, it may be best to avoid other people as much as possible, Gaunt says.
Mr. GREENE: Well, there are a number of pathways that lead to this idea, and one is this notion of unifying all the forces. So string theory is an approach that naturally does unify all the forces, but what comes along with that unification is this super-symmetric quality.

Even the simplest possible things become difficult to decipher in quantum physics. Say you want to describe the position of a single tiny object — the location of just one electron, the simplest subatomic particle we know of. There are three dimensions, so you might expect that you need three numbers to describe the electron's location. This is certainly true in everyday life: If you want to know where I am, you need to know my latitude, my longitude, and how high above the ground I am. But in quantum physics, it turns out three numbers isn't enough. Instead, you need an infinity of numbers, scattered across all of space, just to describe the position of a single electron.
JAMES: Yeah, 6' 8? Yeah, I'll take that.
Well, first of all what I would say is take a look at the appointments I've made since I've been president of the United States. I've appointed as many African-Americans to the Circuit Court as any president ever; more African-American women on the federal courts than any other president; more Hispanics, more Asian-Americans, more LGBT judges than any president in history.

In fact, one of the leaders of this organization called BRICK, which was kind of the bottom-up group of district teachers who were trying to reform schools just by improving the teaching force - he said that he got so many queries from this group of people that he started calling them the school failure industry, which was, you know, just people who showed up when you had failing schools that were the target of, you know, the education reformers or some of the federal grants that were available for failing schools. There was money in failing schools. And he said there was a school failure industry that was trying to compete for it.

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. My guest is the winner of this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction, Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel, The Sympathizer, is set during and just after the war in Vietnam and is told in the form of a forced confession written by a spy for the North Vietnamese who worked undercover as an aid to a South Vietnamese general. It appears that part of his crime is sympathizing with the suffering on both sides. That sympathy is in part a function of his own divided self. The character's mother grew up in the north of Vietnam.
This moment in our history — a time when judicial nominations have become so contentious, a time when our politics is so full of vitriol — I think particularly benefits from a man who by all accounts is decent, full of integrity, is someone who tries to hear the other side's point of view, and can build bridges.

He tells me that in this case, the back pressure overwhelmed the well's safety systems. This allowed crude oil and natural gas trapped thousands of feet down to rocket toward the surface.
In this runoff, he said he knew he would be proud to have Warnock represent him in the Senate and felt that he understood Warnock's vision. I understood what mattered to him, what he was actually running on, Stowers said. That was always clear to me. He wasn't running to be, you know, an ally of anybody. He was running to be a senator from Georgia.
Patients are also concerned about the system's capacity. Monika Lakomy-Diep, an accountant in London, struggled last week to get a doctor to treat her daughter's allergies.
But over the past few months, the experts have pretty much stopped laughing. That's because North Korea has undertaken an unusual number of tests in the first quarter of 2016, everything from detonating a nuclear bomb underground to launching a satellite on a rocket that could be converted to a ballistic missile.
Mckesson has about as many Twitter followers — more than 300,000 — as there are registered voters in Baltimore, and he sneaks peeks at his phone throughout our interview. It's a following built since August 2014, when he heard about the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

And now it's back. Again. For six episodes, this time, with the possibility that all involved — Duchovny, Anderson, and series creator Carter — may want to keep reuniting down the road for more limited-run short bursts of shows, just like the cast and crew of Sherlock.
SAGAL: All right, here we go. Here's your first question. Now, one of the most notorious ice sculptures ever seen was the one commissioned by Dennis Kozlowski, the CEO who served eight years in prison for fraud and embezzlement because he spent company money on things like which of these - A, an ice sculpture of himself, which he kept in a $300,000 clear glass freezer for display; B, a full-scale ice sculpture of Michelangelo's David, which dispensed cold water to party guests through, well, his natural spigot; or, C, a thousand tiny handmade ice sculptures of individual bird species made for his evening cocktail?

Maduro blames the country's growing crisis on foreign economic sanctions, claiming that the U.S. is leading an effort to wipe out socialism in Venezuela, according to Reuters. Presidential elections are set to be held by April 30, which is much earlier than usual, but Venezuela's pro-government Supreme Court last week banned the main opposition party from running.

Over and over in the news and on social media, people imagined how different — and likely more deadly — the police response would have been if those people lined up outside the barriers had been Black or brown. And that alternate scenario is raising complicated questions about what role the police can, and should, play in response to protests, riots and mobs.
I was invited. Actually, it was a speaking engagement for the Washington Speakers Bureau. I was invited there to speak to all the former prime ministers of Ukraine. It was a very, it was a gathering. And then I was invited to tour the country and to do meetings with local officials, to talk, to give them my experience in how to govern. It was more about local government, about mayors, about how to run cities, which usually I talk about more than president since I never obtained that office. But in this case, I got to speak to all the prime ministers. I became very friendly with a few people. Became very friendly with Viktor Yushchenko, who was the first person who won after the revolution and was the hope of Ukraine and a man who was almost killed by Putin. He was poisoned and almost killed. Tragedy. And I think, you know, you can't — I think had Viktor been healthy, he would have turned the country around. And then I was — I became very friendly with Vitali Klitschko through John McCain. John was a good friend of his. A lot of the information I originally got about Ukraine I got from John because John was a very big expert on Ukraine. We hadn't run against each other yet, although we remained close friends even after I ran against him. John briefed me — I remember a particular dinner I had with John late on a Friday afternoon.
I was one of the few that was really close to the situation, Ebeling recalls. Had they listened to me and wait[ed] for a weather change, it might have been a completely different outcome.

In 2016, 20 percent of prescriptions for brand-name drugs used a drug copay assistance coupon, according to an analysis by researchers at the USC Schaeffer Center for Health Policy and Economics. Among the top 200 drugs (based on spending) in 2014, the study found that 132 were brand-name drugs, and 90 of them offered copay coupons.
Dillingham said that the report was a mechanism to assess the bureau's progress in fulfilling an executive order Trump issued in 2019 after the Supreme Court blocked the administration's effort to add a citizenship question to census forms. That order calls for the bureau to use government records on citizenship from other federal agencies and some states to produce data on the number of citizens, non-citizens, and illegal aliens in the U.S.
The outcome of the poll has a direct impact on individual musicians' careers and, ultimately, the formation of new musical canons, a point at which women may face erasure. So without a majority of votes to determine a winner, should the poll results carry the weight of a unified critical ruling? It's as close as we can come, says Davis, citing the difficulties that stem from an abundance of releases and competing stylistic branches of the jazz tradition, not to mention a group of voters one might characterize as stubbornly individualistic.

For several decades, there had been sex abuse allegations lodged against him. One case filed under church law came from a handful of ex-members. And it went to then-Cardinal Ratzinger's office at the Vatican in the mid-'90s, where, essentially, the Vatican set on the allegation until 2001. After 2001, with this change I've described in Cardinal Ratzinger's attitude to this issue, they re-launched the investigation against Father Marcial. Even so, it was widely believed that nothing would happen to him, because Father Marcial was protected at the most senior levels of the church, all the way up to and including Pope John Paul II.
Many other Slovaks felt that way, too, said Ján Orlovský, who heads the Open Society Foundations in Slovakia. It's like, you know, the little pot with the lid. So the pressure builds up and then something unexpected comes out.

None of those elections will be able to be audited.

Political watchers are focused further down the ballot, on statehouse seats. Democrats need just nine more seats to win control of the Texas House for the first time since 2001, giving them a seat at the table for the once-a-decade redrawing of the state's political maps. Their pathway may lead through the North Texas region, home to nearly half of the districts Democrats are targeting.

KODJAK: Yeah, well, we have Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Elizabeth Warren who both also co-sponsored Senator Sanders' bill, so the - that Democratic crowd is pretty much all in.

Howard Schultz, the former CEO of Starbucks - he called this program not American because it would eliminate the health insurance industry. Mike Bloomberg - he says a Medicare-for-all plan would, quote, bankrupt us.

Just after being elected, he said that that was a red line for him, chemical weapons use, and that he would take measures if Assad crossed that red line. And in fact, Scott, he said this in public standing next to Vladimir Putin who was visiting France last May. Macron's actually been working to keep Putin in the loop. Putin has been increasingly isolated. Macron's been talking to him through this crisis. And analysts say Putin doesn't really want to risk ruining the friendship - a tense friendship - that he has with Macron.
Exactly what I like to be.
LANDAU: Well, yeah. James Mason and I played the two spies - very, very lean and very kind of stark looking. And it was a period where, you know, plays like Picnic were being done on Broadway, and movie actors look more like Rock Hudson and Guy Madis and Tab Hunter. And I was, you know, intrinsically a character actor but not easy to cast because of a very, you know - it was a different time. I mean there were no - you know, Al Pacino and Dustin Hoffman and Bobby De Niro would also have had a great deal of problem in those days because they would have been considered offbeat. But times change. And I wound up playing many, many bad guys in movies as a result of my looks.
The 12th Amendment tried to sort things out in 1804, but the Electoral College system soon got into trouble again, first in the disputed election of 1824 (when no one had a majority in the Electoral College) and again in the years before and after the Civil War.

NPR's Interim News Chief Looks Ahead At 2018
I'm very optimistic. It will take time. The easiest part's going to be restoring the morale and the operations of the Department of Justice because the culture is solid. The hard part is going to be reaching those Americans, the tens of millions, literally, who are trapped in a fog of lies about the virus, about our institutions, including about the FBI and the Justice Department. It'll take time to win that back, to coax those people back to reality. But it'll happen. The work will prove itself.

Recently we heard from an adviser in the Trump administration. Michael Anton's official title is deputy assistant to the president for strategic communications at the National Security Council. He says he's been so consumed by the day-to-day, he's had little chance to focus on the long term — despite that he came to prominence as a man who was trying to think long term. In 2016, while working at an investment firm, Anton anonymously published essays that sought to make sense of the Trump phenomenon. The most famous was The Flight 93 Election. Anton compared Trump voters to passengers on the plane hijacked on Sept. 11, 2001, who were choosing to rush the cockpit. They might still die but it was their only hope.

People around the world watched in shock on Wednesday as thousands of Trump supporters stormed the Capitol building, descending on the halls of Congress and postponing the vote that would make Joe Biden's election official. And while there was much to take in — windows shattered, Trump flags waving, a man with his boots up on Nancy Pelosi's desk — many were particularly struck by what they saw from police at the scene. The police force seemed quickly overwhelmed and unable to secure the Capitol. In some cases, officers were even criticized for appearing sympathetic to the will of the crowd.

To some degree, this reflects what the nation was hearing in February and early March from the president. Initially, he cast it as China's problem and added the Chinese were handling it well. As recently as Feb. 28, he was telling a rally crowd in South Carolina that the media were over-dramatizing the danger, calling that treatment the latest liberal media hoax. (The next day, he explained that he had not meant to call the virus itself a hoax.)
BRUMFIEL: Those inspectors would probably be let in in exchange for some kind of sanctions relief and, perhaps, a peace declaration between North Korea and the U.S., which have remained formally at war since an armistice in 1953.

So there's this little dispute going on between the U.S. and South Korea. How does that affect this conversation?

Those second-tier diseases include measles and dengue, which did gangbusters in the tropics. Cholera raged in Yemen. Polio clawed its way back from the brink of defeat. In Pakistan, polio cases were up more than tenfold from a low of just nine in 2018. In a cruel unintended consequence of the polio eradication effort, a dozen countries that had been polio free (including China, Angola and the Philippines) reported cases of vaccine-derived polio in 2019. Venezuela reported its first yellow fever case in more than a decade as that country's health care system continues its downward spiral. Despite efforts to rein it in, a few cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome are reported each month in the Middle East, and that will probably continue in the coming year.

McConnell maintains that he based his plan on the rules for the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999, with each side getting 24 hours. In a last-minute change, McConnell called for the 24 hours to be divided over three days, rather than two as he originally proposed. That would address one Democratic complaint — that a two-day limit would force the session to last long into the night, since the trial days do not start until 1 p.m. ET.

BETTE: I was one of several of his victims. And during the time that it was happening, there were several parents who tried to bring attention to what they thought was bad behavior on this priest's part. And the bishop, you know, ignored the problem, transferred him, and did all the things that they do. But I believe that the bishops do need to be held accountable, because when I brought my case forward, when I made my accusations, the bishop and the lawyers denied everything. They said that I was making things up, I had false memories, et cetera, et cetera.

Christopher Turpin, who assumed interim leadership of NPR's newsroom in November (for the year in question he was the deputy leader), told me recently when we sat down to discuss priorities for the year ahead: I am very proud we've made some good high-level diverse hires, including at the deputy managing editor level and among those who lead the newsmagazines. He added: I think that we obviously have a huge amount of work to do, but I do think that within those numbers, even though those numbers have stayed fundamentally unchanged, there are some very positive signs. Obviously we're all committed to doing better.

Despite its historical status as the default answer to these quantum questions, the Copenhagen interpretation is inadequate. It says nothing about what's going on in the world of quantum physics. In its stubborn silence on the nature of reality, it offers no explanation of why quantum physics works at all, since it can point to no feature of the world that is anything like the mathematical structures at the heart of the theory. There's no compelling logical or philosophical grounds for declaring unobservable things meaningless. And the word unobservable isn't much better defined than the word measurement anyhow. So declaring unobservable things meaningless is not only a silly position, it's a vague one. That vagueness has plagued the Copenhagen interpretation from the start; today, the Copenhagen interpretation has become a collective label for several mutually contradictory ideas about quantum physics.
One vivid example of a discomfited vice president was provided by Al Gore, who held that office on Jan. 6, 2001, and had to read out his own Electoral College defeat (271-266). If the vote of any one of George W. Bush's 30 states had been reversed, Gore would have been the winner.

PERALTA: Mannzoor blames a lot of this tension on the complex history of Asians in East Africa. Many were brought during the colonial period by the British to build the railroad. The Asians stayed on and became economic drivers.

In Kenya, former President Arap Moi would malign Asians and accuse them of exploiting Africans. After a failed coup to oust him in 1982, Kenyans reacted violently.

Much of that spending was military-related, but Congress also appropriated nearly $138 billion since 2002 for Afghanistan's reconstruction. About a third of that was drained out by waste, fraud and abuse, according to the U.S. Office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which audits and investigates that spending.

One worry about this approach is that it could be demoralizing for scientists. Striving to be less wrong might be a less effective prod than the promise of being right. Another concern is that a strategy that works well within science could backfire when it comes to communicating science with the public. This is a topic I've written about before: Without an appreciation for how science works, it's easy to take uncertainty or disagreements as marks against science, when in fact they reflect some of the very features of science that make it our best approach to reaching reliable conclusions about the world. Science is reliable because it responds to evidence: As the quantity and quality of our evidence improves, our theories can and should change, too.
But the other piece of the puzzle is, of course, what about senior management that allowed this to happen? That is, what about bishops who just drop the ball? Who - and in some cases, who overtly try to cover this up rather than deal with the problem? There, I think, a lot of people would say that that is the big piece of unfinished business from this crisis. And it's not clear what new accountability measures the church might be able to adopt to give some teeth to the idea of accountability for bishops. And that, frankly, is what makes these revelations about the pope's track record both as archbishop in Munich from '77 to '82, and also as a Vatican official.

We'd also need to recognize that individual children vary, as do their communities.
At any rate, the final audition was being judged by Elia Kazan, you know, who directed Streetcar Named Desire and - on Broadway and in the movie and On the Waterfront and East Of Eden, and Cheryl Crawford, who was a famous Broadway producer and one of the co-founders of the group theater and Lee Strasberg. And you had to get three one votes from all of them - one, two or three. Three meant no. Two meant not bad; come back another time. And one meant you were in. And I guess in retrospect it was a bit daring, but Strasberg did - gave me a one vote as well.
Back in 2017, the day the Supreme Court announced it was taking up the first Masterpiece case, Phillips declined to bake another cake. The cake was requested to be pink on the inside and blue on the outside, celebrating a gender transition.
There's too much sensationalism, misinformation and polarization in the world today. Social media enables people to spread information faster than ever before, and if we don't specifically tackle these problems, then we end up amplifying them. That's why it's important that News Feed promotes high quality news that helps build a sense of common ground.
Dr. Robert Redfield, the CDC director, told NPR member station WABE in Atlanta that roughly 25% of coronavirus sufferers may be asymptomatic and continue to transmit the virus.

GROSS: But you also wanted to know who were your African ancestors.
RICHEN: Yes, there were. There were white-owned businesses. I don't know if they advertised. I didn't necessarily see any advertisements in terms of, like, pictures. I do remember seeing in one one Chinese-owned business that advertised in the book. I remember that. So there were some white-owned businesses and other races as well who owned businesses in the book.

MCAMMON: Well, as you're no doubt aware, there is video of Iraqi security forces letting militia members into the Green Zone to attack the U.S. Embassy last week. So clearly, they continue to have influence with the security forces. What does Soleimani's death actually change in terms of the situation on the ground?
The union is a symptom of a larger shift at Google, where the median pay is around $200,000. For years, employees were reluctant to publicly criticize the company.
For whatever reason, we're shying away from individual liberty, individual responsibility to this nanny-state, Big-Brother-esque forum or model of the Internet, which is really scary to me, Torba said in a recent conversation with a commentator on YouTube.

It was the dawn of the quants, when Wall Street was beginning to appreciate the power of computers to turbocharge trading. Mercer and Brown set to work designing complex mathematical models that made trading dramatically faster and their work eventually paid off.
But with the results of the 2020 NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll only days away from publication, it is an opportune moment in which to revisit — and question — claims of women's progress. Any of the optimistic assessments occasioned by this poll, and in the wake of jazz's #Me Too stirrings in recent years, are likely to be premature. Only when women's participation in the music has been clearly defined, documented and measured can we be certain of any improvement in their collective status — or lack thereof.
DIONNE: Well, I think the big question about the debate, as David suggested, is whether Cruz, who got hit very hard during that debate, was hurt by it because I think that Iowa really, really does matter to Ted Cruz. I think he needs to win here to go on. And he still has a decent shot because he has some of the most important evangelical organizations. And I was down near the Missouri border in a town Keosauqua City - a little city where you saw some supporters of the socially conservative candidates who were really lagging - Santorum and Huckabee and Ben Carson - coming behind Cruz, at least in that area, because they see him as the person closest to them who can beat Trump. If for some reason Trump actually wins this, I think it becomes much harder for Ted Cruz to return - to go on. I think, similarly, it is very important to Bernie Sanders to win here because his chances over the long-haul, I think, depend on having a one-two punch against Hillary Clinton - winning here and winning in New Hampshire. And the one advantage Hillary Clinton has at this point is, a couple of months ago, she was expected to sweep here. Now, it's much closer. You can argue that the Clinton people shouldn't have let it get away from them. But in letting it get away from them, they lowered the bar on what counts as victory.
People in their communities know their communities best, Ing said. We are all the expert of our own experiences, just kind of recognizing that and supporting that by not just bringing money into a state, but creating a way where people can come together cooperatively, build their own local coalitions and then we can support that.

Although these statistics may indicate some positive change in the representation of women, they paint a very different picture of that progress than an analysis of the top 10 or even top 50. They suggest that the majority of band leaders, both male and female, fail to hire women for their recording projects, though women hire other women musicians at a higher rate than men do (24% vs. 18% in 2017; 28% vs. 17% in 2018; and 42% vs. 24% in 2019).

Or so he thought. When he was fired last year, he believed he'd find something else quickly. But it's been over a year and he's been doing odd jobs to make ends meet. Brazil's economy is in the worst recession in generations. All the social programs started by the PT are being scaled back.

This, I believe, is the reason why so many scientists (with, of course, brave exceptions), many of them in the public media, condemn the humanities as useless — or seem not to understand why we should bother with them at all. As a consequence, many scientific ideas are presented as having conquered some of the deepest questions we have been asking for millennia, when they haven't. Point in case, the origin of the universe, something we can't truly address within the scientific framework as we know it, is often presented as solved and understood. God isn't needed. Case closed. Boom.

Research shows that health facilities with unions have better patient outcomes and are more likely to have inspections that can find and correct workplace hazards. One study found New York nursing homes with unionized workers had lower COVID-19 mortality rates, as well as better access to PPE and stronger infection control measures, than nonunion facilities.
Fauci also said that a more contagious variant of the virus first identified in the United Kingdom and now spreading in the U.S. underscores the need to follow public health measures such as wearing a mask and social distancing. And he said that while the U.K. has implemented a lockdown, he doesn't see any enthusiasm for similar nationwide measures in this country.

There are a host of NCAA membership benefits that male college wrestlers can receive that their female peers don't have access to, including health insurance, scholarships, grants and internship opportunities. The WCWA provides its members health information and recognizes athletes who achieve certain GPAs, but doesn't have the same financial assistance as the NCAA.

Trump has talked tough on China trade as well, but Bosworth notes he has not gone after individual companies — Apple, for example, and its huge iPhone assembly operations there.

Although LIGO was completed in 1999, it took more than a decade for it to see anything. The detectors had to be made incredibly sensitive to pick up the tiny waves.

And even after researchers got rid of all the terrestrial jiggles, LIGO still wasn't quite good enough to see gravitational waves.

And one of the places that African-American women were most vulnerable was on public transportation or on train stations because they could not - they didn't have access to the facilities and had to go in the open sometimes.

Investigators have not formally accused Jane Sanders of any wrongdoing, but at least one donor has publicly said that Sanders mischaracterized the financial gift she had promised to the college. Sanders allegedly claimed in loan documents that Corinne Bove Maietta, a member of a prominent Burlington family, promised a series of donations to the college, but Maietta has since said that the money was actually promised as a bequest, not recurring gifts.
MAJOR JANINE GARNER: (Reading) We have allowed to thrive and, in some instances, even encouraged a culture where women are devalued, demeaned and their contributions diminished. We understand why.

This week's challenge: This challenge comes from listener David Edelheit of Oyster Bay, N.Y. Think of a word meaning a particular body of water. Change one letter in it to get a new word meaning a particular body of land. What words are these?
Let's talk about how you create your images. Where do you even start?
MARTIN: Well, so I'm thinking about the fact that physicians are actually well-represented in the current administration and have been in Congress for some time. I'm thinking about President Trump's nominee for Health Secretary - Tom Price is a physician. Former Congressman Ron Paul was a physician. His son Rand Paul, the senator, was an ophthalmologist. All of them are conservatives, and I'm wondering why is that?
GENTRY: I don't think it is. I think this has been a very, very unique campaign cycle. We started with a lot of people in this process. And what we're seeing is a end of where we all need to come. We've got to get to the point where we have one person standing, and I do believe the party will unify behind one person.
The police blocked the roads with giant shipping containers, yet this failed to prevent thousands of men from reaching the city center, including the high-security red zone containing the key institutions of government.
Even as Border Patrol agents were arresting on average 800 illegal aliens a day, Duke wrote, we were still unable to stop the thousands of trucks filled with drugs and humans that quickly crossed a vanishing point and dispersed into communities all across the country.
Next week's challenge: This challenge comes from listener Sandy Weisz of Chicago, who runs The Mystery League, which conducts puzzle hunts.
It is made even more uncomfortable, Cornyn said Thursday, when the chamber's chairs are less than ergonomic.
This doesn't prove that the social signaling hypothesis is right, the authors cautiously acknowledge. Maybe trichomacy of our sort became fixed early on in catarrhine evolution, due to fitness benefits from improved foraging ability, and that subsequently the red-green color channel became co-opted for socio-sexual signaling.
GROSS: I guess the thought of things turning out badly, of it not being the script that you wanted, during the Vietnam era was pretty scary. I mean, you know, a war TV series during the Vietnam era that gave a kind of high jinks on the front message probably would have made you particularly uncomfortable.
Even the solutions that we have considered big and bold are nowhere near the scale of the actual problem that climate change presents to us to our country, to the world. And so while carbon taxes are nice while things like cap and trade are nice, it's not what's going to save the planet. It could be part of a larger solution but no one has actually scoped out what that larger solution would entail. And so that's really what we're trying to accomplish.
In both the screen and stage versions, Beale's rants touch a nerve with his television audience and his ratings spike. The network executives seize the opportunity to build an entertainment program around his newscast: The anchor becomes a celebrity, and infotainment is born. Keep in mind, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky predicted this more than 40 years ago, and it won him an Oscar.
That would bring some manufacturing production back to the U.S., said Gordon Hanson, who co-wrote that study on U.S. jobs moving to China. But that's not the same thing as manufacturing employment. The jobs that left were 20th century jobs. That is, they were jobs in factories that were built using older vintage technology that was more labor intensive than 21st century tech in which automation is more present.

Writer Created 'Fleabag' By Looking At What She Loved, Then Taking It Away
House Republican leaders had speculated last week that another venue on the Hill (like the GOP-controlled Senate chamber) might be found anytime the president of the United States wishes to speak. And surely that's true. And this week Trump received multiple offers from GOP governors who offered up their statehouses as alternative sites.
Sometimes he would target markets that he was looking for. Hey, we need more listings in Springfield, Miss., or what have you. So you know, it was a real early form of crowdsourcing. And of course, the distribution, he was able to partner with Esso gas station. And Esso distributed the Green Book in its gas stations.
In his dressing room before a recent matinee, Cranston said Chayefsky's prescience was frightening. One of the speeches, if you recall, was 'Only three percent of you people read books. Only 15 percent read newspapers. The numbers were likely never that bad — but according to the most recent study, roughly half of all Americans still prefer to watch the news on TV, with the Internet not far behind. Remember Howard Beale also says, 'Don't look to us for the truth, because we just tell you what you want to hear,' Cranston says.

ARABLOUEI: And you've been listening to THROUGHLINE from NPR.
His defense echoes comments Trump has previously made about accepting compromising information from foreign governments about political opponents.
The agency started sending groups of six to stay inside the dome for months at a time. Water is limited. When the volunteers want to see a website, they have to submit a request to retrieve the page — after 20 minutes. When they go outside, they have to put on spacesuits.
INSKEEP: We could have a long discussion here. But you mentioned fundraising. Hawley sent out a fundraising message on the day of the storming of the Capitol - shortly before, according to the Kansas City Star. But the question about censure - should the Senate be disciplining its own members for doing this sort of thing?
EDMONSON: I'm excited for them to be changing it, though - you know? - to keep my family safe.
Set the right goal, you said. And then there is the question of what went wrong that you would like to correct. I know the two top officials in Hubei province, the center of this outbreak, have been relieved of their duties. What went wrong?
So, look. I mean, whether he has done enough, I think, is a matter of fair debate, but I think what is inarguably is that he has at least done something, and by something I mean considerably more than any of his predecessors ever have on this issue.
I want to ask one other question along the lines of your sense of justice or vindication or whatever is right. I spoke some time ago with Jeffrey Harris, former federal prosecutor, who I believe was a close friend of yours for a long time.
Compounding advocates' concerns is the fact that these coverage changes are frequently not communicated clearly to patients, Schmid says. They are typically buried deep in the plan documents and don't appear in the user-friendly summary of benefits and coverage that consumers receive from their health plan.
GROSS: That's Linda Emond singing a song by John Kander and Fred Ebb. That's included in the new collection John Kander: Hidden Treasures, 1950-2015.
NOURSE: I didn't have any women to really go to in the Senate because there were two women senators. So I went to the ladies on the shelves, the ladies in the books. And then it became - the more I read, the more shocked and the feminists who were considered radical at the time didn't seem terribly radical to me.
IRWIN: Well, it's very interesting. Both parties have this division within them. Interestingly, public opinion polls suggest that Democrats support trade more than Republicans. But the Democratic candidates are speaking more to their union base in the party and opposing these trade agreements. Meanwhile, the Republicans traditionally have been, in recent decades, much more in favor of free trade. But the Republican base does not support trade as much. And now you see some candidates moving in that direction as well.
ANDREW LOPEZ: All the water started coming through the drains.
Several Republican senators have already said they oppose the bill, at least as of now. Senate leaders are aiming for a vote before July 4.
Dale Russakoff, welcome to FRESH AIR. Can you give us a sense of where you think the Newark story fits into the larger story about the education reform movement in America?
In the spring, frustration with Gov. Whitmer's stay-at-home orders manifested in the country's largest so-called gridlock protest in Lansing, followed by protests that rippled into the spring. Rallies became a place where extreme views and conspiracies could grow. Rally attendees who alleged Whitmer was a tyrant mingled with anti-vaxxers and heavily-armed protesters.
FLATOW: Why it kicked in at that point?
DINORA CHINCHILLA: All I see is sick, sick, sick, sick, sick and a lot of death.
Yahoo says at least 500 million accounts were hacked two years ago. The company revealed the data breach on Thursday, without saying whether it knew all along or just found out.
The criticism ignores some other relevant information, though.
As part of our recent conversation about the NPR newsroom's priorities ahead, Turpin talked about efforts in the newsroom to recover from the turmoil that followed the Nov. 1 ouster of newsroom leader Michael Oreskes amid charges of sexual harassment. These efforts include a re-evaluation of NPR's newsroom culture. For many in the newsroom, issues including harassment (of all kinds) and diversity are linked, and can't be looked at in isolation. These employees continue to look for significant changes in both areas, and I've heard some tentative appreciation of the steps taken so far to address broader cultural issues.
And this promise to build a wall or, really, do everything he can to build a wall has become the sun, moon and stars of his administration. It's really become the white whale. It's become the No. 1 priority. And he's gotten pretty sensitive about press coverage of how he's handling this issue. He tweeted that the fake news Washington Post said he didn't have a plan. But he says, I have a plan. But to understand the plan, you have to understand that I won the election.
On the process for amendments Tuesday, Democrats say they expect to offer several amendments. The rule would allow two hours of debate on each amendment with each side controlling one hour of debate. Democrats stress that they are not aiming to delay the trial; the amendments will be targeted at calling for witnesses and potentially changing the rules McConnell has proposed.
What followed, though, exceeded his and most people's expectations.
For me, the sooner the better. But it would depend on our efforts, whether we are working in the right direction, whether the methods, the tools we are using are effective, but we are doing our utmost. I have confidence in our scientists, in our doctors and the medical workers.
One, we have particle physicists looking the tiniest bits of our world with their science-fiction-like names. You have quarks and leptons and bosons and things like that that sound almost made up and sort of are sometimes.
These things are not happening because somebody at the company woke up and they decided they were feeling better about the workers, Gearhart says. They just want to make sure that they maintain the balance of power.

Everyone in Bratislava has seen at least one Asian in the city, she says. But if I compare it to Vienna, which is a short train ride away and a huge multicultural city, there's a big difference.
Individual musicians can be exceptional, but that can actually reinforce inequities, says NPR Music's critic Ann Powers, co-creator of Turning the Tables and a veteran of the Village Voice's Pazz and Jop polls during her tenure there as Music Editor. You need to have a woman not just at No. 1, but at No. 8, and No. 10 and No. 25. You need an equal distribution, otherwise the women at the top are forever an exception.
I think it is appropriate to expand the groups, bring more people into the eligible pools, said Robert Wachter, chair of the University of San Francisco, California Department of Medicine. When you hear people throwing out vaccine because they couldn't find anybody to give it to ... it's just a tragedy.
And they acquitted Johnson, they acquitted Clinton. Yeah.
The U.S. removed Cuba from its state sponsors of terrorism list in May 2015. President Barack Obama's administration had reached an agreement to restore relations with Cuba months earlier, including a plan to boost travel and trade between the two countries.
NAUGHTON: Well, our number-one criteria is that you have a scientific or technical background. At this point, we are only supporting Democratic candidates, and although we want to see more Republicans take action on mitigating the effects of climate change, currently the difference in the two party platforms made us feel we had to pick a team.

I'm an American citizen. I would not benefit from immigration reform, but I'm passionately in favor of it, not just because of the impact to the economy and the country in general, but because I do think that it's a respect issue. Why is Eduardo being treated - even though he's done everything correctly - why are we not taking advantage of the human capital that he represents to this country, and do it in a rational way so that he can be completely calm and relaxed and investing in the country, investing his energy? Why not?
SAGAL: You'd think that. It was The Monster Mash.
Other groups are also working on tools to help businesses avoid human rights abuses in their supply chains.

There is a more serious reason Trump should avoid criticizing judges too, Blackman says.

Critics of the bill say such savings are a fiction, as they are dependent on future Congresses sticking to plans to impose major cuts in Medicare and unpopular new taxes on health plans. We are creating a massive new entitlement, Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) said during floor debate Sunday.
Dr. HOOPER-BUI: Yes, sir. The National Science Foundation, to date, has funded $6.9 million to 70 projects which may - like my project has a total of 10 investigators working together on this project, and our project is funded at the level of 137,000. So it's very - we used all of our discretionary money to rush out, gather preliminary data, and then we have $137,000 between 10 investigators to analyze oil, analyze some pretty complex samples, to look at oyster uptake of oil and effect of growth on oysters, mussels and snails, and then also look at the insect samples and some foraminifera. We have a lot of research that we've coupled together, and we have a one-year process that's going to occur.

One reason for this mindset, says Renzo Guinto, a Filipino physician and a member of The Lancet Planetary Health's editorial board, is the colonial roots of tropical medicine.

Polls can call attention to deserving talents, and they can also influence a community of critics, the reason Davis insists on publishing the individual ballots.

In an era when states move from red to purple or purple to blue, the Republican Party can count on Escambia, Santa Rosa and Okaloosa counties in Northwest Florida to deliver solid support. This is a fiercely conservative area that adored both Bush presidencies and Sen. John McCain and packed the Pensacola Bay Center every time Donald Trump campaigned here. He carried Escambia County 58% to 37% in the 2016 election, when voter turnout was 74%. In Santa Rosa County, Republicans outnumber Democrats by a 3-to-1 ratio and 74% voted for Trump in 2016. In Okaloosa County, Trump outpolled Hillary Clinton 70% to 23%, with 75% turnout. Expect similar results in November. -- Tom Ninestine, WUWF Managing Editor

When you talk about government there are different levels of government in China, like in the United States. You have the central government, you have provincial government, you have city government, you have village people. So you cannot talk in very general terms the government. Sometimes government at a particular level makes some mistakes. This is possible. This is, I think it is all natural all over the world. But you cannot say the whole government in China is making a mistake. This is not true.
It's hard to generalize how delays generated by the government shutdown could change the outcomes of the cases themselves.

The mystery which cannot go away (as physicist Richard Feynman famously remarked) of the double-slit experiment, is that the person performing the experiment determines the physical nature of the particle — i.e., whether it is a wave or a particle. And, with Wheeler, the mystery deepens.
McConnell said he would move to table any Democratic amendments to the resolution.
WEN: This is a gag rule because what President Trump is doing is to put a gag on doctors like me to prevent us from providing our patients with full and accurate medical information. So if you are a woman who goes to a health center that receives public funding, you cannot be referred to abortion care, even if your life depends on it. This gag rule is unethical and unconscionable.

It's not so much that we are all espousing views that all of a sudden became popular, Flores said. Those are issues that matter to the everyday person. Now, because of Bernie I think, people are starting to make that connection between those issues and candidates.
Epidemiological studies that examine the relationship between pollution and health sometimes rely on massive amounts of medical data that is anonymized or kept confidential in order to protect the privacy of study participants. However, rigorous scientific studies are reviewed by multiple experts in the field before publication and that peer-review process includes an examination of how the underlying data was analyzed.

CHAZELLE: I guess I, you know, I hoped with this movie, both with the Jazz within it but also just with the entire approach to the movie, that it would have a little bit of old and new in it.

Top U.S. and NATO officials last week declared the Romanian facility up and running, and a day later broke ground on the Polish site. They say the state-of-the-art Aegis defense system, which will ultimately be under NATO control, is about protecting the alliance against rogue states like Iran and has nothing to do with Russia.

A group called the Sunrise Movement held a Web meeting with supporters around the country Tuesday. Jeremy Ornstein, 18, says he deferred going to college to work with the organization.
Mr. TURNER: The universe today is very, very big. And so, the space between photons is quite large. And so, the probability of two photons colliding is not very big. But if you go back to the past when the universe was much smaller, then the same number of photons occupy a lesser space. And so, the chance for collision was greater.
Just to be able to work on this project was so healing for me, she says. I mean, I was healing the art, but I was also healing myself in a certain sense.
Health officials maintain that among the best ways to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus are the same as those to prevent the seasonal flu: Wash your hands frequently for at least 20 seconds, avoid touching your face and stay home when feeling sick.
Our energy future will not be found in the dark of a mine but in the light of the sun, said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., as he announced the legislation on Capitol Hill.
He needed to lose 14 pounds [7 percent of his body weight], and he needed to reach a target of exercising for 150 minutes per week, explains Linda Delahanty, a registered dietitian at Massachusetts General Hospital.
We're excited to be building infrastructure for progressives running at every level, and hopefully we're going to see in addition to the Sanders energy coalescing around these House candidates, but also to activists saying, 'Hey, I'm going to run for school board, I'm going to run for city council,' said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee.
Yes, it's good to cut added sugars from your diet, she says. But dessert is still dessert, even if it's made with fewer calories. People think it's a get-out–of-jail-free card, Sylvetsky notes, pointing to the example of the hugely popular Halo Top Ice Cream. Its packaging promotes its low-calorie count, and then uses that to encourage people to devour an entire pint at a time. She also calls out bottled smoothies that are 100 percent fruit juice, and pack in 300 calories a bottle. Sylvetsky's advice is to still watch how much you're eating, and consider the potential unintended consequences that might come from consuming sugar substitutes.

MOMTAZ: The first thing she's really had to do is to keep calm and go on because she really is the rock of the family. She has this extremely strong character. She's very spirited, and she has refused to allow the circumstances that they are in - i.e. besieged by their own government supported by militant groups - she's refused to let that affect her children too much. So she tries to keep their daily life as normal as possible. She really is sort of the center of that family. She's also extremely courageous and understands that her eloquence and her ability to communicate with the outside world is an opportunity. It's what she can do to explain to the world what is happening to them, and she hopes to bring about change.

Democratic House managers' hopes of calling witnesses who could have proved damaging to Trump were dashed even before a vote on the motion.
GENTRY: I don't think so. I think tonight sets the standards. I think at this point, I think that the race is going to be over and Donald Trump will actually reach Cleveland with the 1,237 he needs. And I don't think it will be a contested convention. I think that this is a - it's over, and I think probably for the first time in history, Indiana has been the contributing factor to this. I mean, we've been used to years and years of not being in play...
The cumulative effect of all that is pretty disastrous. We have a country which has still got some of the worst development indicators in the world after an extraordinary amount of money being spent, but a lot of that money wasn't really spent on programs that could have led to real recovery, says Barr.
EYDER PERALTA, BYLINE: Well, you know, there was broad hope here that there would be some kind of swift resolution after yesterday - that Guaido would call for some sort of international action. But that didn't happen because Guaido seems to have put on the brakes a little bit, wanting more diplomacy. So I've heard a lot of disillusionment. But the government - it's worth noting - is jubilant. They believe they won this battle - that the coup, as they were calling this operation, has failed.
That was a significant move: knowing what's going to day-to-day, minute-by-minute, he says. And it's also been proving the point. We have numbers you can't argue with.

Neither Chief Kelly nor Mr. Flood actually attended the meetings but did make brief remarks before the meetings started to relay the president's desire for as much openness as possible under the law, the White House said in an official statement.
She had traveled from Nevada for the Stop the Steal rally hoping that a second term for President Trump was still possible. She sang patriotic songs as Trump supporters forcibly invaded the Capitol building. But as night fell, and the occupiers were pushed out and Congress resumed its operations, Laughlin saw with clarity where things are headed.
Lieber's attorney, Peter Levitt, declined to talk to NPR about the allegations. But others watching the case say it raises important questions about ethics, scientific openness and possible racial profiling in an era of geopolitical tension.
First thing that Google executives will be concerned about is potential damage to the brand and the PR efforts the company constantly undertakes, he said.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: And Nancy Pelosi, of course, is in Puerto Rico. So it's not like, you know, she's here right now talking to the president either. So I guess, you know, this leaves him taking his case to the American people. He tried to do that when he actually went and gave an address in the Oval Office. Did that move the needle?
President Trump said the virus wasn't changing any of his campaign plans.

SCICLUNA: It means that the guidelines we have, the laws we have need to be implemented across the board. But it also means a change of heart. He talked about conversion because this is a fight against one of the greatest evils. And this is, obviously, theological language. But it is a very important language for us. The pope, actually, put the abuse of kids and cover-up of that abuse on the same level of gravity. And we need to get it right.
I'm a little nobody from Colorado, she said. And he's this great man.
SNELL: You know, the polling showed really close races heading into these runoff elections. And Democrats work consistently on turnout, particularly on the early vote. You know, this race really depended on their voters showing up in huge numbers. And Republicans going into this worried that President Trump's messaging on election fraud and his fights with the Georgia secretary of state and, you know, his talk on Twitter would repress Republican turnout. And like you said, balance of the power in the Senate hangs on the remaining race between Ossoff and Perdue. If they wind up within a half a percent, that could possibly lead to a recount. That would mean the Senate can't really get underway until Georgia is finalized.
In his latest effort to boost the coal business — and in the process help a major supporter — President Trump has called on the Tennessee Valley Authority to, essentially, ignore the advice of its staff and keep a large coal-fired power plant operating.

We'll hear three interviews from 1987 - with Max Roach, who kind of invented modern jazz drumming, pianist Jay McShann, who led the band in which Charlie Parker first became known - McShann was at the piano for our interview - and singer Anita O'Day, who inspired many of the so-called cool jazz singers. I hope you'll join us.

WOODRING: An H-bomb - dropped an H-bomb.
MONIZ: Well, the labor unions who I think are very much aligned with the idea of low carbon but also understand we cannot strand too many assets and, frankly, strand too many workers with impractical, unrealizable objectives.

It's kind of a cycle; they work hard, and don't have time to take English lessons because they're busy trying to survive, says Langer.

Ithink, the phase one trade agreement is part of the achievement efforts by both sides to develop a stronger and more stable relationship between China and United States. And I certainly hope that this agreement will be implemented effectively and it will be a big plus for the overall relations. Of course, we have other problems to solve, other issues to address — political security and others. But the, what we have learned from the trade negotiation could also be useful for other areas. I don't think the phase one trade agreement would be possible without the principle of mutual respect and equality. The two sides made genuine efforts to understand the other side, to respect the other side's legitimate needs and concerns and try to address the issues with a balanced approach and with a good sense of equality. If these principles could be applied in our efforts to address other issues in other areas, we could be equally successful.
The canceling of in-person classes and dorm closures at a growing number of colleges and universities have also raised concerns about whether students who live away from their families' homes will be counted in the right place.

But some structural factors in this poll mean that the addition of even a single female critic — someone more likely to vote for projects led by women — could be consequential in terms of increasing women's representation, even at the very top of the rankings. In voting, each critic ranks their choices from one to 10, with a first-place nomination equaling ten points, second place equaling nine and so on in a weighted system. Because so many different albums receive votes across all the ballots — some years, as many as 500 albums — comparatively small point totals are needed for high rankings in the poll. Sometimes the top albums are only separated by a handful of points.
I think everybody, both old and young, brought such sensitivity and empathetic playing. Most of it was done live. A bunch of stuff on the record, musically, you'll hear happen on the two [beat]: Like, one, boom. That's because you have people who are listening first and reacting, letting other people set the tone and doing what needs to be done in response. I think that's the working dynamic at Easy Eye, Dan Auerbach's studio — everybody working together to make things happen. It's like a barn raising.
The bureau is currently trying to hire and train as many as a half-million census workers to follow up with households that don't fill out a form themselves. These workers are critical to the bureau's strategy for making sure historically undercounted groups — including communities of color, rural residents and immigrants — are included in the country's population count.
MALEK: It's a good question. Yeah. I did feel a bit guilty. And the only way to compensate for that was just to give it my all. I was in my apartment that we were living in - four of us in a two-bedroom apartment. And I had a stack of manila envelopes. And every morning, I would get up and put my head shot and resume in the manila envelopes. And I remember my father one day standing next to my mom saying, you have a very tenacious son. And I don't think that he knows that I heard him, but I heard that. And it gave me that extra boost I needed to just keep going. And I would take those manila envelopes - I was delivering pizza - I would put them - glue them or tape them to every pizza box I would send out. I would keep them behind the register of the fast-food restaurant I would be working at. And if anyone even producorial came in, they were getting a head shot and resume in their to-go bag.

As a U.S. senator, Joe Biden was among the principal authors of the 1985 federal drug crimes law, but in recent years he has considerably shifted his stance on addiction and substance use. Biden has acknowledged the law's sentencing disparities between crack and powder cocaine led to racial injustices, and he introduced a new bill to eradicate the difference. Biden's language about addiction has changed, too, especially in the context of his son Hunter's struggle with it.

The ceremony began as you might expect: with a lot of emphasis on great hats. British weddings may offer Americans their best opportunity to look at the kinds of hats that we, regrettably, don't wear all that often. And perhaps because Markle is an American actress, there were even more celebrities to look at than usual. Actress Priyanka Chopra wore a sculpted lavender number I could have looked at all day, and Serena Williams had a divine stand-up fascinator. Camilla Parker-Bowles, the Duchess of Cornwall and Charles' wife, wore a broad, flat swirl of feathery peach.
DOUCLEFF: For example, right now, if, say, only 80% of people in a community are following these guidelines, then to stop this new variant, you would need something like 90% or 95% of people to follow the guidelines. And all the scientists I spoke to say the vaccine needs to roll out as quickly as possible because, so far, scientists do believe that the vaccine will still be effective against this new version of the virus.
And so we've already been paying the costs, except we have not been getting any of the benefit. And so what we're here to say is that government is not just for cleaning up other people's mess, but it's also for building solutions in places where the private sector will not.

CARNEY: My songs are the songs that I had sort of half-written. He kind of pushed incredible choruses on them or great hooks, lyrically. I can give you a good example. There's a song in the film, which is one of the first songs Connor writes, and it's called The Riddle Of The Model and the film is about a guy who sees a girl who claims she's a model, this young kid who's sort of a 16-year-old. So I wrote that name, The Riddle Of The Model. I thought it was very pretentious and very sort of appropriate for a young kid in the '80s. And he started adding in words like, you know, she's so indefinable, she holds the key to the missing code.
I'm guessing there are a lot of people who might agree with what you're saying. But people who were also, in the moment, watching what was going on yesterday and having the sort of visceral reaction of: I want to see something happen.

One of the scenes that I saw yesterday seemed like a strange inversion of what we've seen at some of the other protests from the past year. An African-American police officer was basically chased up the stairs of the Capitol by a group of white people. And you could see in this video that he seemed perhaps afraid, but certainly questioning what to do in that moment, how much to react. He had a gun, which he seemed to reach for and didn't touch. Did you see that scene, and what did you make of it?
Instead, Biden will need to consider which domestic priorities can get bipartisan support since Senate rules now require anything to get 60 votes to advance.

Flinders joined the British Royal Navy at age 15, in 1789. Several years later, he was sent to present-day Sydney where he developed an interest in the area's geography. He returned home to Britain and successfully pitched a circumnavigation of the landmass whose full extent was still unknown to his countrymen, according to Royal Museums Greenwich. They note that the Flinders expedition, which lasted from 1801 to 1803, was one of the first organised to try to open up lands for colonial expansion.

QUEEN: (Singing) I work hard - he works hard - every day of my life. I work till I ache my bones. At the end - at the end of the day - I take home my hard-earned pay all on my own. I go down to my knees, and I start to pray till the tears run down from my eyes. Lord, somebody, somebody, somebody, please - can anybody find me somebody to love? He works hard - every day - every day...
SHEHADEH: Absolutely, because without a settlement of the conflict there will be no possibility of peace in Palestine, Israel or in the region. And I believe that eventually it would be seen that a resolution would be beneficial to both sides. It cannot continue. No colonial situation has lasted. No discriminatory situation so glaring has lasted. Nor would this one last as well.
SIMON: And I guess as a parent, I have learned to be grateful that these drills are held. But I wonder if there are some students who aren't panicked by the drills in and of themselves.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: But you didn't. You actually entered that 1967 marathon. Tell us a little bit about how you did that and what - and the story behind that.
Seven and a half years ago. Like yesterday. A cliché that was always true. Claire picked up the chart from the end of the hospital bed and read the history of the man lying helpless before her. Edward R. Reese Jr. Age: 37. Height: 5'11. Weight: 175. Marital status: Married. Two children. Address: 1020 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. Profession: Banker. Claire shuddered. He was only one year older than she was. She imagined him holding his children on his lap to read them a story at bedtime, the way she held Emily and Charlie. She saw him advising clients in a wood-paneled office.
BEERS: When a user steps into the shoe, when their heel touches the foot bed, it triggers a sensor. What that sensor does is it tells it that the foot's there and that go ahead and tighten.
It's removing the ability to make decisions, it's removing that from the bank and effectively vesting it in a government mandate, he says.
We essentially got the keys on a Wednesday, Pina Lopez said, and then we were told we needed to open on that Saturday.
We found that a large majority of the students said we'd have to pay them more than $2.50 to solve the word puzzles, Ubel said. Yet when we actually finished the five minutes and asked them how much they enjoyed those five minutes, the people solving the word puzzles enjoyed the five minutes significantly more. And yet very few of them said yeah, pay me $2 and I'd be happy to do word puzzles 'cause at least I'll be having fun.
Equal At Last? Women In Jazz, By The Numbers
The drinking water options in this part of India are limited. Local water sources may be toxic because of runoff from industries, for example. If water is delivered from a filtration plant, it could lack minerals.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Just showing how widespread this is. Joe Biden has been building a lot of momentum, though, as well as a pretty solid delegate lead. Is this debate Bernie Sanders' last stand to stop Biden from running away with the nomination?
And I started this and I continue it — to defend him, to totally vindicate him — but also I am a citizen and I am a lawyer and I have a skill and what I see is major crime covered up by the media that's in love with Joe Biden. Right in front of their faces in Washington, D.C., Joe Biden has been carrying on a criminal enterprise that's so obvious that you have to be a fool not to see it. You can just take five newspaper articles and they follow all the same pattern. One of Joe Biden's relatives gets involved and makes millions of dollars and all of a sudden you find out that Joe has a connection to it. Either it's a bank. And Joe Biden is the only Democrat who's fighting for making bankruptcy harder. All the Democrats want to make it easier, but his son has no-show job for a big bank, so he's doing that. Then he goes to Iraq.
The spill received enough media attention that President Richard Nixon made a trip to survey the damage in a helicopter. He also visited an oil-soaked beach near Santa Barbara Harbor.
MONIZ: Overwhelmingly the countries of the world and the U.S. population is moving towards a clear commitment to the idea that we need to act.
We're not spending money on this anymore. We consider that a waste of your money, Mulvaney said about climate change research as he took questions from White House reporters at Thursday's afternoon press briefing.

Her husband used to earn small change by hauling groceries for customers out of crowded bazaars, but the work dried up. Now, her oldest boy sells old plastic bags: other families buy them to burn for fuel. He's lucky to make $2 a day. Some days he brings home 50 cents.
SAGAL: ...Regret the name they gave their children. According to the poll, 18 percent of British parents regret their baby's name, 2 percent end up changing it. It's not always the parents' fault. Popular culture can take your baby's name and change it. And it can be problematic or embarrassing for the kids if, you know, they think that you named your child after the popular culture. So you have to say things like, no, no, we don't watch reality TV. Black Chyna was my grandmother's name.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: With all its triumphs and shortcomings, today VAWA sits in purgatory. When the bill expired in 2019, the House passed a new version that's currently stalled in the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell hasn't put it on the legislative schedule.
And Court says the rule is so broadly written that it would apply to mundane business decisions as well as broader ones based on what the management of the bank thinks is good or bad for society — whether that involves climate change, assault rifles, payday lending, or anything else.
So for instance, something like welfare reform - welfare reform is ostensibly not a racial policy. However, when you think about the individuals who are most likely to be on welfare, the picture that comes to your head is of usually an African-American and usually of an African-American woman. And so study after study have found that negative attitudes towards African-Americans affect your attitudes regarding welfare reform.

While COVID-19 has mutated in thousands of mostly harmless ways, the world is increasingly focused on one variant detected in England, dubbed B.1.1.7, and one found in South Africa, called 501.V2, because they seem to spread more easily than older strains. Although not believed to be any deadlier, B.1.1.7 has now become the dominant variant in some areas of England.

But then in order to deepen the character I did have to kind of analyze that a little bit more. And I think there's a bit in episode two when she says that she loves everything about sex: the drama of it, the performance of it, the kind of build up to it — but she doesn't actually like the feeling of it. And that is, I think, at the heart of what's complicated [about] the character. ... The moment that it's about sex, it's incredibly clear, and that's a relief for her and a release. So she's like, the moment she sees desire, you know, flutter across somebody's eyes, she's like, I know this game. I know what we're doing here. I just need to do this; that person will do that; we'll end up having sex and then I'm in control. I am desired. And for a short moment, you know, she has agency over her life.
Tim says learning to build more exercise into his week was not as challenging as learning to eat small portions all the time. But he learned to make that a habit, too.

MARTIN: You were on this program to talk about your book on so-called superbugs. These are drug-resistant bacteria that are - you know, they're dangerous, difficult to treat. And in that interview, you talked about the relationship between the government and pharmaceutical companies, and you said there should be more cooperation in drug development so that medical professionals can better handle outbreaks.

Pohlman still takes quiet moments to reflect on her family's loss. I still think about our baby every day. I would be about six months pregnant now if it hadn't happened, she says. We would be planning a baby shower even if it had to be over Zoom, we would be getting all the new little baby clothes and washing them and folding them and just getting ready. But we're not, because there's nothing to get ready for.
It's the one line of federal code that has created more economic value in this country than any other, says Michael Beckerman, who runs the Internet Association, which represents many of Silicon Valley's largest companies.

But rather like something out of the - kind of cross between The Revenant and, you know, something from, like, Clint Eastwood in one of those Fistful Of Dollar (ph) movies. He does recover slowly. And he goes off to feed himself up and to build his strength because he knows that if he doesn't get back to the troop soon, one of the usurpers will take over power. So he builds himself and builds himself. And - you know, these terrible injuries. He walks the 10 kilometers - seven or eight miles - to where they are and then makes this enormous gamble, which is that even though he's weak and unable to and would actually in a - if it came to a fight, would not be able to win.

WEN: We should talk about what is evidence-based, science-based methods for ensuring that all people have access to the health care that they need. Title X is our nation's program for affordable birth control and health care. And this program is intended to ensure that people with low incomes who live in rural areas or who don't have health insurance still have access to cancer screenings and preventive care.
To Pakistan next, where people are clamoring for the public hanging of an alleged serial killer. A warning - there are details coming over these next four minutes or so that could disturb some listeners. This story begins with a little girl. She was found in a trash heap after being raped and killed. It is an awful story. And among the many questions it's raising is whether her death might lead to changes in Pakistan. NPR's Diaa Hadid visited her hometown today, and Diaa joins me now. Hi.
Whereas the cells in the eye of the birds and the bees sample light evenly across the spectrum, the receptors in our eyes are tuned less-regularly. In particular, long-wave cells (that is, cells that respond more readily to light from the long-wave, red end of the spectrum) are only a very narrow band apart from the medium-wave cells that are tuned to green light.
CORI BUSH: I was able to see people starting to come closer up the stairs. And so I'm seeing the flags, and I'm seeing people starting to come towards the steps. And so I went on ahead and left and was able to get back to my office. And then within a matter of minutes, probably before I even made it back to my office, they had already come through the doors. So my team and I - we're safe. I'm just glad I was - we were able to get out.
Some had visions of Trump and a squad of Secret Service agents barging their way in, no doubt to the cheers of Republican members of Congress.

If we can slow doubling time to 10 days, we might have enough hospital beds to handle the surge and get fully through the surge, said Chris Farnitano, health officer for Contra Costa County in the San Francisco Bay Area on March 31. Currently, we're at about eight days on our doubling time for our hospital cases.

He recently made this argument in a book called The Rise and Fall of American Growth. In the New York Times, Paul Krugman called it a magisterial combination of deep technological history, vivid portraits of daily life... and careful economic analysis.
I think a lot can come from it — at least, I hope so — the denuclearization, ultimately, Trump said at a White House event last week. I'm in no particular rush. The sanctions are on; the relationships are very strong, and a lot of good things have happened.
Trump also said Thursday that he would support the prospect of the government taking an equity stake in companies as part of a big stimulus for the economy.
Their function is to literally just be stage props for an American drama. And my narrator understands this. And he understands it very intellectually and viscerally that what is happening here is that Hollywood is the unofficial ministry of propaganda for the Pentagon, that its role is to basically prepare Americans to go fight wars by making them focus only on the American understanding of things and to understand others as alien and different and marginal, even to their own histories, right?

You have framed your interest in former Vice President Biden as looking into to that 2016 and past corruption. However, you were on Fox the other day and you said, quote, I started investigating Biden two years ago when he was thinking about running for president.
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: Well, money is the No. 1 thing that health officials say they need right now. And the good news is that it's coming. Three billion dollars from CDC is finally on its way after Congress' year-end relief bill.

Mr. KRAUSS: Well no, but I mean, I think it's the biggest misconception about science is that somehow scientists are happy understanding things. In fact, if you're a theorist, you're happiest when you don't understand things because there's a lot more to understand about nature.
Rescheduling a case can be devastating for some individuals. For others, it may actually be a blessing in disguise, said Maurice Goldman, an immigration attorney in Tucson, Ariz.
Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, asked whether it mattered legally if Trump sought a quid pro quo from Ukraine's leader. Trump's attorney Alan Dershowitz responded with a broad view of executive powers, arguing that if a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.

But you can go further. That's when your mind will really get blown. There is no reason to stop at 10,000 years. The line that led to you reaches back beyond civilization to humans wandering in tribes across glaciers in the last ice age 50,000 years ago. It also reaches further back to species that weren't Homo sapiens, like Homo erectus, a million years ago. Keep going long enough and you'll find grandmas who were small mammals living in forests.

As for executive actions, Cooper says the phrase is very generic. He explains that executive actions are merely a category of different policy tools that presidents often use — including executive orders and memorandums — that has no separate legal meaning itself.

Additionally, says Umrbek Allakulov, Research and Development Officer at Water Integrity Network, government agencies and research centers in developing countries may not have the ability to monitor and test water quality. Under such circumstances, citizen-led water quality monitoring can offer a supporting hand to help ensure that water is safe for human consumption.
RICHEN: I think it was an alliance and also a give-and-take. So there are things I know that King did that Gaston did not support. One of those was the children's march. During that campaign, they had all the students come out and march. And Gaston thought that was a bad idea, and there was violence around that. And Gaston didn't want the children - was worried about the children being attacked. But also, too, Gaston bailed King out of jail. He let them stay for free. And he does talk about how he realized that there needed to be a more confrontational approach when he saw the hoses on the people in the park and - you know, the strength of the hoses literally making someone barrel down the sidewalk. And he knew that things had to change and that confrontation was going to - you know, it was the only way to attack this problem.
KUHN: I think it's pretty clear that he mostly just wants the meeting at this point, and we know this because North Korea has refused to engage in working-level talks with the U.S., particularly Mike Pompeo and U.S. special envoy Steve Biegun have basically been shut out. So analysts believe that North Korea is betting everything on a second summit with Trump, where they will try to manipulate him into making more concessions.
I hope we can get witnesses and documents, Schumer told reporters during a break in the questioning. It's an uphill fight. Is it more likely than not? Probably no. But is it a decent good chance? Yes.
So, I would say that trying to judge string theory today is like trying to judge a block of wood that hasn't yet been turned into a violin. You know, it's in an infant stage. It's a very difficult problem. The progress has been astounding. There are questions that we've resolved in the theory that I, 20 years ago, and I think my colleagues would agree, would think we would never get this far in certain domains. But we've not made enough progress in the other direction which is making the experimental predictions, and that's just the state of being at the cutting edge.
Bad News was written two Novembers ago, but I think it's only gotten more timely as release day was approaching. I wrote it to be heard almost from the perspective of Mother Earth — like, I'm on fire, I can barely keep it turning. But it's also all of us in this moment of relentless, 'Yo, can I catch a break?

We haven't had a national unemployment rate this low for this long in 50 years. Here in South Carolina, the unemployment rate is even lower, said CBS moderator Norah O'Donnell. How will you convince voters that a Democratic socialist can do better than President Trump with the economy?
I'm left hanging my head and asking why, he continued. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations? How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile? How can an individual who's been embraced by the city of Chicago turn around and slap everyone in this city in the face by making these false claims?
I'm a pastor. I lead Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. served. He said that we're tied in a single garment of destiny, caught up in an inescapable network of mutuality, whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly, Warnock said. And so whether we're talking about health care, or we're talking about a livable wage, there's a way in which we have to look out for one another.
BRYANT: You know, well, it's an old story with a new chapter, Scott. And this is something that Boston has - the fans and the organization obviously over the several decades, they've earned it. It's not hyperbole. The Red Sox, as we all know, have had incredible racial problems from going back to - from 1945 up to the present. And I think that equally old with a new chapter is the response from a lot of the fans and a lot of the talking heads in the media responding to this by saying, well, you know, this is just a few bad apples. And why do we all get lumped into this? Well, because it's been happening for so long. And also to the players who play for the Red Sox.
Rather than steady progress, this wealth of data indicates that women's critical recognition through the poll has remained static over the years. The percentage of projects led or co-led by women in the top ten has ranged from 0% to 50%, but has not made consistent gains.

The woman told Prasertong that when she was a college student, she was offered an unpaid summer White House internship in Washington, D.C. But that meant she would have had to find a way to support herself in another city instead of spending the summer earning money that she could use to help pay for school in the fall. The woman passed on the internship, Prasertong says, because she realized, 'Oh, it's just for rich people'  – meaning students whose parents could afford to subsidize them while they worked for free. She still went on to be successful, but if she'd done that internship, who knows what she'd be doing?
Republican Rep. Lou Barletta believes that outsider quality is what propelled Trump to a dominating win in Northeastern Pennsylvania last month. He represents the Scranton region in the House and was one of the first congressmen to endorse Trump. In Luzerne County, home of Wilkes-Barre, Trump won more than 77 percent of the vote. People feel that Washington will never control him. And that's what they want, Barletta said.
SAGAL: All right, here's your next question. The U.K.'s Channel 4 came under some criticism for its creative use of an ice sculpture. Why? A, Her Majesty did not appreciate being represented by a sculpture titled Ice Queen; B, after Boris Johnson refused to participate in a debate on climate change, they had a melting ice sculpture take his place; or, C, to counterprogram a Theresa May speech on the BBC, they showed an ice sculpture of her for an hour with the caption - which seems more human?

Like any other year, there was plenty to celebrate in 2020. People graduated from high school and college, got married and had babies. We all found ways to mark those special moments — weddings and baby showers over Zoom, drive-by graduation parties and distanced pot luck Thanksgivings. Neighborhoods even found a way to do socially distanced trick-or-treating.
This is a regime that has never been in the position that it's in today. One has to confront so many elements that challenge the central thesis of the theocracy and the revolutionary nature of this regime. And you can see it in protests, not just in Tehran. And you should know when you traveled there, I'm guessing you weren't permitted to travel freely. I'm guessing that you didn't get a chance to go out into these places where the life of the Iranian people, these are people who are suffering. Qassem Soleimani, who we removed from the battlefield, killed hundreds of Iranians, and the Iranian people know that. And it's been our strategy that has delivered this message of freedom for the Iranian people.

This Southern city near the Mississippi border seems like an unlikely place for such a concept. Yet the area is surprisingly diverse: In 2016, there were more than 70,300 immigrants living in Memphis — about 11 percent of the total population, according to a compilation of data from New American Economy, a bipartisan research and advocacy firm focused on immigration policy. Memphis is also home to one of 20 World Relief offices in the U.S., which partner with churches and communities to provide transition programs for refugees and immigrants.

Making a split-second appraisal of the scene, guided by intuition, Claire crouched and pivoted until she found the best angle. Using the 35 mm lens, she stopped down on the Leica to increase the depth of field. She took a quick series of photos, bracketing to guarantee the exposure: the patient in profile and a half-dozen nurses, doctors, and orderlies gathered around him, like a group portrait by Rembrandt, their faces saying their thoughts. They knew he was dying, too. Out here in the cold without their coats on, with the man looking dead already and nobody else nearby but Claire, they dispensed with their usual cheery and encouraging expressions.

Now, he's openly wondering, you know, the Astros told him after that series that he was tipping his pitches, you know, kind of giving away with little tics or whatever. But now he's wondering, well, was it their sign-stealing? And what this does to a pitcher's reputation - I mean, it took Yu Darvish - who you know now is with the Chicago Cubs. It took him until the latter half of last season to really recover and become an effective pitcher again.

The U.S. and more than 50 other countries' governments have issued statements recognizing congressional leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela's rightful president, according to Prodavinci, an independent website for Venezuela analysis. The Maduro administration said earlier this month it had enlisted about as many countries, including China and Russia, in its support. Most Latin American governments now back Guaidó. Mexico's president says the country is neutral and is calling for dialogue.

That increases the likelihood that these abuses could be happening in fisheries as well, she says.

While within his rights, Trump shocked the legal and political worlds by booting an FBI director who was midway through his 10-year term and whose agency was still investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election. It was shocking enough that the Justice Department named an independent counsel, Robert Mueller, whose lengthy probe and eventual report haunted Trump's first two years in office. It set up Trump's loss of the House in the 2018 midterms and the eventual departure of Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions.

From the candle-lit home of their lead singer, Hit La Rosa comes in hot and doesn't stop until the final measure. The band explores the many facets of Peruvian cumbia music, infusing it with pop music, folklore, jazz and dancehall to produce its distinctive grooves and hooks. The band's precise-yet-dreamlike music and punk sensibility all come together to make music that explores life's shadowy sides. Despite living through a political crisis in Peru, the band brings a message of hope and joy in the midst of struggle and upheaval.

Seven male suspects were detained earlier this month — according to Slovak media, one of them was Vadala — but were released within 48 hours for lack of evidence. Fico, who has repeatedly accused reporters and the opposition of using the tragedy to further their own agendas, also held a news conference on March 1 offering a 1 million euro ($1.2 million) reward to find the couple's killers. The money was piled in neat stacks in front of him on a table.
Yeah, I always try to be fair. If I went there and the witnesses said to me this is all bull, Joe Biden didn't know anything. He wasn't involved. He's only involved a little bit. The stuff about collusion, they're making it up. We don't have any evidence of it, I would have either not pursued it or I have pursued it and locked it up and tied it up and said, OK, we can't go that way. I've gone down about four avenues to try to defend the president that turned out not to be true. I don't think people understand this, and Jeff may not understand this because Jeff's always been more of a prosecutor: when you defend somebody in what is akin to a criminal action, it's not just a courtroom, where I think I'm great. The real key to it is investigating. It's my job to do a counter investigation. The best thing I can do is prove that my client's innocent. So if, let's take a bank robbery, I'm representing somebody for a bank robbery. He tells me he was in Los Angeles and can prove it. I'm going to go out to Los Angeles. I'm gonna find a people who can prove it. So that's a simple case. Here, I'm in the middle of answering [Special Counsel Robert] Mueller's questions about collusions with Russia.

There are no legal processes required for issuing a memorandum, Cooper says. A president doesn't have to do anything, doesn't even have to publish it if he or she doesn't want to. With an executive order, presidents must publish. The Obama administration started publishing public memorandums on the White House website, and the Trump administration has followed suit. But, Cooper says, that is something they choose to do, and what's available on the website now may not include all of the new administration's memorandums.

Sounds like Sci-Fi gets used everywhere, from CNN, to The New York Times, to yes ... here on NPR. And once you see it, you can't unsee it. The best examples usually include a reference to a mid-1990s sci-fi film, just to make crystal-clear what science fiction this particular science fact refers to.
This advice may sound unduly pessimistic, but it's not so foreign to science. Philosophers of science sometimes refer to the pessimistic meta-induction on the history of science: All of our past scientific theories have been wrong, so surely our current theories will turn out to be wrong, too. That doesn't mean we haven't made progress, but it does suggest that there is always room for improvement and elaboration — ways to be less wrong.

REEVES: Yes. I mean, one of the things that's quite interesting here is that you often meet people who lean to the left but who rather apologetically explain to you that they are very much in favor of the Trump administration because they're very glad to see this happening in Venezuela after so long. And they appreciate the intervention. But at the same time, this concern exists about what's going to happen. You know, if Maduro goes, Steve, it's unlikely to be a clean break with his military and security apparatus all transferring their allegiance to a new interim government.
And in May it returned Cuba to a list of countries that the U.S. deems as not cooperating fully with its counterterrorism efforts.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: Yeah. I think the first thing that we need to do is kind of break the mistaken idea that taxes pay for a hundred percent of government expenditure. It's just not how government expenditure works. We can recoup costs, but oftentimes you look at, for example, the GOP tax cut, which I think was an irresponsible use of government expenditure. But government projects are often financed by a combination of taxes, deficit spending and other kinds of investments - you know, bonds and so on.

At the university level, students are calling on faculty to acknowledge the field's colonial history in global health curriculum. And communications managers at charitable groups are trying to portray the recipients of aid with dignity and respect in messages sent to donors and the media. Many of these conversations can be found on social media with the hashtags #ShiftThePower and #DecolonizeGlobalHealth.

SAGAL: The woman was understandably upset that not a single employer had reached out to her, so she checked out her resume, only to find out in huge letters at the top of it, her name was listed as Princess Banana Hammock. Apparently, the Word document automatically changed her given name to her computer's username, and she did not notice. Employers did, though, and were clearly too nervous to reach out to a member of the monarchy to offer her an interview.

Now, I think on that first problem - that is the need to adopt tough policies to try to prevent future acts of abuse - I think most people would give the Catholic Church, in general, and in this pope, in particular, fairly high marks. I mean, today, zero tolerance is more or less the official policy of the Catholic Church.
Last year, on the heels of the Haikus with Hotties success, Audrey announced that after 12 years as an independent publication, the magazine had been acquired by investors (along with sister publication KoreAm Journal) and would no longer be producing print issues. Tseng, along with the rest of the editorial staff, was laid off.
That break may have reinforced something party stalwarts have long been skeptical of — this independent senator's commitment to the party at large. After all, rival Hillary Clinton — who still leads him in both pledged and superdelegates by a nearly insurmountable margin — has long been fundraising for state and national Democrats. By the end of April, she had raised more than $46 million for the DNC and state parties through her Hillary Victory Fund.

It's very different.
The No. 1 issue for Democratic voters in this presidential election season is health care. But trailing a close second is climate change. Morning Edition host Rachel Martin has been reporting in Iowa this past week ahead of the caucuses. And she spent some time in the city of Davenport, right along the Mississippi River. The city was the site of record-breaking floods last spring. How does the rising river and the threat from climate change affect how people there vote? Here's what she found out.
The final margin for the races are outside the threshold for a recount, and the voters in this county an hour northwest of Atlanta are about 75% Republican — so the result isn't close, or expected to change.
Few avenues exist here for the rural poor to better their situation. For more than a decade, many parents have sent their children to orphanages in Kathmandu, where they hope they'll get better resources and education than what's available in their villages. The problem of false orphanages has grown so out of control that the U.S. and other countries banned international adoptions from Nepal in 2010. There were simply too many orphans with parents.
Zhuk said she immediately showed the messages to the program's anchor, who told her Slutsky's inappropriate behavior toward women was well-known. Her colleague, however, discouraged her from reacting, as the politician was an important get for the show.
Mary Jackson, who was from Virginia, died in 2005 at the age of 83. She spent 35 years at NASA, beginning in 1951, at a still segregated division called the West Area Computing Unit which calculated the trajectories of some of NASA's first space shots. She worked with children in her retirement - even helping them build a wind tunnel for science experiments at a local community center, like the kind she once helped build to test the equipment that would send men and women into space.
It's bleeding into other forms of work — so you're seeing that in marketing, as an example, where you see campaigns that are continuously getting feedback from the market on an hourly basis, she says.
He added: I believe the United States of America should be at the front of the pack. But even in the absence of American leadership; even as this Administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; I'm confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet we've got.

The president's plan calls for a 6 percent increase in spending by the Department of Homeland Security, including $2.6 billion to begin work on a planned border wall. The White House is also asking Congress to devote $1.5 billion to the wall in the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
The new president also sought to explain his decision in the past 100 days not to label China a currency manipulator by pointing to the tense situation on the Korean Peninsula and China's critical role in dealing with the North Korean regime. Trump called Chinese President Xi Jinping a good man, adding let's see what happens.

You know, Khan Academy is on track, and hopefully it does reach hundreds of millions, billions of students and empowers them where if they have a low-cost cellphone, they can start to self-educate themselves. But we think the opportunity now is not just online. We want to catalyze change more broadly. You know, what does a physical classroom look like? Break out of this kind of Prussian-factory model of education. And what we said was we needed to create a lab school, but we don't just want to create another one-off, progressive private school. So everything that we're doing in this lab school we're sharing — we're sharing with local public, private schools. All the curricula, we're going to open-source it and figure out what works, what doesn't. And when you figure out things that do work, share it with the rest of the planet.
And there is some evidence for this: Workers are not sharing in growth nearly as much as they used to — more of that new income has gone to shareholders, for example.
He said the president's attacks on the FBI will do lasting damage to our country.
So while candidates may make religious references and show off their family Bibles to win over Iowa's Christian vote, that approach can go only so far. Many evangelical voters simply aren't first and foremost religious voters.
GOMEZ: I think it's really important when people are writing a will to consider the fact that wills are governed by state law. To give you an example, each state kind of has their own execution requirements. Some states require two witnesses and a notary, other states perhaps only one witness. Some states currently allow for online execution of these documents while other states don't.
Home prices have finally clawed their way back to the peak of the housing bubble. That's on average nationally. The story is very different when you zoom in on different counties or cities in particular.
New York City's Department of Correction is in charge of the operation. Four days a week, it sends a bus with prisoners to bury pine caskets that arrive on a refrigerated truck from the city morgue.
Longer lines at airports, national parks closed and, of course, for hundreds of thousands of federal workers, missed paychecks and worry about keeping food on the table. The partial government shutdown has had some immediate impacts. The longer-term ones can be harder to see.

Hey, Nate.
MAEVE HIGGINS: Little slits to pour boiling oil out of and a murder hole.
Just think about it, if you go back and you see the technology section of any newspaper, I'm going to guess that a small share of the things that are in the future ever become the present. The journals in science are a bit like that. They are very well informed guesses about what's going to happen next. But they're not solid knowledge that we should take for granted.
Thursday the president said basically it's up to Pelosi. It's really her choice, Trump said, I would have done it in a different place but I think that would be very disrespectful to the State of the Union — to pick some other place. I could have done it. I could have gone to a big auditorium and gotten 25,000 people in one day.

MARTIN: To mark this day, we wanted to take a few minutes to reflect on President Trump's first year in office, speaking to people on both sides of the aisle about the president's legacy and lasting imprint so far. Earlier in the week, before the shutdown took effect, I spoke with two members of Congress about the president's first year in office. We start with Republican Don Young of Alaska, the so-called dean of the House. That's a title reserved for the longest-serving representative. It's been 45 years in Congressman Young's case. We went to his office on Capitol Hill, and I asked him for his take on Donald Trump's first year.

Mr. ALLEN: Yeah, that's right. I mean, one point that is often forgotten in this discussion - because in some reporting, it's been suggested that then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the guy who is now the pope was somehow the Vatican's point person on sex abuse for the entire arch of his 25-year career in Rome. And that's not really correct. In fact, he didn't get any direct responsibility for this until 2001, when Pope John Paul II put him and his office in charge of it.

If we still have the capacity as a nation to honor all of that, we should be as disturbed when a president defies the law as we are when rioters desecrate the place where the law is made.
The American Bar Association has passed a resolution prohibiting lawyers from making sexist remarks, following the lead of many U.S. states.
The question now is whether congressional Republicans will do the same.
Mr. KRAUSS: Yeah, and you know, the point is - well, many physicists find it distasteful because for 400 years, physics has tried to explain why the universe is the way it is rather than why it isn't, but at the same time, and for another reason, whenever we've gotten to a point where something really strange has come up, the anthropic principle has been proposed as an explanation.
So these migrants have to choose between two bad options if they want to reach the United States: They can cross the border illegally in remote areas, or they can wait, sometimes for months, in border towns.

The White House's plan to provide a separate briefing for their political allies demonstrates that their interest is not in informing Congress but in undermining an ongoing criminal investigation, Warner said.
You see, we believe in openness, but openness does not mean that you could say anything under any circumstances. The government has to respond in a responsible way. Whatever action the government is taking, whatever announcement it is making, alert it is issuing, you have to base yourself on sufficient evidence and science.
SIMON: Let me ask about the Russian position. They insist there's no proof yet of chemical weapons. In fact, a Russian general yesterday, I believe, said that British intelligence had somehow faked the attack in that suburb.

Instead of crumbs or broken M&Ms scattered in that dispenser tray on the bottom, this one is filled with blood.
They said, Why would you go and be a part of an institution that is not always fair and does not always pursue justice? Some would call it the persecutors office, not the prosecutor's office. ... Law enforcement has such a profound and direct impact on the most vulnerable among us. And there is a duty and a responsibility to be a voice for the most voiceless and vulnerable and to do the work of justice. And that's the work I wanted to do. ... It is also understanding that the victims of crime come from the same communities as those who have been treated unfairly. The victims of crime deserve a voice. I, for a while, specialized in child sexual assault cases. I'm gonna tell you, prosecuting those cases were extraordinarily difficult and some of the most important work I did.
In 1993, a panel of federal, state, tribal and local biologists and stakeholders, called the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee, put out a recovery plan for grizzly bears in the lower 48 states. It set population targets for each of the five populations of grizzlies still living south of Canada.

Amira Adawe has just arrived at a Somali-American community radio station in Minneapolis where she hosts a weekly call-in show called Beauty-Wellness Talk. After peeling off her winter jacket, Adawe slides a pair of headphones over her crown of dark, short curls. Hello? As-Salaam-Alaikum, she says into the foam mouth of her studio microphone. An anonymous stream of listeners starts calling in to confide about a subject that is deeply personal and also taboo — skin bleaching.

GATES: The average African-American is 24 percent European. Now think about that. And most DNA companies in the United States will tell you that they have never tested an African-American who is 100 percent from sub-Saharan Africa. This is called an admixture test. It measures your ancestry back 500 years approximately. So what that means is that it's the percent of - if you had a perfect family tree, what percent would be from sub-Saharan Africa? What percent would be from Europe? What percent would be Native American?

RUSSAKOFF: Well, that was another case of, like, you know, this enormous gap between the people who have come to save the Newark children and the people who actually cared for and taught the Newark children. And it became a huge flashpoint because Mark Zuckerberg had indicated that he wanted to give teachers enormous bonuses if they were the top teachers in the district. And that wasn't possible because the district just didn't have the money to pay those bonuses beyond the time that they would have the Zuckerberg money. So there were some merit bonuses put into the contract, but they were relatively small. And the new contract that came out of this reform effort also required teachers in quite a few schools to work longer hours, longer years and to work some weekends for a pretty small stipend that was added to their annual pay. It was $3,000, which they calculated came to about $10 an hour. And they were just - you know, they felt they had been kind of conscripted into working these extra hours and extra days while the people who were in the district, you know, scripting these plans as consultants were getting a thousand dollars a day. And it really became something that turned the teachers - even teachers who wanted - very much wanted change - it turned them against the reform effort.

She stressed that the current risk remains low. Almost all the cases that have occurred in the United States have been among travelers who have been infected overseas. In addition, there's always the chance that the coronavirus could begin to subside as spring and summer arrive.
But does it make sense to do this speech at this time in any other place than the House floor? Or — as Trump seemed to concede this week in bowing to Pelosi — does a change from the traditional venue sap too much of the tradition, glory and grandeur?
In addition to covert support for insurgencies, the U.S. has invaded its southern neighbors numerous times. For instance, the U.S. launched invasions of the Dominican Republic (1916), Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989).

But is learning really like money? In some domains it seems to be. For instance, there's evidence that children with larger vocabularies learn new words more readily than those with smaller vocabularies, as a result of which the gap between them can grow, rather than shrink, over time. And verbal abilities aren't just important because they beget further verbal abilities; they're important because they make new kinds of social interactions and information gathering possible. As with sensitive periods, targeting phenomena that snowball means that education can have a greater impact.
But there was one overriding reason to come back to the Capitol. And that was the Capitol itself. No other venue could invoke the same history and convey the same legitimacy.

SAGAL: On its 12th anniversary, cryptocurrency blank jumped to record highs.
In it, she pointed to a list of criminal justice reform groups and bail funds for protesters who were seeking contributions. Soon after, Muthukumar was summoned into a meeting with Google's human relations department.
I think the idea of a woman having her period, a lot of people know it's such a normal thing, but it's made into such a big thing, we have to keep it so secret and all of that. So Fats is obviously coming very much from that point of view, and the moment Shugs comes out complaining about having, I got my period and my stomach hurts, Fats just quarantines her. So we've taken it to an absurd level of, You have your period, you got to be quarantined. So we have Do Not Cross police tape and the episode has hazmat suits and ... it's like she's disposing of a bomb, basically.
SAGAL: It was so tough to get the president to pay attention to the briefing books that were prepared for him about this trip that the aides inserted his own name in every paragraph so that they would hold his interest.

These are areas which are largely isolated from the urban core where there are poor transportation options, said Tang. They're known as food deserts. People feel like they have less access to health care and other amenities. So, these are suburbs to the extent that they're outside the urban core. But they are not a move up for people. They're simply a move out.
The X-Files, though, has enjoyed its own dynamic from the start, thanks to the chemistry between David Duchovny, as FBI agent and conspiracy theorist Fox Mulder, and Gillian Anderson, as FBI medical expert Dana Scully.
Vocalists vs. Instrumentalists: Recordings led or co-led by female instrumentalists earned more spots in the critic's poll than those led or co-led by female vocalists: 13% vs. 5% in 2017, 15% vs. 5% in 2018, and 14% vs. 7% in 2019. This quantifies the greater critical acceptance of instrumentalists over singers, although vocalists do appear in the poll more often than those performing on any other single instrument. The data does not indicate any further preferences among critics between instruments played by women in jazz.
Being put on the U.S. terror list exposes countries to a suite of sanctions, including restrictions on U.S. foreign assistance; a ban on defense exports and sales; certain controls over exports of dual use items; and miscellaneous financial and other restrictions, the U.S. State Department says.

I want to play another song from your new CD, At The Cut, and this is a song called Granny that's about one of your grandmothers.

Los Angeles County [has] reported that its homeless population went up 23 percent last year, which is an amazing number. But this budget calls for cuts in homeless assistance. Do you think we're going to be seeing increases in homelessness in lots of other places?
You know, at this point a total country lockdown, I don't think there's any enthusiasm for that. There's such a fatigue, a COVID-19 fatigue, that just people would have a real tough time with that. Short of that, you can do a lot of things. Also, in certain regions of the country, for example, California is suffering terribly. They're having a stress on the system with beds, an exhausted health care group. I mean, understandably, these people have been working day and night. When you get to the point where the system is stressed like that, as the governor of California has said, you may look at selective lockdowns in certain parts of the state. I don't think this is something that we're ready for on a countrywide basis. But, you know, you have to keep your eye on everything that's going on and always keep all options open.

Note: As this article was being edited, we learned of Stephen Hawking's passing. An uncanny coincidence, he was fond of telling that he was born on the 300th anniversary of Galileo's death; and now, he passes away on the 139th anniversary of Einstein's birth.

FAVREAU: You know, it didn't totally surprise me. You know, I remember when the tragedy at Newtown elementary took place. And we had handed him a first draft of the speech he would give at the press conference that day, walked into the Oval and tried to pick up the edits. And he barely even looked up from his desk because there were tears in his eyes. I mean, he was so emotional that day, and you know, the first time he came home from Dover Air Force Base and saw a flag-draped coffin come off that plane. I think the weight of what it means to be the president of the United States, the commander in chief, when tragedies like this happen really affects him not only as a president but as a parent.

Jennifer Lentfer, a communications strategist who has worked in the field for two decades, says she has never seen so much excitement around decolonizing global development. There are already events scheduled in 2020 to tackle the subject. In the coming weeks, Lentfer is hosting a couple of online workshops on topics that question Western motives to make a difference and help because it is our moral imperative. And in January, graduate students at Duke University are organizing a conference called Decolonizing Global Health 2020.
JOSH BLOCK: It's a lobby that represents Americans who support the U.S.-Israel alliance. It itself, as an organization, does not make endorsements. It doesn't contribute to campaigns. It doesn't contribute to candidates - none of those things. In fact, it doesn't even have a PAC.

MARTIN: And for additional perspective, we also called Eduardo de Souza. He's the associate head soccer coach at Longwood University in Virginia. He's been living in the U.S. since 1999 on a series of visas, and we thought it would be helpful for him to tell us more about his experiences in trying to navigate the system as it is now. Eduardo, thank you so much for joining us once again.
So there are reasons for concern regarding the U.S. trade relationship with China. But if China did indeed suck 25 percent of manufacturing jobs out of the U.S. over nearly two decades, that leaves about 75 percent of those jobs that weren't lost to China.
SOFIA: So one thing that I found really interesting in your article was the state of coronavirus research in general and how that plays into how prepared we are right now. Like, this is a big group of viruses that cause a decent bit of disease throughout the world. But one researcher you talked to said that until recently, not that many people were studying coronaviruses.
Margaret Wroblewski's daily commute on the Metro often comes with an unwanted consequence, and it's not necessarily unexpected delays or crowded trains. It's sexual harassment.
I spoke to a priest. Of course, the Catholic Church in Ireland has historically been very powerful, very socially conservative. And this priest here in Dublin, he told me he'd be disappointed but not surprised if abortion was legalized here. And I think that speaks to the erosion of trust in the church here, particularly with respect to women and children, after a series of scandals of abuse, basically.
And while it's not been your traditional campaigning and there's been a lot of things said and so forth, I do believe at the end of the day, we will come together. We will unite behind the winner, which is going to be Donald Trump. And we will focus on making sure he becomes the next president of the United States.

Looking at this in any way you want, there is no way conceivable that Assad's writ will ever extend throughout the country again, Brett McGurk, President Obama's special envoy for countering ISIS, recently told The New Yorker. It's just not realistic after everything that's happened. So we have to find the formula for that transition.
GOLDFARB: Even within the women's rights community, there were some people who felt that this wasn't the highest priority, that we needed to be working on other issues like family leave, which, at the time, was not yet protected under federal law - abortion rights, equality in the workplace. These are all important issues. Some women's rights groups felt that working on the Violence Against Women Act would in some way distract or undermine those other efforts.

Maybe he means the Democratic establishment are people who don't agree with him. I'm not sure. But the difference is that Bernie Sanders has a different mission from the other candidates. As he says, every day, he is running to lead a political revolution. He wants to move American politics to the left. He's not running to lead a political party.

Though Lee acknowledges he is not intimately familiar with his congregation's political views, he said his unofficial sense is that they are divided among several candidates, especially Rubio, Santorum, Carson and Cruz.

The previous Administration refused to recognize that private innovation and American natural gas have achieved more than government mandates and misguided international agreements — and that naiveté led President Obama to sign a climate deal that will impose great costs with little gain. President Trump made the right call in leaving a deal that would have put an unnecessary burden on the United States.

In that sense, this year's race is looking more like 2012 than 2008. In 2012, Iowa evangelicals' support was relatively divided. Entrance polls showed Santorum with 32 percent of evangelicals' support, compared with Ron Paul's 18 percent (remarkably close to the Cruz-Trump split that this latest poll shows). Three other candidates each took 14 percent. Santorum went on to win the caucuses by just 34 votes over Mitt Romney. Paul finished a strong third.
BALDWIN: Well, the - climate change, as we hear about it every day through the national media, I don't believe is our problem. I believe climate's changing.

And that is when it rains, the water has nowhere to go except to the Mississippi River. But is it related to - what? - driving cars and eating beef? I'm not convinced of that.

The pragmatic answer is that when we physicists do quantum physics, we tend to think of it only as the physics of the ultra-tiny. We usually assume that the Schrödinger equation doesn't really apply to sufficiently large objects — objects like tables and chairs and humans, the things in our everyday lives. Instead, as a practical matter, we assume that those objects obey the classical physics of Isaac Newton, and that the Schrödinger equation stops applying when one of these objects interacts with something from the quantum world of the small. This works well enough to get the right answer in most cases. But almost no physicists truly believe this is how the world actually works. Experiments over the past few decades have shown that quantum physics applies to larger and larger objects, and at this point few doubt that it applies to objects of all sizes. Indeed, quantum physics is routinely and successfully used to describe the largest thing there is — the universe itself — in the well-established field of physical cosmology.
The other thing that in some respects was unfortunate is that it got started right in the middle of the holiday season between Christmas and New Year's. And that's the reason why things start slow.

But right now, I think we just need to give a little bit slack — not a lot, but enough to say, well, we're past the holiday season, now let's really turn the afterburners on.

HALIHAN: So when they design an injection well, it's designed to protect the fresh water up above and keep it from coming into the surface or coming into groundwater where people are drinking. When you design for seismicity, you want to design to protect the well from the water going down below where you're injecting. And so they've done a lot of changes to the wells to try to prevent water from getting down into the - what we call the granitic basement and finding faults down there that it can lubricate and move. And so that change from protecting the upper part of the well to changing the lower part of the well - they put out some mandates saying, we'd like you to modify your wells in these ways if you're in the seismically active areas.

So they just simply couldn't get enough traction on the ice.

A lot of people tell you it sets their teeth on edge, but my guess is that they're not listening to themselves very attentively. Everyone uses singular they, whether they realize it or not. In an engaging recent book called Between You & Me, the New Yorker's self-designated comma queen Mary Norris says that that use of they is just wrong. But flip back a few pages and you find her writing Nobody wanted to think they were not essential. If that sentence got by a New Yorker copy editor in her own book on grammar, what hope is there for anybody else? If you insist on coming down on singular they, it's best to be a bit ironic about it, since you're almost certainly going to be making a hypocrite of yourself before the day is out.

SHAPIRO: Why did you decide to address this issue in such a large scale, public way?
HALIHAN: Well, one of the tricks is - is that you need to get the technical components out in the front. And that's been done in the airline industry. And I talk about if you have a plane crash, they don't want that to happen, but there's a neutral technical group that can look at that and make a call on it. It's difficult in the oil industry because there's not that neutral ref to say, what's the next step? And so I think what we're going to be looking at is, how do we properly address these problems so the public is comfortable, but the energy industry can operate with some certainty? And that balance is something that's difficult in the energy industry because there's no referee.

INSKEEP: He's referring to 15 days of social distancing recommended by the CDC. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo also says a time must come when he loosens his state's tight restrictions, but Cuomo says that's not going to be for a while, as New York's caseload soars. We have an outside evaluation of the administration's response from Ron Klain. He served as the Ebola response coordinator in the Obama administration and is now an adviser to Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Mr. Klain, welcome to the program.
So what will transpire Wednesday should not be regarded as suspenseful with regard to the continuation of the government. That is a done deal. What is still at stake, however, is the attitude of Trump supporters toward the legitimacy of that done deal. As a consequence, there is also an opportunity for individuals in the Republican Party to show their fealty to Trump and thereby endear themselves to his most loyal voters.
She also points out that in recent weeks, many Uber drivers are earning less per ride because the company changed its fare structure.
She's probably the most prolific and foundational person in children's music. And she's a Black woman. But guess what? She's never won a Grammy Award through the Recording Academy process, Freelon says. They had to give her an honorary lifetime achievement award, but she actually never got that recognition from her peers in the industry.
At a very young age, I knew I wanted to be a lawyer. And mostly because the heroes among many of the civil rights movements were the lawyers. These individuals who understood the skill of the profession of law to translate the passion from the streets to courtrooms of our country and do the work that we know must constantly be done of reminding people of that promise we articulated in 1776, that we're all equal and should be treated that way.
You know, I don't even know why you have a side, because you should want to have an accurate election — and you're a Republican, Trump said.
Now her work is on display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City (MoMA) as part of Being: New Photography 2018, an exhibition lasting through August 19.

The fifth edition will be held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in December 2018.
Slovakia Government's Collapse Not Enough To End Protests Over Journalist's Murder
Each of us constitutes a generation. We are the children of our parents who were the children of their parents (your grandparents) who were children of their parents (your great-grandparents).
DAVIES: Right. But I think we as the audience, and, I'm sure, the crew that was filming it, were thinking, oh, my God. We're going to see this...
At this hour, we are still following the developments at the U.S. Capitol. At least one person has died in connection with today's violence by pro-Trump extremists. President Trump has spoken only once since all of this began in his name, posting a video on Twitter, where he urged his followers to leave the Capitol. He also repeated his inaccurate statements about the election that have inflamed so many today and for the last two months. President-elect Joe Biden is calling for calm and criticizing the rhetoric of President Trump, and lawmakers are set to resume the certification process of the Electoral College votes at the Capitol tonight. We're going to talk about all of this now with NPR national political correspondent Mara Liasson.
If I might — it's been clear from some of your public statements that you've found it upsetting that people have portrayed you as a villain or a negative force or someone who has even harmed the president. I know you want to vindicate the president. Do you also continue this because you would like to vindicate yourself?
In between those traumatic touchstones of history, there were other major shocks such as the Cuban missile crisis of October 1962. Suddenly, Americans were on the brink of nuclear confrontation with the Soviet Union, which was delivering the means to launch nuclear weapons from bases 90 miles from Florida. The White House responded, the nation united, and the Soviets pulled back.
GONYEA: A lot of people say Bernie can't beat Trump. Some Democrats say that.
Here are some of the factors identified by the researchers:
Stabilizing a home has all sorts of positive benefits for a family.
KURTIS: She had five right for 10 more points. She now has 12 and the lead.
REUSS: Absolutely. It means that it cannot find in its place to determine that gender-based violence is discrimination.
After getting his GED and taking construction and building classes, Drummond now earns $21 an hour. He's supervising a crew renovating a historic building downtown. He enjoys his work and doesn't feel like a robot anymore. I always say I feel like I was a carpenter in my past life because I can just pick up a tool sometimes and immediately know what it's used for, what to do with it and how to use it.
NINA TOTENBERG: Mr. President, Judge Garland was runner-up twice before. So why now and not twice before?
There is already Oscar talk in Variety magazine - 2021 Oscar talk - for Phyllida Lloyd's new film Herself - small, relatively short film with no big-name stars, no CGI super-natural avengers or warriors, but was a standout at the last Sundance Film Festival. It opens with Sandra, a mother, dancing joyfully in the kitchen with her two young daughters.
SAGAL: It's like what they say about actual children. Don't worry when they make noise, worry when they get really quiet.

As he announced the designation Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused Cuba of repeatedly providing support for acts of international terrorism in granting safe harbor to terrorists.
SAGAL: This is - this is, like, the one strange idea he doesn't have.
KHALID: One common ritual at Biden rallies is the pledge. It's not a tradition for all Democrats.
SHAPIRO: What was the first sign little Jacob gave you that he was going to be shaking things up on the national stage by the age of 9?
For one thing, people are closer to it than you might think, but it's a matter of making sure they're educated properly. A lot of times people maybe bite off more than they can chew. And that's one of the reasons, for instance, that we are now looking at being able to guarantee mortgages on individual condominium units. Because that can frequently be the first step. You buy that kind of home, you build up equity, you save, and then you move to the next step. In 2008, there were so many people who deceived individuals and simply said you've got an ever expanding price here. It's going to be your piggy bank for the rest of your life. And you can always count on that. And look what the results of that were. So we're working to make sure that the education of the people is such that they understand how you go about building that equity, and how you go about making your first, second, third steps to acquiring a home. Because, quite frankly, in America ... the primary source of wealth is home ownership.
SIMON: You've directed some big-budget films with household names - Mamma Mia, The Iron Lady. What drew you to tell this story in this way?
Some census advocates are worried that a citizenship question would deter community groups from helping to promote the census.
While fewer members of the public were there to watch the audit than November's vote count, those who were there said it was still an important step in becoming an informed voter.

KHALID: Battis is 72, and he's not sure someone in their 70s has the energy to be president.
GJELTEN: Nothing at all, actually. He didn't dwell on the attack all that much. He said the killing of Soleimani is a warning that if anyone values their own life, they'd better not threaten American lives. But that was about it. He moved on pretty quickly to focus on the things he sees evangelicals as caring about - social issues, abortion, gun rights. This was a campaign rally. It was billed as the launch of an Evangelicals for Trump coalition for the 2020 election.
REUSS: That was our seed money to begin our women's research center, a women's center and a couple of rooms for battered women.
Black ledger, which purports to be a group of bribes of which Manafort is supposed to have signed for it. And then there was a big press conference held to try to blow it up. And the witnesses who I have say that this was an orchestrated effort to get him to drop out, to show how corrupt his campaign manager was. And they were quite certain they were gonna get him. One operative of the DNC told one of my witnesses the plan in May. It played itself out. And then Mr. Lutsenko, who did it, says this will destroy him. This will get him off the ticket. That was the whole purpose of that. And I think the best evidence of that is the FBI never used it in the Manafort trial. So the FBI knows that it's a stinko document.
For the leader of Venezuela's opposition, time is growing short. Juan Guaido says he is the interim president of Venezuela. An opposition-led legislature says Guaido is to replace Nicolas Maduro, who kept power in a disputed election. President Maduro, though, has shown no sign of stepping down or allowing a new election. And instead, the chief justice of Venezuela's Supreme Court, who is aligned with Maduro, has begun what he calls a preliminary investigation of the opposition leader. Things are getting tense as the opposition prepares big protests. And NPR's Philip Reeves is on the line to tell us about it. Hi there, Philip.
Over the years, victims and their families brought case after case against Backpage — and lost. The website kept convincing judges across the country that Section 230 shielded it from liability for the posts of its users. Major digital-rights groups, including the Center for Democracy and Technology, argued that holding Backpage liable could have chilling effects for social media and other websites.
FRAZIER: Since failing a lead test last year, Pittsburgh's Water and Sewer Authority has been required to find and replace lead service lines, the pipes that take water into houses. Now, the city only has authority to replace the public side of the water line, the part from the curb away from the house.
I'm a woman, and I'm sharing my experience with the world. I can't see myself doing that through a man's body. I feel as though there's a power in the gaze of the woman. Especially in Africa, women are our biggest assets. There's an expression that if you teach something to a man, you teach one person, but if you teach something to a woman, you're teaching the whole society.
And so I'd like to say we're living in interesting times. Maybe the only time in the history of universe when we can - when we know we're living in interesting times. But the more important point is, it suggests that if we're - if they're missing something then, maybe there are key parts of the universe that we're missing now. And while we have this incredible picture that there maybe things that are out there that are going to change it completely. And really that's what makes science so exciting.
Feds To Waive Penalties For Some Who Signed Up Late For Medicare
FLATOW: Good to see how. Let me begin at that end of the table. Steven, let me begin with you. What don't we know?
Mr. TURNER: And when we have so much in front of us to try to understand about the universe - I mean, if you - the metaphor for cosmology right now is that we know a tremendous amount about the universe. And we understand a lot less. And so, some of us feel like we ought to concentrate on our own universe before we imagine a multiverse.

The Census Bureau has been planning to conduct the national head count through July 31. But this week, some Democratic members of Congress have been calling for the counting to be extended.
In recent years, the backlog of immigration court cases in the U.S. has swelled, as processing times lagged. The average case making its way through immigration courts today has been there for 718 days, or almost two years, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which compiles statistics on U.S. immigration. That's up from 430 days a decade ago.
On his new album and on the preceding one, Chesnutt is backed by guitarist Guy Picciotto, formerly of the post-punk band Fugazi, and members of the Montreal band Thee Silver Mt. Zion.
FORDHAM: So pro-abortion rights lawmakers say they hope that they will be able to change it by the end of the year. This is set to allow, among other things, the right to elective abortion in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. In the short term, there are a lot of parties planned in Dublin, but I think there's also a lot of people who are just exhausted by this fight as well.
What becomes dominant is the conspiracy — this overall kind of belief that this is part of some larger plot to seize control, says Carnahan.
We look at the results coming out of the Nevada caucuses, Russia's attempts to interfere in Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign and what to expect from Tuesday's Democratic debate.
Additionally, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed the first possible outbreak in a nursing facility, also in Washington state. This is unrelated to the patient who died.
GATES: Very close to them, yeah, particularly to my mother. When I was a boy, I was closer to my mother than my father. When I became a teenager, my father and I bonded. My father loved sports, and I didn't care about sports that much. I was more of a bookworm. And when I was a young teenager, early adolescence, my father and I connected through the news. He loved the news. And I loved the news. And my brother went off to dental school. So it was just the two of us and my mom, right?
In January 2016, more than five years after the loan to Burlington College was approved, and eight months after Bernie Sanders announced his presidential run, Brady Toensing wrote a letter to the Department of Justice calling for an investigation into the statements Jane Sanders made on the loan application. Toensing served as the Vermont campaign chairman for Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and is the co-chairman of the Vermont Republican Party.

McConnell has blamed Democrats for delaying progress on the bill even as Democrats continued to negotiate with White House officials.
Close to 12,900 dorms had chosen earlier this year to have the bureau drop off paper forms for each of their student residents to fill out individually. Given the chaotic situation at many campuses, however, the bureau is reaching out to the administrators to see if they want to change those plans.
SAGAL: And they had no choice.
It is unclear when the proceedings will resume. The House Sergeant at arms, the top House law enforcement official, told lawmakers earlier that the Capitol has been cleared but the process to ensure that the chamber was ready for the joint session appears to still be ongoing.
The results of the inquiry were damning. According to a summary of the findings of the law firm Pepper Hamilton released by the university in 2016, the investigators discovered a fundamental failure by Baylor to implement Title IX, the federal law that polices sexual violence on campus, as well as the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act.
I just think it's unlikely that we could ever pass it, he said. So I don't want to prioritize that.
All of these people were a tremendous education for me. I stood on the side. And watching from the side, you see not only what their performance is, you see where it comes from. 'Cause you're only a few feet from them. And you hear the audience reaction, and you see the way they play the audience. They have the same material every day, but they play the audience in a different way, depending on what the audience gives them back. And that interaction gives you a clue into the way their brains work.
As Cox read about this ruling, he thought this was exactly the wrong result: How was this amazing new thing — the Internet — going to blossom, if companies got punished for trying to keep things clean? This struck me as a way to make the Internet a cesspool, he says.
SAGAL: OK, Amy, you're up next. Fill in the blank. Following his incitement of the mob that stormed the Capitol, Facebook banned blank indefinitely.
Economist Derek Scissors at the American Enterprise Institute says retailers, banks and other service providers aren't likely to be targeted. And, he says, he hopes the singling out of individual companies will stop once Trump takes office.
A lot of people when they think about virtual anything, they do make that comparison of say an Amazon.com versus a Barnes & Noble. We at Khan Academy, we never viewed it that way. We view the virtual as something that can empower the physical — that if students can get lectures at their own time and pace, they can get exercises, they can have a programming platform, that doesn't mean that the classroom gets replaced; it means the classroom gets liberated. It doesn't have to be about a lecture anymore; students don't have to learn at the same time and pace. Classroom time could be much more about Socratic dialogue, building projects, whatever else. So we wanted to prove it out. We've been working with a lot of great schools who have been doing aspects of this, but we started a lab underneath our offices, literally, where we have mixed age, it's full-year, full-day. The students do mastery-based, personalized learning for kind of the first half of the day. We have a lot of focus on kind of meta-cognitive skills like entrepreneurship and creativity. The second half of the day — and they're here until 6 o'clock — they're building stuff, they're making things.
JEFFREY LEWIS: This is really the oldest, best-known nuclear facility in all of North Korea.
GATES: Well, I was on The View. And one of the, you know, wonderful people on The View said did I think that Donald Trump is racist. I said, well, I've never met Donald Trump. And I think that we throw terms like that around too loosely. So I would say, you know, no, I don't think so. I have a couple black friends - I went to Yale with Ben Carson and with Ben's wife. I mean, they know Donald Trump. Armstrong Williams, a person I really admire and like, I ask him, and he said absolutely not.
Researchers are checking now on the folks vaccinated in the Pfizer and Moderna trials for antibodies showing that they've been infected. It's not a perfect measure, Corey notes, because the antibody tests aren't always accurate and antibodies can be transient. Moderna officials have hinted that their vaccine prevents some shedding, but they haven't been specific on how much. Some people who volunteered for the vaccine studies will be checked for evidence of the virus itself.

Bernie Sanders is really building this political revolution all the way up and down the ballot, said Matt Blizek, MoveOn.org's electoral field director. His entire campaign, the mantra has been 'not me, us.'
The slowing of the rate is enormously important, says Jewell. Ultimately, you will end up with a smaller fraction of the population infected if you lower the rate. And you buy a lot of time by slowing it and that gives an opportunity for preparation by hospitals and health care workers.
GJELTEN: And it is true, Leila, they did choose this church. It's Rey Jesus Church, the King Jesus Church. The pastor here, Guillermo Maldonado - Apostle Maldonado, as he likes to be called - is himself from Honduras. Many of his parishioners are Latino. In fact, I'd say at least half the people at this rally were Hispanic. And that's a change from other Trump rallies where it's been largely a white audience. Many Hispanic evangelicals are fairly conservative on social issues, and the Trump campaign would like their support. Florida is a swing state, and Hispanic evangelicals are swing voters.
Change of subject. Ukraine. Do you owe Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch an apology?
So we've been engaged in deep diplomatic efforts since the first day of the Trump administration. We've built out a coalition that is working together — Gulf states, Israel, many European countries — to deliver on the three central outcomes that we're looking for.
These [measures] work. We've not seen the type of transmissible infections that we would normally be seeing — RSV, rhinovirus, influenza, metapneumovirus. In trying to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, we've also prevented the transmission of these other seasonal viruses that cause asthma exacerbations, Schroeder says.
MOORE: That's right. Boy, you've read the book, haven't you?
And the other thing we see is that he hasn't been able to convince Americans that there's actually a crisis on the border. That hasn't worked mostly because the people who are coming across are applying for asylum. That's a legal process, and it wouldn't be stopped by a wall.

We are grateful to Bloomberg Philanthropies for this generous contribution, UNFCCC Executive Secretary Patricia Espinosa said in a news release about the funding pledge.
I don't think so. I can't imagine they were thinking about a TED Talk at the time. And so, I think it's important to distinguish between the regional, narrow, a little dry paper that came out in 2010, that Dana's talking about and then the TED Talk, which is inspired by that study but also talks a lot by Amy Cuddy's personal experiences. I think of that talk of more a motivational speaker, more than a scientific presentation.
RICKETTS: I own a yoga studio out here and like to enjoy the outdoors, too.
But some supporters here are still hopeful.
The decisions come as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to climb. Packed public gatherings such as political rallies could pose a particular risk of virus transmission, although so far there's no sign that's taken place.

About once a week, Border Patrol agents come across migrant groups of 100 people or more in some of the most isolated parts of the Southwest border. In Arizona, the number of migrant families and children crossing the border more than doubled last year, straining resources in the U.S. and Mexico.
PERALTA: Protesters have once again taken to the streets. But they have stopped short of calling for the ouster of the government. Ali says that's because unlike when Bashir was in power, Sudanese right now have hope that things can change.
GARCETTI: Exactly. And so I think, you know, we have so many incredible stories. And because Los Angeles is half Latino now, we have, I think, the opportunity to really make that sort of impact.
Consumers who disagree with a health plan's decision to deny benefits or payment for services can appeal the decision to an independent review panel.
When women use these products, it comes from a very deeply ingrained place of insecurity, Ali says. It's because of what society pushes on us to believe. Across all cultures, darker-skinned people have self-esteem issues.

Operation Warp Speed is a great example of how these companies can do a very difficult thing if we incentivize it and we remove the risk, and we give them the right publicity, frankly, to make this worth their while.
Lawyers for Trump have accused Democrats of trying to invalidate the result of the 2016 election. They say Trump has not committed any crime and therefore cannot be removed from office, even though many legal scholars say a law need not be broken to secure an impeachment conviction that would remove a president from office.

Our new rule recognizes this relationship and strikes the proper balance between Washington, D.C., and the states, he added. And it clearly details which waters are subject to federal control under the Clean Water Act and, importantly, which waters falls solely under the states' jurisdiction.
In that vein, the proposal stresses that it aims to meet its ambitious goals while paying special attention to groups like the poor, disabled and minority communities that might be disproportionately affected by massive economic transitions like those the Green New Deal calls for.
A second priority, Turpin said, is to continue work that began in earnest last year to make greater use of the public radio network by more closely tying local stations to the national newsroom through a series of regional reporting hubs. The first is expected to launch in March, with another two coming later in the year. If it works, he said, the initiative will improve local, regional and national journalism. (There are major challenges to this work, as NPR and the stations work on common editorial standards to guide their work. I'll have more on that initiative in an upcoming column, but Turpin acknowledged, It's not going to be easy.)
It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but more really a question of when it will happen — and how many people in this country will have severe illness, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told reporters during a briefing.

NGUYEN: Well, they were part of a great migration of about 800,000 North Vietnamese Catholics who had been persuaded by their parish priests that the communists were going to massacre them or at the very least persecute them. And that idea had been promulgated by the CIA, by Col. Edward Lansdale who became famous for helping the Philippines suppress a communist insurgency in the 1950s and then he brought his talents to South Vietnam. And he became the inspiration - so it was rumored - for Alden Pyle in Graham Greene's The Quiet American. So that was the history behind why my parents had decided to flee. And they came from a region in North Vietnam that was famous for producing hard-core revolutionaries like Ho Chi Minh, who was born 30 minutes from their home village. And it was a region famous for producing hard-core Catholics, and so my parents were among the hard-core Catholics.
MCCLURG: But the Christmas wave is just beginning to hit. A New Year's surge is still a few weeks away, and many cold months lie ahead before the vaccine slows the virus.
Executive orders and memorandums are often conflated. In the last few administrations, particularly since the Clinton years, presidents started using the two interchangeably, says Cooper.
Paul Pakusch Courtesy of Paul Pakusch At age 53 I lost my job after 32 years of working in a TV station control room. I took a job as a school bus driver so I could have summers off with my teacher/wife. I found out I love the job! Who would have thought I'd love driving a big ol' bus with a bunch of screaming kids? Ha ha! Anyways, the bigger success is the business I started for myself as a wedding officiant; marrying people! I took the script-writing-and-reading skills from my years of broadcasting and turned them into something where I could be a part of a major lifetime event for people. I love doing it! It turns out there's a lot of demand for what I am able to offer couples who are getting married outside of a traditional church. I officiated 21 weddings in my first year, and now have close to 30 weddings booked for 2016! Between these two jobs, I hardly feel like I am working and I look forward to what I am doing every day!
The Trump administration is making several big changes to its COVID-19 vaccine distribution strategy, officials announced Tuesday, in a bid to jump-start the rollout and get more Americans vaccinated quickly.

So, David, an example of this is the rapidity with which a vaccine has been developed and has started in phase one trials. That's a very rapid timetable that's taken place. And with respect to the other issue, again, we really can't speculate, we have to have facts. And when you ask me a question, I have to be certain of my answer. And that doesn't mean that people aren't working on this. That doesn't mean that around the clock efforts aren't being made. What I can't do, what's one of the worst things that you can do in a medical situation that's urgent is to provide information that isn't accurate. So I'm not going to do that because I don't think that that's right for the American people. But I want to assure the American people that the FDA and this all-of-government approach, frankly, all-of-America approach, really working hard 24/7. Lots of scientists and researchers and doctors and nurses and pharmacists are on this effort.
In 2009, while he was still in debt from paying for inmates' food, Entrekin told the Times that he personally thought the law needed to be changed. But he noted that it might cost more money for taxpayers if the county commission had to manage jail kitchens through an open bid process.

Sexual assault during hajj is not a new phenomenon. It's clearly happening and has been happening, but we don't know how widespread this is, says Rothna Begum, the women's rights researcher for the Middle East and North Africa for Human Rights Watch.

Cox argues that websites that are involved in soliciting unlawful materials or connected to unlawful activity should not be immune under Section 230. Congress should revisit the law, he says, and make the statute longer and make it crystal clear.
Like any White House budget, Trump's blueprint is more of a political document than an accurate predictor of government spending. Congress controls the purse strings and lawmakers may have very different priorities. As a statement of presidential intention, though, the blueprint is crystal clear.

We know from polling, including NPR's polling, that his approval rating was starting to slip with white, working-class voters who are the core of his base. And we know that in every shutdown - shutdowns end because one side reaches their pain threshold first. In this case, it was the Republicans and Donald Trump. Maybe it was the long lines at the airport, that angry video statement from the FBI director or all those Senate Republicans who were starting to jump ship. But he had a weak hand and played it poorly. And his base is angry at him.

But Trump and Cruz have been sinking, and Cruz really got hit, I thought, in the debate. And Rubio and some of the others have been rising. Even Ben Carson has been rising. And so I think if that momentum continues, it may not look as clean as a Cruz-Trump race as it does right now.

The real villains are the ongoing effects of racism, inequality, greed, anti-intellectualism, and even laissez-faire neoliberal capitalism.

Wara added, What California urgently needs and wants from its utilities right now is hard thinking about how to better protect communities from fire. And it's hard to see that going on.
Manzoor: My brother's academic pursuits were really encouraged and he knew all of the capitals of the world and he was in every single sports team. ... The lessons that I was getting was on not getting fat and my academic pursuits, they just weren't really encouraged. It was like, If you're good at something, it's fine, but it wasn't something that was considered that she's going to be a leader. My brother was going to be the leader and take over the world, and I just had to remain beautiful.

BRYANT: Yeah, she's the main draw, and that's the big thing. Obviously, Maria Sharapova coming back from suspension - I think the WTA could use that. But let's face it, both American tennis and the WTA has been dreading the day that Venus and Serena are no longer there because they are what makes the game go. But it's a great sport.

Nunes and Gowdy had been requesting secret information from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein for months about the Russia investigation, and he had resisted. Nunes threatened to try to impeach Rosenstein or hold him in contempt of Congress. The deputy attorney general relented after Trump's demand that the Justice Department comply.

Pelosi garnered 216 votes Sunday, seven more than the 209 for House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy of California.
But it's not that the government can't make you say anything you don't want to, says Professor Goldman: There are plenty of circumstances where the government mandates people to speak — for example, you have to put the nutrition label on your can of food if you want to sell that food into the economy.
I think they have to take a look long and hard at what role has their political spending played in sort of the buildup to this crisis, said Bruce Freed, the head of the Center for Political Accountability.
In 2020, Burke says, expect to see more satellite-based software tools move out of research labs and into the hands of aid agencies and policymakers. And although today most of the images come from satellites owned by the U.S. and the European Union, more may soon come from satellites operated by developing countries — including Ethiopia's first observatory satellite, launched in late December. — Tim McDonnell
LIASSON: I think some of the dynamic on that has changed a bit because he took a big hit with his base this week. He went into a macho standoff and lost to Madam Speaker. And some of his base is angry with him because they think he had no strategy. They think he wimped out. And don't forget this was a kind of two-step capitulation. First, he played brinksmanship (ph) on the State of the Union address, then retreated on that. And Nancy Pelosi had a strategy. As she reportedly told a group of columnists this week, she says, you start with a feather. Then you get to the sledgehammer. So her Art Of The Deal was smarter and more strategic than the president's. His critics say his strategy was more whining than winning.
I recall being behind the scenes in a Ford campaign kind of boiler room when the campaign delegate counters led by Jim Baker, later secretary of state, were befuddled by delegates who were asking for favors, says Compton. One was a delegate from New York who wanted a federal judgeship for his brother — a serious request in return for his vote for Gerald Ford. He didn't get it.
SAGAL: Hey, Sarah. How are you?
At their victory news conference following the vote, Democratic leaders gave a place of honor to John Dingell (D-MI), the House's longest-serving member. Dingell followed his father into a Detroit-area House seat in 1955 and like his father has introduced universal health legislation throughout his career.

I mean, he was a unique character. No one had ever seen anybody like him as a continuing role in a series. And people were mistaking him for the character he played, which is so often true for those of us in television. And they would - and of course both their - the first name was the same Ted, Ted. And they were calling him stupid and, oh, you're the funniest dumbbell we ever met. And, boy, are you dumb and stupid, and somebody called him a dumb schmuck.

While government funding remains vital, Espinosa said, this kind of support is crucial for the work of the Secretariat to assist nations in their efforts to implement their commitments under the Paris Climate Change Agreement.
I think so. So maybe the scientific foundation was exaggerated or over perceived. But I think it's useful to keep those two separate, so Dana Carney and Amy Cuddy have thought of this from different perspectives; one much more basic science, the other much more in terms of giving advice.

In choosing that particular group of people - there were 16 in all - I saw 200 people, and I spent my time not auditioning them but talking to them and trying to discourage them from coming into my class because what I did in the class demanded a certain kind of allegiance and diligence and tenacity and hard work.
But first, we want to talk about politics and specifically, immigration reform, which is often viewed as a top priority of Latino voters. It's also been on the mind of President Obama, who said late last week that he was ready to make it a priority.

But Rendell thinks that Trump's outside-the-box antics will also turn off moderate Republican voters — particularly Republican women — in the populous suburban counties surrounding Philadelphia. I think he will wind up, my guess is, losing more of those type of Republicans than he gains in blue-collar Democrats, Rendell said.
Rolón points out that while the bilingual market is growing, Latinos tend to gravitate towards the Spanish ESPN Deportes network for sports like fútbol, soccer, and English ESPN for American football despite the complex overlap in the bilingual audience. That, Rolón says, is the result of each English or Spanish side of the network having cultivated more expertise through a longer history of covering the two different sports.
A House Democratic aide said the package was valued at $2.5 trillion and focused on boosting healthcare access, unemployment insurance, the healthcare industry and payments to workers, among other issues. Pelosi has not said whether the House would move forward with its proposal. The chamber could take up the Senate bill if more changes are made to it that satisfy Democrats' concerns.
The remaining four Republican candidates debate once again tonight, this time in Miami. Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich will be on the stage together for the last time before next Tuesday's big primary night, when voters in Ohio and Florida — Rubio and Kasich's home states — go to the polls. Tuesday is a make or break night for the two of them and tonight's debate is the last chance they have to change the dynamic in a race that has not been going their way.
And as far as the activists, we're just going to see them keep pushing the envelope when someone's killed by police, like they did this week. One activist who's been involved for years, Nekima Levy Armstrong, was telling us that she's pleased the city is taking the steps of releasing the body camera footage more quickly. But that by itself doesn't make up for decades of mistrust.
One attendee, freshman Hunter Frybergh, 14, said he survived the attack by hiding in a closet at the school.

BEARDSLEY: Yeah, absolutely. President Macron said this week on television he had no doubt that chemical weapons were used. And today, the French foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian, spoke, and he said they have undeniable proof of chemical weapons use from French intelligence sources on the ground, from independent medical sources, as well as photos and satellite images. And in fact, he says it's all published. It's on the Internet under the French presidency's website so you can see it. And he said that the mission starting work today is really late. He said the Russians repeatedly vetoed the use of another monitoring group that had confirmed the use of chemical weapons last year, Scott. They were very effective. They were already, you know, nearly on the ground, and they could have quickly gone in. The Russians continuously vetoed that.
He put Hunter Biden on the board to pay off the bribe. He made a deal with Biden --
Using the Rolleiflex, Claire went to work. She knelt to make the two scientists look larger and more dramatic in the photos.

So far the evidence suggests that poor people who received this cash aid mainly used it to meet short-term needs — like giving their families enough food each day — rather than finding ways to lift themselves out of poverty in a permanent way. But these families were also able to give their children more schooling. And now that the kids are aging into the workforce, it will become clear whether the extra education translates into enough additional income to vault this next generation out of poverty. If so, says Evans, that will be an exciting thing to find. — Nurith Aizenman

We know that neighborhoods that have more evictions have higher violent crime rates the following year. You can understand why — it rips apart the fabric of a community. We pay for that. The top 5 percent of hospital users consume 50 percent of the health care costs. Guess who those people are? They're the homeless and unstably housed. And so I think we can spend smart or we can spend stupid, and so I think addressing the affordable housing crisis is a win for families, for landlords and for the taxpayer.

I don't think that that should happen, and I don't think that that could happen. Because we are the two largest economies in the world. We are so interconnected, so interdependent. And this interdependence has worked in the interests of both countries. Both economies, both peoples have benefited a great deal from such growing economic ties. Why should anybody try to cut it off, to have this so-called decoupling?
Over the weekend, judges snuffed out a particularly quixotic bid by Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas and a group of Trump supporters from Arizona. In their lawsuit, they alleged that Vice President Pence has the power to accept or reject the Electoral College results from individual states.
That manuscript, which reportedly contains dozens of pages on Trump's dealing with Ukraine, has loomed over this week's Senate impeachment trial sessions. That is because the book purportedly says Trump told Bolton that military assistance to Ukraine would be released only after Ukraine opened investigations into Trump's Democratic rivals — the allegation at the heart of Trump's impeachment and the proceedings in the Senate.
And so his belief is that he can somehow try to subvert this ministry of propaganda, this vast war epic that is going to continue to kill Vietnamese people in a cinematic fashion, which is simply the prelude to actually killing Vietnamese people in real life. So he believes that he can try to make a difference. And, of course, the humor and the tragedy is that he can't.

There were - you know, he wanted to do away with superdelegates. There were some people who wanted to do - away with superdelegates and wanted to change the rules.

A spokesman for the Sanders family says the investigation is part of a politically motivated attack designed to hurt the Vermont senator's political career, but that hasn't stopped investigators from requesting documents and conducting interviews with former Burlington College officials.
We'll see shortly what that is or whether it is even true. Still, Trump's posture doesn't appear to be one through which a deal has been made. In fact, he tweeted Friday that any DACA deal must include building a wall with Mexico and ending both chain migration and the visa lottery system.
Johnson said it wasn't until the very end of their interrogation that the brothers decided to confess. It wasn't until the 47th hour of their 48-hour hold time — that we could legally hold them in custody — that it took a change, Johnson said, adding that it was at that point that the brothers implicated Smollett.
But thousands also bought A Higher Loyalty wondering how much Comey could tell about another FBI probe, this one into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server for official business while secretary of state. Questions of what she might have been hiding dogged her campaign throughout 2016, even after Comey recommended against prosecution (for her incredibly careless behavior). Comey's decision to reopen that probe just weeks before the election, albeit briefly, may have contributed to her narrow loss to Trump.

She had her opportunities in the first set. She was up 5-4, had two set points and did not convert, ended up not winning another game. She lost 7-5, 6-0, had an opportunity at the beginning of the second set. But Muguruza was just too good. And, sometimes, we want the results. We want the results more than we want the game itself. And it really is a fantastic effort by Muguruza because she did not let Venus back into this match. She saw a championship in front of her, and she took it.

Instead of providing aid to improve health and foster economic development, Konyndyk says there's a growing mentality in the U.S. that aid can be used as a goody bag to incentivize foreign leaders to fall in line. Examples include Trump's freezing and reinstatement of aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2019 based on their immigration policies; his threats to cut off countries that don't vote with the U.S. at the United Nations; and his withdrawal of aid to Palestinians to pressure them to reconsider his peace plan.

DOUCLEFF: Yeah. So scientists first detected this new variant, like you said, in the U.K. back in September. By December, it had become the dominant one in London. And it is responsible for the huge surge in cases there now. This variant has also spread to at least 32 other countries. And right now, here in the U.S., scientists think it's still pretty uncommon. But they believe that could change pretty fast, like in the next month or two, because they estimate the variant is about 50% more transmissible than the previous ones.

You all have kind of touched on it a little bit, but, you know, from the early onset, there were scientists that you just spoke about who saw these huge plumes. So it's proven scientific fact.

I have not been shy in my criticisms of Josh Hawley, either in public or in private. This was a terrible, terrible idea.

Just one other thing to ask about, Ambassador. I'm sure that you follow the president's impeachment and acquittal here in the United States. And there was a part of this that touched on China. The president was criticized for seeking investigation of a political rival, Joe Biden, in Ukraine. When he was criticized for this, he said that was correct, that he sought that investigation and urged China also to investigate Joe Biden or his son, Hunter Biden, for investments that he was involved in in China.What did your government make of that remark?

President Trump's tough talk on renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada has raised many questions — including how such a move might negatively affect the flow of beloved produce to the U.S.
KHALID: She says the country needs someone who can quickly clean up Trump's mess and doesn't need on-the-job training. Biden's age, she feels, could be an asset.

PFEIFFER: Because defense lawyers for the 9/11 defendants want the judge to throw out all the statements they made to the FBI on grounds that are tainted by torture. And the lawyers want to use Mitchell's testimony to help support their argument. Now, I had assumed much of his testimony would be censored because almost anything related to torture used to be top secret. And in Guantanamo's courtroom, reporters sit in a spectator gallery behind a glass wall. And we listen to what's happening on a 40-second delay. If anything is said the government doesn't want us to hear, the sound is cut off, and white noise is piped in. So I expected that cut off would be triggered a lot when Mitchell was on the stand.

Claire turned. A doctor in an unbuttoned white coat stood before her. He was about six feel tall, lean, with brown hair brushed back, and steel-rimmed glasses. He wore a conservative tie, buttoned-down oxford shirt, and a dark suit beneath the white coat. A stethoscope was draped around his neck. He held a clipboard and a three-ring binder. He was in his late thirties, Claire judged from the lines around his eyes. His face had an open, boyish handsomeness, yet the hard set of his shoulders revealed his disapproval. Nurse Brockett stood like a sentinel behind him. In the light from the river, the doctor's eyes were deep blue. At five foot eight, Claire could almost look him in the eye, an advantage.

So, yes, the policing did not work. It both failed to protect the Capitol and used what I think is probably unnecessarily deadly force against people. It was a double failure. And then to the take away from that the message that, well, we just need to do more of that seems misguided. What we need is a real national reckoning about political responsibility for this mess we're in. And I think we're starting to move in that direction.

Last evening, lawmakers resumed deliberations, and several Republicans backed off their baseless challenges. But Republican Josh Hawley of Missouri persisted.
ESPUELAS: I disagree with that only because I'm a pragmatist, and, at the end of the day, Congress has to pass laws in order for the president to sign it. And he can give as many speeches as he wants. At the end of the day, if the House of Representatives does not take up the Senate immigration bill, modify it, do whatever they want with it, but take it up and have a vote, there is no bill to sign. And no amount of speechifying on the part of the president will really change that dynamic. So, at the end of the day, Boehner has to open up the floor of the House to an open vote. There will be an almost unanimous Democratic support for it and probably about 30 percent of Republicans will support it, as well. It will pass. The president will sign it. We'll be done with this issue. Eduardo will have a path toward citizenship, and our country will be better for it.

KHALID: Biden's campaign speech is about character, country and unity. It's about aspiring to a better time. He doesn't mention his Democratic rivals by name. Biden mostly talks about President Trump as if he's the only opponent. He is the former vice president. And he readily mentions Barack Obama's name, plus his own experience on health care, foreign policy and gun control. But more than policy, his speech is an appeal to morality.

Though in his announcement Trump referred to himself as someone who cares deeply about the environment, he has signaled, more broadly, that fighting climate change is not a priority for his administration. He has denied the existence of climate change and appointed as the head of the EPA a man who doesn't accept the overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming by releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. And he has already overturned several Obama-era efforts to reduce emissions.

Is doing something—anything—better than doing nothing? Here's another case that confirms how much we don't like doing nothing. Back in 80s, an airport in Houston was getting a lot of complaints about how long it took their baggage to arrive at the pick-up carousel. The vice president conducted studies, brought in consultants, and even hired more baggage handlers so that the wait time never exceeded eight minutes (an industry standard). Still, the complaints kept coming. Then the airport tried something interesting. They moved the gate farther away from baggage pickup so that fliers were walking most of the eight minutes rather than standing beside the carousel. The complaints stopped.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., think they have a start to a solution. Thursday they are introducing a framework defining what they call a Green New Deal — what they foresee as a massive policy package that would remake the U.S. economy and, they hope, eliminate all U.S. carbon emissions.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: The history of violence against women is as old as history itself. It shows up in human remains and in the laws. Hammurabi's Code is one of the first sets of written laws and dates back to the 1700s B.C., the age of ancient Mesopotamia. There are laws in there saying men were allowed to use violence against their wives in certain situations. For instance, if a woman was caught cheating or left her husband, she could be tied up and drowned.

EDMUNDS: The classic corals of the Caribbean you might have seen there in the 1950s, 1960s would've been towering elkhorn and staghorn corals and beautiful, massive star corals. And unfortunately, those are the corals that have suffered particularly acutely from diseases and rising temperature and previous storms. But in their place are corals that are growing that are a more weedy species in the sense that - of a weed in your garden. They're small. They're perhaps a little drab. There's lots of them. They grow fast. And they die fast, as well. But they are a shadow of the kind of corals that used to be found there 50 years ago.

Newsom takes office Monday, bringing to the state capital a very different style and set of priorities. Journalists often referred to Gov. Jerry Brown as the adult in the room when he huddled with legislators to close their differences. It was not a label legislators much cared for.
If we were still back at the forage quality that we would've had 25 years ago, no less 100 years ago, our animals would be gaining a lot more weight, Craine says.

WOOD JR: Yeah. I think the difference between Southern racism and Northern racism is that in the South, you know where you stand. And there's - I don't want to say a freedom in that. But when you know where the boundaries are, then you kind of know how to play the game a little bit more. So if someone's going to openly say, I don't like you people, and I'm going to hang a flag over my door to remind you I don't like you people, then I know not to eat at that business.

The new Seafood Watch database, which took two years to design, assigns slavery risk ratings to specific fisheries and was developed in collaboration with Liberty Asia and the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership. Like Seafood Watch's color-coded ratings, the Seafood Slavery Risk Tool aims to keep it simple — a set criteria determines whether a fishery will earn a critical, high, moderate or low risk rating.

Let's head overseas for a moment now to the African nation of Uganda. With an average age of 17, the country has one of the youngest populations in the world. That means most voters who'll go to the polls tomorrow to elect a leader have only known one president - Yoweri Museveni, who's been in power for 35 years. His rival, a singer-turned-politician who is half his age, has electrified young people, as NPR's Eyder Peralta reports.
Abortion was illegal in Ireland long before the Eighth Amendment was voted into the constitution through a public referendum in 1983. But Catholic groups sought to solidify the provisions after Roe v. Wade made abortion in the United States legal in the 1970s.

The writers of the Constitution decided to have the reported and sealed ballots from the electors (who meet and vote in their respective states) delivered to the seat of government and entrusted to the president of the Senate — who's also the vice president of the United States. The ballots remain sealed until the vice president opens them on the designated day and hands them to tellers to read out and tally.

The Biden administration could remove or rewrite the rule, but it would take months, if not years. Because the rule gives the EPA administrator the power to override the limits on which scientific studies EPA regulators can use, the incoming administration could essentially sidestep the rule while it works to undo it.

But 50 years ago, young kids were pretty much the same. I interviewed Fred Rogers a few times over the years, and one time I asked him about the secret of his success — why his slow, deliberate manner of relating to children, and why seeming to look at them and talk to them directly through the TV lens, connected so strongly with young viewers. This is what he told me:

FORDHAM: Well, understandably, they're disappointed. And most people didn't really want to talk, although I did speak to one man who said he'd worked all his life as a teacher with severely disabled children. He said he was proud to have voted the way that he had, and he wished there could've been a compromise. But, you know, Scott, he didn't seem hugely surprised. He said he felt like Ireland was going through a huge social change. And that fits with what other people I've spoken to have said.

The son got China, have the Bank of China become a partner with him and a $1.5 billion fund. And the partners were Hunter Biden, Devon Archer, Chris Heinz, the son of the secretary of state. The Bank of China, the son of the vice president and the son of the secretary of state, when we are having contentious discussions with China, our partners with the government-owned Bank of China — can you imagine if Donald Trump Jr. was a partner with the Bank of China, how angry he would be at me? And rather than putting me on the defensive, what you would say: It was pretty brilliant for you to discover that. Well, I didn't discover that. Peter Schweizer discovered it. And I'm gonna tell you who the third partner is, which makes it even more incredible that the press covers this up. The third partner was Whitey Bulger's nephew.

Others point to the Hindu caste system as an impetus. Though outlawed in 2001, caste discrimination is still widely practiced, particularly in rural Nepal, where people on the lower rungs suffer systematic abuse passed on between generations. Many converts come from these lower castes, and missionaries point to Christianity as a way to escape. It's the only way out, says Fallesen. Socially there's nothing they can do to change that and then we come along and we share about Jesus and the love he has for them. The system still exists, Fallesen says, but no longer has power over them.

Einstein's General Theory of Relativity became a new theory of gravity, superseding Issac Newton's. Not that Newton's theory was wrong, far from it. We use it all the time, including when we send rockets to outer space. But Einstein's works better in strong gravity. In science, works better means gives better results, closer to observations. And it does so by making an amazing conceptual leap: that gravity can be interpreted as the curvature of space around an object; the more massive the object, the more curved the space around it. So, close to a star, space is more curved than close to you. Also, it's not just space; time is affected, too, ticking slower the stronger gravity is.
The statement calls for the creation of an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states.
Claire hadn't looked through a microscope since she took a required biology course as a college freshman. She didn't want to disappoint the doctor or embarrass herself by making a mistake.

His close physical presence stirred her.

Patti's mom, Barb, isn't anywhere near as cruel or monstrous, just drunk and irresponsible. Most evenings she storms into the karaoke bar where her daughter works, downs several shots and sings a lovely quavering solo, only to end the night with her head over a toilet. Played in a blistering sweet-and-sour performance by the New York cabaret legend Bridget Everett, Barb once longed to be a singer. But she disdains Patti's dreams of stardom, claiming that rap isn't really music anyway.

According to a paper published in the journal Physical Review Letters, the two black holes were each roughly 30 times the mass of the sun. They merged some 1.3 billion light years from Earth. The waves were generated in the final moments before the black holes merged. The signal was brief but definitive.

And it's one of the songs that wrecks a room. I mean, it was like you could just hear everybody's heart break, and we were all stunned, including, like, the guys who run the record label that puts the record out. And we were all just like man, you know, it really set us back on our heels.

so it's more subtle, this animus towards African-Americans, but it's animus nonetheless. So they'll ask questions like the Irish and the Italians and Jews faced discrimination but worked their way up to success. African-Americans should do the same. And you agree, or you disagree? And so agreeing with that sentiment would be an indication of racial resentment.

You know, I'm not concerned at all. I'm not. I wasn't concerned from the very beginning if he flipped because he doesn't know anything. I know this sounds — you'll find out this is true. I'd do anything wrong. I did what a lawyer is supposed to do for his client. And I am a dogged, 24-hour-day investigator when I get on something. So I may have done it with more enthusiasm and with more intensity, but everything I did I can completely justify. All the allegations in the newspaper I laugh at. I'm not a foreign agent for any government. Never have been. They try to take the work that I do, security work that I do for countries and try to change it into my being a foreign agent. And most of those countries are cities, not countries. They try to take my representation occasionally of a foreigner as I'm a foreign agent. There's an exception in FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] for being a defense lawyer. I know the law. I follow it. I respect it. I love it. So I'm not worried about that. I'm not worried about it now at all because he's lied so often. He's made himself a useless witness. I mean, I don't know who's representing him, but you don't – and here's just a little lesson on representing criminal defendants that come from somebody who's been involved in this – I've been practicing law for 50 years.

FLATOW: But don't we have photons in this room colliding all the time?
Lately, the front-runner has been trying to appear more presidential, holding news conferences instead of rallies after his primary wins to project more gravitas. In the last debate, he announced that he was flexible and would change his positions if necessary in order to break the gridlock in Washington. But that was just minutes before — and after — he talked about the size of his hands and a certain part of his anatomy. So we're not sure which Trump will show up tonight — the one who calls his opponents stupid, fat, losers, or the one who promised on Tuesday night: I can be more presidential than anybody other than the great Abe Lincoln. He was very presidential, right?

In other words, Comey the first-time author, renowned for his height (6 feet, 8 inches) and high-mindedness, stood at the nexus of two issues that may have determined the fates of Trump, Clinton and the nation in the 2016 election. No wonder everyone wanted to know what he knew.
GROSS: Well, you kind of work that out a little bit in your new novel because the main character, the spy, after the fall of Saigon when he comes to the U.S., he ends up being an advisor on a film called The Hamlet, that's very much modeled on Apocalypse Now. It's like your fictional version of Apocalypse Now. And in the acknowledgments for your book, you mention, like, a whole bunch of, like, books and movies that you, like, read or watched that have to do with Apocalypse Now. So your spy is, like, an advisor on this movie. What is expected of him?

I think we need to change rules that allow people to be fundraising while the Senate is in session. You know, I'm a fan of term limits. I don't think the idea of constantly trying to get these feedback loops and make politics the center of kind of horse race rage, addiction, social media stuff, I don't think any of that is healthy. So the fundraising is gross. I want to ban cameras in committee rooms. Not audio — I want the American people to have transparency. But I want to end the constant grandstanding that drives so much of our politics at present.
And in fact, inflation or not, there are regions of the universe right now that are expanding away from us faster than the speed of light. Locally - in fact, in general relativity, you can be moving at the speed of light and still be standing still. You're doing it now, in this room, you know? I'm moving -unless you had a lot of coffee, you're not moving very fast. But relative to a radio audience at the other end of the universe, which isn't moving fast in their local surroundings, we're moving away at the speed of light.
The trip itself was almost derailed by coronavirus fears, and mixed signals about what was happening created an on-again, off-again drama that played out in front of television cameras. The chaotic impression clashed with the White House quest to show that the public health crisis is under control.

So what we did was, we were able to use - once we'd located where the den was, we used remote cameras so that the cameraman was able to approach and put a camera on a long, super-extended tripod. And on that tripod was a camera with a number of remote servers on it which allowed him to pan, and tilt, and zoom and change the exposure. And then that was wirelessly connected to a control panel, which he was then able to retreat off to some distance away and then just leave it. Because if you would try to do it in a hide, or a blind, as you guys call it, that would be too disturbing.

One of the recurring sections, The Blue Chair, is a stirring exploration of Owusu succumbing to — and also embracing — the kind of breakdown that might sound terrifying to some but alluring, even necessary, to others. She spent a week almost exclusively in a blue rocking chair she'd found on the street and lugged up to her apartment in Chinatown, New York. It reminded her of her father — and it became a haven. She read, and she wailed, and she ate a little and drank a lot of alcohol during that week. She became a body that needed only some, very particular things that she allowed herself, especially as her mind was turning over all that she no longer had, the certainties and homes and lands and languages and parents she had lost. Owusu's depiction of this breakdown is not about redemption or even strictly about healing. It's instead about a reckoning with the self, with memory, with the stories that she thought could keep her safe.

I belong to a generation of Americans for whom the idea of not only a royal wedding but a royal marriage was largely established by Charles and Diana, the Prince and Princess of Wales. Their staid ceremony and their seemingly joyless marriage (aside from the births of their children) made marrying into the royal family look less like a fantasy than like a march into oblivion — a grudgingly accepted transformation into a wealthy but hollowed-out target for photographers hoping to catch you at your worst.

Twenty percent of kids were in charters at the time this effort started, and within a year or two, 40 percent of children will be in charters. And in Newark, that's an improvement for kids because the charter schools in Newark dramatically outperform the district schools, even though statewide, that's not true of charter schools, and nationally, it's not. But Newark has, you know, a very superior group of charter schools that are doing, you know, a lot of good work with kids.

Dershowitz said if a president does not act out of purely a corrupt motive, but rather has a mixed motive, meaning a president is acting of the country's interest and in hopes of improving reelection prospects, then the behavior cannot warrant articles of impeachment.
The court disagreed, but for an unexpected reason: Prodigy moderated posts, cleaning up foul language. And because of that, the court treated Prodigy like a newspaper liable for its articles.

The bottom line is that there has not been a coherent argument presented. The real argument is the one that you made, Nina, which is that they don't want a Democrat filling the seat, and they are worried and scared about their political base punishing them if they allow a Democrat to fill the seat.
Mobilize — that's the key word here, says Leonardo Martinez-Diaz, a former deputy assistant secretary for energy and environment at the U.S. Treasury in the Obama administration. The term was specifically chosen to underscore the understanding that only a portion of the $100 billion per year would come directly from rich country governments. The plan is to motivate mostly private sources of capital — for example, for-profit corporations — to invest in efforts that help poor countries deal with climate change.
Despite Trump's insistence that he's not in a hurry, administration officials say he's urged his negotiators to try to get North Korea to agree to concrete steps.

So we have some well-established theories, Einstein's general relativity is the one that we use for describing the large objects, galaxies and the entire universe, the real big scales where gravity matters. And quantum physics, in various guises is the structure that we use to describe the small things that we've been talking about - the molecules, the atoms, the subatomic particles.

There isn't time for that to include James Comey's latest work, Saving Justice: Truth, Transparency and Trust. But Comey has had his assessment of Trump locked and loaded for some while.

It could be called the first really consequential critique in the initial barrage of books about President Trump in office.

But also, I think the way he delivers the stories allowed us to tread the line between the truth and the drama of the truth without stepping into melodrama or something that felt untrue. There's something about the conviction and the passion and the knowledge that he has, absolutely makes you absolutely follow those stories with, you know, an extraordinary intensity.

NTETA: Racial resentment is a new way to measure what is negative attitudes or negative affect towards African-Americans.

It's not something that's going to happen in five years or in, you know - within the term of a mayor or a governor. It's something that's going to take generations and has to be worked at continually.

So I had so much conflict within myself and something that I wasn't able to balance. It definitely led me to being very conflicted and it was only when my mother passed away and I left my family and I came to America that I was able to unpack all of these conflicts and all of this confusion about who I was and begin to find my own path and my own sense of where my morality came from. But that took a really long time.

When Claire finished what she thought of as her housekeeping chores, she looked around and was surprised to find herself alone with Edward Reese. His eyes had settled on her. She felt self-conscious and wanted to say to him, don't worry, I'll do you proud. Meeting his gaze, she said nothing, but it was the vow she made to herself. With her light meter in hand, she toured the room, taking sample readings and orienting herself. Luckily the room was bright. She wouldn't need artificial light or a tripod, at least not yet. The setup here was a little strange for a hospital. She glanced at Reese, who continued to watch her. She wondered if he'd noticed the oddness. The spacious, high-ceilinged room looked like the reception area of a private club, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing the river and an arrangement of leather chairs and a sofa. Brilliantly colored, semiabstract seascapes decorated the walls, no doubt loans from Mrs. John D. Rockefeller Jr., who collected modern art. Sunlight reflecting from the river shimmered and trembled upon the walls and ceiling, as if the hospital room were an extension of the paintings.

VANCE: It's an issue of timing. So fast forwarding and putting this in the context of the Trump investigation, defendants who've already pleaded guilty or future defendants who might plead guilty or go to trial and have a jury impaneled in their case would then be ineligible for retrial in the state of New York if they were to be pardoned by President Trump at that point in the proceedings. And that technical timing issue is what's given prosecutors in the state of New York some concern.

It is unclear how exactly the Uber suspension will be enforced. Unlike California, Arizona does not have a permitting system for autonomous vehicles.

One of the things that I heard was people talking about the fact that the police weren't prepared for this moment.

And whether that difference in preparation says a lot about who we expect to be violent and who we think of as a real threat in this country.

In fact, Macron said this week the strikes were necessary to fight against what he sees as a normalization of the use of chemical weapons. It cannot be a normal thing.

GOLDMAN: Rudy Gobert - not last night. You know, to pick up on Kerr's ebbs and flows comments, it's hard to have a consistent narrative once the playoffs get past the first round. All the remaining teams are very good. They're well-coached. And things change game to game because teams adjust game to game. And the home court can play a big part as it did in New Orleans last night. So the narrative that a talented cohesive Utah team might upset the number one seat Houston after Utah won game two and stole the Rockets' home-court advantage - that narrative changed in a big way by halftime last night when Houston led by 30 and ended up cruising to victory in Utah and stealing back the home-court advantage.

Routed in Wisconsin just two weeks ago, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton stormed back to take the high-stakes primary in their home state of New York in convincing fashion. Each won about three-fifths of the vote and widened their already imposing leads among pledged delegates.
But now that Democrats control the House, their ambitions are meeting up with reality.
On the campaign trail in Iowa, many voters seem to care more about the former vice president's one-on-one interactions than the content of his speeches.
Mr. KRAUSS: I was going to say that there is - there are, however, photons that do collide. And they're another one of our windows in the universe. There are objects out there, perhaps black holes colliding or stars exploding that are producing very high energy cosmic rays, which produce very energetic particles. Some of them may be very energetic photons, and they collide in the atmosphere and we use those photons which then produce particles in our atmosphere to try and learn about objects from extreme distances in space. It's a very exciting area of physics right now.

Democrats will revive the Gephardt Rule, introduced in the late 1970s by Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., that automatically raises the debt ceiling — the nation's borrowing limit — once the House passes a budget.
This rule will enable the exclusion of highly relevant scientific evidence from the policymaking process, Sudip Parikh, chief executive of the national science advocacy group American Association for the Advancement of Science, wrote in an email.

These are drugs available nationwide through an emergency authorization. They're designed to bind to the coronavirus to prevent it from invading cells. The government allocates the drug to states, which in turn decide how the drugs are distributed. Uptake has been irregular, in part because the medicines are cumbersome to deliver – they're given by infusion. A committee convened by the National Institutes of Health is also not confident that the drugs actually work.
NPR's Robert Siegel interviews Raja Shehadeh, a Palestinian lawyer and writer best known for his book Strangers in the House, about his memories of the Six-Day War and its lasting impact on the Middle East.
And, Scott, you know, then there's this. The rule-breaking involved here threatens a fundamental relationship in Major League Baseball between the pitcher and the batter. Normally, the pitcher knows what he's going to throw; the batter doesn't. The batter has milliseconds to figure out or to guess the speed, the angle, the spin of the ball. And, you know, that's one of the reasons Ted Williams famously said hitting a pitched ball is the hardest thing to do in sports. And if you successfully steal a sign from the catcher, you know what pitch is coming. Now the batter has the advantage, and that relationship is turned upside down. And the outcome of games can change because of that. It's very telling that several pitchers tweeted this week they'd rather face a player on steroids than a player who knew what pitch was coming.

Also people were advised to stop the experience after 45 minutes. David Baron couldn't even take it that long.
This, to me, is a sign of a weakness in a leader who demands loyalty. I can't imagine, for example, an Eisenhower or a Truman, say, firing people because they were disloyal. They get their following because they're strong leaders. A weak leader like Trump has to demand and command loyalty. He did it with Comey when he was, really, being interviewed to stay on the job, and Comey said, I can't do that. So Comey was removed. This has just been a constant pattern throughout the Trump presidency.

That has been my work since Day 1. From the moment of recognizing this widespread lead contamination, this population-level trauma and this broken trust, our work has been in a very holistic way to mitigate the impact of the crisis and bring forth healing and recovery. You can think of what happened in Flint as a case of science denial and our science helped speak truth to power. And we're leaning on that incredible science of child development and what kids and families need to bring forth healing and recovery. So what that looks like right now are these long-term interventions to support Flint families — like child care, like Medicaid expansion, like literacy support, like nutrition access, all of these critical ingredients to keep families healthy, including things like behavioral health services and trauma-informed care. Because what Flint was, by and large, was this population-level trauma. And people to this day are stressed and angry, and they feel guilt and they feel betrayed by the folks that were out there to protect them.
Instead of the open-ended federal contribution to the funding of Medicaid in all other states — which increases with higher enrollment and associated health costs — Tennessee will instead get a capped amount of money, via an annual block grant.

And so coming back as an adult and also kind of particularly as a film director - you know, film director is, you know, it's a very hierarchical kind of thing and you're at the top of the tree and, you know, you kind of have a megaphone and jodhpurs and a whip. And you're the boss in a sense. So it was kind of funny being back in a position of complete authority from one of completely subservient student life, you know, 30 years earlier.
At St. Mary Medical Center outside Philadelphia, short staffing led nurses to strike in November.

And to be fair, he said a hell of a lot more things that mattered than I did. You know, and even when I came back to Birmingham after college - I came back in '01. And I ended up hosting a morning show at the same station that my father used to work. At this point, the station was dedicated hip-hop. And there had been a split in the genres and all of that. But, you know, there were a lot of people in the building, a lot of the engineers. And, you know, some of the people in sales who worked with my father.

KANDER: The interesting thing is that I listened to everybody but Kurt Weill because I knew that was a dangerous area to be walking into. I listened to lots and lots and lots of German jazz and German vaudeville music of the '20s. But I stayed away zealously from listening to Weill at all. What I think happened is that the kind of Kurt Weill musical pieces that we hear in our heads were influenced by the same thing that I was sort of digging into. His early music and more serious music is in many ways in a totally different style and quite wonderful and slightly academic. When he comes to writing to his musicals or operas, if you will, he's reflecting the sounds of those vaudeville houses and German jazz and that sort of sleazy world that I was trying to reflect, also. But the actual influence of Weill's music itself was nonexistent.

The effects, called length contraction and time dilation, become more pronounced as the speed of the moving object approaches the speed of light. Remarkably, Einstein also showed, in a second paper he wrote that same year, that no object with mass could ever reach the speed of light. Mass itself grows with speed and becomes infinitely large at the speed of light. Only light itself, or another entity with no mass, could travel at light speed. And by the way, all this is perfectly consistent with light traveling in empty space. No ether. Light is like nothing else in the cosmos.

The political power to the choose the president was basically given by the founders to the state legislatures, Koza said. And over the years they've passed different laws specifying how to allocate their state's electoral votes.

It was the summer of 2015. I was actually with a high school girlfriend who, of all things, had become a drinking water expert. And she told me in my house at a last-minute barbecue that Mona, the water isn't being treated properly in Flint. And because of that, there's probably lead in the water. And that's the moment that my life changed. When I heard the word lead, it was a call to action. I respect the science of what lead does. I understand it's a potent, irreversible neurotoxin. And I also understand that lead's a form of environmental racism. It's the last thing our kids in Flint needed. That's the moment I stopped sleeping, I stopped eating, I lost about 30 pounds. And I began this quest to find out if that lead was getting into the bodies of our children.

Taylor wants to continue her wrestling career at the collegiate level after she graduates from high school, but there are just a handful of collegiate women's wrestling programs in the U.S. — and at that level, women aren't allowed to wrestle men, despite the fact that many female high school wrestlers never had leagues of their own.

PERALTA: Kassam went to college in Canada. When she was done, she had to make a choice - stay within the comfort of Western society or come back to Kenya and fight endemic corruption, poverty and tribalism to build a better country. She chose home. She chose Kenya. Eyder Peralta, NPR News, Nairobi.
The move by the Justice and Education departments reverses guidance the Obama administration publicized in May 2016, which said a federal law known as Title IX protects the right of transgender students to use restrooms and locker rooms that match their gender identities.
Speaking on the Senate floor, Florida Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson said he was absolutely shocked by FEMA's decision. I urge the administration to reverse this disastrous decision immediately and to continue providing the people of Puerto Rico with the help that they need as they are trying to recover from two disastrous hurricanes.
No. In fact, the standards have become slightly tighter this year.

Years later, Stratton Oakmont's crimes would be turned into a Hollywood film, The Wolf of Wall Street. But in 1994, the firm called the accusations libel and wanted to sue. But because it was the Internet, the posts were anonymous. So instead, the firm sued Prodigy, the online service that hosted the bulletin board.

There's been a lot of talk about how the election of Donald Trump has sparked a new energy and engagement in politics on both the right and the left. We're going to hear now the story of a mobilization of scientists concerned that the Trump administration could upend years of work on climate change. Some scientists are worried about President Trump's Environmental Protection Agency administrator who's criticized EPA rules on climate change, clean air and water, and those concerns are prompting some scientists to move beyond just advocating for science to organizing and even running for office.
I allowed myself to be imperfect. I allowed myself to make mistakes and laugh at it, to handle my real-life mistakes the way I handled the acting mistakes on The Dick Van Dyke Show, to think of those as positive steps forward rather than anything to be ashamed of.
The Trump administration's special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, was convicted of withholding information about the Iran-Contra scandal from Congress but later received a pardon from President George H.W. Bush. This month, Congress members grilled Abrams and questioned whether he would speak truthfully.

That same pain is felt by people who lose their jobs to robots, though, said Hills, and if the U.S. is serious about getting former manufacturing workers back to work, that means adopting policies outside of trade pacts.
Mr. WEINBERG: Well, I have to, though, support the questioner. Every once in a while, even now, a couple of photons in intergalactic space collide, but their energy is so low that the only thing that can happen is two photons go in, two photons go out.
SAGAL: So here are your stories, each of which involve two people fighting over one thing. Was it from Joel Kim Booster, two graffiti artists arguing that they were the ones who tagged their school King Steez? Was it from Amy Dickinson, the two great authors J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis arguing over which of them could use the character Tinkle the Pixie? Or from Maeve Higgins, two well-known influencers who each claim the idea to name their baby Baby? Which of these is the real story of a rivalry we found in the week's news?
A few years ago, it was more common for migrant families to cross in places like the Rio Grande Valley in Texas. But Williams says that route has become increasingly dangerous because the Mexican side of the border is controlled by cartels. So migrants are crossing in remote borderlands, in spite of the risks.
MARTIN: You mean regulatory actions or executive orders?
MARTIN: Eduardo, can I ask - briefly as you can - when you think about the situation that you are in, the limbo that you are in, which is better than other peoples' in the sense that you do have, you know, you do have an H1-B visa. You do have a job. You're respected in your field. Who do you blame for this situation? Do you have a sense of - when you think about it, who do you think is at fault? Or do you even think of it that way?
Growing up in South Africa with a white father and a black mother, Trevor Noah confronted prejudices on both sides. He tells Fresh Air's Terry Gross that both white people and black people would express fear and biases to him. Then, he says, I'd have to explain to them, 'Hey, you can't think like that. You can't hold these views, because you're generalizing everybody.'

And what ended up happening was a circus. What ended up happening was she was vilified for doing what she believed was the right thing to do. And again, having personally prosecuted sexual assault cases, I was incredibly disappointed and frustrated by the lack of information that leaders have about the nature of these kinds of issues like sexual assault. And how they treated her, I thought was regrettable and really unfortunate. And I have nothing but praise for her and her courage, including what it did, which was require people to have a national conversation about an issue that is seldom discussed — and impacts a wide range of people in all genders, in every socioeconomic background, race, religion and ethnicity.
Often official data is spotty, inaccurate or simply fudged, she says. In Tamil Nadu, for example, people living in [a certain] area claimed that for the past two to three years there was no rainfall. Official rainfall data showed that rainfall was normal for those years and yet the farming lands were fallow and dry.
The counseling is important, health workers say, because hunger in Afghanistan is more than a lack of money to buy food. In traditional households, men eat first, leaving women and children with the remains. That mindset particularly hurts pregnant and lactating women, who need more calories. The counselors advise women about the importance of breastfeeding and when to wean their children, and male health workers raise awareness with men about ensuring the women and children in their families eat well.
The public and NBA sponsors were wary, but Stern supported Magic. He paved the way for him to play in the 1992 All-Star Game and the '92 Olympics, where Magic was a star in that star-studded dream team. Stern educated himself and teams and players about the disease. And, you know, Leila, this whole process helped change the conversation and attitudes about HIV and AIDS.

Hidden from view is a U.S. naval facility, where sailors use high-tech radar day and night to watch for incoming ballistic missiles fired at NATO countries. If any are spotted, the Americans would fire back with SM-3 Block IIA missiles.
Mr. CHESNUTT: Well, I played - my chords were a lot different. There was a lot more kind of odd chords and things in my songs before I broke my neck. There were a little more jazzy chords that my granddad taught me and a lot more kind of, yeah, strange chords and not just open G's and E minors and thing like that. Those were not acceptable before my accident. I also, you know, I was 18 when I broke my neck. I didn't really have anything to say at the time. I wasn't sure what was - I just didn't know what I wanted to say. It was only after I broke my neck and after even like maybe a year later that I really started realizing that I had something to say. And physically, when I could start playing the guitar again after about a year, I realized that all I could play were these kinds of you know, G, F, C - those kind of chords. And so it was going to be - well, that's what I was going to do.
Marie Yovanovitch [crosstalk] testified under oath that Ukraine policy was hijacked.
Imagine that the setup — having or not having the screen — is decided after the photon goes through the slits. That is what the arrows in the diagram represent, the possibility that the screen is there — or is not. In 2007, a group in France did exactly that, letting a single photon pass through a double slit and then, after it passed through, having a random number generator choose whether the screen would be there or not to detect it. As Wheeler wrote, Thus one decides the photon shall have come by one route or by both routes after it has already done its travel. Since then, many other groups (for example, here) have performed refined versions of the experiment, confirming Wheeler's intuition.
And, you know, I feel very - sometimes, you know, I am telling the right thing because a lot of people - it's not just myself - a lot of people are in my situation, that you follow the American dream. You do the correct things, and in the end, maybe it doesn't work for you, and why, you know. So I don't think blame should be the word I should use. But I think - I think at least, you know, the president is trying to address the immigration reform. That's a positive thing.
You know Americans are industrious people. That's how America got to be a great place. We're not a little feeble people who have to be spoon-fed.
If we also had statues of the great Aboriginal people who have fought for land rights, who have worked with people, Europeans, early on in the explorations, then that would change our consciousness of Australia, she added.
Moreover, there is that question of misinformation. If NPR runs a 90-minute briefing live, how many listeners are sticking around for the analysis, context and fact-checking afterwards? The NPR newsroom's self-defined mission is, among other elements, to serve the public and democracy. I take that to mean that it should provide facts to help listeners make decisions in their lives, not spin, particularly at a time when public health is at stake. That means having its reporters listen to the briefing and immediately share important updates in the newscasts and newsmagazines, without giving a platform for falsehoods, or speculative comments on as-yet-untested treatments or campaign rally-style rants. Those who want to can watch the full briefing at npr.org (albeit without that all-important context) and NPR has made the link easy to find, sending out breaking news alerts, among other things.

Friday morning, the 20 - since my shift yesterday, I came back in to find the emergency department full. Everyone in the ICU at the moment is on a ventilator. Not only did everything change as far as the severity in my hospital went today, somebody forgot to inform everyone today, please don't go to the emergency department to get a routine test for COVID or because you've had two days of a cough and maybe a low-grade fever. Those people need to self-isolate at home, take care of themselves and call their doctors if they're concerned. But when you come to the emergency department - number one, if you don't have COVID, you're probably going to get exposed to it at a hospital now. Number two, if you do have COVID, you're going to expose other people who are very ill to it.

KING: Indigenous leader Warren Mundine said that performance really moved him.
JOHNSON: Oh, my gosh. How many times have we talked over the last four years about the chaos and turmoil at the Justice Department, Ailsa? That place has a morale problem and a public confidence problem. Merrick Garland, Joe Biden thinks, will help resolve some of those issues. Garland is a former DOJ official - lots of experience in managing that building in the Clinton years, also some experience with cases like the Unabomber and the Oklahoma City bombing. He's known as nonpartisan and a level head and a guy who does things for reasons based on the law and not politics or protecting the president. So that would, Democrats believe, be a change from the current situation.

When The X-Files appeared on TV in the 1990s, there really hadn't been anything quite like it on TV for a long time. The Twilight Zone, with its monsters and flying saucers and anything-goes mentality, was an obvious inspiration and precursor. But investigations of unusual or unearthly phenomena, dramatized in a weekly series in ways that could be scary or funny, or both? As TV shows go, that's about as rare a sighting as Bigfoot or the Loch Ness Monster.
He pointed to the recent community transmission of the disease in countries outside Asia, which he called deeply concerning.
CARNEY: I did make videos for bands, but I think kind of the opposite in a way. It was very much - I looked at videos just as a means of representing the music, not as a film in and of itself, not really anything to do with filmmaking. So when I moved from music into filmmaking, it was because I wanted to be friends with Truffaut or, you know, Martin Scorsese or whatever.
RICHEN: Gas stations were listed, clubs, liquor stores, resorts, beauty shops, tailors. In the early ones, there were doctor's office and hospitals, I mean, because - and that just goes to show you, as someone says in the film, the breadth of businesses and services that African-Americans were locked out of at the time.
With the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, a study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in December found that protection doesn't start until 12 days after the first shot and that it reaches 52% effectiveness a few weeks later. A week after the second vaccination, the effectiveness rate hits 95%. In its application for authorization, Moderna reported a protection rate of 51% two weeks after the first immunization and 94% two weeks after the second dose.
Charly García came of artistic age when Argentina's dictatorship would regularly imprison and disappear rock musicians like him who dared to challenge the injustice of a brutal regime. His song Los Dinosaurios is a classic of resistance and defiance not just in his home country but across all of Latin America.
Philbin defended accepting credible information from foreign sources about a political rival, arguing that mere information is not something that would violate the campaign finance laws.
We did the best we could with what we had at the time, Moorhouse said. But it is definitely a better situation today than it was 10 years ago. The change was pretty dramatic.
I think that was one of the mistakes that God made, Ebeling says softly. He shouldn't have picked me for the job. But next time I talk to him, I'm gonna ask him, 'Why me. You picked a loser.' 
The United States supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaidó, the president of your National Assembly, to assert that body's constitutional powers, declare Maduro a usurper, and call for the establishment of a transitional government, Pence said. On behalf of the American people, we say to all the good people of Venezuela, estamos con ustedes. We are with you.
YONG: Right. So in most respiratory viruses, you either get infections in the upper airways - in which case symptoms are mild, but the virus spreads more easily - or you get infections in the lower airways - in which case symptoms are more severe, like pneumonia, but the virus is harder to transmit. It seems that the new coronavirus can infect both sites. So perhaps it infects the upper airways, causing mild symptoms and spreading easily before moving down into the lower airways and causing some of the more severe illnesses we've seen in the worst COVID-19 cases. And maybe the reason it can do all those things is that it relies on this furin enzyme, which is found in lots of different tissues.
That's the idea. But in practice, seeing such gravitational waves has been nearly impossible. To make detectable waves, massive objects must be moving quickly. Researchers predicted a collision between two black holes would do the trick. But nobody knew how often that might happen.
At the end of the day, I just don't think there's enough angry old white people in Pennsylvania.
And in addition to that, the charter school had created a position called the dean of student and family engagement, whose job it was to work with children whose issues outside the classroom were making it virtually impossible for them to learn effectively. So this particular dean would find someone in each child's family to be responsible for their learning. If it wasn't a parent or a grandparent, it would be a neighbor. One time, there was a stepfather who had just come out of prison and wanted to have a relationship with his stepson, and they engaged him to be the sort of chief learning officer for that child. And all of these people were there to be present and to support kids who otherwise wouldn't have been able to learn.

Was there a hole that needed to be filled that you needed to write a new song for?

And, you know, Ireland - it has changed so much here since the 1990s. It's made contraception easy to access. It's legalized divorce and homosexuality and same-sex marriage. And I think, for many people, they felt like abortion was the last, what they called, of the moral battle that they had to fight here.
Einstein was the first to apply his ideas of space and time plasticity to the universe as a whole. In 1919, he devised a model for the entire universe: a static, spherical, perfectly symmetric cosmos, with matter homogeneously distributed everywhere, reflecting a mix of Platonic perfection and of Ockham's Razor. That first model, even if wrong, became the inspiration for all the work on modern cosmology that followed it, including the now widely-accepted Big Bang model, whereby the universe emerged from an event 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding and cooling ever since. Black holes, gravitational waves, all of this follows from Einstein's general theory. Oh yes, and so does the accuracy of your GPS, which needs elements from both the special and the general theories.
This idea of spreading refugee cuisine is taking off in other cities around the country, too. West Side Bazaar, in Buffalo, N.Y., functions as a small-business incubator for immigrants and refugees, with nine restaurants helmed by refugee or immigrant chefs, ranging from Asian Halal to Ethiopian cuisine. There's been talk of turning Seattle's King Street Station into an immigrant food hall similar to Global Café. And organizations like Komeeda, a New York-based company that puts on food events, launched a series called Chefugee Cuisine, meant to help refugee chefs share their native cuisine.

I couldn't believe it. I could not believe it. I went in on that day. And later on that night, I had a callback for that show. And in between that, one of these manila envelopes that I had been stuffing, sending to every agent in Los Angeles, happened to call me in between the audition and the callback. And the confluence of the things that happened on that day still defy me to have any explanation for them. But it was a very profoundly successful day.

UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #4: Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for the Pledge of Allegiance.
The first step was to check whether anyone was there. He would peer in the windows, put his ear to the door. A beeping smoke detector was a dead giveaway — the batteries had gone dead, but no one was around to change them. If the house was vacant, he would pick the lock on the front door and go in.
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I picked the office that was arguably the furthest walk from the Capitol.
LIASSON: It doesn't seem like he's moved the needle. He did a lot of things - Oval Office address, trip to the border, a lot of interviews. The latest polling we have is a Washington Post/ABC News poll that shows by a very wide margin - 53 to 29 percent - more Americans blame President Trump and the Republicans in Congress for the shutdown rather than Democrats.
I don't believe that we have an issue if we have one or two people who can no longer support the work in one of the centers, Stempowski said.
The fact that they wear [hijabs is] sort of a metaphor for traditional conservatism, Manzoor says. Shugs and Fats are two women who are also interested in the secular world and interested in things that are down in Brooklyn.
SAGAL: And then when he's in Israel he's going to Yad Vashem. That is the very solemn state memorial to the victims of the Holocaust. But again - this is true - he has insisted that he only spend 15 minutes there. He will not spend any longer than that. And, of course, 10 minutes of that has to be in the gift shop.
HADID: So when he says the innocent children in our city, what he's talking about is that activists count here that 13 children were raped and killed over the past two years here. The 13th child was Zainab.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: But finally, in yet another drawn-out meeting, Sally got through.
PFEIFFER: He really did. You know, he described some torture techniques in a fair amount of detail, like putting a broomstick behind someone's knees and pushing them backward until their shoulders were touching the floor and their knees were at risk of getting dislocated or walling, which he described as putting a collar around someone's neck and, in his words, bouncing them against a wall. One of the Guantanamo prisoners got a traumatic brain injury from being walled. That's according to the prisoners' lawyers.
Fifty years after its debut, a restored version of Senegalese director Ousmane Sembène's first film is now available. John Powers says Black Girl feels as timely today as it did half a century ago.
But Michele Johnson, executive director of the Tennessee Justice Center sees the move as a step backward for the state's Medicaid program.
INSKEEP: You're talking about things that obviously would cost a lot of money. I know you'd rather think of it as an investment rather than a cost, but it is just certainly a lot of money. You don't specify where it's going to come from, other than saying it will all pay for itself.
Clarifying and strengthening the complaint process. We have clarified the process for making complaints and added new avenues for raising concerns of inappropriate behavior, including an anonymous hotline. We have identified and communicated a range of consequences for inappropriate behavior. These include verbal warnings, personalized training, a change of responsibilities or assignments, suspension, and termination. We have enhanced our investigation process, reviewing complaints by representatives of both the HR and Legal teams and working with outside counsel and our union representatives as appropriate. Our overarching goal is to ensure that everyone at NPR is safe and treated with respect.
HARKINS: (As Reverend Burns) Yes, you, would you stand up please?
What I want is to possess my readers while they are reading my book, Philip Roth once told The Paris Review. (Reading) Then let them return just as they were to a world where everybody else is working to change, persuade, temp and control them. The best readers come to fiction to be free of all that noise - to have set loose in them the consciousness that's otherwise conditioned and hemmed in by all that isn't fiction.
HOYER: ...And Honduras, where so many of the refugees are now coming. There's a real change. Five years ago, it was single men coming in, a lot sneaking in. Now what we're seeing is moms, children, families coming to points of entry and going up to Border Patrol and saying, we want to turn ourselves in and seek asylum, which of course, under our law, is what they can do. So there's a character difference in the kind of influx of immigrants that we are seeing today than we saw five years ago.
Generally the multiple sclerosis drugs are not substitutable, she says. Most have different mechanisms of action, different administration and different side effect profiles. And generics, when they're available, are pricey too — typically costing $60,000 or more annually, she says.

A new study shows race is a factor in the debate over whether to pay college athletes. NPR's Lulu Garcia-Navarro talks to UMass Amherst political scientist Tatishe Nteta, who co-authored the study.
Mr. WEINBERG: This is an old story when Galileo wrote his dialogue concerning the two chief systems of the world, in which he presented his discoveries about astronomy. He wrote it in Italian rather than in Latin. Latin was the language that would reach scholars throughout Europe. And Italian was a language that would be read by ordinary people. And he wanted it to be read by ordinary people. Unfortunately, it got him into some trouble.
I was hired as a performer and then they course corrected. [Becoming a staff writer] took about five years, and those were my hardest five years on the show. I thought when you showed up at SNL, that meant you were as good as everybody at SNL. Like how could Lorne be wrong?
Still, a part of her fears that conservative Muslim clerics may twist #MosqueMeToo to women's detriment. The danger is that people could use this to try to separate men from women, which could be a disaster. We have enjoyed [praying] in the same space together for [more than 1,400 years], she says.
MCCARTHY: Yeah. So the short answer is that Operation Warp Speed has been a tremendous success. And the reason it was successful is that the federal government removed risk from these companies from taking on a very risky project, which was a vaccine for a new virus, and taking on such an important problem - you know, the greatest pandemic of our lives.

It was a striking moment in a 40-year fight over drilling in the coastal plain, an area that's home to migrating caribou, polar bears, birds and other wildlife. It also potentially sits atop billions of barrels of oil, according to federal estimates.
SAGAL: After a can of its product was found in the wreckage of the Capitol, blank condemned that assault on democracy.
In a darkened London theater, the first thing the audience hears is the rhythmic chanting of an a capella Islamic State anthem.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with Viet Thanh Nguyen. His novel The Sympathizer won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. It's set in Vietnam during the war and in LA just after. The main character is a spy for North Vietnam working undercover as an aide to a general in South Vietnam. Viet Thanh Nguyen was born in South Vietnam. He was 4 in 1975 when the war ended. The North, which was Communist, took over the South. The Americans pulled out. And he and his family fled to the U.S.
But then in school, Lindenberger got pulled out of class and asked by educators to get vaccinated. He talked with friends and realized all of them had been vaccinated, but that he didn't even know what a flu shot felt like. He saw more and more anti-vaccination debates popping up on social media. Slowly, he started to question what his mother had told him.
QUEEN: (Singing) Mama, just killed a man, put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger. Now he's dead. Mama, life had just begun. But now I've gone and thrown it all away. Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry. If I'm not back again this time tomorrow, carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.
The subject matter is something we've all heard, Sen. Mike Braun, R-Ind., said to reporters.
On a Sunday in late April, Pastor Clarence Jones asked his congregation to join him.
Well, to talk about the future of clean energy in the U.S., we're joined now by Ernest Moniz. He was President Obama's energy secretary, and today he testified before a Senate committee. Welcome to ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.
The president also faces some significant headwinds for re-election in 2020. Just 30 percent of registered voters said they will definitely vote for Trump in 2020, while 57 percent said they will definitely vote against him.
The federal government shutdown — caused in part by disagreements over immigration policy — is delaying immigration court hearings across the country.
From a studio space in Brooklyn, Guinean native Natu Camara mixes West African soul, rock and pop music. As a builder of inter-cultural bridges, Camara uses her songs to bring people together, weaving a tapestry of musical stories and visions of her beloved home.
For Some New Americans, Capitol Attack Was An Echo Of Turmoil They'd Hoped To Escape
And at a time when, once again, politicians are talking about defunding public television, it should be noted that Rogers went to Washington to testify before Congress in 1969 about why public TV was so important to young viewers — and to beg for $20 million in public funding.
INSKEEP: Well, let's talk about that because obviously the opposition leader hasn't been arrested yet. He's still walking free. But if the Supreme Court is beginning motions against him, it clearly leans in that direction. What is the plan of Juan Guaido, the opposition leader, to actually take power having claimed it?
There's only so much stress and pain and grief that you can experience, Andy says. And we're all kind of experiencing a collective stress, and pain and grief and it crowds out a little bit of the room you have for your own personal thoughts.
Mr. CHESNUTT: Yeah, that comes from The Radetzky March by Joseph Roth - Roth or whatever his name is. It's another line that it felt true. You know, it was kind of the flip side of this coward - of the courage of the coward. It kind of - they dovetailed nicely together and helped illuminate this idea I had of, you know, hello, my name is Vic Chesnutt, and I am a coward - statement.
The Third Circuit's opinion is a faithful reading of the statute's plain language and is consistent with Congress's intent to protect American neighborhoods from the scourge of concentrated drug use, McSwain said in a statement.
LORENA RIOS, BYLINE: The annual event is called the Abrazo Children Ceremony. It's been going on for nearly half a century. Each year, both cities nominate a child to represent them. The children dress up in their local finery and walk to the middle of the bridge to embrace their counterparts from the other side.
For his part, Biden called on the president to direct his supporters to end what he described as an unprecedented assault on democracy that borders on sedition.
And when you're invincible, even the improbable can happen: The kid can be the one to reassure the mom.
MARTIN: We just heard from Dr. Matt McCarthy, associate professor of medicine at Cornell University and the author of Superbugs: The Race To Stop An Epidemic.
I wrote about the race and ethnicity numbers last April, and talked then to many employees about their deep concerns and frustrations over the lack of progress and what they saw as the causes and ramifications. That column also included an assessment of how NPR's numbers compare with those of other newsrooms. I won't repeat that assessment here, but putting the company in the context of its peers is a valuable perspective, as is hearing from a wide range of newsroom employees.
DAVIES: So it really was nationwide. It wasn't primarily in the Jim Crow South.
GREENE: ...To convince them that the world is different today?
The Post also turned loose its fact-checking staff, led by Glenn Kessler, in a lengthy compendium of falsehoods, misleading claims and flat-out lies titled Donald Trump and His Assault on Truth. It was all far in excess of the assault on any previous president in the mainstream media, and yet it did not seem to dent the president's armor. To be sure, it was pleasing to people who had not cared for the man from the beginning, but there is an underlying assumption in digging for and telling hard truths needs to make a difference.
Such programs exist in other countries. Canada, for example, has had a 150 Research Chairs program that looks similar in many ways to the Thousand Talents Plan.
UNIDENTIFIED PERSON #6: It's hard for me to understand how people are punching out their wives at home and the rest of that. But it does happen. And it's an issue we've been working on for a very long time.
Throughout the early 2000s, housing prices in some parts of the country rose, and rose, and rose. Homes with prices that for decades had steadily grown with inflation were suddenly worth 50 percent or 100 percent more.
Calling the combined venture the first of a new breed of cyber-physical retailers, professor Lee McKnight of Syracuse University's school of information studies says Amazon's first priority isn't to boost Whole Foods' sales volumes — it's to boost the amount of data the company has about its customers.
GROSS: My guest is Dale Russakoff, author of The Prize: Who's In Charge Of America's Schools? After a short break, we'll talk about the growing education industrial complex. Then David Bianculli will review last night's Emmy Award telecast and look ahead to the fall TV season, and Kevin Whitehead will review the new complete edition of Erroll Garner's 1955 Concert By The Sea. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.
Hess recalls it as a marvelous little speech, which pretty much declared him as the next Republican candidate. And in that speech, praised the Republican platform as a 'banner of bold, unmistakable colors with no pale pastel shades.' 
Clonazolam serves no medical purpose. It's a chemical devised for recreational use and profit. But it's a hundred to a thousand times more potent than our standard array of benzos, according to Lembke. This means its potential for overdose is substantially higher, too.
When it comes to the Supreme Court, I've appointed two women, one Hispanic. And in each case, the good news is that I appointed the person who I absolutely thought was the best person for the job. In this case, Merrick Garland is the best person for the job.

Assistant Speaker Katherine Clark, D-Mass. called the president a traitor to our country and our Constitution and called for him to be removed from office and prevented from further endangering our country and our people.
Claire was an only child and thus not an expert in siblings, but she thought Tia looked at her brother with an unusual degree of trust and affection. Glancing between them, Claire saw that the two shared a familial link in their eyes and their coloring.
If someone is found to be shedding the virus, then researchers will check to see if that virus is capable of reproducing itself and, if it is, whether there's enough to infect other people. That raises another unknown: It's not yet clear what an infectious dose would be.
The study authors also cited environmental reasons: improved air quality as more Americans worked from home and had less contact with outdoor allergens such as pollen and dust on playgrounds, many of which have been off-limits during the COVID-19 crisis.
Soon, Nick's cell phone begins ringing with grisly long-distance assignments from Cole. Nick is a criminal, but not a bad man. While feverishly scheming how to escape his servitude to Cole, Nick also must keep dodging a Chicago detective determined to put him back in prison.
In South Korea, for instance, or even Singapore, a recommendation from the government is taken really literally and in a very stringent way, says Brusin of ECDC. Other sources interviewed for this story suggest that is because there may be more trust in government than in western societies.
The prime minister-designate, Peter Pellegrini, who was a deputy to his predecessor, Robert Fico, is now scrambling to form a new government to calm the situation. Pellegrini's original picks for his cabinet were rejected by the president and he plans to discuss new names on Wednesday.
Some likely trends give cause for optimism — signs of progress in solving the world's problems. Other trends are pessimistic — threats and challenges that are expected to worsen in the year ahead.
DAVIS: You know, if you had not paid attention to the television today and just tuned in tonight, it is resumed debate. The House and Senate are back in session, Republicans and Democrats going back-and-forth over the Electoral College results. We still expect there to be some objections. I would say overall, the mood has been fairly somber. Members have recognized how serious today was, the threat that it posed - and a lot of calls for unity to assert the election as they were set out to do today. And overwhelmingly, lawmakers wanted to come in back to session tonight. There was no disagreement. Members wanted to come in. They wanted the country to see them doing their jobs, to see them on the floor of the House and Senate and to get this done.
Both Daly brothers had gained weight in middle age. It's just that one gained more than the other. In 1996, when he was diagnosed with diabetes, Paul weighed 220 pounds — too much for his 5-foot-10-inch frame. Looking back, Paul says he hadn't stuck with much regular exercise.
MCCAMMON: Well, we have confirmed, as many other media outlets have, that this is a real photo from Virginia Governor Ralph Northam's medical school yearbook in 1984. The page shows several sort of typical yearbook photos, and then it also shows a picture of someone in blackface and someone else in a KKK costume. This is on Northam's page in his yearbook, and he has acknowledged that he appeared in the picture, didn't say which of those people is him. And he's apologized for that.
West of the King County Sheriff's Office said Thursday that charges were never brought against Brown because his wife is uncomfortable testifying. West says that's not uncommon in domestic violence cases.
TILLMAN: Oh, OK - cool. Well, you know, I'm on the phone, and I can't see y'all. So I do a lot of radio interviews. And they have, like, applause on cue where they hit a button...
MICHELE KELEMEN, BYLINE: Pompeo's first stop is Jordan, a country that borders Syria and houses hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees. The secretary of state calls Jordan a durable partner, adding that he doesn't think a change in the U.S. tactics in Syria should affect the U.S.-led coalition's fight against ISIS.
Residents of New Zealand proposed 10,292 alternative flag designs as of mid-2015. A panel then narrowed it down to a handful of choices, and the nation picked its favorite.
GATES: Our TV - when we woke up, the TV was on, and nobody ever turned it off until you went to sleep. And I watched reruns of early black films like Amos 'n' Andy and Beulah. All that was on still in 1965 in syndication. And I learned a lot about the medium. And deep down, I realized in retrospect that my desire to make films was probably born about that time.
LANDAU: ...After the fact in this world, and on - you know? And I mean immediately after playing Tucker, there were, you know, script after script after script with a lot of very ethnic, mostly Jewish, older men - were sent my way. It takes a Woody Allen to think of me as the character I played in Crimes And Misdemeanors, again a departure from anything I'd ever done before and anything he'd seen me in before.
DAVIES: Right. And there was also one amazing sequence which we see one of them eaten by a crocodile, pack takes it hard.

Like other farmers across the region, he'll plant his corn and beans and hope for the best. If you're not optimistic, he says, you're not a farmer.
But the damage was already done. Outside, state police blocked a handful of Republican state representatives who tried to gain access to the building in order to seat an alternate slate of electors as the state's 16 electoral votes were cast for Joe Biden, who won the state by 154,188 votes.
Well done, Stanton, Dr. Rivers said as he strode out. The crowd slipped away. After a few private words with her brother, Tia left. Dr. Stanton asked Nurse Brockett to put the remainder of the liquid penicillin into the refrigerator until it was needed. Then he turned to Claire. He was surprised by how liberated he felt, how lighthearted. He even felt a touch of pride that he'd been able to show Claire Shipley this accomplishment. But work pressed against him. Most likely we won't see any results for several hours, Mrs. Shipley. Probably not until tonight. Perhaps you'd like to return to your office? I'll have someone telephone you later.
The case against monarchies is not a hard one to make, particularly from afar. Why on earth allow public funds to support such a spectacle? What is a tiara for, in the grand scheme of things? And, of course, the old standard: Who cares? (Often spoken by those in the process of caring quite deeply, if in the negative.)
It's a legacy accomplishment, says Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican. This new flexibility means we can work toward improving maternal health coverage and clearing the waiting list for developmentally disabled.
The sleepy interludes demonstrate a struggle many senators are fighting during the trial's marathon sessions: resisting the urge to nod off as the tiring days test stamina and patience.
Pressed further about whether specific research on issues such as climate change could be withheld, Ericksen told NPR that it's premature to comment on a hypothetical before we've even had the time to look at what's currently happening in the [agency].
Local ambulance and emergency medical service agencies were already on tight budgets before coronavirus. A local ambulance crew and the head of a national EMS organization tell us their concerns.

SAGAL: Whatever you're asking, I got nothing, but go for it.
The Holy See Press Office announced Saturday that the pontiff would lead the prayer from the library of the Apostolic Palace — rather than from his usual window overlooking the square — and would livestream the proceedings online rather than encourage visitors to gather at the Vatican. Officials say they will be carrying out his general audience on Wednesday in a similar fashion.
As this plays out, the role Wisconsin's voter ID law has had in suppressing or turning out voters is also still up for debate. Supporters say same-day registration and free voter IDs make those concerns moot, but larger cities have expanded early voting with an eye toward combating what they insist is an effort to depress turnout among voters of color and those who are younger and lower income.
CONAN: All right, Shawn, thanks very much. John?
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: Whatever Pat was doing, it was working. The coalition grew and grew.
If North Korea wants to change its status with the U.S., Frank Aum, of the U.S. Institute of Peace, says the country cannot keep its weapons.
Congresswoman On What It Was Like To Be Evacuated From The U.S. Capitol
In an interview with the science magazine Undark, Lindenberger's mother said that his decision to get vaccinations felt like an insult and called it a slap in the face.

UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER #6: How many domestic violence calls do you get on most nights?
Shay Stewart Bouley from Maine is the executive director of Community Change and the creator of the blog Black Girl in Maine. She tweeted a story about an incident that happened to her while she was waiting for an Amtrak train. She was the only black person standing on the crowded platform, she says, and she jostled a white woman standing near her.
It all could have been avoided, experts say, if those in power told the truth about the legitimacy of the vote.
The call came days ahead of congressional certification of Biden's electoral victory. A number of Republican members of Congress have said they're going to object to the results, an effort that is poised to fail but that has the support of Vice President Pence.
I originally saw him posting in the science topics on Gab and later followed him on Twitter. His online handle is @TruckDrivinRyan — he drives 18-wheelers for a living.
Oversight is a powerful tool, said Chiquita Brooks-LaSure, a former HHS official who is now a managing director at Manatt Health Strategies, a consulting firm.
WOOD JR: If you was at the club and the DJ started playing the national anthem, you'd be like, what the [expletive] is wrong with this DJ?
Scientists theorized that it would prove to be useful against a wide range of infections, including pneumonia, scarlet fever, meningitis, syphilis, and blood poisoning. However, the necessary clinical testing hadn't yet been done. Given the production problems, the Times noted, penicillin might remain nothing more than a laboratory curiosity.

And I need to put their threats in perspective. They didn't just threaten on Title IX. They also threatened on Title VII, the Equal Employment Opportunity Civil Rights Act, which affects 80 percent of the employees nationwide. So this is no longer a threat against North Carolina.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN #2: I live in one of the most beautiful areas in America, I think.
Some Democrats have already begun calling for a broader investigation into the Trump administration's handling of the crisis so far. Pelosi did not rule out the possibility of launching a backwards-looking investigation similar to the 9/11 Commission but said the priority now is making sure the new federal funds are spent appropriately.
ROTT: Well, so the issue is that this is the time of year where forest managers and firefighters usually do a lot of the administrative duties and preparatory work they need to for the upcoming season. And because so many - so much of the federal workforce is furloughed right now, those things aren't happening. So that's hiring for seasonal positions, contracts for aircraft that aren't getting done, contracts for heavy equipment.
The fact that farmland values are holding up pretty well — and farmland as an asset is by far the biggest portion of the balance sheet — means debt-to-asset ratios aren't rising too much, Kauffman says. Those values have stayed strong.
GROSZ: No, Mars is red. She's going to lose it no matter what...
We are exploring the options available in Mr. Makhzoomi's case and seeing how we can best connect it to what we are worried about as being a pattern — the new reality of flying while Muslim, as some Muslims refer to it. We are looking at the different options to see what will make the most sense.
Perhaps the most prominent of the newly confirmed patients is Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of Italy's Democratic Party, which is part of the country's governing coalition. Zingaretti revealed his diagnosis in a video posted Saturday to Facebook.
CORNISH: Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling play the two lovers at the heart of the film, each balancing their showbiz dreams with reality. Gosling's Sebastian, a traditional Jazz pianist, has to join a band with more pop sensibilities to make ends meet. And Emma Stone's Mia is an aspiring actress who still hasn't found her big break after six years and countless auditions.
It really gave us the ability to compete on big ticket items like TV and other expensive modes of communication. And it really helped us expand our campaign and be able to compete against very, very big money interests, Flores said. One of her chief opponents, state Senate Minority Whip Ruben Kihuen, has been endorsed by both Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and former President Bill Clinton. Nevada education leader Susie Lee has been endorsed by EMILY's List.
The company supplies the chips for Uber's autonomous cars and has five test cars of its own operating in California and New Jersey.
Tell me what you know about the medicine, Patsy said.
Naming Austin to the position comes six months after a scathing independent audit found that the company had made painful decisions [not to control content] with real world consequences that are serious setbacks for civil rights.
Since the 1980s, income inequality has been on the rise, says Lucas Chancel, co-director of the World Inequality Lab at the Paris School of Economics. In the U.S., for example, Chancel says the richest 1% owned about 40% of the nation's wealth in 2016 — up from 20% in the 1980s — and Trump's 2017 tax policies have only turbocharged inequality, with the richest 400 families paying a lower average tax rate in 2018 than the poorest half of American households.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Really, that they were going to turn into men or that their uterus would be damaged?
But Americans are preoccupied with their own experiences. That's an exact replication of the mindset that got us into Vietnam and that has now allowed Americans to remember the Vietnam War in a certain way that makes it an America war.
Until recently those payments by the drug company helped Catton save money on her medical out-of-pocket expenses, because they counted toward her family's $8,800 annual pharmacy deductible on their health plan.
Forty-three countries pledged a total of $10.3 billion to get the ball rolling for the first several years — though no exact time period was specified for how long that money is supposed to last. So far, the GCF has committed $2.2 billion to 43 projects.
About a month later, on Friday, April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that Americans wear cloth face coverings fashioned from household items or made at home from common materials ... as an additional, voluntary public health measure.

HIGGINS: Oh, I cannot for the life of me remember that man's name.
He's been removed, I think, for that position. There's someone else in charge of affairs in Ukraine. But I want to get to the bottom line here.
But Ethiopian artist Aïda Muluneh wants to help people understand that there's more to her country than what they typically see in the news.
Still, in the last Congress, there were 116 attacks against the Endangered Species Act, according to the Center for Biological Diversity. Bills and riders added to them were proposed to delist specific species, limit habitat protections, and to block funding for species like the New Mexico meadow jumping mouse. None passed into law.
CUMMINGS: It's important to me that I do this right because I have people now supporting this, underwriting it on Patreon.
GUNTON: Yeah. So that - we don't apply - attach these devices. The scientific researchers do this to some individuals so they can follow the packs for various parts of their scientific research. With the painted wolves, I don't think - it would - although we - the trackers were amazing. And actually, for long distance tracking, you sometimes can only do it by that kind of traditional tracking skills. But when you're closer, strangely, they're actually sometimes harder to find because they might be sleeping under a thicket or something like that. And that's when the radio tracking devices sometimes can help you zero in on them and find them.
So how will we get an answer to whether vaccinated people can infect others?
Mr. CHESNUTT: Yeah. This is how he taught me how to play guitar. My granddaddy, he would show me the chords to Sweet Georgia Brown in G, and then we would play that song for an hour without stopping, and while my granddad would play lead over it.
SIMON: Dalibor, what are some of the stories you've illustrated that stay with you that you think are most important for us to know?
But even then, his later answer made muddier exactly what he meant. Trump went on to say he didn't want to renegotiate but rather wanted to discount or refinance U.S. Treasurys. That could very well mean he still wanted to offer creditors lower rates, said one economist. But there's another reading.
INSKEEP: Are you - forgive me. Are you saying the president would seriously consider what Clyburn just put on the table there?
At one point he pleaded for an end to it. When Democratic Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. became especially impassioned, Gore stretched out his hands in a gesture of helplessness and said: I appreciate the gentleman from Illinois, but hey ...
YONG: It seems that way. So the spike consists of two halves, which must first be split apart for the virus to begin infecting a cell. And that split happens with some difficulty with SARS classic, but it seems to occur more readily with this new virus because the two halves can be separated by an enzyme called furin, which is quite widespread in the human body.
It's opened up the world of women's basketball to some of the great coaching minds on the men's side, Voepel says, which doesn't really happen in college [with the men's and women's basketball teams], even though they're on the same campus.
After seven years of renting, the Heges bought again for the first time last year.
PHILIP COURTER: Hi, Lulu. It's Phil.
So it's a bubbling, boiling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time so short you can't see them. So you might say okay, well that's fine. It's just due to them.
You told it to me! he tells her.
SYMMES: I say they're wrong. And I have confidence that the truth and integrity and character will win.
I really don't regret anything that I've done, in terms of my work. If I were writing a happily-ever-after piece, looking back, sure, there are things that would probably be better if they were erased and maybe not included at all. But I think I've learned from everything I've done. And I can't help but bring those experiences to what I do today.
JENKINS: While they don't miss shoveling snow, Joan says caucusing is still a part of their identity.
Metro by T-Mobile used to be a regional cell phone company a few years ago and has now branched out nationwide. Metro uses T-Mobile's HSPA+ and LTE network, as it is owned entirely by the larger carrier. T-Mobile's network has become one of the strongest networks in populated areas but even with all of the improvements, you should check the coverage map to be sure you're covered.
The novel coronavirus continues to spread around the globe, including a massive surge in South Korea, where more than 800 new cases were confirmed between Friday and Saturday and more than 3,000 people are now confirmed to have the virus. The South Korean government has urged its citizens to stay indoors.
Talk plans start at 250 minutes for $15/month or unlimited minutes for $20/month.
Trump did not explain why he waited until now to exercise this authority to invoke the DPA. He had come under increasing fire from Congressional Democrats in recent days for not doing so. One of his critics, Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., reacted favorably to Trump's change of heart. Instead of saying we have 'tremendous supplies,' the Trump Administration should start coordinating with the private sector to ensure America actually has the life-saving supplies we need, Reed said in a statement. Invoking the DPA is a needed step in the right direction.
GOLDFARB: And we had a conversation about the Violence Against Women Act. And I did my best to explain to him why it was important, why he should support it.
This year, the marches come in the midst of the #MeToo movement, a worldwide reckoning on sexual assault and harassment.
I was attracted to the idea of creating a character who does just have a lot of sex and doesn't need to kind of explain it away. So that was the first impulse was just, yeah, she just likes having a shag occasionally.
WOOD JR: My father was a radio personality in the city.
With Trump himself having joined the health professionals in his administration in acknowledging the reality of the crisis (It could be really bad), a sea change may be coming among his followers. On Tuesday, Falwell decided that Liberty would close after all.
The administration is also urging states to expand vaccination to more venues, such as convention center mega-sites, pharmacies and community health centers.
After months of stalemate over the size and scope of a coronavirus relief package in the closing weeks of the last Congress, a group of centrists from both parties, led by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, unveiled a $900 billion compromise plan that became the basis for the legislation that ultimately was approved by the House and Senate and signed by President Trump.
Section 230 lives inside the Communications Decency Act of 1996, and it gives websites broad legal immunity: With some exceptions, online platforms can't be sued for something posted by a user — and that remains true even if they act a little like publishers, by moderating posts or setting specific standards.
MALEK: Exactly. So I kept the mic on it just to remind people, hey, I'm not out to hurt anyone. It was the first thing we shot - Live Aid - day one. We came out, and it was - it's that massive crane shot that goes through the audience and comes right up around the piano and opens to Freddie Mercury - myself, playing him - singing Bohemian Rhapsody.
LANDAU: But I think there are always - when somebody gives you something for a headache, there are sometimes side effects. You get an upset stomach.
Amtrak spokeswoman Olivia Irvin told NPR that Eugene was the first destination for Coast Starlight Train 11 on Tuesday, with subsequent stops set for Portland, Ore., and then Seattle. But the ride remained rocky. Because of weather conditions, it's really slow and really stop and go, Irvin said.

People talk about how upset people are with Washington, but they were back then too, especially coming on the heels of the Watergate, Sears says. There's a great deal of anti-Washington feeling.
Changing or rearranging letters is not allowed, neither are plurals or verbs formed by adding -S. No word in the chain can have fewer than three letters.

PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Anywhere from 250- to 300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn't been checked. We think that if you check the signatures - a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County, you'll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures.
And Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., head of the Energy and Commerce Committee, announced a hearing on the impact of the ruling. He said he intends to hold lots of hearings to review the Trump administration's actions around the ACA — actions he calls sabotage.

California Health Care Workers Overwhelmed Amid COVID-19 Surge
All of which is to say that it's not clear the Trump campaign has settled positions on a range of economic policy issues. These kinds of clarifications and policy shifts give the Clinton campaign ample ammunition for attacking Trump in two ways: one, for potentially harmful economic policies, and two, for not having firm policy principles.
The new administration is claiming credit on both fronts, although much of the change so far is psychological.
Comic Michelle Wolf Responds To Backlash: 'I'm Glad I Stuck To My Guns': Though critics argued that the comedian's barbed monologue at Saturday's White House Correspondents' Dinner was too pointed, Wolf stands by her set: I wouldn't change a single word.

For context, in 2010, when asked about then-President Barack Obama, just 36 percent said they would definitely vote for him, while 48 percent said they would not. Obama went on to win with 51 percent of the vote.
Dr. McCarthy, it's nice to have you back with us on the program. Thanks for joining us.
For example, pushing back a hearing could mean an immigrant who qualifies for status now may not in the future if immigration policies are restricted. Or, if an immigrant doesn't have a strong claim for status, a delay means more time in the U.S. and maybe even qualifying for another form of immigration status in the interim.
A funeral procession moves through an intricately tiled arch at a holy shrine as a cold morning rain comes down. Here, honoring the dead, especially martyrs killed by Iran's enemies, is as natural as breathing. Students of all ages interested in the study of Shiite Islam come to Qom from all over the world.
DAVIES: This is FRESH AIR. And we're listening to Terry's interview with Henry Louis Gates. They spoke in front of an audience last May when Gates received WHYY's annual Lifelong Learning Award. The fifth season of Gates' TV series Finding Your Roots is now running on PBS. When we left off, Gates was talking about his own DNA mix. Testing showed he had ancestors from sub-Saharan Africa, Ireland and England.
Employers, however, may have a keen interest in the new data, says James Gelfand, senior vice president at the ERISA Industry Committee, which lobbies on behalf of large employers that offer health insurance to their workers. Employers will want to know how much they are paying each hospital compared with others in the area and how well their insurers stack up in negotiating rates, Gelfand says.
Prior to 2001, Allen tells host Neal Conan of then-Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger,in the very few public statements he had made about this crisis, he came off, to be frank, as just another Roman cardinal in denial.
Each detector looks like a big L, made up of two tunnels 2.5 miles long. It's designed so that if a gravitational wave passes by, it will stretch space along one direction of the tunnel and squish space along the direction of the other. The stretching and squishing changes the tunnels' lengths by a tiny amount, and that change can be detected by lasers.

CUMMINGS: Here's the thing. If I write an essay now and I say, here, I've written it over on Medium, just click over and read it - the odds are low that they will click. If I can figure out in this time of great change how to be adaptive and a little creative, I can wait and see where my opportunities are.

The Environmental Protection Agency adopted a new rule restricting the types of scientific studies its own regulators can use to rein in pollution, in the Trump administration's latest effort to undercut the use of science in establishing public health standards.
They're not particularly built for comfort, I will tell you that, Cornyn said. I keep sort of sliding out of it.
Station F is privately financed by French telecom billionaire Xavier Niel, who invested about $300 million to acquire and renovate the train depot. Microsoft and Facebook are just a few of the multinational corporations sponsoring incubators here.
SIMON: That makes sense to me somehow. Why does Darren become Buck, create his character over again?
IRWIN: Actually, it's sort of the opposite. A lot of the jobs that are being destroyed in apparel and furniture were low-paying jobs. And a lot of the jobs that are being created are in aircraft and high-tech - are high-paying jobs. But still that said, wages have been flat even though total compensation is up because health care costs are taking that wedge, that bite out of people's paycheck. So people don't think they've been getting a pay increase at all.
Out of concern for public health and safety, we are canceling tonight's rally in Cleveland, Mike Casca, Sanders' communications director, said in a statement. We are heeding the public warnings from Ohio state officials, who have communicated concern about holding large, indoor events during the coronavirus outbreak. Sen. Sanders would like to express his regret to the thousands of Ohioans who had planned to attend the event tonight.
Mr. CHESNUTT: But, you know, it was a great, I mean my parents did feel like I had a great gift. They said you've got a great gift. Your music, you have a great gift. You could be a great preacher. But you are doing the opposite of that, and it broke their hearts.
Zirinsky is known as a tough leader who inspires loyalty. She also inspired the lead character of the 1987 movie Broadcast News, played by Holly Hunter. She was a consultant on the film.
But asked if the poll itself bears some responsibility for these systemic gender issues, and whether or not they require intervention, his answer is noncommittal. I don't know, he says. That's a good question. You're asking it about the poll. You could be asking it about criticism and jazz journalism in general. Is it part of the industry or is it standing off to the side pointing? Martin Williams called his DownBeat column 'Bystander.' I like to think of myself more as a bystander. (Incidentally, Williams helped establish the idea that jazz could be judged objectively as an intellectual exercise by critics who were experts.)
She just looked over at me and gave me this nasty look, she says, and it's 8-something in the morning and all I want to do is get on this train. And then she says out loud to her traveling companion 'this woman is in my space.'

Heidi Thomas — the first of several women expected to take the stand against Bill Cosby in his criminal retrial – described to the court on Tuesday how the comedian lured her to his Nevada ranch in 1984, drugged her and then forced her to perform oral sex.
NGUYEN: Well, rice. I remember that we had just - my dad had built these racks and racks that were just stocked full of rice up into the rafters. And I remember going there after school and hiding up in these rafters amid these sacks of rice and all kind of, you know, Vietnamese fruits and things like fish sauce - nuoc mam, which is the lifeblood of Vietnamese cuisine. And there was always a certain kind of odor in the Vietnamese grocery store that I came to recognize, which was the scent of rice and fruit and spices that you cannot find anywhere else - a certain kind of mustiness, which I assume might have been alien to Americans but to Vietnamese people was the smell of comfort.

Some Trump backers say they're worried about ISIS. Others say the economy is their top concern. But every person eventually returns to the same central quality he is most passionate about in the likely Republican nominee: the fact that he's not a typical politician.
Mr. CHESNUTT: ...every conversation I had with them from that time - about 12 years old until they died - was tinted with this disappointment and also them telling me well, you know, you're going to go to hell.

When the U.S. Capitol Police placed the congressional complex on lockdown, many senators were brought to that secure location, she said, adding that others were still being brought in from around the congressional complex.
Sutton has received accolades for his paper's investigative work, as Ingber reported: In the 1990s, Ole Goodloe exposed corruption in the Marengo County sheriff's department, receiving numerous awards for his investigative reporting, including a Hugh M.

That could be because many consumers carry types of insurance in which they pay flat-dollar copayments for such things as doctor visits, drugs or hospital stays — payments that have no correlation to the underlying charges.
The hypothesis that critical recognition is disproportionately limited to a small group of exceptional women is supported by a deeper analysis of the data for 2017, 2018 and 2019. The team researched the full personnel on every album that received a vote through publicly available information online (via individual artist and record label websites, Discogs and AllMusic.com). We documented whenever a recording included women as sidemen, essential members of an ensemble other than its leader; we will refer to them as core band members. We distinguished between these musicians, who are essential to a band, and others we who might be considered additional or ancillary personnel: those who performed as guests limited to a few album tracks or took on non-improvising roles, typically on non-traditional jazz instruments (such as background vocalists, and string and wind players employed on large ensemble arrangements).

MONTAGNE: Let's zoom out, though, for a moment on this whole subject of, really, civil rights, as we're talking about here. There has been a lot of race-related unrest in the St. Louis area recently. I mean, we remember Michael Brown was shot and killed in Ferguson in 2014. And now, also, this campaign for janitors' pay has that sort of aspect to it. Has there been no progress on racial issues in the aftermath of Ferguson?

But Hahn wanted to take a look: It was the first house he'd ever bought for himself. He and his wife purchased the house in the late '80s for $55,000 and moved out a few years later. Now, it was next to ruined.
And what was strange is almost immediately, they cut these little - I mean, steps is too grand, I think. They were little slices, little chinks. The penguins discovered it and out they went. And one after the other, one - they all got out. And I just think we all felt, how on Earth would you - you know, imagine the conversation if we said, we could've done that. And we just sat there and watched them all perish. So I think in that case - very unusual situation - we made the right decision.
It's making Romanians nervous, too, and helps explain why they are comforted by the U.S. Navy setting up a base in their country, even if the Americans say it's not about Russia.

Nancy Pelosi is on her way to another turn as speaker of the house. Earlier today, 203 Democrats voted to make her their party's nominee to be the top leader in the House and third in line for the presidency. Now, this does not mean Pelosi is totally in the clear. More than two dozen Democrats voted against her, but Pelosi says she is not worried.

Maybe there'll be some other lighter legislative initiatives that take place, but I'm a little bit skeptical. And then, if immigration reform is not done by the end of this year, it is highly unlikely that it would be done next year because it's an election year.

I really want that to be a cultural norm, she says.
Shortly before we spoke, Chinese authorities dramatically increased their reported number of Coronavirus cases, which was an adjustment because of the way that the counting is done, not necessarily an increase in the number of cases, but that leads to a question. Are you confident that you now know a reliable number of how many cases there are and have an idea of the full scope of the problem?

The big ones are the ones that wreak havoc in the cosmos. We now know they exist, something that Einstein was not pleased about. To him, an object that, at its very center, had a singularity, a point in space where gravity becomes infinitely strong and the laws of nature break down, was just unacceptable.
Ryan would not say Republican policies won't increase the deficit in the short term, but he reiterated a long-standing commitment to paying for new spending. We are fiscal conservatives. If we're going to be spending on things like say, infrastructure, we're going to find the fiscal space to pay for that in our spring budget, he said, referring to the annual budget resolution.

SOMMER: David Barclay is an assistant professor at Dalhousie University. He measured ocean noise in the waters near Vancouver, where those endangered killer whales live. He found there was about half as much noise in April compared to months prior.
And he is at a stage in his career where, given his confidence in his record, given the reputation that he's built in the legal community, that he is prepared I think to take on whatever unfair or unjust or wildly exaggerated claims that may be made by those who are just opposed to any nominee that I might make. Because he thinks it's important.
RICHEN: It was created by a man named Victor Green, Victor Hugo Green. First, you know, very good at branding, (laughter) called it the Green Book. And he was a postal worker based in Harlem. And he had a Jewish friend who had a guide to places in the Catskills where Jewish families could go and have recreation and pleasure and be safe. And he thought that would be a really good idea for African-Americans. He knew that we needed such a guide. He also had a wife named Alma, and Alma had family in Virginia. And they would go, and they'd travel from New York down to Virginia to visit family. So he experienced what it was like to drive on the segregated roads.
HADID: Because people worry that there might be another murderer. And it really just - it just gets to the heart of the problem in Kasur and generally in Pakistan - is that people don't trust the police. They don't trust the government. They see their officials as corrupt, inept, inefficient. And they see them as being subservient to the rich and contemptuous of the poor. And most of the families whose children were killed here are quite poor.
On Monday, armed Iranian forces boarded a South Korean tanker and are apparently holding it hostage until Seoul facilitates the release of some $7 billion of Iranian assets frozen in Korean banks. The following day, Iran launched significant exercises with military drones.
YONG: That's right. This virus is better at recognizing and latching on to human cells...
ALDA: I didn't. I didn't. But I do remember - you know, children are so much more aware than everybody gives them credit for. I remember thinking - 'cause when the chorus girls would take me up to their dressing room, you know, they would take me up, and they would comb my hair and talk to me. And I was like a mascot, like a little pet. And then they'd say, OK, Ally (ph), we're going to change our clothes now. Turn your back. And I'd stand with my face pressed against their costumes hanging on the wall, and I'd smell the perfume and I'd hear them behind me.
KUHN: Well, these - the two sides were supposed to come up with a new agreement before the old one expired last night. But the U.S. reportedly wants South Korea to increase its contribution by 50 percent, and Seoul says no. The Trump administration wants all U.S. allies to pay more, and it's focusing on South Korea first. The South Koreans are also somewhat unnerved by the resignation of Defense Secretary Mattis because he was a consistent advocate for the alliance. It's not clear that the U.S. Congress would allow any sort of pullout of U.S. troops, but any sign that the U.S. commitment to the defense of South Korea is wavering has Seoul very concerned.
Like so many issues, Americans view election security from opposite poles of the partisan divide, said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, which conducted the poll.
Noah Centineo plays Peter — a character who's more open to emotion and vulnerability than your average dude. They say, you know, hard on the outside and then soft and mushy on the inside, and with Peter, it's genuinely true, he says. I feel like you can't say 'Break my heart into a thousand pieces,' and 'I love you' without being vulnerable. Those are very very honest statements. And I feel like that's what we all want ... And being pent up and not releasing your emotion is something that as men for a very long time, we've been conditioned to think is normal. And it's led to so many psychiatric ailments.

But picking up Pennsylvania is Trump's most feasible route to the White House. This path is dependent on Trump being able to use his populist, protectionist and anti-globalization rhetoric to fire up white, working-class voters affected by outsourcing in the Rust Belt and Upper Midwest, NPR Political Editor Domenico Montanaro put it in NPR's initial electoral college analysis last week.
So by being a long distance away and just letting the camera on its own, you know, he was able to spend four hours filming those cubs, which, I don't think it would be possible any other way.

I mean, people never get that close to them and able to film like that.
That came as a relief to those who had taken seriously his threat to come to the Capitol on Jan. 29 as originally planned, with or without the blessing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.

SCHLAPP: The Democrats' demand is not going to work because of the fact that they don't even want to have a discussion with the president. The president has asked time and time again to come to a compromise, and they refuse to do so. So we want to open the government. We want the Democrats to come to the table. We want to secure the border where we have seen increased crime, where we have seen increased gang activity, where we have to deal with a decades old problem. And it's time we - and we have put forward a good faith proposal, and yet we have no answer coming from the Democrats.

Schumer told reporters early Monday morning that Democrats see this bill as their best opportunity to provide the most help. This bill is going to affect this country and the lives of Americans not just for the next few days, but in the next few months and years — so we have to make sure it is good, he said.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: You could also name your baby B.J. Leiderman. He wrote our theme music.
SAGAL: All right, your first quote is from, naturally and inevitably, the president of the United States.
Well, you know, you can't look at that in a vacuum because as we're trying to get people to adhere uniformly to public health measures, we're having the rollout of the vaccine. We have a highly efficacious vaccine, 94% to 95% effective. As the months go by, I would expect by the time we get to April, it will be what we call open season on vaccines. Everyone will be able to get a vaccine. So I think by the end of the summer, if we get 70% to 85% of the population vaccinated and get a good herd immunity, I think by the fall we could start to approach some form of normality.
GATES: ...Of Finding Your Roots. Yeah. Would you do it?
Asked by NPR about the Surgeon General's earlier tweet about the ineffectiveness of masks, the office of the Surgeon General issued a statement Thursday noting that back in February Dr. Adams was following the CDC, WHO and other health organizations, which all recommended against wearing masks as a way to protect the person wearing them. The statement said that the understanding on spread from infected individuals who have not shown symptoms has since changed.
Just how much latitude Austin ultimately gets remains to be seen.

In September 2018, Rhodes' boss, then-CBS Chairman Leslie Moonves, stepped down as he faced multiple accusations of sexual harassment and assault (which he denies). Days later, Rhodes fired then-60 Minutes Executive Producer Jeff Fager, who had sent a threatening message to a CBS journalist reporting on accusations that he tolerated a hostile workplace for women. Fager would ultimately face allegations of sexual harassment as well, which he also denied.
Although Biden secured the most prominent endorsements in Virginia, the state's black leadership and the wider party have no clear favorite. Various members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus endorsed Biden, Bloomberg and Warren; and all six top presidential contenders have garnered endorsements from state lawmakers in the General Assembly. Congressman Don Beyer supports Buttigieg, comparing him to former President Obama at a recent rally in Arlington.
1. Creating a committee to address climate change. The panel will not have subpoena power or the ability to introduce legislation so it will not be as powerful as a similar committee created by Pelosi during the previous Democratic majority from 2007 to 2011, but the issue is expected to be a major priority for the party's progressive wing.

This isn't the only example of a change or updating of mask-wearing policies during the coronavirus crisis. It's happened in countries around the world — from Singapore to Austria to Kenya (which just announced one of the world's strictest policies — police are arresting anyone caught without a mask in their vehicle, on a bus or in a public place.)
The North has now had four nuclear tests — enough, according to many experts, for it to figure out the basics of miniaturization. Its progress has gotten the U.S. military's attention. Earlier this month, Adm. Bill Gortney, who heads the North American Aerospace Defense Command, told lawmakers: It's the prudent decision on my part to assume that [Kim Jong Un] has the capability to miniaturize a nuclear weapon and put it on an ICBM.

Carly Novell, the school's newspaper editor, wrote on Twitter: Do you want me to take my shoes off when I walk into school as well?
R. SHAHIN: The change in status for teachers came about from what was a palpable contempt for what teachers did by legislators and policymakers because most times, you know, parents and teachers are on the same page. They want to do what's best for the children that are in their charge, which is something I think the - people who have never done it don't understand that link and can't understand why it's so vital that it's a people activity, not a business activity.
Mercer is preoccupied with the country's monetary and banking systems, which he sees as hopelessly compromised by government meddling, Bloomberg wrote, quoting people who know him.

But is everyone on the same page? Far from it. Among the surprising revelations in recent days is the persistence of popular denial regarding the crisis itself. As of March 15, the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found only a bare majority of Americans (53%) are worried the virus could infect someone in their family.

I mean, he's an extraordinary fit and healthy man. But I, nevertheless, had that responsibility. And nobody wants to be the person who killed David Attenborough.
KLAIN: I don't think that's a problem. It is a big country, and it's hitting the countries - the country at different times. I think it's a problem that Washington hasn't provided clear leadership. The Trump administration hasn't provided clear guidance on what the restrictions should be, how long they should last and what we should expect to see. I mean, that is, I think rather than assuming we should have a conversation about what day this should change, the thing is what conditions need to be present to make it change?

Strengthening our HR function. A strong HR function is essential in our work to improve our culture. We have elevated the senior-most position in HR to Chief HR Officer, we are adding capacity to the team with dedicated HR support at each of our sites, we have redefined priorities to increase company-wide efforts to improve training and foster an inclusive work place, and we are developing ways to increase executive accountability and increase employee engagement.
SAGAL: No, stole a bulldozer and crushed 50 brand-new cars. Furious that he may lose his job, the man assured he would lose his job by stealing one of the factory's bulldozers, driving it to a parking lot and smashing over 50 cars with it. He then tried to drive it inside of the factory to the production line but was stopped by security officers before he made it. Look. It is a car factory. It's not the U.S. Capitol. Oof. Bill, how did Maeve do on our quiz?
Initially, the online calculator that the federal Department of Health and Human Services provided to help large employers gauge compliance with the minimum value standard gave the green light to plans that didn't cover hospitalization services or more than a few doctor visits a year.

Frankly, knowing what cell phone carrier to go for is an exercise in patience.

SIMON: I'm wondering how you feel today.
And I think he is convinced that he can do a really good job, partly because he has relationships with the judges that are already on the court, and he's shown himself to be a consensus builder. And he believes, rightly, that we're at a time where the more consensus we can forge, the better off we're going to be.

NFL investigators made repeated attempts — both orally and in writing — to obtain any and all evidence and relevant information in this case from the King County [Washington] Sheriff's Office. Each of those requests was denied and the Sheriff's Office declined to provide any of the requested information, which ultimately limited our ability to fully investigate this matter. We concluded our own investigation, more than a year after the initial incident, based on the facts and evidence available to us at the time and after making exhaustive attempts to obtain information in a timely fashion. It is unfortunate that we did not have the benefit or knowledge of these materials [the documents released Wednesday] at the time.

Making comedy about comedy, he blazed the trail for such later masters of showbiz meta as Steve Martin, David Letterman and Bill Murray. By the late '70s, Brooks was making movies, starting with three groundbreaking comedies that explored the triumph of modern narcissism in all its cringe-worthy hilarity. The greatest of these is Lost In America, just out in in a gorgeous, new package from the Criterion Collection that I highly recommend - but also widely streamable.

Tyreece Gilder, 32, is the team's head coach. Gilder says if the NCAA recognized women's wrestling, there would be an immediate boost in opportunities for women wrestlers seeking to compete at the collegiate level.

An important detail is that the switching over of detecting apparatus must be faster than the time the photon has to travel to the detectors. This way, there is no way the photon could know what to do. (If a photon knows anything, anyway.) Experiments presented in October extended the range of the photon's trip to about 2,200 miles, and still the photon seems to always choose the path consistent with the delayed choice. It is as if — Mike McRae wrote in this Science Alert piece — that even after the horse has bolted 2,200 miles out of the gate, it can still wait until the finish line to decide which race it ran. That is, which path to the finish line it took.
When Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar tweeted a few days ago about the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, she repeated what are viewed as anti-Semitic characterizations of the powerful lobbying group - that the group's money drives U.S. policy towards Israel.

But covering baseball is complicated, in large part because of its astronomical popularity in and equally important fan bases in the U.S. and Latin America. When you speak about baseball, it speaks to Latinos on both sides of their being, Rolón said. There's a question of identity and how that is mixed between your country of origin and the country that you are part of and you live in. That is very much a fabric of baseball.

According to a memo by Commerce Department Inspector General Peggy Gustafson, multiple whistleblowers at the bureau reported that they are concerned Census Bureau Director Steven Dillingham was trying to rush out a data report on noncitizens that would be statistically indefensible and could be misinterpreted, misused, or otherwise tarnish the Bureau's reputation.

Next week's challenge: This week's challenge comes from listener Joe Krozel of Creve Coeur, Mo., and it might require a little research. There is a city somewhere in the United States with a population of about 24,000 people. Change the last letter in the name of its state. If you now read the name of the city plus the altered name of its state together, the result is a palindrome — that is, it reads backward and forward the same. What city is it?
Several Republican lawmakers who publicly backed the objections were meeting Wednesday evening to decide whether they would follow through with those challenges, as pressure mounted on them to stand down after an angry mob rifled through desks on the Senate floor, posted pictures in top leaders' offices and were photographed with Confederate flags in the hallways outside the Senate chamber.
And I think back to this one particular incident. And I'm like - you know, they were shot. And they weren't shot badly. I mean, they were released from the hospital the next day.

We worked for this family friend in her grocery store. And within a few months or maybe a year, we - my parents opened their own Vietnamese grocery store not far away.

And so from One Newark onward, which started in the fall of 2013, no family automatically was sending a child to a neighborhood school. They had to go online and pick one of 60-something schools in the city - some charter, some district - and then algorithm would sort whether they got into that school. In theory, it's a great idea because everybody wants to be able to choose the right school for their kid, but it was a huge upheaval in the way people had always lived in Newark. And at the same time, she was closing, consolidating and rearranging the district schools to make way for the charter school growth and to basically downsize the district, which already had lost a lot of kids to charter schools.

So part of it, as I say, is understanding the reaction of the animals. And they are all habituated, to some degree, in the sense that they're observed by scientists or naturalists. And so they are used to human presence. And, you know, the chimpanzee film that we were talking about is - you know, that was an interesting one. When you turn up there after having been away for a while, David, the chimpanzee, the alpha male, will look at the crew and sort of think - maybe just give them a stare or do something, and sort of say, I remember you.

After the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris deal sparked pledges of money and solidarity, Figueres said via Twitter on Friday, Thank you Trump. You have provoked an unparalleled wave of support for Paris and determined resolve on climate action. Deeply grateful.
And I would expect that the senators who've been elected by their constituents will find in themselves the kind of respect for this incredible democratic experiment that our founders crafted, that they're not going to want to see it continue to degenerate into just a bunch of poll-driven, negative-ad-driven, polarized name-calling, because that's not what made us the greatest country on Earth.

It's really an opportunity to do a deeper dive into understanding more about which element has had the greatest contribution to the drop in emergency room visits, Simoneau says. This is something we, as both clinicians and researchers, have been struggling with for quite some time, and yet this pandemic was quite effective in showing us what works. We just have to tease apart the things that could be really useful for the future.
Listen, the four most powerful words in a democracy are: 'The people have spoken.' The people of Georgia spoke very clearly on Nov. 3, when they elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris and gave them our 16 electoral votes, Warnock said on NPR. We counted those votes three times. It is clear, when you look at the swing states all across our country, Joe Biden is the president-elect. Unfortunately, there are enablers of this nonsense in the United States Senate. And that's why the people who I'm running into all across Georgia are frustrated with politics.

The other part of it is that there's - every four years - the discussion of does my vote really matter?

Provision of those commodities will continue, spokesman William Booher said.

Even though the pre-authorization studies of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines were as streamlined as possible, they still required quite a lot of work. Each of the 75,000 volunteers had to come into a clinic; get a test for the coronavirus; get either a vaccine or a placebo shot (without knowing which they'd received); return for a second shot; and come back to the clinic for testing anytime in the interim if they showed any symptoms of having caught the virus.

There's no question that climate change is real. There's work we need to do on that front, he said. I think too often, even in the places where there is agreement, at least among ordinary people that we need movement, we get no movement. And that's quite frankly because someone other than the people own our democracy. And so one of the things that I'll be very focused on is the outsized influence of well-connected corporate interests in our politics.

There's a big reason Cruz and others are making that kind of pitch here days before the first votes cast in this presidential campaign season — Iowa's evangelical voters have carved a well-worn path for past Iowa winners.

I think the real accountability for this rests with the Trump administration and his core supporters. [The election marked] a repudiation of this politics in the national political arena. But we have to continue that process, that those members of Congress who have supported this politics need to be voted out of office. And I think ultimately that is the most important form of accountability here, is the kind of popular rejection of this kind of white nationalist extremist politics. Trying to use the criminal justice system to fix those political problems is not the right way to go and is unlikely to be successful.

With Haley, we see a multi-dimensional (and, in fact, multicultural) tilt to America's ongoing struggle with race.

And it was against this backdrop that Muthukumar and several hundred of her colleagues did something this week rarely seen in Silicon Valley: they formed a labor union.
Another victim of West Wing internal wars was Cliff Sims, a young blogger from Alabama brought into the campaign by Bannon in 2016. Sims' Team of Vipers appeared in early 2019 and foretold some of the infighting that would be featured in other accounts. Sims, however, remained basically loyal to Trump. The same could not be said for national security adviser John Bolton, who blistered his former boss in The Room Where It Happened. And the deepest cuts of all might have been those by Michael Cohen, formerly Trump's personal lawyer and fixer, whose Disloyal appeared in September 2020.
At the protest's heart are escalating frustrations with pay and financial support for schools — similar to those that have motivated teachers in several other states to walk out since a showdown in West Virginia ended with a salary bump for educators there.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., argues that the resolution could also prevent the Senate and the American people from learning the full scope of claims against the president.

SNELL: Yeah. So the basics are that Vice President Mike Pence will preside over these proceedings alongside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Republicans will have the chance to object to each state individually. And we expect that to start with Arizona. Texas Senator Ted Cruz and a group of others will start their objections there. And I'm told they plan to focus on calls for an electoral commission, not setting aside the election result. We hear that there are about six states that could be at issue. Though, it could be more, it could be less. And it could drag on all night because each objection opens them up to hours of debate. You know, Congress is expected to vote to certify the states with little trouble in the end. And we understand that Vice President Pence intends, as we are told, to follow the law as he presides.

Emily is a good example. She's 27. She's married. Both she and her husband are employed, yet neither of them can afford to buy even the tiniest apartment in the neighborhood where they grew up. Property prices here are some of the highest in the world. And locals blame an influx of wealthy mainland Chinese, who they say are buying up property, making it impossible for them to thrive. And the numbers seem to back this up. The wealth gap in Hong Kong is at its widest since China took control of the city 20 years ago.
But sometimes it can be hard to grasp what all the numbers and stats mean. For instance, when scientists say Earth's average surface temperature has gone up about 1 degree Celsius over the past 150 years or so, what does that really mean? Besides, hasn't Earth's temperature always fluctuated?
Whatever is motivating voters, though, the economy for now underpins Trump's reelection message. If the coronavirus (and fears about it) further rattle the U.S. economy, however, it could mean an entirely new backdrop for November's election.

And I think they didn't make me do these kinds of things because they wanted me to study.

Don't let anyone tell you who you are. You tell them who you are. ... That is actually something my grandmother used to say often to my aunt, my mom and to me. ... You are the only person who has power to define who you are — what your ambitions are and what your impact on the world will be. No one else should have the power to do that. And I think inherent in that is, again, claiming your ambition.
MOORE: Right. And you see a shot of me in church looking from the - Jesus, the statue of Jesus, and Elvis playing guitar, and then to Jesus and Elvis and Jesus and Elvis and Jesus and Elvis.

And he apparently said in somebody's book - he is quoted in somebody's book as having said, there's only one leading lady that I didn't sleep with. And guess what? I know who she is.
The laws of physics prohibit traveling backwards in time for many reasons. If we did travel backwards in time and changed the course of events, we would be altering the course of history. An example often cited is the grandfather's paradox: If you traveled back in time and killed your grandfather when he was still a high school student, he wouldn't have met your grandmother and your father and you wouldn't exist.
As Adawe continued to sound an alarm about skin bleaching, she realized that warning people about the health risks of toxic chemicals wasn't necessarily enough to change behaviors. So long as the belief that lighter skin is inherently preferable persisted, women would likely keep bleaching, she thought. So she decided to tackle the issue from another direction.
Part of the problem is that inequality has a new face, according to a new report by the United Nations Development Programme.

This study was, ahem, shocking. We know boredom is uncomfortable, but how uncomfortable? Timothy Wilson and his colleagues at the University of Virginia and Harvard investigated. They left participants alone in a room for 15 minutes with nothing but their thoughts and a device that administers painful electric shocks.

One guy shocked himself 190 times.

When asked Monday during a White House briefing whether campaigns should cancel big events, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the answer depended on the prevalence of the coronavirus in the community.
So much of our imagined science-fiction futures have been written by white men. Black voices have rarely been given room in popular culture to explore their conceptions of what a future could, or should, look like. And while the original Black Panther was the vision of white men, the image and world brought to screen is one created by black screenwriter Ryan Coogler and team. One of the most compelling aspects of the Black Panther story is that Africans, though Wakanda, have fully won the future. It is from that position that T'Challa's begins to reconsider Wakanda's place in the world. This is the essence of the hero's choice.

And if you don't? Then regulations can be challenged in court — as those of the Trump administration were dozens of times. That's something Biden officials will take pains to avoid, said Calsyn.

A top hypothesis that this strain is more infectious comes from a study looking at how much virus a person generates in the nose. The research found preliminary evidence that people infected with B.1.1.7 are more likely to have high levels of virus inside their upper respiratory tracts, so that when they cough, sneeze, talk or scream, they likely expel more virus into the air. More virus in the air likely means you infect more people around you.

There was a definite shift in activity in the chamber Wednesday. Senate pages ran question cards and notes back and forth — in addition to their usual duties of running water and mail to senators' desks.

Avoid other people indoors as much as possible. Before the new strain, Adam Squires, an associate professor of biochemistry at the University of Bath, recommended taking three of the following four measures before any encounter in an indoor situation: opening windows; masking up; keeping it less than 20 minutes; staying at least 6 feet apart. Now he suggests taking all four measures ... or, better yet, don't meet indoors at all. And if you can order your groceries online, do it, Gaunt says.

For all the attention the Iowa caucuses get, even in a high turnout year, less than 20% of eligible voters will come out to caucus. People have to miss work or take a time out of their evening in order to participate.

Kate Payne of Iowa Public Radio and Jimmy Jenkins of KJZZ bring this report on how Iowa Democrats are trying to respond to those concerns.

In 2020, Woodward came out with Rage, based largely on extensive interviews he had done with Trump on tape. Among other stunning revelations, we learned how much Trump knew in early February about the emerging COVID-19 virus. Even as he dismissed it publicly as just like the flu and promised one day it will just disappear, Trump knew better. Trump did not bother to deny or dispute Woodward's account. He apparently felt secure in the knowledge that Woodward's target audience did not include much of his own, and evidence would suggest that was correct. Woodward's account did not produce a notable change in the president's approval rating, nor was it identifiable as a factor in November.

RICHEN: Absolutely, yeah. If your car breaks down, we can't all - you know, not all of us know how to change a tire on the road. So auto repair and gas stations were definitely a big part of the Green Book.
CHANG: Why do you think Merrick Garland in particular was chosen, particularly to step - to be in the job after someone like Bill Barr? What are the issues that are left to be resolved at the Justice Department after Bill Barr's departure?
Heinrich had been suspected in the two abductions, as well as in a string of eight sexually motivated assaults on young boys in Paynesville, Minn., where he lived. But at the time, the physical evidence wasn't considered to be enough to link him to the crimes.
Among the best-known figures on the list is Stephen Moore, founder of the conservative Club for Growth, and a frequent TV, radio and newspaper commentator.
Mr. CHESNUTT: I was in my mid-20s. And that's the thing about a suicidal person, I think, is that, you know, I mean, right after my mom died was, like, one of my last suicide attempts. It really destroyed me. My dad had died a year before, and that was the end of my whole close family, who had all died off within two or three years of each other: my grandpa, my grandma, my other grandma, my mom and my dad. They all died off in a couple of years. And so I felt lost, and I was depressed. But also you see - a suicidal person, when you see somebody else die of natural causes or whatever, for me it's also a kind of wakeup call.
But if the stellar core is too heavy, neutrons can't stop gravity. The neutrons in the core will keep getting squeezed, and gravity will keep getting stronger. With no brakes, the process just keeps going on until gravity is so strong that not even light can escape from its neighborhood, and a black hole is born.
We had a very candid conversation. He's chief judge of the D.C. Circuit, so I assume that he either reads The Washington Post or listens to NPR, and I think had a pretty good sense of the posture that Majority Leader McConnell took immediately after Justice Scalia's passing — the notion that the Republican senators would not consider any nominee, no way, no how.
AWA is responsible for restoring David and Bathsheba, one of her paintings that was found after being hidden in a Florentine palazzo's attic for 3 1/2 centuries.
Slovaks are having an existential crisis, she says. They worry that people will come here and build mosques and change life as they know it.
As a result, farm debt is projected to pass $372 billion this year. Adjusting for inflation, that's the most farm debt since the late 1970s, when the rural economy began to melt down. But Kauffman says today's numbers are not a sign of history repeating.
Brown and Mercer eventually were named to head Renaissance.
Brownson, Shi and Gostin all say that the heads of government should lead by example, practicing what they preach.
Globally, skin bleaching is a multibillion-dollar business. According to a 2017 market research study by Global Industry Analysts, the market for skin lightening products is anticipated to exceed $31 billion by 2024, with the Asia-Pacific region representing the fastest-growing market.
We don't have a crystal ball, but as journalists covering global health and development, we have a pretty good nose for emerging trends (with some help from our favorite expert sources).
KING: So the races in Georgia were both close. Warnock pulled off a win. What do we learn from Georgia?
The charter schools, while starting out with less money, get more of it to the classroom. So they get, like, $12,000 to $13,000 per student. And what they do with that money is really critical because they actually use the resources to support kids who would otherwise have a lot of trouble learning because of the issues that growing up in poverty cause for them. So, you know, there are children who literally - and it's not unusual. Children suffer trauma in Newark from having grown up amid violence, family strife and constant instability in their homes.
SIMON: And why was he on the stand this week?
LANDAU: Not really, no. Steve was very different physically than I was. I was very lean and very dark and much more ethnic in feel. And Steve was - I think he was much more competitive with a very close friend of mine called Jimmy Dean, James Dean. I was in a different sort of category. Johnny Cassavetes and Sydney Pollack and those kinds of fellows were my competition.
I find that finding new ways to express myself is very, very important. Like, I drew some character without even meaning to. I don't draw very well at all. But the other night, I drew this character, and it's this cute little — it resembles Mr. Potato Head. And he looks super sad and super exhausted ... And I was like, you know what? ... That's my inner Mr. Potato Head. And so in that moment, it sounds ridiculous, maybe. But, you know, that cartoon character was such an honest reflection of my inner state that it almost was as if I finally had accepted that. And I feel better because of it.
FADEL: NPR's Tom Gjelten was at the rally and joins us now.
The people of Venezuela have courageously spoken out against Maduro and his regime and demanded freedom and the rule of law, President Trump said in a statement. He pressed other governments to recognize Guaidó and pledged to use the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power to press for the restoration of Venezuelan democracy.
SASSE: Yeah. I think that the less the president does over the next 12 days, the better. You mentioned delegating responsibilities during this period to the vice president. In the midst of all of the pain and ugliness of the present, it is worth us pausing and affirming the fact that Mike Pence acted as a patriot through this. Mike Pence fulfilled his obligations on Wednesday. While blood was being shed at the people's Capitol, the president was actively rage tweeting against his vice president because the vice president was fulfilling his oath of office to the Constitution to affirm the fact that Joe Biden won because Joe Biden won, and the Congress' duty was to count and announce that Joe Biden had won.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Could these malicious actors have actually changed people's votes?
Zirinsky had been strongly considered by Rhodes and acting CBS Corp. CEO Joe Ianniello to run 60 Minutes, by far the network's most prestigious and most profitable news program. Instead, she will oversee the news division, and choosing 60 Minutes' top executive will be among her first and most important decisions.
And the conventional wisdom is that a strong economy helps buoy incumbent presidents to reelection — for decades, election prediction models have factored in economic indicators like unemployment and GDP growth. (Trump knows this, and he often trumpets it at his rallies and on Twitter.)
Cuddy, a body language expert, has built much of her career on power poses. In addition to a myriad of speaking engagements, she's been widely featured in the media including the Wall Street Journal, New York Times and CNN discussing the benefits of and science behind power posing.
Trump alluded on Tuesday to what he now says people were saying about simply enduring the pandemic and made clear he rules out that approach.
The government of Italy has imposed mass restrictions across its northern region, limiting the movement of more than 16 million people, as it fights to control the coronavirus outbreak there.
SAGAL: No, it's speaker - speaker of the House.
There were debates, handshakes and deals before a final vote that all came down to the state of Mississippi.
There are a lot of good deals with MVNOs that fit all kinds of needs, whether you need unlimited data plan or just a little for a spare phone. But they allow you to get many of the same perks as the big four, often at a lower price and without a contract.
MCAMMON: That's retired General David Petraeus. Thanks so much for talking with us.
SAGAL: So quick, before we fall behind any more, give us a call. The number is 1-888-WAITWAIT. That's 1-888-924-8924. It's time to welcome our first listener contestant. Hi, you are on WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME.
SIMON: But, Allison, we know there's a shortage of masks for health care workers who need them.
Each day of the shutdown means thousands of cases will be pushed back indefinitely, according to Ashley Tabaddor, president of the National Association of Immigration Judges. Tabaddor said she currently has around 2,000 cases before her court in Los Angeles, while some judges have upwards of 4,000.
KURTIS: Well, she wrote a book while she's been playing.
BILL KURTIS: From NPR and WBEZ Chicago, this is WAIT WAIT... DON'T TELL ME - the NPR News quiz. I'm Bill Kurtis. We are playing this week with Maeve Higgins, Joel Kim Booster and Amy Dickinson. And here again is your host, a man who calls working from home being removed from office - Peter Sagal.
A number of these projects need money, she says, and it's not clear that the city will have enough time to raise the money that they need to fund these rather ambitious projects.
Mr. CHESNUTT: Well, like when my friends have died or something like that, it made me feel silly. My sorrow seemed silly and that I'm not ready to go. As I said in the song, the sweet relief, I'm not - I don't deserve the sweet relief of death yet, because I haven't accomplished my tasks yet.
Their primary work was to look very, very hard at equity trading. After some effort, some several years of effort, they were able to produce a system that was hugely profitable, Patterson says.
But his most shocking endorsement came over the weekend, when he told CNN's Jake Tapper he was backing progressive Tim Canova in his primary challenge to Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.). It's highly unusual for a sitting member of Congress to endorse against another incumbent, but was unprecedented for a presidential candidate to do so, let alone the leader of the party whose nomination he's seeking.

KAPLAN-LEVENSON: The hearings had an impact on Congress, but VAWA still hadn't reached bipartisan support. They needed the endorsement of a key Republican in the Senate Judiciary Committee - Orrin Hatch. Hatch was an ultraconservative from Utah. And so support for any Democratic bill was not a given. But the thing is, like most people, he knew someone.
Friedman says some things are challenging, like having to terminate an employee over video conference. But overall, he says, the company's setup actually improved communication and coordination.
Well, now to our Friday political commentators, columnists David Brooks of The New York Times, who's with me in the studio, and E.J. Dionne of The Washington Post, who's at Iowa Public Radio in Ames, Iowa. Hello to both of you.
Forty-one percent of those surveyed said they believed the U.S. is not very prepared or not prepared at all to keep November's election safe and secure.
FLATOW: What do you mean anymore?
RICHEN: As we were, you know, developing the film and finding the stories, the women owners became, you know, a real part of what we were finding - a real part of the, you know, how we were telling the story. And at one point, we looked in the Green Book, as they're all online, and there were just tons of these advertisements that women had sent in - women business owners had sent in. That's one of the backbones of our community, African-American women.
(SOUNDBITE OF JOHN BEASLEY'S I MEAN YOU)
We fully understand that PG&E must re-earn trust and credibility with its customers, regulators, the communities it serves and all of its stakeholders, and we are continuing to make changes that reinforce PG&E's commitment to safety and improvement, the statement read.
SAGAL: Because it spelled out A-S-S-O-L, which is, as...
GM says only a small number of the cars produced in Mexico are sold in the U.S., but that's a detail that may not register with the public.
His dangerous views do not represent Alabama or the small-town papers in Alabama that do great work every day, Sen. Doug Jones, a Democrat, said in a tweet. The good people of Linden deserve so much better than these racist rants and I am confident they will get it with new editor, Elecia Dexter.
ALLAM: So just a lot of chilling rhetoric like that, people everywhere, you can barely move and, again, very minimal security presence. And we could hear the mob start to bang on the doors and just really looking for any way into that building.
The way people raise funds, the way they raise money during legislative debates is disgusting. Fundamentally, this goes back to the demand side problem. We have - again, I want to be clear. It is a minority of America, but we have somewhere between four and 14% of Americans who are identifying their political tribe as their most important community. And it's not a community of love. It's just - they're anti-communities. They're communities of hate.
Senior career officials at the bureau instructed the internal team assigned to carry out Trump's presidential memo to stand down and cease their work immediately on Tuesday night, according to a bureau employee who spoke to NPR on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation in the workplace for speaking out.
And those will kind of come up every so often and I would think, 'I would have said that', but, he says, there's no one there to get the joke. It's sort of like you're the last speaker of this language that no one knows anymore.
I'm really excited about bringing people's faces and experiences into a conversation where folks from the south, Black folks, Black women, people of color and in some low wealth communities have not been at the table. Harper said. They have not been a part of the fabric. They have not been in an opportunity to lead and to contribute. I think that Georgia spoke very loudly in the last election, so it's very clear that we are an integral point of moving what needs to be moved forward.
On if we should we take a clue from this when we read other studies
You do not try out for being a government witness by going on television. I've never heard of a government witness that the government took, and the way the government was induced to take him as a witness is he went on television. First of all, government prosecutors get very nervous when they see witnesses who go on television because they say even though they tell me they're going to keep it quiet, they're going to be the guys who leak on me. Number two, he's gotten caught in two or three big lies. Almost irrelevant big lies. This is important. Irrelevant big lies. I'll give you the biggest one. He said that at the Hanukkah party in 2018 the president took us all aside, took us into a room, and basically the president deputized him, told him my mission and deputized him. First of all, the president didn't even know about it then.
I love boleros — I've really fallen in love with them over the past few years, learning more about them and their history. I wanted to put a touch of that in the song. This one is pretty autobiographical: the story of me meeting my lady and that feeling of being like, 'Oh my gosh, this person is so special.' And the fear that comes with that, of 'I don't want to screw it up.'
DAVIES: We'll talk with Joseph Turow about his new book, The Aisles Have Eyes. Hope you can join us. FRESH AIR's executive producer is Danny Miller. Our technical director and engineer is Audrey Bentham additional engineering support from Joyce Lieberman and Julian Herzfeld. Our associate producer for online media is Molly Seavy-Nesper. Roberta Shorrock directs the show. Terry Gross returns Monday. I'm Dave Davies.
SNELL: Well, this was a pretty strong vote. But no, it's not all over. There is a big vote on the House floor in January. It's one of the very first things that they do when they come back. After all the new members are sworn in, all the new members of Congress will sit down on the House floor and vote for who they want for speaker. Now, Pelosi came out and talked to reporters before they were even done counting the votes inside of that closed-door Dem caucus. And she was in a pretty celebratory mood, and it's not just about being speaker. It was kind of like a second victory lap for the election. Here's what she said.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Have you spoken to any U.S. government representatives? Have you been able to sort of speak to embassies or consulates?
And so that's one of the other major threads is, did the universe really go through this growth spurt. And thanks to the instrumentation we now have, particularly measurements of the microwave background, we're starting to test this idea. And what we might do in the next 10 years, probably more likely than solving dark energy, is to figure out when and if inflation took place. And if it really did take place, it could be a clue to this unification of the forces.
According to the 2014 AP report, there has been an increase in people of color in sports newsrooms, but most of the progress can be attributed to the diversity found at ESPN. For instance, if the male columnists of color employed by ESPN were removed from the total number of sports staffers at the over 100 newspapers and websites AP reviewed, the percentage of columnists of color would drop from more than 17 percent to three percent.

KAPLAN-LEVENSON: A kernel that suddenly made her see this was as basic as could be. This was about civil rights.
GROSS: Right. So what was it like to play opposite him?
A woman shot during pro-Trump insurrectionists' assault on the Capitol today has died according to the Metropolitan Police spokeswoman Kristin Metzger.
Answer: Here's an example of one possible answer: WHOLE --> HOLE, HOE, HOPE, OPE, COPE, COP, COOP, COOPT, COOT, COT, COAT, CAT, CHAT, HAT, HEAT --> HEART.
CHERYL SEBRELL: We have trouble attracting and keeping good teachers. Sometimes we have substitutes keeping a class for half of the year.
An assault on the United States Capitol failed to prevent the confirmation of Joe Biden as the next president. Early this morning, a little bit before 4 o'clock Eastern Time, Congress formally finished counting the electoral votes, and Vice President Pence brought down the gavel to end the session. Biden won the election, as previously affirmed by election officials from all 50 states and many courts. Shortly afterward, the White House released a statement that conceivably represents a concession by President Trump. The departing president promised a, quote, orderly transition on January 20, but he also referred to the end of his, quote, first term.
There are new developments in a legal fight over the security of Georgia's election server. This past week, an election security expert said he found evidence the server was tampered with in 2014. The allegation was contained in an affidavit filed as part of a lawsuit brought by election integrity activists seeking to bar Georgia from using its paperless voting machines.
Mr. TURNER: Some of us chaff at using the word anthropic and common sense in the same sentence.
MOORE: (As Laura Petrie) Well, it's the only way I know how to cry.
No, I don't. If you look really at a broad array of these videos, you see police really fighting to keep these demonstrators out of the Capitol. Several officers were injured, some seriously.
Alongside Defense, the agencies for which the White House proposes spending increases are almost entirely military- and national security-related. The Department of Homeland Security would see a hike in funding of 6.8 percent, as would the Department of Veterans Affairs (5.9 percent) and the National Nuclear Security Administration (11.3 percent).
SANCHEZ: He's a new politician. He's fresh. He's not polluted. I think he's very honest on what he's doing.
Yes and no, experts say. If you've been following the oft-repeated safety protocols to the letter, you might not have much adjusting to do. But this variant is a good wake-up call for the rest of us, experts say. Have you edged closer than 6 feet when you run into a neighbor on the sidewalk? Has that mask slipped below your nose? Are you singing two full rounds of happy birthday when you wash your hands — every time? Despite pandemic fatigue, this is not the time for slacking, the prevention specialists say.
In case the shutdown lasts longer — as Trump has threatened — the Census Bureau has started looking into ways to extend the length of the funds without notable programmatic slowdowns, the agency's statement says.
Rep. Don Young of Alaska has had a pretty good year. He talks with NPR's Michel Martin about his role in getting the new tax bill passed and opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling.
On top of all that, implementing all of these policies could cost trillions upon trillions of dollars.
RUSSAKOFF: Well, that was again totally alienating of the community because there were a number of local foundations in Newark that had been involved for years in education. And, you know, $5 million as an annual gift just was not in their budget. And so they were excluded from having any say, but more importantly, there was no way for the parents, the teachers, the principals, the community leaders - just, you know, really, really intelligence, smart, committed people who had been in the fray for years in the lives of children in education - to be part of this. And so basically, the board decided to spend the money the way the wealthy donors wanted it spent. And the priorities were not about getting money to the classroom or to the children. The priorities were to have to this kind of business model, top-down reform that had become very popular in the reform movement.
A record number of people will need humanitarian assistance
Yet open discussion of the blasphemy laws will remain extremely difficult in Pakistan because of the deadly response it can draw from religious extremists.
Foreclosures came in all conditions. Some were impeccably cleaned; some were trashed. Most were in between, with leftover clothes or furniture here and there, cotton swabs on the floor or beer bottles on the table.

Stroehmann concedes the violence likely harmed their cause. But, he warns, lawmakers who dismiss Trump's supporters do so at their own peril.
May I ask you a question?
JOBRANI: Right? You put the money in...
Incoming officials will also have other time-sensitive work to do. Writing regulations for the newly passed ban on surprise medical bills will almost certainly be a giant political fight between insurers and health care providers, who will try to re-litigate the legislation as it is implemented. Rules for insurers who sell policies under the ACA will need to be written almost immediately after Biden takes office.

Dr. D'ELIA: ...essentially a five-page (unintelligible).
A sale would have big implications for the company, which supplies electricity and gas to more than 5 million California households and has more than 20,000 employees. PG&E's natural gas assets account for between 20 percent to 30 percent of the company.

Unlike the border-crossers of a decade ago, many of these Central American migrants are trying to turn themselves in to the Border Patrol to request asylum in the United States.

Later on, Einstein's prediction for the flow of time was also confirmed: Time slows down in strong gravity. A clock on the top of the Empire State Building ticks faster than one on the ground. But the effect is tiny: If you were to spend your lifetime on top of the Empire State Building you would lose 104 millionths of a second. Even more fun: In a 79-year lifetime, the cells in your brain age faster than those in your feet by about 45 billionths of a second.
MARK ERICKSON: A third of our students in our school districts live in the country, and they were unable to do their homework when they got home. Most of them had dial-up, which is just archaic. Some used satellite connections, which were good when the weather was fine, and some had poor DSL from their phone companies.
MALEK: Correct. I got the part, actually, auditioning with that very scene. Sam Esmail, who is the creator of Mr. Robot, had seen me do a miniseries that was from Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks called The Pacific. And at some point, I came in with another hundred actors or so, did my best and kept coming in and coming in until finally, I did a network test. And I got the role. I never thought that I would be the lead character in any show. And this proved me wrong.
Storming The Capitol Didn't Change The Election, Some Trump Backers Realize
Ireland has one of the strictest abortion laws in the world. Pro-abortion-rights groups have campaigned for decades to repeal the country's Eighth Amendment. Now voters have decided.
The only thing we really can do is obviously try and prevent global warming because that's the root cause of why we think it's weakening now with increasing temperatures, he says.
So we're working on that now where obviously supply and availability of a drug is an issue. But there is an all-of-government approach on this.
Buckle up. We're ready to go to work, Vice President Pence told Republican lawmakers at their annual retreat in Philadelphia on Thursday.
Will price transparency reduce overall health spending?
I asked Turpin to walk me (as a proxy for listeners) through his priorities for the year ahead. He started with reporting priorities: We want to focus on trying to do more high-impact reporting, more unduplicated reporting. In other words, break stories and commit resources to journalistic endeavors such as investigative and enterprise reporting. The latter involves a broad range of reporting, including digging beneath the surface of the daily news and looking for developments and trends that deserve greater public attention.
He said the administration was working with digital companies, prepaid debit cards, and others to make sure we have a process that every American gets their money quickly. This money does people no good if it shows up in four months, and we will deliver on that promise.
JAMES: You're eating the prizes that come in the box.
MARIA CANDELARIA URIBE: We used to have the governor here all the time from Texas. We had, like, four or five governors from Mexico. And they would party, and they would get to know each other so that if they needed something, they could just pick up the telephone and call each other and talk to each other.
CANDICE MILLARD: He wanted to be in the most difficult, most dangerous battles he could find. And he wanted to be noticed. He wanted to stand out.
Because the magazine's future is unclear — it may continue in a Web-only format — the 2016 Haikus with Hotties calendar may become a one-time-only collector's item after this year. I would love for there to be a 2017 calendar, but there are no plans right now, Tseng says. But if anyone wants to sponsor it ... 
You can kind of see the structure and see the opportunity instead of drowning in your situation, said Jessica Bright, South Carolina state director for Sanders. So definitely the time is right to change structurally, change the systems that we're going up against.

It's almost unprecedented in the psychological-research field for one to make such an admission and as boldly Carney.
And Sheehan respects that idea, but disagrees. He says he feels called to teach, but he also wants to be paid like a professional.
I smelled it long before I saw it; it really stank around here, says Marc McGinnes, a lawyer who came down from San Francisco. And when I looked at the oil on the beach, I cried.
In mid-December, state regulators found that PG&E had systematically falsified safety documents and broke safety rules related to its natural gas operations over a five-year period.
There are a number of things in the president's budget to encourage home ownership, but we have many millions of people in this country who aren't even close to that point. What's in the budget to help them?
Marshall Burke, deputy director of Stanford University's Center on Food Security and the Environment, is one of a growing number of researchers who are training artificial intelligence software to scan through millions of satellite images to look for clues about where these challenges exist and test solutions to them.
And when you then have — add to that a situation in which for the first time in anyone's memory you have the head of the Senate saying, I won't meet with a nominee; I won't provide a nominee a hearing; I will not provide a nominee a vote, and that, if, in fact, was maintained, would be the first time in the modern court where we would have a seat unfilled for over a year. That matters to people.
SAGAL: Yes, your confession, very good.
BARRON: That's - as far as I know, that's correct. They've interviewed the people that worked that day. With regard to dumping ballots, I don't even know how to respond to that because I'm not sure what he means by dumping ballots and hundreds of thousands of them. I don't know what that means. And shredding ballots - we haven't shredded any ballots. If there are unused ballots, we can do that. But we haven't done that for the November election.
MARTIN: Well, why do you say that there is no path for you, though? You have an H-1B visa. Just to recap. You came here, as you said, by invitation. You were recruited to play soccer. You went to undergraduate and graduate school here. So you had a series of student visas. Now you have an H-1B visa, recognizing your particular expertise. Why is that not a path to citizenship for you?
So over the phone, talking the MPAA all the way through while shooting, I was trying to do what they suggested so I could have a PG rating. Well, when the film was finished and they saw it, it was really amazing. They have these little clipboards, you know, with lights on them in the dark room. And every few seconds, those lights would pop on. And they were making notes. And I thought, oh, that's trouble. That means they're talking about cuts. Well, ended up not having to make any cuts, but, of course, we took the R rating. And I don't know, however, had I not sincerely tried to go for PG, the picture may have been an X.
Prasertong points to one anecdote from an African-American customer whom she interviewed. I asked her, 'If you had been given access to more resources while you were growing up, would that have changed your life in any way?'  Prasertong recalls. She immediately had an example.
After graduating from high school, Sunuwar was working at the commercial Kaleidoscope Kitchen with a fellow refugee named Ibti Salih, from Sudan, when they met Sabine Langer. They didn't know it right away, but Langer would soon change the course of their lives through a food hall she would launch called Global Café.
DEBBIE STABENOW: Good morning. Good to be with you.
SIMON: Second half of the baseball season's beginning. Yankees, Red Sox seem to be back. Dodgers are way out in the West. The rampaging Milwaukee Brewers are really an unexpected bright spot in...
Conservation takes a long time. It took hundreds of years for grizzly bears to be hunted, trapped and driven to the brink of extirpation from the lower 48 states. Scientists and conservationists say it's unreasonable to expect that they'd recover in a few decades.
Early Wednesday, Guaidó tweeted that protests were underway in Caracas and the coastal cities of Carúpano and Maracaibo, showing that his movement had reached distant locations. He used the protest hashtag #GritemosConBrio, which means Let's cry out loud and also is part of the chorus of the Venezuelan national anthem.
Sekulow is part of a defense team for the president led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who called the articles of impeachment ridiculous and said it was an act of patriotism to defend the constitutional rights of the president, because if they do it to the president, they can do it to any of you, and they can do it to any American citizen.
An attorney for the secretary of state's office told the president on the call that state investigators, law enforcement and the courts looked into claims of illegal votes and found no evidence of widespread fraud that would overturn Trump's narrow loss.
LLOYD: Well, I'd been looking to do a lower budget film for several years. And Clare Dunne and Harriet Walter, who also plays in Herself, and I were working together in an all-female theater troupe. We were performing Shakespeare set in women's prisons. And we were very preoccupied by the number of women we met whose journey into the criminal justice system had begun against a background of abuse in childhood. And then Clare had a friend who became homeless in her hometown of Dublin. She was a single mom with three kids. And Clare was just so outraged at the lack of support for her that she sat down and started writing this, her first screenplay.

The NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll is particularly well-suited to close study. Founded by Francis Davis in 2006 and published by NPR Music since 2013, it is the largest annual jazz critics poll, drawing the participation of up to nearly 150 critics who contribute to a range of media outlets. As such, it arguably provides the broadest picture of jazz criticism in a given year. Although the published results on NPR Music highlight the top ten new releases, interested readers can access a complete list of the hundreds of albums for which critics cast votes, as well as their individual ballots, via a separate website.
The process to affirm Biden's victory began in the early afternoon.

I think it's only natural that some people would be panicking under the circumstances. So we always have as one of our basic principles, openness and transparency. We believe openness and transparency will give people more confidence, will give them more awareness about this virus. What is the real, what are the real risks and how to prevent them? And we are providing, you see all the figures, the numbers on daily basis just to make people reassured that we are doing our most to confront it. And this will certainly help us to dispel any fake news, rumors or what people call pseudoscience.

Well, of course we never got to go back. And my mom walked downhill to Nha Trang, that port town of about 150 miles south.

And the historical accounts that I have read indicate that it was chaos and death and lots of civilians and Southern Vietnamese soldiers dead along the way. We caught a boat from Nha Trang to Saigon, met up with my father, fortunately enough.

KANDER: Yes, and - but a piece of history and something that you're writing are two different things. Once you write - start writing - you're not thinking extracurricularly - or at least for me. We're thinking about the moment in the theater. So if I went to see Cabaret and had not written it, I would have a reaction to it that would be somehow or other colored by being a Jew. But maybe it's some defect on my part. But I did not think about that when we were writing.

He kind of stands up on his back legs and makes himself look as big as possible and just walks towards his - this major rival to intimidate him as much as he can.

So I had to incorporate all of that into this. And he said, And while you're at it, sprinkle in some matador! So I'm like, Oh, OK. I understood exactly what he meant immediately, though.

It's sexy and graceful all at the same time, and very athletic and very fearless. ... That's kind of what I did.

We were just there to grab a lot of footage that shows a young woman's exuberance being in a new city, looking around, gazing at the sights. And I had in my hand a hat, a little beret that my aunt had given me for Christmas. And I had packed that along with whatever other warm things that I had, which weren't too many because I was a Californian, to go to Minneapolis to do these film spots. And Jim Brooks said, oh, I have a good idea, Mary. Take that hat, put it on your head and now run into the intersection. And it'll be all right. We'll watch for cars.

HALIHAN: So when you're producing oil and gas, you're actually pumping a water well, and you happen to get some oil and gas out of it. And so in some formations, you get mostly oil, which is a great thing to do. In ours, you're getting about 10 gallons of water per gallon of oil. And then you have this leftover salty water that you can't do much with. It's much saltier than ocean water, and so the only choice that they found was we could put it down to depth and dispose of it. That process, for a very long time, has worked very, very effectively. But in the modern day with higher volumes and higher rates, it's caused seismicity. For us, that's not been something we've had to deal with previously until a few years ago.

So, yes, simplicity — often in the form of unification — has been extremely successful. For this reason, many physicists want to further simplify the existing theories. But you can always simplify a theory by removing an assumption. Like the assumption that the gravitational constant has a some value that you inferred from observation (up to some precision). Or similar assumptions about, say, the values of the masses of elementary particles, or the cosmological constant, or the strength of the four forces. These are assumptions some theoreticians are now throwing out.
Mr. CHESNUTT: Well, yeah. This is a very strange song. This song is the only one I've ever done this with but I dreamed it. I dreamt it completely as is on this album.

And I was crying in my dream. And then I woke up and my - the pillow was sopping wet. My face was all wet and so obviously I was actually crying. And I realized: Holy moly, this is a great song. And so I reached over and I got the hotel stationery and pen and I wrote down the lyrics as exactly as they were in my dream. And then I reached over and got my guitar and I figured out the chords. And wow, there it is. Straight from my subconscious to the recording tape. I mean it's an incredible thing that's never happened to me before.

My works are very intimate portraits. Everything is very flat. I remove a lot of shadows from the image and take a very graphical approach to photography. When I started looking at traditional elements of my culture — body ornamentation and tattoos — it's highly sophisticated. Unfortunately, Eurocentric history has dismissed this art as primitive. But, in fact, specific colors, lines and designs have different meanings. Even when you look at the movie Black Panther, a lot of [the movie's aesthetic] was inspired by Ethiopia. I find traditional culture to be far more contemporary than the contemporary itself.

SYDELL: So Twitter has a little over 300 million users who use it on a monthly basis. And it really hasn't been able to make a consistent profit off that. Plus, growth has slowed. Take Facebook. Facebook has, you know, over 1.5 billion users, still growing. So investors are saying, hey, come on, you know, Twitter; what's going on here?
Many Twitter users responded angrily after a published report said the company is planning to change how tweets are displayed.

Climate research at NASA could also take a hit under Trump's budget. The plan would reduce overall spending at NASA by around 1 percent, Mulvaney said, but would increase spending on space exploration, which Trump supports.
Yes, I did see that. So we've seen a handful of videos that have shown either the D.C. Metropolitan Police or the Capitol Police sort of giving way to the demonstrators. And this has been used to talk about their alleged affinity with the demonstrators or their complicity in this kind of right wing politics. And while I'm sure there are officers who were very sympathetic to the protests and we know there are officers who buy into a lot of these conspiracy theories, I think if we look a little bit more carefully at these videos, what we see is officers who were overwhelmed by an extremely violent and persistent crowd and are making a discretionary judgment about the use of force in a situation where they have lost control.

When you think about dialogue and people communicating, so much of our communication is visual: how you hold your hands, how you're postured, what your body language is, expressions on your face, the tilt of the head.

Before the mob breached the Capitol, Congress was in the process of officially recognizing President-elect Joe Biden's election win. Proceedings had just been delayed after Republican lawmakers challenged the results of Arizona's vote.
SHEHADEH: I say that the leadership and the people have shown that whenever there is a little bit of hope they change and adopt the hope and are willing to go all the way with it because people want to have hope. When there's no hope, it weakens the leadership because at this point, the leadership is not giving us hope because Israel is not willing to come along with the leadership and say, OK, we will go along with you on this basis. There isn't any such response from Israel, and therefore this weakens the leadership.
Hours later Trump signed an executive order formalizing that decision.
As you may have guessed, Qom is also a very politically conservative place. At a modest religious school named for a martyred ayatollah, depictions of the U.S. and Israeli flags are painted on the entrance floor so students can walk on them. The noon call to prayer is not recorded and blasted out over a loudspeaker, a common practice these days. Instead, a slender young man fills the courtyard with his unamplified voice, as students shuffle past.

Even my Republican colleagues wanted me fired for going after the Teamsters Union. Can you imagine it? When I went after the mafia, God, I was only in office four weeks to put out a contract for $800,000 to kill me. Didn't stop me from doing it. At the end of my time of U.S. attorney, another mafia figure put out a $400,000 contract to kill me. I've had four fatwas declared against me. I've had the FARC in Colombia threaten several times to cut my throat if I came there. And then I've had some recent threats because of this.

I haven't talked to him about it, about this case in quite a while, but I would have no problem with him doing it. In fact, I'd have a problem with him not doing it. I think he would be saying that Joe Biden can get away with selling out the United States, making us a fool in the Ukraine. Do you know from the moment that it was found out that Hunter Biden had that job, every time Joe Biden went there, the people of Ukraine laughed at him? Joe Biden would stand up in that stupid way in which he talks, he would say, oh, we should end the corruption in Ukraine. People in Ukraine would say, OK, let's start with you, Joe. How about you get your kid off that no-show job? Now, everybody knew it because in December — December 8th, 2015 — James Risen, who now wishes he didn't write this, wrote an article for The New York Times blasting the conflict, basically saying, how could Joe Biden, who's giving billions out to this country that's bankrupt, how could he put his son into a phony job with the most crooked guy in Ukraine? And he said he was getting a reasonable amount of money. Risen was misled, he didn't even know the amount of money that — he had no idea he was making a million dollars a year and his company was making $2 million. He had no idea.

The court fight hinged on the interpretation of Section 856 of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. This crack house statute from 1986 was written at the height of the country's crack epidemic as a way to strengthen prosecution of drug crimes. The law prohibits anyone from maintaining a place for the purpose of using, selling or storing drugs. The statute was later used to prosecute people hosting raves where ecstasy and other popular party drugs were consumed.

Trump pretty much left the details of last year's NAFTA talks up to Lighthizer. The president has taken a more direct role in the negotiations with Beijing.
During his four years in office, Pence has mastered the art of standing by the president without standing by his words, of conveniently shrinking from view when he'd rather not answer questions about something Trump has said or tweeted, of looking off into the middle distance, expressionless as the president says something extreme, or outlandish or obviously wrong, of praising Trump for saying something the president has never actually said, at least not in public.

SARS, the SARS epidemic of some years ago. OK. When Americans look at China's effort to face this crisis, it is natural, I think, for some to compare the U.S. system to China's system and ask how things would be different if the crisis were here. Americans might say it is impressive that China can shut down an entire city to try to stop the spread of a virus that would not very likely happen in the United States. But they will also argue that the American system is more open and would be a little more free about sharing information and trying to get reliable information to the public. That is the way that an American might look at strengths and weaknesses of China's system compared to the United States. How would you make that comparison?

The health law isn't as prescriptive with large-group plans about the specific benefits that have to be offered. They aren't required to cover the 10 essential health benefits that individual and small-group plans have to include, for example. But the law does require that big companies offer plans that meet a minimum-value standard, paying at least 60 percent of the cost of covered services, on average. Those that don't could face a fine.
To try to move cases through more quickly, the Trump administration imposed quotas on immigration judges in 2018, requiring them to clear 700 cases a year or get docked points on their performance evaluations. However, under former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, the Department of Justice also changed policy so that more than 300,000 closed immigration cases could be reactivated. If reopened, those claims would swell the backlog of cases from upwards of an estimated 768,000 cases to more than 1 million.

Now what is true, Nina, is, is that, you know, we have a divided court on a lot of important issues. Justice Scalia was a big figure who was viewed as providing a majority on conservative positions on some of the cases that came before the court.

We were really seeing all the difficulties that were coming - the privatizing of schools, the charter schools that were opening up and taking money away. We had taken huge pay cuts in our last few years of work - more than 10 percent cuts to our pensions, cuts to our health care. And I thought, you know, this kid's going to do four years at U of M. That's a very expensive education, and I'd like him to do something else.

KUHN: Yes. He talked about continuing the thaw in relations with South Korea. Now, at times, the U.S. has seemed nervous that this sort of inter-Korean rapprochement is getting out too far ahead of the nuclear issue. But lately, they seem to have had a change of heart. They seem to have decided that it doesn't really cost them anything at this point. There's only so far they can go with those sanctions still in place. And they hope that this will just improve the atmosphere and maybe make talks a little bit easier.
Biden and Harris finished with 306 electoral votes, while Trump and Pence had 232. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.

Part 1 of the TED Radio Hour episode Painfully Funny.
But the problem is that the leading center-left alternatives to Bernie Sanders - Mike Bloomberg and Joe Biden - have failed to perform at a level high enough to clear the field. And the center-left candidates now have what you could call a collective action problem. They all believe it's better if there's one alternative to Sanders, but none - no one of them is willing to drop out to make that happen. So the bottom line is Bernie Sanders has the clearest path to come into the Milwaukee convention with a plurality of delegates. Even one-third might be enough to get the nomination if the opposition to him is split many ways.
YOUNG: It's not toxic in the sense that it's toxic because we're not getting things done. The chairman used to run the Congress, not the president, not the speaker. Now, everything's run through Nancy's office or run through Ryan's office. And in doing so, it becomes a party policy instead of solving a problem. There is no problem that's a Republican problem or a Democrat problem or a progressive problem, depends on what you want to call them. But there is a problem, and no one can solve it 100 percent their way. They have to do it together or it'll never get solved. And what's happened now, it has to be 100 percent Republican or 100 percent Democrat. No wants to sit down and say, OK, well, how can we solve the problem? You have to give up a little bit. I have to give up a little bit. The problem's solved.
COBB: Well, I mean, it's exactly the things that you were talking about. You know, the grievances around who won the election call back to 1876, which was the disputed election between Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden. And the result of that was the deal that was cut that allowed Rutherford B. Hayes to assume the presidency, but also ended Reconstruction and ended the period of democracy that the newly emancipated Black people had experienced. And that was when we saw the onset of things like violent voter suppression.

The principal of the charter school, who is very proud of their student results because they - you know, they do far outperform the school district - said unequivocally she never would have these results if she didn't have these extra resources. In other words, if she only had the resources to work with that the school district schools had, she couldn't have done this, and her students couldn't have done this. So to me, the biggest takeaway - and again, as I said, it's a huge political enterprise that can't be done easily - but it's to figure out how to get resources to individual schools within school districts to meet the needs of children because they really don't have the resources to meet them now in cities like Newark.
Now, as a mob took over the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, those predictions have come true.

Even Senate Republicans like Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, who said he was open to hearing from witnesses like former national security adviser John Bolton, said that he backed McConnell's resolution and that if attempts are made to vote on witnesses prior to opening arguments, I would oppose those efforts.

But I looked for things in the people, and Jack did all the right things wrong and all the wrong things right, which is what I always looked for. Strange - it's hard to say. It's sort of a kinesthetic thing, but I saw a lot of stuff in Jack. And he looked like the boy next door in those days, but there was nothing about the boy next door and his persona.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Phil Reeves in Caracas, Venezuela. And we'll be following this story throughout the day. Thank you so much.
It's something that happens every day. Things blow up on Twitter. Trends happen. Hashtags are created. Happy, angry tweets start flying. And over the weekend, Twitter itself became a trending topic. It happened after a report came out that the company would change the way tweets are displayed, that they would show up on your timeline differently. NPR's Laura Sydell is here to talk more about this. And Laura, one of the hashtags around this has been Twitter RIP, as in Twitter, rest in peace. Why are people so upset?

Yes, David, you're right. The risk calculus changes. And this is an individual doctor decision. We'll be providing — not we FDA — but the CDC will be providing some guidance about that with respect to potential therapeutic options. But you're right. I mean, absolutely. And this is a drug that's available to physicians to prescribe now.
Trump and Pence said they didn't want the cure to be worse than the disease, and they likened the old projections for coronavirus fatalities to the annual tolls taken in car accidents or by the seasonal flu.

Trade deficits aren't inherently bad, but if the U.S. does want to sell more goods to China, the Trump administration could try to negotiate China into being more open to U.S. products, says one expert.
No, he isn't. And so we discussed that, and I wanted to make sure that not only he felt comfortable with it, but his family felt comfortable with it. You know, for those of us who are more often in, you know, the scrum of politics, we're — we call folks like Judge Garland civilians. And so suddenly being placed in a war zone like this is something that you want to make sure they're mindful of.
There's also been collective sorrow. More than 1.8 million people have died of COVID-19 worldwide — 342,000 in the U.S. alone. And people have been losing jobs, with the weekly unemployment claims staying at high levels and nearly 20 million ongoing claims for various forms of assistance.

For the very same reasons that the industrial power of the United States is able to produce this vast inequity of death, that's the same reason that the United States, in the years afterward, through its incredibly powerful cultural industry, is able to win the war in memory because wherever you go outside of Vietnam, you have to deal with American memories of the Vietnam War. Inside Vietnam, you have to confront Vietnamese memories. But outside, wherever I've gone and talked about the Vietnam War and memory, one of the first questions that I get is what do you think of Apocalypse Now? So...

Recurring donations can smooth out spiky funding. But when it comes to structural change, Lewis has one big request: open-source software, frameworks and collaboration spaces.
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Because I think we do. And if we want the United States to continue to be a global leader then that means we have to lead on the solution of this issue. And I think that it is completely wrong to point fingers at other developing nations and to say, well, China's doing this and India's doing that and Russia is doing this, when we can just choose to lead and we don't have to hold ourselves to a lower bar.
But Trump, as well as many other Republicans in Congress, didn't heed those warnings. In a phone call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the weekend, Trump listed a number of debunked conspiracy theories, many of which spawned from extremist corners of the Internet.
Tools to help consumers determine in advance the amount of deductible they'll owe are already available from many insurers. And experts expect the additional information being made available this month will prompt entrepreneurs to create their own apps or services to help consumers analyze the price data.
The companies knew their supply chains weren't transparent. They were obviously embarrassed and humiliated by being called out, says Duncan Jepson, founder of Liberty Asia, a nongovernmental organization that focuses on preventing human trafficking. He adds that the incentive for businesses to use the new Seafood Watch tool is obvious. From our perspective, the question now is, do you want to be involved or exposed to people earning their profits from these types of environments?

The trade-off is that we have to be doing the intervention for a longer period of time, says Jewell. But that's over having a catastrophic number of infections and a high number of deaths.
GROSS: Well, Guy, I want to thank you for talking with us. I'm going to ask Vic to stick around. We're going to have a kind of biographical interview. But thanks for talking with us about what's happening instrumentally on Vic Chesnutt's new CD, and thanks very much, and Guy plays guitar and has done some of the arranging on the new CD At the Cut, and he was a co-founder of the band Fugazi. Thanks and all the best to you. Be well. Thanks so much for talking with us.
A powerful wind swept across the 2016 presidential race Tuesday night as the political pendulum came swinging back with a vengeance.
Perdue ultimately stood out as more of a known quantity, Muller said.
Facebook is rolling out a major change to its News Feed: pushing up news articles that come from high quality sources, and pushing down the others. The move signals that, in an effort to combat the problem of fake news, the social media giant is willing to play a kind of editorial role — making decisions based on substance, not just how viral a headline may be.
NOURSE: There were concerns raised by some women's groups about Native American women. There were some parts of the bill that might have had a negative effect because Native American law is very specialized because they're nations. So somewhere along the line, in the first year, I reached out to a colleague of mine on the Indian Affairs Committee, and I said, you need to help me redraft every piece of this to make it clear that Indian tribal units can benefit from the law, they can get the money under the grants, that they are required to meet the same conditions, that there is no discrimination whatsoever.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the position brought Dershowitz into the land of legal absurdity, he tweeted. That anything a public official does for re-election is OK. That cannot be true.

Many who have weighed in praise the new rules for restoring sanity and fairness to the process but many more are critical.
MALEK: (As Elliot Alderson) I own everything - all your emails, all your files, all your pics.
Former Gov. Ed Rendell, a Democrat with close ties to Hillary Clinton, is confident that fears about a Donald Trump presidency will turn out urban Democrats. You know, there's an old saying in politics that hate is a more powerful emotion than love, he said, or fear is a more powerful emotion than love. I think Donald Trump will produce the turnout.
JOHN HARKINS: (As Reverend Burns) Excuse me, young lady.
A couple of years ago, a mechanical engineer met with Narendra Modi, who would later become India's Prime Minister. The engineer proposed a bold and radical idea that he said would completely change the Indian economy. The idea is called demonetization, and it happened six months ago. The government suddenly declared most of the paper money in circulation worthless. Citizens had a short time to turn in their stashes of cash for new bills. It was an effort to flush out corruption, get people to join the banking system and in the process, help the poor of India.
Mr. WEINBERG: Some of us are dreading that what the LHC will find is a single, electrically neutral Higgs boson where it's expected with a mass of, oh let's say, 130 or 150 times the mass of the proton, and nothing else. I think that would be the worst possible outcome.

So this starts as an investigation to obtain evidence to help defend President Trump against the false charges of collusion. And then it continues as an investigation to defend him against what immediately followed, impeachment. It has never, ever been a focus on Joe Biden. And it wasn't and I didn't go looking for it. He never went looking for it. It was given to me by Ukrainians who had been trying to give it to the United States for a year and been turned away by the FBI and by the Department of Justice and by the embassy in Ukraine.
Between the dawn of civilization and now, there have been just 400 generations. Let's call each generation a grandma (great-grandma would be more accurate of course). What our little calculation shows is there are only 400 grandmas separating you and your first ancestor who put the Earth to plow.

You see our two countries, China and the United States, we are big countries, major powers in the world and we are the two largest economies. So I think we do have some similarities. As big countries, you have great responsibilities and very often we set great goals for ourselves. This is only natural for any major power. And then we also have our roots in different civilizations. But we both could run into some problems, big challenges from time to time. You have your own problems and challenges, we have our problems and challenges. I always believe whether China or United States can really grow stronger and have a better future very much that depends on our domestic governance. Now, you may have problems to solve — to enhance your domestic governance. We have our own challenges to meet, to modernize our governance system and capacity. So if each of us can do a good job at home you always have a good future. So we are watching, of course, we wish American people good luck and a better future.
But now, in the Web series Shugs & Fats, Manzoor and Vaz (who grew up in India) play immigrant roommates whom they describe as walking the line between hipsters and hijabis.

Every day [SEIU members] confront the crisis of climate, as well as environmental racism and economic inequality, so the Green New Deal is not something that is abstract to them, said Rocio Sáenz, the executive vice president of the Service Employees International Union. For our members the Green New Deal means clear air, clean water, safe communities, good jobs and a growing economy. So this, for us, is why we are part of this network. What we see, especially now more than ever, is that we cannot think about these issues in siloes.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: I guess the crux of the matter is, is there a specific reason, in your view, that Eric Schneiderman is bringing up this legislation? Who could President Trump potentially pardon that could end up under New York jurisdiction?
This, of course, happened after the Exxon Valdez spill, when there was the same conflict between NRDA's desire to control information so as to have, you know, power over it during the litigation process, and of course, Exxon's desire also, to have data and scientific testimony that would be under their control.

GRAY: Well, in our particular case, there are 2,100 SEIU Local 1 janitors. And SEIU - that's the Service Employees International Union. Out of that 2,100, over 90% are African American men or women. And so as I stood at the press conference and as I stood in front of the marchers and looked back, I could see, you know, a sea of black faces. The reality of St. Louis in particular - the racial income gap is more than 10%. Black families are three times more likely to live in poverty than whites. And so when we look at the disparity - the income disparity in this region, we know that it affects people of color more than anyone else.

In some cases, the federal government has objected.
Leve thinks laws against proselytizing aren't the best way for the Nepali government to keep conversions down. What it needs to do is ramp up the public health and social support infrastructure so that its citizens are getting what they need from the state, she says. When public hospitals start to provide effective health services, when there's a social safety net in place post-earthquake or any other time, you will see fewer people expressing any interest in Christianity.
Many of the most severe cases of malnourished babies are referred to the Indira Gandhi Children's Hospital in central Kabul, where, on a recent December day, women clad in burkas clutched swaddled babies as they waited to see a doctor.
The baby, a perfect little girl named Ayla Kimberley, finally arrived. It's a joyful, sweet time — and time for Chavarria and Rivas to get some more serious financial advice.
Lawyer Aaron Littman, at the Southern Center for Human Rights, said in a January statement that the practice of pocketing leftover funds was a dubious interpretation of the law that raises grave ethical concerns, invites public corruption, and creates a perverse incentive to spend as little as possible on feeding people who are in jail. He argues the sheriffs are supposed to manage the funds, not personally profit from them.
The Trump administration has steadily reversed many of the steps Obama took to end Cuba's isolation. In the spring of 2019, it placed new sanctions and penalties on Cuba, hoping to undermine the communist regime. It also killed a deal that would have made it easier for Cuban baseball players to join professional teams in the U.S. and Canada.

ALLAM: It unfolded very quickly. We saw this massive swell of marchers kind of converge around 1 o'clock, around the time that, you know, Congress was starting its discussion. And we just see this huge crush of people coming down Pennsylvania Avenue toward the Capitol, a big contingent of the Proud Boys, a violent, far-right gang, sort of in the lead as a front-line force.

If you had a law that required them to do this in the first place, we might argue about whether that law is logical, or a good idea, or in fact is constitutional for other reasons says Crocker.

And with - the Birmingham campaign was an effort to desegregate the businesses downtown. And Birmingham was policed by a notorious, racist sheriff who had a lot of power in the town, Bull Connor. So the photo footage that we - you know, that we've found show Martin Luther King at the motel with Dr. Reverend Abernathy really orchestrating this campaign. And A.G. Gaston was the owner, let them stay for free and also gave money even though he disagreed - he was more conservative. And he disagreed with a confrontational approach, initially. So he and Dr. King would kind of go at it about, you know, what's the right way forward to fight - you know, to fight for civil rights. But he's a really unsung hero of the movement. And so it was really wonderful to be able to talk to his niece Carol Jenkins, who is an esteemed reporter in her own right, about that history.

As officials try to improve vaccine distribution, a new strain of coronavirus has shown up in at least two states this week. Scientists say that while the variant does not appear to be more dangerous, it does seem to be more contagious. And, of course, all this is happening as hospitals across the country operate at or near capacity and brace for what might be another post-holiday surge.
Nonetheless, the announcement is a swift reversal for a state once called the Wild West of self-driving cars. In 2016, Ducey welcomed Uber with open arms and wide open roads as the company sought alternatives to California's regulatory environment.

The Etowah County Drug Enforcement Unit added extra charges to his case, including a charge of drug trafficking, which the Rainbow City Police chief said was based on inaccurate weight calculations. (The unit counted 14 grams of pot, infused in five cups of butter, as more than than 1,000 grams worth of marijuana.)
The trial follows Trump's impeachment last month in the House of Representatives on charges of obstruction of Congress and abuse of power. The White House has laid out a forceful rejection of those charges and called for an acquittal of the president. At issue in the impeachment is whether Trump sought political favors from his Ukrainian counterpart in exchange for the release of military aid. The White House denies any such link was made.
After his remarks, Trump supporters marched to Capitol Hill where they pushed past barricades and some broke in to the building, which had been locked down. Pence was whisked out the Senate chamber. Not long after, Trump tweeted a rebuke of his wingman.
Ericksen's comments come just days after Trump's team ordered agencies to limit their external communications to the public. Employees at the EPA, the Department of Agriculture and the Interior Department, among others, have been instructed not to post on social media accounts.

We'd put a house on the market, and by noon we'd have 12 offers, Hahn says.

Raffensperger was not the only target of Trump's ire. The president said that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who has also repeatedly refused to interfere with the election results, was working with the secretary of state to treat Georgians badly.
ARS: Do you believe that we in terms of the United States need to pay 100 cents on the dollar? Or do you think there's actually ways that we could renegotiate that debt? DT: I think, look. I've borrowed knowing that you can pay back with discounts. And I've done very well with debt. Now of course I was swashbuckling, and it did well for me, and it was good for me and all of that. And you know debt was always sort of interesting to me. Now we're in a different situation with a country, but I would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal. And if the economy was good it was good so therefore you can't lose. It's like you make a deal before you go into a poker game. And your odds are much better.

President Trump's support in Pennsylvania doesn't follow strict party lines. Those who flock to his rallies (he has held at least seven here since his election) include voters who like his brash style and those who may not, but credit him with adding jobs and making the stock market soar.
The back-and-forth is a culmination of disagreement between Democrats and Republicans over what would constitute a fair trial. The Democratic-led House voted in December to impeach President Trump but held off on transmitting the two articles of impeachment in an attempt to get more details on the trial rules. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., ultimately moved the process forward without the assurances Democrats sought.

NGUYEN: Well, my mother's family did go, so all my aunts on that side of the family and my grandparents on that side of the family went. My father's parents and his siblings decided to stay in North Vietnam. And the human consequences of this were that my parents left in 1954 to go south. My parents would not return to a unified Vietnam until the early 1990s, which meant my father didn't see his own relatives for 40 years. My mom, because her family came to the South and then, you know, she left in 1975 when Saigon fell, she wouldn't see her siblings again for 20 years.
LLOYD: Yeah, most homicides that occur in domestic abuse situations occur at the point when the woman crosses the threshold either with or without her children. It's the moment you're most likely to die. And so it's a preposterous question - you know, why didn't you leave sooner? - because not just you might be going to die, but where do you go?

The main character, Connor, is having a difficult time. His parents are constantly fighting and possibly splitting up. Because of their financial troubles, Connor is forced to change schools. In the new school, he's bullied by other boys and by the Catholic brothers who run it. One day, he spots a girl and to impress her, tells her he's in a band. He isn't but quickly puts one together.

You know, supporters of President Trump have gathered in D.C. for days of protest. And much of the downtown core of the city is just shut down to traffic as a result. You know, the protests are based on Trump's false claims of election fraud, mixed with conspiracy theories and other misinformation. It is a scene that is so tense that D.C. officials have called in the National Guard to be on standby. So there's a lot of churn happening in Washington right now.

It's about the five-year experiment to reform the schools in Newark, N.J., a city beset by poverty and violence. The experiment was initiated by then-Newark Mayor Cory Booker, who enlisted the support of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. Zuckerberg donated $100 million to the project, which was to be matched by 100 million from other donors. There's, like, a whole new network of, you know, funders, foundations, philanthropic groups and education consultants who are leaders of one part of the education reform movement.

They think this is going to be bad, certainly in the short term and probably, even from their perspective, in the long term, for the U.K. economy. And also, many young people are very disappointed. They're not going to be able to live and work freely in Europe, which created great opportunities for them. There's a woman named Charlotte Reynolds. She's a university student here. She studies French, Spanish and German. And last night, she struck a totally different tone from the prime minister.
I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe, but these are things that people need to start thinking about now, Messonnier said.
Over the following weeks, the President repeatedly tweeted false claims about the election in Michigan and other states. After one board of county canvassers voted not to certify their election results (a move they reversed before their meeting adjourned) Trump falsely announced, Wow! Michigan just refused to certify the election results! Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!
Editor's note: One change has been made to the Web version of this story. Earlier, we wrote that Craig Combs maintains his belief in the debunked pizzagate stories. It now simply quotes what Combs said in an email to NPR, that the pizzagate story has the potential to get very, very huge, indeed.
The Indian subcontinent is a prime candidate, he says. But on the plus side, climate scientists expect 2020 to be an off year for El Niño and La Niña, the weather patterns that occur every few years and can cause flooding in some areas and droughts in others. The absence of those extremes might help stave off some instances of water scarcity.
In their campaigns last year, Democrats promised to protect the Affordable Care Act, and the access to coverage that it guarantees for many people. Many Democrats went further, running on the promise of Medicare-for-all.
The two vaccines that have been authorized so far, made by Pfizer and Moderna, both require two shots several weeks apart. The need for two doses is one reason why the roll-out of the vaccine has gotten off to a sluggish start, and there's been a lot of frustration with the pace of vaccinations.
Experts say no matter what a community's doubling time is, the key is seeing it get longer.

Meanwhile, U.S. President Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia Saturday morning, for a visit with the country's royal leaders. The Saudis are a strong U.S. ally and arch-enemy of Iran; the largely Sunni Saudis strongly opposed President Obama's outreach and nuclear deal with the Persian Shia power.
SYDELL: So I think that they've got to do something to make it easier to use. I think people feel that Facebook - it's actually fairly - you get on there, and you can see how to use it. Twitter takes some work. So there's a lot of pressure, and that, I think, is what this is all about - to make Twitter easier for the average person to understand.

JOHNSON: You know, there's - yeah, there's been a little bit of outrage, Ailsa. Many of those people left the Capitol and went about their day in the streets of Washington. Some of them were armed, and others had tear gas or mace on them. But some did stop to talk with reporters or post selfies. Law enforcement will be scouring those videos and photos. Lots of those people scattered, but the same law enforcement source tells me they expect to charge a handful of people by the morning tomorrow.

And again, all of this is hypothetical — it would be tough to implement and potentially extremely expensive ... if it passed.
The other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.
We have those premium supermarket chains that want California fruit, says Spann. So if we can develop other varieties that will expand our season to a year-round or nearly year-round position, that would be fantastic.
That tweet offers at least a partial explanation for why so many Republicans are willing to challenge the outcome of an election on the basis of nothing but their own candidate's insistence that he could not have lost.
Oregonians Aren't Pumped About New Law Allowing Self-Service Gas Stations
Police in Union are now investigating the case. According to The Union Times, investigators used a search warrant to obtain the male student's cellphone and have now given it to state law enforcement officials for a forensic examination.
At the time, Comey was not just looking back, he was elucidating history in the making. His first subtitle recalled his testimony to a Senate committee right after he lost his job as director of the FBI. Trump had said he wanted and needed loyalty. Comey had offered loyalty to the truth — and shortly thereafter he was fired.
Rudell says Hathloul and Albutairi were hopeful about the changes in Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. He knew that Hathloul had been arrested in the past, but thought she and her husband were safe because they were so well known.

A deliberate change on professors' part from trying to cram in as much material as possible over the course of a term, Cohen suggests, brings benefits to the students. I am convinced that key concepts and texts will adhere better to memory and understanding if their presentation is slowed down, she says in her essay.
But critics say it will hurt lower-income women who depend upon family planning centers that receive what are known as Title X funds. Leana Wen is a physician and the president of Planned Parenthood, and she joins us now.
Technology like this is enabling scientists to gather frequent and reliable data from the grassroots level — and to fill in gaps. And proponents of citizen observations say having more hands on deck helps advance not only science but also policy.
I think we are working on two fronts. On the one front, we are doing our utmost and this is a nationwide effort to fight the virus. At the same time, we are doing whatever we can, to the extent that we can, to maintain some normal economic and social life. For instance, people's daily necessities have to be provided and some of the companies, factories have to resume their work after the Lunar New Year holidays. And we are looking at when and how schools could be reopened.
Now, as host of his own nightly show, Meyers actively works against the instinct to second guess himself. We made this decision after [Late Night] every night not to do a post-op ... [and] instead [to] sleep on it, he says. And if it's still bothering you in the morning, let's talk then. The reality is, you are then just focused on the next show. ... It's nice to be in this place where you can be very forward focused.
UNIDENTIFIED CHOIR: (Singing) When they let you down, you'll get up off the ground as morning rolls around and it's another day of sun.
BARRON: I think that our elections are without reproach. I mean, we come to work every day just to do this job because it means something to us. And what it's turned into this year is something that I don't think I ever anticipated seeing in my lifetime. It's concerning to me that we've got to this point and that a lot of things are put out in social media and the Twittersphere that just have no basis in fact. And I think there has to be some sort of education for the public that just breaks down and simplifies what goes on behind the scenes in elections because it is really just a set of processes that you go through, and you do it time and time again. And they're the same things we've been doing for years and years.

In 2015, Khan Academy, which pioneered free, online video tutorials and lectures that have reached millions of students around the world, sought new ways of reaching new people.
It also sends a clear message domestically: This administration is willing to make drastic, controversial cuts to fund that strong-power message. That includes slashing spending on foreign aid and the environment, as well as long-standing programs aimed at boosting the arts and humanities, as well as the fortunes of the most vulnerable Americans. The question now is how much the Republican-controlled Congress will go along with that vision.

Another Trump supporter, Jeffrey Stroehmann, also believes Trump's unfounded portrayal of an election rife with corruption, even though courts, state election officials and many leading Republicans have rejected those claims.
Assuming you are right might be a motivating force, sustaining the enormous effort that conducting scientific work requires. But it also makes it easy to construe criticisms as personal attacks, and for scientific arguments to devolve into personal battles. Beginning, instead, from the assumption you are wrong, a criticism is easier to construe as a helpful pointer, a constructive suggestion for how to be less wrong — a goal that your critic presumably shares.

Nepali leaders aren't happy about the Christianity boom. Before the release of the country's first constitution this September, debates swelled over whether to scrap secularism and go back to an official Hindu designation. While Christians and other religious minorities feared a clampdown on religious freedom, the Hindu right insisted secularism would allow Christianity to take over. The British ambassador in Nepal ran afoul of this sentiment in 2014 after telling Parliament the right to change religions should be included in the constitution. Pro-Hindu groups accused him of supporting proselytizing and called for his resignation. When lawmakers did ensure secularism in the constitution, police needed water cannons and tear gas to dispel angry Hindu protesters.

Dozens of Republican House lawmakers, along with some Republican senators supportive of Trump, had planned to object Wednesday to the electoral votes of as many as six states that backed Biden.
North Korea did continue last year, though, to test shorter range ballistic missiles capable of hitting targets in South Korea, including bases where the U.S. has some 28,500 troops. President Trump appeared unperturbed by the tests, as they were not capable of hitting the U.S. mainland.

Girls seeking success in wrestling say they want the same benefits and opportunities as their male peers already have — and by providing them to college athletes, many more girls in high school, like Felicity Taylor, might be inspired to get involved in the sport.
Recent high-profile measles outbreaks in the U.S., Europe, the Philippines and Samoa should push health officials to make sure more kids are immunized this year. To prevent outbreaks, the World Health Organization says that roughly 95% of a community needs to be vaccinated against measles. More than half the countries in the world, including the U.S. at 94%, haven't reached that threshold, according to UNICEF. Where might there be a measles outbreak in 2020? Afghanistan, Angola, Bolivia and Haiti all have dismally low immunization rates below 40%.

And I'm also very grateful for the opportunity to thank a city and the streets that changed my life and help to empower millions of women all around the world and change the face of the sport.

Colorado School of Mines professor Geoffrey Thyne understands that. Still, he wants the industry to start encouraging more scientific research on fracking.
The head of the Association of Immunization Managers, Claire Hannan, says in her view, it's probably a good thing to get more doses flowing. The goal, she says, should be to send doses to the field as fast as possible. Get it, thaw it, give it. [Then] order the second dose. Don't try to store it at CDC, don't try to store it at McKesson.

Bruising as the loss was for Cruz, it may have been just as bitter for Sanders on the Democratic side. Clinton only increased her delegate lead by about 30 in the crucial category of pledged delegates. But the real pain for her rival was the opportunity cost. Sanders' team had given it their all in New York, outspending Clinton on TV and hoping visibly for an upset — or at least a narrow loss that could be spun as a moral victory.

Simply by intervening, Putin demonstrated Russia is still an influential player in the Middle East. Ever since the Soviet breakup a quarter-century ago, Russia has struggled to project itself as a global power and this was an opportunity to play a prominent role in a major conflict and challenge the U.S. at the same time.
Warnock said the coronavirus pandemic has brought those issues into sharper focus, and that he supports passing the $2,000 stimulus payments for qualifying Americans.
Alexander gave a different rationale: He argued that he had enough evidence that Trump acted inappropriately — but he does not think the president's actions are impeachable. If you've got eight witnesses saying that you left the scene of an accident, you don't need nine, he told NPR on Friday.
Well, at this hour, both the House and Senate are back at work under intense security hours after pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol building. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed what happened as House debate on the Electoral College votes resumed a short time ago.
Some scientists say they're being locked out of research on the oil spill because they refuse to sign confidentiality agreements. Ira Flatow and guests discuss the problems of doing scientific research when a lawsuit is pending. Is there a way to keep science independent?
GUNTON: Yes. I mean, it's competition for habitat, loss of habitat. Yes, you're right. They can actually lose the habitat because it's destroyed, but often, it's because there is literally - humanity wants that land as well as the animals do. And in those situations, animals don't often come out on top. And it's quite a - it's a really important part of - it became a really important part of the series, actually. We didn't set out to tell people a conservation story.
If people don't like you because you refused to break the law or you insisted on telling the truth or following your constitutional and legal duty — shame on them, not shame on you, Goldstein said.
Over 800 people have died in China from the coronavirus. That's more than the SARS epidemic death toll 18 years ago. Meanwhile, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus on a ship near Japan has risen. The Diamond Princess was supposed to have docked in Taiwan today, but the cruise ship has become a floating quarantine for some 3,700 people aboard. Since Monday, it's been alternating between the port of Yokohama, Japan, and nearby open water. It's believed that a passenger carrying the coronavirus boarded the ship before disembarking in Hong Kong. More than 60 people on the Diamond Princess have now tested positive for the disease. About a dozen are American.

Mr. WOHLFORTH: Yeah. The parallel is they're really quite distressing, you know, in what we can see from the Exxon Valdez, which is what I wrote about in my book - you interviewed me about The Fate of Nature -is that the result of getting the lawyers in charge of the science program is you don't get the answers you need. So 20 years after the Exxon Valdez, we still don't know what happened to the herring. We still really don't know how much oil was released. You know, we still don't know the major ecosystem effect, and that's after spending $500 million on science. And the reason for that failure is because of the secrecy that's been mentioned, and also because lawyers are not scientists. And when they design a science program, they get it wrong.

2019 was marked by angry protests over inequality around the world, and according to some experts, the demonstrations will grow more violent in 2020.
AUBREY: Well, the CDC says that what scientists know now, given recent studies, is that a lot of people with coronavirus lack symptoms or they have only mild symptoms, and they can transmit the virus. So this means if an infected person goes out and interacts in close quarters with others, they can unknowingly spread it. One person who pushed to make this change recommending broader use of masks is the former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb.

He was so enthusiastic about the president and about the good things the president is doing. He was so enthusiastic about this, that the only hope for Ukraine to straighten itself out is if we get to the bottom of this. And his partner, Igor Fruman, I also love and care about, and Igor, of course, is saying the total opposite, but nobody's paying attention to it over what Lev Parnas is saying.

The outcome of the poll depends in part on who votes in it. Women and men exhibit different voting preferences along gender lines; an analysis of the individual ballots from 2017, 2018 and 2019 shows that women critics were approximately one and a half times more likely to vote for projects led or co-led by women musicians than their male counterparts. In addition, researching individual ballots revealed that, on average, 12% of male critics ranked no projects led or co-led by women musicians at all, even during years when a substantial number of women made recordings compelling enough to land in the top 10 and top 50.

So really record speed there, David, in terms of getting a vaccine to a virus and as you know, it's — the safety is really critical here, which is why we have to be careful about the development. But very quick development, as I mentioned yesterday, realistically, we're looking at a year to get a vaccine up and running and available. So you may ask why is safety so important? It's always important, of course, with any therapy or prevention, such as a vaccine. But remember, the vaccines are given to people who don't have the disease, who are otherwise healthy. So the safety consideration is very significant. After the safety phase of this, then it gets moved to can the vaccine elicit an immune response? Which of course, we would consider to be protective against the virus. So multiple steps that have to take place, they have to be done under controlled conditions, so that we can make sure that we have the right answer.

KANDER: It's really true. We just wrote songs, and we liked to write songs. So the idea of taking that idea and going in another direction was not a moment of friction between us. It was, OK, let's try that. And we ended up writing a song which I like very much to this day because it's so simple.
Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said he welcomes the changes.
But the National Association of Immigration Judges, the union that represents immigration judges, warns that quotas could undermine judicial independence and erode due process rights for immigrants. Immigration lawyers are also critical of the plan. Decisions in immigration court have life-or-death consequences and cannot be managed like an assembly line, said Jeremy McKinney, secretary of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.

An MVNO is an alternative carrier that leases network coverage from one of the Big Four companies and can offer similar levels of service at a lower cost.

And there was a very famous spy named Pham Xuan An who was so important that during his time as a mole he was promoted to a major general by the North Vietnamese. And he was friends with people like David Halberstam and all the important American journalists. And they had no idea that he was a communist spy who had studied in the United States. So all these factors were in my mind.
I was sickened, as I hope all Americans were, watching an attack on the center of our democracy, Comey says of the violence. And I was also angry as someone who spent a lot of a career in law enforcement; I was angry that it was being allowed to happen and that the Capitol was not being adequately defended. It just mystified me and angered me.
But for Trump fan Tracey Lawrence, at least, the Stop the Steal rally was a big success.

I got on Twitter and I wanted people to understand because I was seeing and lot of white people who were expressing just shock. I need people to understand that it's the cumulative effect of knowing everywhere you go that you aren't welcome, says Ijeoma Oluo, a speaker and writer from Seattle. Oluo shared statistics about how black and brown youth are often criminalized from as early as preschool. Those statistics point to the issues behind a lot of these incidents, she says.
YONG: Right. A lot of our preparedness measures in general have been focused on flu as the most likely next pandemic - and for good reason - because flu actually is the most likely next pandemic. It just so happened that this time, it was a coronavirus. And we don't have surveillance for coronaviruses. We know, actually, surprisingly little about coronavirus biology. And all of those deficiencies have contributed to this dire situation that we're facing when we don't know enough but we're forced to act as quickly as possible.
NGUYEN: I hated that store. You know, I am thankful to my parents that they were not the kind of - I mean, they made me do certain kinds of things, like do the accounting and all of that.

On the contrary, they find out who they really are and how they really want to live. And this self-knowledge leads to a wickedly upbeat ending that includes the greatest gag ever about finding a parking space in Manhattan. David and Linda only stopped being lost in America when they find out that, given the choice, they'd rather be comfortable than free.
What remains a complete mystery is what is inside them. Once we cross the point of no return (also known as the horizon), things change in a curious way. In our reality, we are free to move in space, but time only goes forward. We can control where we go, but not how time goes. Once inside a black hole, this role is somewhat reversed. Now, there is only one place to go, the center of the hole, a one-way track to oblivion. However, as we dive into the center of the hole, we may see all of time at once, as in Jorge Luis Borges' magnificent short story The Aleph. It is also quite possible that there is no real singularity at the center, but something else. Some theories speculate that a black hole is really a kind of tunnel to another spot in the universe (known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge, think a subway tunnel) or even to another universe. We don't know.
ROXANNE ROBERTS: Yeah, but the problem with that is that if the eggs drop they're going to break.
The tool's release comes on the heels of a new report that confirms forced labor and human rights abuses remain embedded in Thailand's fishing industry, years after global media outlets first documented the practice.
KODJAK: Severino is conservative and a devout Catholic. He previously worked at the Becket Fund, a nonprofit law firm that focuses on religious freedom. And he ran a center on religion at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Since he joined HHS just a year ago, he's issued a new rule that allows employers to refuse to cover birth control if they have a religious or moral objection. And he created the new Religious Freedom Division to ensure that health care workers and companies are never forced to participate in medical services like abortion if they object.

Together, they produced Section 230 — perhaps the only 20-year-old statute to be claimed by Internet companies and advocates as technologically prescient.
The sources also said the company would like to present its own plan before one is imposed by regulators.
For constant exponential growth, you would expect cases to double consistently over a three- or four-day period, says Nick Jewell, a biostatistician at the University of California, Berkeley. The whole point of social distancing is to make that doubling time longer and longer.
The legislation will face legal challenges as well. On Wednesday, Butch Otter (R-ID) became the first governor to sign a law requiring the state attorney general to sue the federal government if it forces individuals to buy health insurance – a central tenet of the legislation. Other states are likely to pass similar measures, including Arizona, where the question will be put directly to voters.

WOOD JR: I want the biggest bag you have just to make sure. And you know - and that's where when it comes to educating people about issues of race and just - here's a snippet of black life you might not have considered, something as simple about a bag. Like, for me, I enjoy being able to find material that specific in that regard because it gives me an opportunity to just show a little bit more of my world and what I believe African-Americans go through. And it's not to vilify this man because I can't say that he's racist because he didn't know that a bag could get me harassed. If he doesn't have a black friend that's ever explained that to him, when was he ever going to learn it? Here's a joke for me to explain it to all of y'all.

The response system got a test in 2015, when an oil pipeline burst a few miles up the coast. Workers deployed thousands of feet of floating boom to help contain the spill and skimmer boats began removing the oil from the water's surface.

Only 44 percent of farmers called agriculture their primary occupation in the most recent census by the USDA. Small producers, especially, rely on outside income. But economists expect farmers of larger operations to look for extra work in order to stay in the black.
Today in Alabama, sheriffs are personally responsible for feeding inmates in their jails and receive funds to cover the cost. For state inmates, it's less than $2 per inmate per day; for county, city or federal inmates, the amount can be higher.
NOURSE: I really was quite demoralized. I really didn't know how I was going to move forward. The women judges had by then come out in favor of a remedy. So we had some support. But judges are friends of senators, and they had convinced people that this was the worst thing that had ever happened to them. And I could never quite get them out of that mindset.

As recently as 2015, the act was mentioned again when 47 Republican U.S. senators wrote a letter to Iran downplaying the nuclear deal. Sen. Tom Cotton, who has been rumored to be in line as Trump's next CIA director, penned the letter — and was accused of violating the act.
Back in the early '60s, I learned - studied physics, and then I was told to get close to the speed of light, it takes a little bit more energy. A little bit closer, it takes a whole lot more energy.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell made last-minute, handwritten changes Tuesday to the parameters for how President Trump's impeachment trial process will play out. Departing from a draft resolution he released Monday night, the resolution now allows impeachment managers and the president's defense to have 24 hours to make arguments over three session days. The draft had stipulated 24 hours over two days. McConnell also altered the rules for admitting the House evidence into the record.
Since you cannot calculate anything in the multiverse, the assumptions which physicists removed must then be replaced with something else. That something else is a probability distribution on the multiverse, which tells you not what we do observe, but what we are likely to observe. But it is simpler to assume a constant than an infinite number of universes with a probability distribution over them. Therefore, Ockham's razor should shave off the multiverse. It's superfluous. Unfortunately, this argument carries little weight among many of today's theoretical physicists who value the multiverse because it excuses boundless speculation.
Hahn, of the FDA, said he wanted to assure Americans that the agency would work as fast as it could to broaden access to new medicines and treatment but that it remained bound by its mission to ensure that those products would be safe.
GROSS: And it made me think about - because I was just reading this - it made me think about how a president can set the tone for the country on so many things, including, you know, racial issues, immigration.

These goals build on the commitments McDonald's has made to improve options for kids. And, in many cases, these goals represent small tweaks. For instance, to reduce sugar, McDonald's locations in the U.S. have already switched to organic apple juice that is lower in sugar and calories. Now, the company plans to reformulate chocolate milk to a lower-sugar version. In addition, they will downsize the size of the fries served with the six-piece Chicken McNugget Happy Meal. Currently it comes with a standard small fry, but going forward this will change to a smaller kiddie size.
Several of these eliminated programs aim to help the poorest Americans. The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps people pay utility bills and weatherize their homes.

And to challenge us to think through the ways that expertise is gendered. Many of the women who Davis invites to contribute to the NPR Music Jazz Critics poll decline to participate, some explaining that they hadn't listened to enough new recordings to feel confident in choosing the year's best, Davis writes in his editorial note accompanying the 2018 results.

Besides, Pauline Kael, Susan Sontag, Ellen Willis and Valerie Wilmer never had to be coaxed to share their opinions. They couldn't stop themselves, and neither could anyone else.

Number two, they don't like the precedent that's set that a future Democratic president could declare a national emergency around gun safety or climate change or health care. They also don't like the constitutional clash that the president is setting up, where he's challenging the separation of powers and Congress's power to appropriate money. And also, Congress, who has allowed its power to wither, is further emasculating itself in the mind of many lawmakers. Republican Senator Lee of Utah said recently because we don't want to make the judgment calls that made people angry, we leave it to the executive. It's almost as if Congress doesn't want to go through the difficult task of lawmaking.
#2 Create snowballs. Sometimes, an early gain can snowball into a greater final outcome. Money provides an easy illustration. Two people who start out with different amounts of money might see the discrepancy in their wealth magnified over time as the richer party capitalizes on the opportunities afforded by their wealth: investments that pay off; education that opens doors; and so on. As the saying goes, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer — a phenomenon also known as the Matthew Effect. In such cases, it pays to bring about initial gains; a numerically comparable boost that occurs later in time is likely to make a smaller difference to the final outcome. For processes that snowball, there's a good argument for early learning.

It's not yet clear how President-elect Donald Trump and congressional Republicans plan to revamp the federal health law, known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. They have not agreed on a plan, and they do not have enough votes in the Senate to fully repeal the current statute. So they are planning to use a budgeting rule to disassemble part of the law, which will limit what they can change. But they also may seek revisions in important regulations and guidance that have determined how the law is implemented.
ALECCIA: You know, critics of aid in dying say that they would like it to continue to be taboo because they believe it's kind of the first step toward societal euthanasia, if you will. More and more, though - more and more states are considering this. There is potential legislation in as many as two dozen states seeking to do this. So I think, from what I've heard from experts, the issues surrounding it are becoming less taboo. But, still, talking about end of life and death is still pretty uncomfortable in our society.
These two ideas give two very different depictions of reality, but they both line up perfectly with the mathematics of quantum mechanics as we know it.

At the moment, he said, NPR is soliciting feedback from stations about possible changes, but I am encouraged that clock changes might be forthcoming.

Alabama has a Depression-era law that allows sheriffs to keep and retain unspent money from jail food-provision accounts. Sheriffs across the state take excess money as personal income — and, in the event of a shortfall, are personally liable for covering the gap.
All of the automation and keeping a lid on labor costs allow manufacturers like McGregor to compete with a low-cost country like Vietnam.
We must be careful and practical. This process will be like repairing a jetliner while it's in flight. Crashing a plane to make it safer isn't good for the passengers.
SIMMONS-DUFFIN: She says with so many people dying every day, this may be better than keeping vaccine in a freezer somewhere. Of course, there are problems that more doses won't solve, like finding willing people to get shots because of vaccine hesitancy and just general disorganization and chaos that we've heard about in different places.
Maybe you should tell me what you're dealing with here. So I can work harder at staying out of your way, Claire added with a flirtatious touch of irony.

Accountability is great, but even with accountability, even if Rick Snyder was behind bars for a significant amount of time, that still doesn't compensate for the generations of irreversible damage that is and will continue to happen with residents, said LaTricea Adams, who heads Black Millennials For Flint, which advocates for the rights of Flint residents still dealing with the effects of the water crisis.
Clients Hahn had helped buy a house a year or two before began to call about exit strategies.

Victoria's job was to write it. In order to do that, she had to understand the laws through a new lens - through the history of violence against women. This is a story about a group of people who got a rare chance to take on an age-old problem - a problem rooted in power - in the hopes that something could finally be done.
Okay. She seemed to drift, and when she spoke again, she might have been in a trance. It started out as a scratch. Not even. He was playing court tennis.
Beck explains that as we read a book, it feels like a fluent experience when we're absorbed in the text. The material that we're taking in, though, is being held only in working memory. It takes concentrated effort to set that material in long-term memory. Beck writes:

YONG: Right. So a very small group of people - maybe, you know, several dozens of researchers - have focused on coronaviruses for a few decades now. But it really has been a very, very niche field, even among virologists. When SARS classic first emerged, I think coronavirus researchers were really shocked that the things that they were studying were suddenly of public health importance.
I'm sorry, that's what I call corruption. And they can dress it up in fine legalese, but corruption is still corruption, Schiff said.
I think [analysts are] wrong, absolutely. We're paying very close attention to the vulnerable population and making that a very important part of how things are executed. Bear in mind, there are a lot efficiencies that will save us a lot of money. And there's also a new model that we're really concentrating on. The old model was the federal government rides in on the white horse and plops down millions of dollars and says, Build this place for all these people. And then goes on to the next project. The new model is the federal government seeds the project, and oversees and facilitates, along with the housing authorities, ... bringing in those private partners, bringing in the nonprofits, bringing in the faith community.
EPA Scientists' Work May Face 'Case By Case' Review By Trump Team, Official Says
As New York's outbreak has heated up, Gov. Andrew Cuomo often refers to doubling times to signal how things are going. We had a doubling of cases every two days, he told the public on March 30. We now have a doubling of cases every six days. So while the overall number is going up, the rate of doubling is actually going down.

If President-Elect Biden is suggesting that the maximum number of doses should be made available, consistent with ensuring that a second dose of vaccine will be there when the patient shows up, then that is already happening, wrote spokesperson Michael Pratt in a statement to NPR. Operation Warp Speed monitors manufacturing closely, with the intent to transition from reserving as many second doses as manufacturing further stabilizes with a consistent flow of vaccines.

This argument ignores Iran's own support for listed terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas. It's also not a majority view, Iranians say. But a visit to Qom does give a Westerner a glimpse of the forces that will be lining up against Iran's moderate and reformist politicians in Friday's vote.

Sydney Harper and Peter Granitz produced and edited this interview for broadcast. Milton Guevara adapted it for the Web.
GOLDMAN: Well, that's a very good question. And I think what you're saying is it doesn't mean as much because of the way college football lurched through the season - you know, many games canceled, many players, coaches tested positive for the coronavirus. Nearly 20 bowl games were called off because of the pandemic. And Ohio State, in fact, only managed to play and win six games before last night. And some, including Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney, said that should've disqualified Ohio State from playing in the College Football Playoff. Then you had the Big Ten conference change some rules to make it so Ohio State could qualify for the playoff. And the Buckeyes got some players back early after they'd tested positive for the coronavirus so they could play in yesterday's game.
So in a way the graphic is really comparing apples and oranges: measurements of the recent past versus reconstructions of more ancient times.

If the president has the authority to issue that directive, whether from the Constitution or statute, then it becomes legally binding. However, Cooper says, if there's a clear piece of legislation that says, 'No you can't do this,' a president can't pick up a pen and get around it. In essence, a president can't sign an executive order that violates existing law.

In addition, the Vatican has a whole another understanding of what accountability means in a case like this, because their theological model for understanding a bishop is not that he is the CEO of a corporation, but he's the father of a family. And as we would say with regular human families, you know, when things get tough, you don't tell the father to walk away. You tell him to, you know, try to solve the problem. That's their understanding of what accountability means.

Perhaps the most notable case came in 2003, when the administration of President George W. Bush tried to alter the climate change section of a major EPA report on the environment. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, which tracks such issues, changes included the deletion of a 1,000 year temperature record and insertion of a study funded by the American Petroleum Institute.

SCICLUNA: Well, I think crisis is also an opportunity. And I think that this is a moment where we need to listen to the victims, to the communities there asking that we get it right. This will not go away easily. This will create a lot of hurt. But the United States has moved - I'm talking about the Catholic Church in the United States - has moved forward since 2002.

The saving grace for me and my neighborhood was that my parents bought me a really nice basketball goal. And there was a park up the street from my house called Powderly Park. And Powderly Park had all the - you know, it was a municipal city park, and they had all the hoops. And you know, it would be bangers out there. And Powderly Park sat on the edge of Gangster Disciple and Vice Lord territory, so sometimes it would go down at Powderly Park. So my mom didn't really want me around that element. So I - and I've never talked with her about this, but my guess is that her ideology was if the boy likes shooting basketball, let's put a basketball hoop in the yard, and that way, he won't be at Powderly Park if something goes down.

Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury is a big contrast to his starring role in the TV series Mr. Robot as a withdrawn hacker with social anxiety disorder. Terry spoke with Rami Malek in November. Let's start with a scene from Bohemian Rhapsody.

Stars are kind of like living creatures in that they also have a life cycle: They are born (in regions we call stellar nurseries, huge gas clouds in outer space), live dramatically, fusing hydrogen into helium for a long time until they die, when they run out of hydrogen. Without the energy released from nuclear fusion to balance the imploding pressure from gravity, the star collapses onto itself, releasing a huge amount of energy in the process. Large stars, at least eight times more massive than the sun, become supernovas. Their core, what's left over after the explosion, is what could become a black hole.

American leadership has already dramatically declined in the past ten months. In 1991, when Bush, Sr., launched the war against Iraq, it got thirty-four countries to join the war effort. This time, if Trump launched a war against anyone, I doubt he would get support from even five countries. For Chinese leaders, Yan said, 'Trump is the biggest strategic opportunity.' [New Yorker reporter Evan Osnos] asked Yan how long he thought the opportunity would last. 'As long as Trump stays in power,' he replied.
The people of Georgia are angry, and these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night, along with others that we're going to have by that time, which are much more substantial, Trump claimed.

FLATOW: Steven, do you think we'll be more upset if we find it or more upset if we don't find it?
LIASSON: Well, it's just heartbreaking. You know, this is supposed to be the greatest democracy on the face of the Earth. Politics is the nonviolent way that we work out our differences, and today that didn't happen. I don't know if I ever could have imagined that I would live to hear a senior member of the Republican Party - in this case, Mitt Romney - say, what happened today was, quote, an insurrection incited by the president of the United States. I mean, it's just extraordinary. Everyone I've talked to today has just been totally heartbroken. But it's a logical conclusion in many ways to President Trump's repeated refusal ever since 2016 to not agree to a peaceful transfer of power, to not say he would accept the results of an election where he wasn't the winner.

One reason that Sembene could pull this off was that, by the time he made Black Girl, he was a man in his 40s who knew life. This was no film school brat but the son of a poor Muslim fisherman who'd fought with the Free French forces during World War II, stowed away to do manual labor in France, returned to Senegal in time for independence in 1960, became a largely self-taught writer - his 1960 novel, God's Bits Of Wood, is tremendous - and then became a filmmaker because so many of his countrymen couldn't read. To reach them, he needed to make movies, and that's just what he did. Over the next decade, Sembene would go on to make richer and more complex works than Black Girl.

They were - I don't know how we fed those people. But I wouldn't call that being in the military. But, you know, I had to face the idea of it, which was interesting. I mean, when I was - I saw myself, I watched myself as I was teaching people. That was one of my jobs, to teach people how to kill the greatest number of people with a mortar shell. And I would keep them interested and, you know, I wanted to be a good teacher. As long as they gave me a job, I did the best I could.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: It does. It does. Yeah. I have no problem saying that. Why? Because we have tried their approach for 40 years. For 40 years, we tried to let the private sector take care of it. They said, we got this, we can do this, the forces of the market are going to force us to innovate. Except for the fact that there's a little thing in economics called externalities, and what that means is that a corporation can dump pollution in the river and they don't have to pay for it, and taxpayers have to pay for cleaning up our air, cleaning up our water and saving the planet.

LIASSON: What happens next is that House and Senate negotiators from both parties start talking to each other. The president has said that at the end of three weeks, if he doesn't get money for a wall, he will either declare a national emergency - in other words, build the wall himself with unobligated Pentagon funds - or shut down the government again. But no one I've talked to on either side of the aisle thinks that he will actually shut down the government again. Some people do think that declaring an emergency is still his endgame. But many Republicans are against that because they say it'll set a precedent. And a future Democratic president could declare an emergency for gun safety or health care or climate change. And these Republicans say that any kind of an emergency declaration would be tied up in court, and he would end up getting no wall after all.
It's tough for many Britons to watch the NHS struggle because they love it so much. Anandaciva, of The King's Fund, says the service regularly tops public opinion polls on what makes people proud to be British.
With very few exceptions, neither Mercer talks to the press or speaks publicly and if they have specific policy goals, those are shrouded in mystery. NPR contacted a spokesman for the Mercers but did not receive a reply.
As coronavirus numbers have ticked steadily upwards in some U.S. states and cities, officials have watched one specific figure to see whether they're facing a flattening curve or runaway outbreak: the doubling rate.
ROBERT SIEGEL, BYLINE: What science fiction writers have dreamt of for decades, scientists now say is possible, to simulate reality to create with the aid of a computer a lifelike world of the imagination, a place not bound by physical laws or reason. Computer scientists call the concept virtual or artificial reality.
The EPA contends that the rule will improve public trust in environmental regulations by letting people know more about the data that regulators use to make their decisions about air and water pollution, including greenhouse gas emissions. These cause climate change and particle pollution that can exacerbate chronic diseases that make people more susceptible to severe COVID-19.
The U.S. will keep an eye on these, says Julia Braun, a registered dietitian and head of global nutrition at McDonald's. We're committed to exploring new options.
That would seem to be good news for a musical community that has been frustratingly slow to embrace women musicians. Women in jazz have traditionally been singers, a role that allows them to be dismissed as entertainers who are not fundamental to jazz as serious art. Few female instrumentalists — or, for that matter, composers, arrangers and bandleaders — have become part of the music's story, one that stretches back to the late 19th century.
One reason the 1969 oil spill had such an impact was that Santa Barbara was home to a lot of wealthy Republicans who had helped elect Nixon, Alagona says.
That kind of involvement by young people isn't new, Taft says. But what has changed, she says, is that today's social media platforms make their contributions more visible to the world and to each other.

I never instructed John Bolton to set up a meeting for Rudy Giuliani, one of the greatest corruption fighters in America and by far the greatest mayor in the history of NYC, to meet with President Zelenskiy. That meeting never happened, he said.
Weeks after Jussie Smollett reported being assaulted in a potential hate crime, the Empire actor has been released on bail after police questioned him for allegedly orchestrating the attack. Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett faked the incident, paying two brothers about $3,500 to join a publicity stunt staged by Smollett because he was dissatisfied with his salary.
Tonight is the Oscars, when Hollywood gathers to celebrate and reward the best movies and the people who make them. Despite the fact that Latinos make up almost half the population of the LA area, only a tiny fraction of them are employed behind and in front of the camera. There is now a new jobs program to change that with the aim of doubling Latino representation in Hollywood over the next decade. It's called LA Collab, and it was co-founded by the mayor of LA, Eric Garcetti. Welcome.
It's been a busy week for President Trump's pen.
Patti herself may not be much of a musician, but there's no doubting she's a natural born poet. Whether she's improvising some lines in a parking lot with Jheri or defeating a local bully in an outdoor hip-hop battle, she proves herself a terrific wordsmith, a master at synthesizing tough-talking slang, pop cultural references and no shortage of expletives into an exhilarating stream of rhyming verse.
The invasion of the Capitol was not the first act of resistance to the election by Trump or his most intense loyalists. The rioters wanted to stop the count because Trump had told them that would mean another election could be held — at least in the states he falsely claimed he had won.
The lack of good notification was leading people down a dangerous path in terms of declining or delaying Part B, Sanders says.

It's too similar to Australia's flag, and it's embarrassing when they're confused; it would be expensive to change it. It's too colonial; it's a part of Kiwi history. It doesn't honor any of the Maori heritage of New Zealand; generations of New Zealanders fought and died for that symbol.

I have no doubt that the day will come when the supreme, presidential power in Russia will not be so personified, if I may say so, that it will not be connected to a certain individual, Putin added. But this is exactly how it was in our previous history, and we must take this into account.
Deena Katz, a Hollywood producer who became involved in the early stages of planning for the march, said fundraising efforts have been successful enough to ensure continued lobbying and other activism. She did not cite a specific amount, saying donations were still being tallied.
Well, I guess I just wonder, I mean, President Trump said yesterday he's clearing red tape like no one before has ever done. What's an example of that? I mean, you say it's an all-of-government approach, but if you can't say like we're gonna get this process that could get this drug out there much faster going — like why not — why not today?

A study of death penalty juries in Houston County, Ala., showed that 80 percent of qualified black jurors were struck; the result was that in a 27 percent black county, half the death penalty juries were all white. Another study in North Carolina found that from 1990 to 2010, prosecutors excluded black jurors twice as often a non-black jurors.
HADID: That's right. He's a 23-year-old construction worker, and he lived about a minute's walk from where Zainab lived.

KANDER: He literally said, I think you two guys should meet each other. I think you'd like each other. And so since we always followed his advice, separately at the time, we did meet each other. We did like each other. And we started writing almost immediately. I don't know, we were just pregnant with song all the time, it seemed to me. And from then on, we've been one of those marriages in which you're pretty faithful to each other. Fred has done some material with someone else and I do an occasional movie score, as I am at the moment. But when it comes down to the hardcore of what we've written, we write together.

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Dave Davies in for Terry Gross. As we honor the memory of Dr. Martin Luther King today, we're going to listen to an interview Terry recorded with historian Henry Louis Gates. The new season of his TV series Finding Your Roots is now showing on PBS. In the show, notable guests discover their family roots based on genealogical research and DNA results. This kind of research has been especially important for African-Americans whose ancestors had their names and families taken away when they were enslaved. One episode this season explores Gates' own DNA and family history.
According to the March For Our Lives website, the activists say they will fight for comprehensive gun safety legislation at the local, state and federal level and undertake voter education and ballot initiatives.
The Senate also seems to be less-than-enthused to change any of the big entitlements. McConnell, who will be clinging to an even narrower 51-49 majority in 2018, told Axios that he would not expect to see the Senate work on making changes to those programs without Democrats.

JOHNSON: Well, the acting attorney general is coordinating with law enforcement partners to add additional federal support to the Capitol Police. Jeffrey Rosen put out a statement rather late in the day, saying the violence on our nation's capital is an intolerable attack on a fundamental institution of our democracy. DOJ has deployed hundreds of federal agents from the FBI, ATF and U.S. Marshals to help. The National Guard is sending more than a thousand troops, and Virginia and Maryland police are on hand as well. The evacuation of the Capitol, we're told, is mostly complete. We're also told that the FBI located and disarmed multiple suspicious devices in or near the Capitol.
MONTAGNE: Thank you very much for your time.
There's a growing concern in the scientific community and among environmental organizations that the new administration might take aim at climate change research in particular. Trump has previously called climate change a hoax created by China to hurt the U.S. economy, though he later said he had an open mind on the issue. In the weeks before his inauguration, groups of scientists rushed to copy and preserve federal public climate data out of fear that it would be purged.
Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. He was the first senator to say that he would join the objections to the election results. He raised his fist to the mob before they stormed the building. He continued his objections afterward and said he was just raising some concerns about ballot security. Is there any doubt, though, that your colleague knew what he was inciting?
GOLDMAN: I think it could. The Houston Astros broke baseball rules by using technology at Houston home games - technology in the form of video cameras, video replay - to steal the signs opposing catchers were giving to pitchers. Now, the team that won the 2018 World Series, the Boston Red Sox, is being investigated for similar rule-breaking. There's suspicion there could be more teams, as well. So just the scope could be much greater than 1919.
Pullen says even a few years ago he would've never imagined London in such difficulty, with Paris enjoying a business renaissance.

But what Trump faces today is a far more generalized sense that the government has been slow to respond even in the face of an obvious danger. Indeed, the NPR/PBS/Marist poll found more Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the pandemic than approve by a 49%-44% margin.

Still, Monday's revelation further tightens the window for Trump to try to make an unprecedented change in who is counted in a process that helps set the balance of power in Congress and the Electoral College long after Trump's term ends.
My question is with this idea of inflation, I see that as the universe expanding faster than the speed of light. Is it possible that, you know, under those conditions, if things really were sent out, wherever out is, to us faster than the speed of light and just that the light hasn't had time to get back to us?
Mr. TURNER: You can't always choose the problems that nature gives you. So we're still very interested in looking at hints for the unification of the forces from the early universe, and one of our other big holy grails in cosmology right now is to test this idea of inflation, the idea that the universe went through a growth spurt and that this growth spurt, very early on, which explains a lot of the features of the universe today, including the galaxies and astronomers that we know exist, by blowing up quantum fluctuations, that would be or could be a big clue and piece to this unification.

The Trump administration's call to expand vaccine eligibility also deviates from previous Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, which had recommended that front-line, essential workers and those over 75 be next in line, after health care workers and long-term care residents. Essential workers include groups such as grocery, agricultural and transportation workers who are at high risk of exposure.
When Entrekin's predecessor died while still in office, all the money in the food provision account went to his estate — as state law dictated, a county official told NPR. Entrekin had to borrow $150,000 to keep the inmates fed. He was paying down that debt for years, The Gadsden Times reported.

U.S. economic might should not be underestimated. Combined with Iran's endemic corruption and the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. sanctions have cratered the Iranian economy, driven up inflation and eroded the purchasing power of average Iranians. The U.S. measures have effectively cut off Iran from the international financial system and targeted key sectors, including energy and manufacturing. Oil exports, Iran's most important source of hard currency, remain largely crippled by the threat of U.S. sanctions. The government has tried to boost the non-oil sector and focus on trade in goods that are not as easy for sanctions to interrupt. But Iranian President Hassan Rouhani's latest budget proposal continues to rely significantly on oil. Budgeting has a habit of focusing minds, and the message from Rouhani's plan could not have been clearer: The long-term stability of the economy depends in large part on relations with Washington.

But he added: On balance, a sizeable drawdown could mean that Russian President Putin calculates he has gotten his maximum military bang for the buck in Syria, and that anything further would encounter diminishing returns.
So our first financial tip for new families: Don't be shy about the baby shower. Tell people what you need — and not just onesies and mobiles. For the more expensive things, like strollers, car seats and cribs, consider asking people to pool money. If you don't tell people what you want, you may end up with 200 newborn onesies, and none of the other things you'll desperately need.
If they don't qualify for either government health program, they could consider buying a health insurance plan on the state marketplace or through a broker.
The reality is that no company right now can be 100 percent sure there's no slavery in the supply chain, says Ganzler. All companies need to band together to work on the issue, along with the government. It really is an issue that governments are going to have to take action on.
Surrender by the state has never looked more tawdry and dismal, said an editorial Friday in the English-language Dawn newspaper. The paper reported that, according to protest leaders, Pakistan's government had agreed not to review the blasphemy laws - thereby abandoning its legislative prerogative - and to review anti-terrorism watch lists - thereby giving up its executive prerogative.
GATES: Was I close to them?
He went to work for the city and advocated for a Phoenix law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The ordinance would apply to housing, employment and other public accommodations — just as the law already did for categories like race, sex, marital status and religion.
It was the first and only time Congress sidestepped the Endangered Species Act, delisting a species on its own. Others have since tried to follow suit.

She said there is a full slate of ideologically neutral policies Trump put out, including ones on price transparency and prescription drugs. If Biden officials don't want to keep those as they are, they can rewrite them and advance other policies at the same time, saving a round of regulatory effort.

Joe Biden has been campaigning for one political office or another for decades. The former vice president is, perhaps, the most seasoned politician running for president this year, and that's obvious at his rallies. NPR's Asma Khalid has been following Biden on his campaign trail and shares this report.
Meanwhile, the earthquake last year may have strengthened the Christian surge. Where the government — long mired in political instability — has failed to help poor villagers, aid groups have trickled in to fill gaps, some of them carrying a message of salvation.

Soon many other types of retail outlets will also be required to only hire Saudi workers. It's causing a lot of problems for businesses, says a Saudi accountant. NPR is not using his name so he can speak without fear of recrimination.
On the Republican side, some of the president's former aides and allies have stepped aside in the wake of the violence he instigated. But many continue to support him, especially Republican officeholders who continue to object to the November election results even after they were forced into safe rooms to escape the mob.
KAPLAN-LEVENSON: On September 13, 1994, President Bill Clinton signed the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. VAWA was included in that bill, the crime bill that many say contributed to the rise of mass incarceration in this country and the bill that many people of color and grassroots organizations didn't want anywhere near the Violence Against Women Act - that bill.

Almost immediately, she said, she felt her mental state powerfully altered. The next thing she remembers is waking up in bed next to Cosby, she said. I have clothes on. He did not.

KHALID: Battis said Biden impressed him more this time.
NOURSE: Yes, previous legislation in the 19th century which was targeted at violence in the South. I mean, it's called the Ku Klux Klan Act that allowed the federal government to criminalize violence that was focused on race. And that was pretty well established. No one thought that that would be unconstitutional. I kept saying, well, if that isn't unconstitutional, why is it different for gender? This was my constant refrain. Eventually, unfortunately, one of the judges on the committee said to me, well, we don't like those cases, either. I couldn't get out of there fast enough, man.

YONG: That's right, yeah. When a virus enters a new host, there's often a brief period of acclimation, a little span of time when it's mutating a bit and finding ways of better existing within that new type of body.

It seems to have been a really good human pathogen right off the bat...
Meanwhile, in 2008, Huckabee had a far more commanding lead with these voters. He took 46 percent to Romney's 19 percent — and they made up 60 percent of the electorate. All that added up to a solid 9-point win for Huckabee over Romney.
C4C supports an orphanage, too. Not all the kids are orphans in the western sense, Fallesen explained, but they come from families that don't have the ability to properly care for them. How do these families feel about their kids getting baptized? Some are happy, some are not. Some now want to take them out from the home, said Rokka, whose ministry runs the orphanage. But the parents don't typically act on their concerns, he added. They have no way to help them. Anyway [the children] are getting help here, so [the parents] think, OK, let it be.

When the backlash against Gómez quotes began, freelance writer Britni De La Cretaz wrote an article pointing to the lack of diversity in newsrooms as contributing to the lack of sensitivity from both Smith and the editors who did not address the grammatically-poor quotes before publishing the article.

The election of November 2016 — obviously it was a national election for president, but it was also the night I was elected to the United States Senate. And as I write in the book, even just that night, which was the impetus for writing this book, I was experiencing our election and watching on the monitors this thing happen to our country. And I write about how my godson came up to me crying, Auntie Kamala, this man can't win. And he was afraid. And people were afraid. And my speech, impromptu that night, was we must fight. And that there is so much worth fighting for. And I wrote the book to talk about that.
The charter school had three social workers for 520 kids, and they actually had - the school had their time organized so they did therapy. At this particular school, 70 children had therapy every week for different kinds of emotional issues that were interfering with their learning. In the district school, there's one social worker for over 600 kids. And they don't have time to do any therapy because they're just juggling so much, and they have tons of paperwork they're responsible for.

Our critic at large John Powers says Black Girl isn't merely a landmark but a movie that still packs a wallop.

And I could not use my human instincts to respond. So if someone's talking to me, I had to think: OK, so when you talk to the family dog, 'You're such a good boy, Fluffy,' the dog does not say, 'Yes, Daddy, I am a good boy,' and give you a thumbs up. They tilt their head. They raise their ears. They wag their tail. They ruff at you. So they have their own ecosystem to respond with. So I had to find my own ecosystem with this fish man character, and that's kind of what helped me, was to think of the family dog.

I think we'd all agree on that, that the biggest mystery in particle physics and cosmology is why empty space appears to weigh something. That's literally the case.

A lot of the imports that we bring into the country are needed by our manufacturing industries as inputs into production.

You know what it was, I started doing plays in third grade. And I was a very shy kid when I was younger, I was very sensitive, and wasn't good at meeting new people. And I think in third grade, once I started to do improv and learn what acting was, and becoming a character, I found this confidence, and I loved the feeling of being on stage. I was Mowgli in The Jungle Book in fifth grade, and was running around with this leotard on. And I think, just honestly, maybe it was the adoration, you know, the applause at the end and then the rush of just like being in front of people and making them laugh. Maybe it was the attention, I don't know, but I started just knowing that I felt euphoric when I was doing it, and I wanted to keep doing it.

DARREN: Oh, yeah, they inspected the boat. They, of course, checked everyone's identification, and they took all the samples that we had. And they also took some notes that we had.

ALICE FORDHAM, BYLINE: Well, Scott, for many people, it is jubilant, and it feels historic. I was in the counting center earlier where all Dublin's votes are being counted. And there were a lot of people there who had campaigned to change the law observing the tally, in some cases watching their own neighborhood's voting box being counted. And it was very emotional.
LIASSON: That's right. His longtime friend Roger Stone, who is a self-described dirty trickster. I can't think of another president who's had a fixer and a dirty trickster in their orbit. But Roger Stone was invited - indicted. That increases the number of close associates to the president who have pled guilty or been indicted. Stone says he won't plead. He won't cooperate. He won't turn on the president. Maybe he's banking on a pardon. But what it seems like is that Robert Mueller is doing what most organized crime prosecutions do, working their way up the food chain, starting with small fry like Papadopoulos and then going up the ladder to people who are closer to the president. So it was a bad day for the president. But on the other hand, his capitulation on the shutdown took some of the attention away from the Robert - Roger Stone indictment. It was a bit of a distraction.
KHALID: Maryann and her husband Tom are fans of their home state senator, Elizabeth Warren. But their decision is not just about who they like.
I have not been in touch with [U.S. Attorney] John Durham. And this is on purpose. I haven't spoken to Bill Barr about this investigation in any respect, ever. I decided that any conversation between Bill and me would be – same thing with [former Acting Attorney General] Matt Whitaker-- any conversation like that would be completely misconstrued. No matter what we talked about, they would turn it around into some kind of an attempt by me to influence them or give them trouble they don't need. Anything I have, I can just promise it's big. It's got a lot of people. And if I have to deliver information, I'm not saying I have, but if I have to deliver information, I'll find a way to do it so it comes in a lower level to be reviewed first and then they can decide, is this appropriate for the attorney general or the deputy attorney general. Now that doesn't mean I haven't dealt with Bill Bar on other things, on other cases, totally unrelated to this. I am a lawyer and I do have other clients, although I have one that's much more prominent than any others. But I have not dealt with him in this case.

The leaked call between President Trump and Georgia election officials is something of a greatest hits of the president's frequent election-related grievances - allegations of voter misconduct and fraud without evidence; many levied at counties where Black voters showed up in force. In Georgia, Fulton County has drawn his ire. Much of Atlanta is in Fulton County. In Pennsylvania, it was Philadelphia. In Michigan, Wayne County, home of Detroit. Just a few examples there. Jelani Cobb is a staff writer at The New Yorker and professor of journalism at Columbia University. He's here to talk more about it.
There are still a few little differences. Neither of us think they are in any way going to get in the way of a final agreement. Secretary Mnuchin called the president, we told him we are very, very close to an agreement and he seemed very happy with that, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer told reporters shortly before midnight.
Back then, nobody knew what we know about alcoholism today and the kind of counseling it takes and the kind of sharing and support that is needed to get through this, to break this cycle.

The U.S. has most definitely lost jobs to China. In perhaps the most commonly cited recent paper on the matter, a group of economists led by MIT's David Autor found that between 1990 and 2007, Chinese import competition accounted for the loss of 1 million manufacturing jobs — about 25 percent of the total manufacturing job loss over that period.

INSKEEP: Let's remember, the United States is not just supporting the opposition leader. They've formally recognized him as the president, the interim president, of Venezuela, in addition to cutting the oil money and taking other steps. I'm curious, Philip. As you talk with people on the streets of Caracas, do you have any sense of people hoping for or expecting bigger U.S. intervention?

He said the agency is confident it has enough of a stockpile there already to meet the need that remains. If supplies run out, he said FEMA would reconsider purchasing more. He did not say when the agency would finalize its plan to hand the remaining supplies over to the Puerto Rican government.
And so right now, we have a situation where this president incited riots, incited people to basically attack our United States Capitol. We have at least one police officer who lost his life. We've had four others who lost their lives as well. And this is very serious. If other people were doing this, they would be held accountable. So I'm not naive, Noel. I know that this would take the vice president to initiate the 25th Amendment. It would take bipartisan support to be able to move forward on impeachment. But I will support whatever we can get support for that holds him accountable, including what happens when he leaves office.

And I think it's also important to know too that he started it as - it was called the Negro Motorist Guide.

So safety was a big part of it obviously, but this pursuit of leisure and vacation was also a part of it.

They said, No, you're the president for four years, and Mr. McConnell, you're going to be the leader, because we've given you a majority in the Senate.

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. The movie Green Book won three Oscars last night, including best picture. We're going to talk about the new documentary The Green Book Guide To Freedom, which will be shown on the Smithsonian Channel tonight. The Green Book was a travel guide that was first printed in 1936, in the era of segregation, listing restaurants, hotels, shops and gas stations that would serve African-Americans and that were safe for them. In 1967, following the signing of the Civil Rights Act, the Green Book stopped publication.

But NPR is also something else. It is a constellation of more than 1,000 public radio stations around the country, such as KUOW, that are licensed to local communities or community organizations such as universities. They contract with NPR to provide national and international news coverage, but fundamentally, they make local decisions, responding to the needs of their communities. That's per their mandate from the Federal Communications Commission, which has the power to take away those licenses to use the public airwaves. Not every community has the same wants or needs.

Yeah, I think that's fair. I mean, it's a different kind of situation, but it's the same basic challenge. How do you provide information that fosters the trust and the knowledge of the people that you're working for, the American people? The challenge there in late October was there was nothing we could say beyond that sparse letter that wouldn't magnify the harm that was flowing from our doing the notice in the first place. If I had included in there that we found hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton's emails on Anthony Weiner's laptop, I think I would have increased the harm. And so we wrestled with it. But there was no way to do less harm by speaking more at that point.

Despite these worries, I like Nosek's suggestion because it builds in epistemic humility (there are things I do not know!) along with a sense that we can do better (there are things I do not know yet!). It also builds in a sense of community — we're all in the same boat when it comes to falling short of getting things right. Perhaps the focus on a shared goal — our goal as scientists and humans of being less wrong — can help compensate for any harms in scientific motivation or communication.
MONTANARO: Well, you know, the - this Green New Deal is obviously something that Democrats want to be able to try to push at least some on the left because it does frame a blueprint of something that's big and bold and broad - to be able to try to break through this sort of gridlock of what to do about climate change. They know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.
ESPUELAS: Well, I have my theories. I think that there is a group of people in the Congress that represent a minority of Americans, based on the polling, that adamantly are against any kind of immigration reform, perhaps are somewhat threatened - emotionally threatened by the demographic changes in the country. And they see blocking immigration reform as a way of stopping history at a certain level. I know that sounds like too easy an answer, but at the same time, I actually have attended some of these Tea Party rallies and heard some of these congresspeople speak. And they really do speak in rather harsh terms about immigrants and about what's happened in this country without recognizing that this is a process. This is a system that has broken down, and we have to fix the system, not for the immigrants, but really for the country.
This year, expect more people in the global health and development community to address the injustices and inequities that can be traced to the era when Western countries colonized poor countries, stripping them of resources and autonomy.

My mother can't communicate with my father, so she takes our lives into her hands and decides to flee the town on foot with my brother, who was 10 years old, and myself, who was 4, and leaves behind my adopted sister, who was about 16, to take care of the family property because she believed - and reasonably so - that we would be back because that's the way the war had happened for the last 10 or 15 years - you know.

Justice Kennedy was confirmed by Ronald Reagan, and I'm quite certain that there were a whole lot of Democratic senators who understood at the time that he was unlikely to favor their positions on a number of issues. But ultimately, he was confirmed. And he was confirmed in the last year of President Reagan's office. So we actually have evidence — we have proof, not that Democrats are perfect, but that they do at a certain point recognize that the process and the sanctity of the Supreme Court, and the integrity of the institution, not just the Supreme Court, but the integrity of the Senate, and the office of the president, requires them to do their job.

KHALID: Biden takes the mic out of the podium stand so he can roam around the room as he talks. There's no stage. He's in the middle - people on chairs all around him. It's one of the more intimate setups you see on the campaign trail. Biden warns the crowd that there has never been a more consequential election in recent history.

GUNTON: No, that was very unusual. In fact, that was - when we embarked on that film, we didn't expect that at all to be the story. We thought it would be - typically what happens is eventually, other males will come in and challenge the kind of incumbent males for that that position. And we thought there would be what they call a takeover or an attempted takeover, but just - for - I don't think anybody's really ever seen it, certainly they'd never filmed this before. These - the adult males just up and left. I mean, there's a lot of complex interactions with other prides in the area, which probably explains why they did it.

That doesn't mean they give Trump credit, though. Joyce Delk, who knocked doors for Biden in South Carolina last week, gives him some credit for today's economy.
Mohammed bin Nayef, 57, had served as crown prince since 2015, taking the post shortly after Salman, his uncle, was crowned. He also had been Saudi Arabia's interior minister — another job that will now be filled by Mohammed bin Salman.
Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff, told Raffensperger he was hopeful that in a spirit of cooperation and compromise there would be some way to find a path forward to overturn Georgia's certified election results, which were confirmed by both a full hand audit and a machine recount.
So during those five days, it was - at least the first three days it was very much a matter of rehearse and contribute and attempt things and not be afraid to fail, to make a fool of yourself. Just pick yourself up. And if it didn't happen this time, then the next time you experiment maybe it will. It was a wonderfully supportive, creative environment.
Well, as a diplomat, normally I don't compare the government of China, and the government of the United States, but you can have your own views because you also have had things like disasters, emergencies here, like the Hurricane Katrina some years ago. And you did not shut down the city, but there was total disorder in the city. I visited Louisiana. People told me all kinds of stories. So we're shutting down some of the cities, especially Wuhan to stop the transmission of the virus, to protect more people. We are doing all this of course, at high cost. But we are doing this in the larger interest of the entire world. If we fail to stop the virus, it could spread to other countries. Then this will cause international crisis. So this is, I believe, a real example of one for all, all for one situation. We are doing this for the world, and we appreciate that the world is helping us.
I don't think anybody's going to be thrown out on the streets. We're paying very careful attention to that.
The immigration court system has been under fire, not only from critics who say it's inefficient but also from immigrant-rights advocates.
MCMULLIN: You're exactly right. That is the primary motivation for the Kim regime in pursuit of nuclear weapons - is to preserve its power. And so the goal then, if - the goal has to be to change the way they think about the best way to do that. Right now they think the best way to do that is to develop nuclear weapons. It's understandable that they would think that, by the way. It's a rational conclusion, but we have to change that dynamic. And the only way we can really do that is with a lot more help from China. And so that's got to be the approach. China provides most of North Korea's energy and other support - humanitarian, et cetera. And we've got to change the dynamic there so that the regime actually fears, you know, its demise through lack of that support rather than through its lack of nuclear weapons.

Altogether, the Green New Deal is a loose framework. It does not lay out guidance on how to implement these policies.
Republicans are already working to provide Trump with $12 billion to $15 billion in new spending to fund his call to finish a border wall with Mexico. Congress is expected to use an upcoming defense supplemental spending bill to include new border funds. The supplemental spending bill is considered emergency spending and does not require spending offsets. Ryan and McConnell declined to answer repeated questions about whether the wall would be offset in the federal budget. Trump has insisted Mexico will reimburse the U.S. for the costs, through undetermined new measures affecting trade and tax policy with Mexico.

Hydraulic fracturing allows drillers to dramatically increase production. The chemicals pumped underground with the water help drillers bore through the hard rock. The pressure used is tremendous — about 300 times a typical garden hose. That creates small cracks in the rock that allow gas to escape.
When Diouana is not being publicly shown off like an exotic pet, her mistress privately treats her like a slave. She rebels, but what can she do? She can't even read, let alone answer, the letters from her mother back in Senegal. Her employers do that for her. Of course, there's nothing more familiar than masters treating their servants badly. But what made Black Girl groundbreaking in its day, and still gives it an incandescent power, is that these are black Africans telling their own story and telling it with a searing passion. Although Sembene is clearly making a political point about the West's dehumanizing treatment of poor Africans, he never lets his heroine become an abstraction. We feel her pain, humiliation and anger at having her humanity invalidated.

YONG: It is a moment of, like, light comic relief in the middle of this horrific catastrophe. I think that because this new virus has been called SARS-CoV-2 and the original virus, the SARS from 2003, is technically called SARS-CoV - it's very difficult to talk about the two of them without getting confused and without sort of muddling up which SARS you were talking about. So yeah, virologists have found all kinds of hilariously colloquial work-arounds, calling the first virus original SARS or SARS classic as if it were some kind of soda.
DON YOUNG: Well, President Trump's year has been probably more exciting. One thing though I have to stress that I've always said I don't care who the president is, the job of the Congress is to lead this nation. We've lost that over the years since 1935, when we started transferring power to the president and to the executive branch. Most people are controlled by regulatory law, not legislative law. But overall, for Alaska, with Secretary Zinke, we've undone a lot of what the presidents in the past have done. And I think it gives us more freedom and a chance to take it and improve our nation's and our state's economic bases.

Upstairs, the group crowded into a private room. In one coordinated heave the orderlies shifted the patient from the gurney to a bed. The man moaned. At least the orderlies were quick. The staff bustled around the bed, taking the patient's pulse, drawing blood, rearranging his useless limbs. In the enclosed space, the rotting stench he gave off assaulted Claire. She felt a constriction of revulsion and forced herself to ignore it, because the man's eyes were alive now. Golden brown eyes, shifting slowly, their movement consuming his energy. His eyes followed the voices of the nurses. When Claire's daughter, Emily, was a newborn, her delicate face peering from a wrap of pink blankets, her eyes had followed Claire's voice around the room just so while Claire's husband held her.

Here is the state of play in efforts to reopen the federal government. The Senate votes on two bills today. The Republican measure has funding the president demanded for a wall along the border with Mexico along with some other immigration measures. The Democratic measure just reopens the government. In the House, a leading Democrat, James Clyburn, says his party is ready to give the president all the money he is asking for border security, just not a wall.

Police, before a demonstration, engage in threat assessments. They gather intelligence, they sit around in a room, sometimes in consultation with political leaders. And they make a threat assessment.

Mr. GREENE: Sure. Yeah. That's a great question. And I think it's worth just clarifying what confidence means. I'm often asked, do you still believe in string theory. And I'm glad you didn't frame it that way because my response to that question would have been I don't believe in anything until it's experimentally proven. I have confidence that this is the best approach currently on the table for answering this deep question of putting together Einstein's theory of gravity, general relativity and quantum physics. If there were a better theory on the table, I'm sure all of these string theorists would turn their attention toward it. It is the best thing we have. And over the last few decades, the math has come together in such an incredibly compelling way. The pieces have locked together in a way where as you work on it, you feel that it has to be leading me toward a true, deeper understanding of the world. But that is not how you judge a theory. You judge it whether it makes predictions that are going to be confirmed by experiment, and we are working hard in that direction. So, yes.

Biden will inherit significant economic leverage over Iran. However misguided and erratic Trump's approach was toward Iran, the president renewed and strengthened the U.S.'s most comprehensive sanctions regime. Trump failed to convert this leverage into diplomatic progress because he did not have a clear strategy or a realistic path to achieving it. While Trump repeatedly urged Iran to negotiate and Make the Big Deal, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's demands for Iran amounted to a call for regime change. Trump also hired John Bolton, an outspoken supporter of regime change, to serve as national security adviser. Tehran had little incentive to talk, let alone offer concessions, to an administration that ultimately sought its surrender or demise.

HADID: So when I was in Kasur today, I went to the police station which still reeks of smoke from when residents tried to burn it down. And there was still smashed cars in the yard. And police said that the furor around this case really changed things, and it forced the state government to throw more resources and money at this case, which is why they were able to solve it. And so that's one important change that we might see looking forward - is that the government will be reluctant to let these cases drag on like they did in the past.

And one playing out over the night were the hurricanes. And the longer-term things are rising sea water temperature and declining pH of the ocean. And so since there are now fewer corals on adjacent islands, it will slow the rate of which the reefs recover. And I think that is very worrying. But that's quite different from saying that they won't recover. And I think in addition, the kinds of coral that live there are changing dramatically, as well.

Fighting these issues through agency regulations — once the domain of wonky lawyers — is something of a newer frontier in political activism. Harvard Law School Professor Jacob Gersen, an expert in the administrative law process, and a proponent of many of the changes DeVos has proposed, says most regulations still get just a smattering of comments — certainly not a hashtag campaign on social media. But it's increasingly a part of political strategy.

But I guess looking back on it now with hindsight, if you spend this amount of time - is - the amount of time that we did with these creatures - these type of creatures - it was almost inevitable that part of that story would result in them bumping into humanity in a confrontational way and - as it so proved to be. And actually, I think it was - I think it's been a good element to the series to show people that as well as all the pressures these animals face between their rivals within their own families and competitors with other species, they also have this extra challenge, which is that they have - they're bumping into humanity and in conflict with humanity for space, for habitat.

But here, the play differs from the film. Actor Bryan Cranston — as Beale — rushes into the TV studio, then spends seemingly endless silent minutes grasping for words. Cranston says it's like the experience of waking up from a vivid dream, and we think 'oh, this is indelible!' And you start to try to recall it, and it dissipates, like fog. And so he collapses from that. And out of that despair and public humiliation comes the speech. Cranston actually wells up with tears when he finally speaks.

Biden's Plan To Release More Vaccine Is A Gamble. Is It Worth The Risk?
SHARP: Absolutely. And so we've got several families there that the Obama administration came in and forced the District 211 to allow a biological boy into the female's restrooms. And so these girls are telling stories about how when they're in their locker room changing for PE, they're now uncomfortable knowing that a boy can walk in at any time under the school's new policy. They talk about how one girl in particular does not change out of her gym clothes but rather wears them all day long, wears them after going to gym, after getting them dirty and nasty through PE class and then just puts her clothes on top of it because she's so nervous about the possibility of having to change and shower and whatnot in front of this boy. And we hear stories like that across the country of these girls speaking out and saying, look, we don't want this student to be bullied or harassed or anything, but we also want our privacy protected. And we just want to know that when we go into these lockers and shower rooms that we're not going to be forced to share with someone of the opposite biological sex. That's all these girls are asking for.

I want to just ask them in a similar vein about testing. I mean, your boss, the secretary of Health and Human Services, declared coronavirus a public health emergency in January.

How did this happen?

While many officials are watching new coronavirus cases, epidemiologists warn that case counts may not be the most reliable indicator of how the outbreak is spreading.

NPR's Michele Kelemen is traveling with the secretary.
And so although I've always believed that he would make an outstanding Supreme Court justice, it is my belief that now more than ever his voice would serve the court well, would help to burnish the sense that the Supreme Court is above politics and not just an extension of politics, and would set a good tone for restoring — or at least increasing — the American people's confidence in our justice system.

No, thanks, Claire said cheerfully. I'll wait here.
GATES: Yeah. You know, I try to - doing Finding Your Roots is a way to paying homage to my mother and father every year. It's - remember, it's - my father dragged my brother and me upstairs in his parents' home and made us wait why he'd look through half a dozen of his father's scrapbooks, about which we knew nothing - complete mystery, a secret to us - looking for that obituary. And it's for my father. It's a gift - and for my mom. And it turned out - my father used to say, you know, your mother's family is really distinguished, too? And I couldn't imagine what, but two sets of those fourth great-grandparents are from my mother's line.
My father to this day is the funniest person I know. And he was the funniest person anybody who knew him knew. And when he started laughing at me, when I could make him laugh, I had the sense of, Oh I might be good at this.
Under the Paris accord, the U.S. sent some $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund that is guided by the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change — the body that coordinates international climate policy. The U.S. was supposed to provide an additional $2 billion, but Trump has balked at that idea, and his proposed budget includes cuts to international climate programs.

Although the nurses didn't vote to unionize until September, Waters said, they began acting collectively from the early days of the pandemic. They drafted a petition and sent a letter to administrators together. When the hospital agreed to provide advanced training on how to use PPE to protect against COVID transmission, it was a small but significant victory, Waters said.

INSKEEP: We met Ocasio-Cortez inside that office. Sunlight fell through the oversized window onto her fuchsia suit. Her office is still a fraction of the size of the committee chairmen who hold real power in Congress, though she has something they do not. The 29-year-old is a media star. She has been since she upset a leading Democrat in a New York City primary last year. Her surprise victory cast her as a party insurgent. Her label as a Democratic Socialist also alarmed conservatives, who now see her face constantly on Fox News.
Every immigration attorney who is honest will tell you that sometimes getting cases delayed is the best thing for the case, said Philadelphia immigration attorney Matthew Archambeault. In either instance, unexpected delays can be confusing for clients because they have nothing to do with the facts of their cases and because the shutdown could end at any time.

KHALID: But his supporters are still excited to see him. Before heading to Iowa for the final sprint, he was here in Salem, N.H. Dozens of people are lined up in the cold - voters from New Hampshire and quite a few from just across the state line in Massachusetts, some with their Dunkin' Donuts coffee in hand as they waited to enter a local elementary school gym. One of them was Maryann Bradley from neighboring Massachusetts.
Alaska's state-owned economic development corporation was the only bidder on nine of the parcels offered for lease in the northernmost swath of the refuge, known as the coastal plain. Two small companies also each picked up a single parcel.
Of course, the parts of this ceremony that felt modernizing were only symbolic for everyone except the couple themselves. It doesn't actually modernize the monarchy, let alone a country, to invite one minister rather than another; it doesn't change anything for poor people to have a gospel choir singing.
And, you know, his basic understanding of this is that Hollywood is interested in the authenticity of details when it comes to others. So they have to get the right costume down, for example. But they're not interested in the authenticity of the people that they're dealing with. So all of these Vietnamese people who've been brought in to have roles in this American epic about the Vietnam War literally have nothing to say.
Former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder cited that federal criminal statute in a tweet Sunday.

In Salinas, a mix of what looked to be Trump and Sanders supporters gathered outside a Clinton event. They chanted and waved signs about her speech transcripts, email server and relatively hawkish foreign policy views.
The Red Sox were the very last team in the majors to integrate, only finally hiring a black player, Elijah Jerry Pumpsie Green, in 1959 — 12 years after Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers. The Sox front office was notorious for racism, even spewing the n-word, as many fans were reputed to do as well. The ugly history made it all the more painful last summer at Fenway, when Orioles center fielder Adam Jones said a Sox fan hurled the n-word at him, along with a bag of peanuts.
And that's not just a big deal; that's a gargantuan deal. The prospect of investors in U.S. debt accepting less on the dollar than they are owed could tank the economy (more on that later).
But he has since soured on the American base that was first proposed nine years ago and where ground was finally broken Friday at the Redzikowo Air Base, 2 miles from his city hall.
You mentioned the impeachment process, but impeachment is a political process, right? And you write in your book that for people to trust in the legal system, everyone needs to be held accountable under the law. So how does the country move on when you don't hold the president of the United States accountable under the law and you rely on a political process, assuming that states don't end up prosecuting?

That first week of Mister Rogers was about change — even in the Neighborhood of Make Believe, where a puppet ruler named King Friday XIII was upset that his subjects were moving their homes around his kingdom. In this week-long story, King Friday becomes so upset that he orders a big wall to be built around the castle to keep everyone out. But eventually, the ruler decides he had nothing to fear and takes down the wall.

What's more, Trump's stance on the uprising is more in line with an interventionist approach, which is contradictory to his more isolationist America First policy. So there is a question about the Trump Doctrine: When does the United States intervene and when does it not? What is the trigger to say, OK, this is where the United States gets involved?

Time now for the Opinion Page. The scandal over sexual abuse by priests and cover-ups by bishops erupted in this country 10 years ago. Now, there are similar charges from several countries in Europe that seem to place some responsibility and blame at the door of Pope Benedict XVI, as a bishop in his native Germany, later as a high-ranking Vatican official. But in an op-ed in the New York Times, John Allen, senior correspondent of the National Catholic Reporter, says before we rush to condemn the pope as part of the problem, we must first understand that he's also been part of the solution.
No, I didn't say you had.
They've decided to maybe even ban some of the people they've ejected for life as a way of finally saying, listen, this is not what we want to be. And that's not going to change until the Red Sox decide that, hey, we don't want this in our ballpark. And they're the ones - and I think the fans - if the fans don't want this, and if the Red Sox don't want this, then maybe it's time for them to join up and make it clear that this is not how they want to be represented.

Enter Einstein. In 1905, he proposes his special theory of relativity, whereby he singlehandedly destroyed the notions of absolute space and time, and the need for an ether. According to the theory, now one of the greatest success stories in the history of thought, the notions of space as a rigid stage at which things just happen and of time as a steadily flowing river, are just an illusion caused by our myopic view of reality. And it's all light's fault.

The Capitol was begun in 1793 when George Washington laid the cornerstone, and it has been the site where Congress has counted the Electoral College vote every time since the election of 1800.

By definition, lists are hierarchical. The politics of the communities who create them can be found embedded within them. The issues raised by this poll have relevance well beyond jazz for all sorts of critics' year-end lists. Like NPR Music's Turning the Tables, a feminist intervention in the popular music canon, our inquiry also offers an opportunity to challenge list-making as a means of arriving at critical consensus that results in new musical histories and potentially perpetuates the conditions that enable the erasure of women musicians.
Gradually dark shapes came into view, small, clustered circles like grapes, harmless-looking shapes that could make a thirty-seven-yearold man, and a three-year-old girl, die.
When I went back to Vietnam in 2004, for the second time, I finally was able to meet her. And she'd been a presence in my life because I remember, you know, we had a photograph of her when she was probably 16 - black-and-white photograph. And she was beautiful. And when I was growing up, I was always haunted by that face, her face, and thinking, why is she there and not here? I have no memory of her, but her memory obviously persists in the family.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. We don't know a lot about this, but I do want to bring up this other thing. The intelligence community apparently briefed Bernie Sanders that Russia is interfering to try and help his campaign. There are many questions here that are still unanswered. Why was this leaked now? What is this intelligence? How robust is it? But let's look at how Sanders reacted.
Health care employers, in particular, are known to launch aggressive and well-funded anti-union campaigns, said Rebecca Givan, a labor studies expert at Rutgers university. Still, workers might be more motivated by what they witnessed during the pandemic, she said.

Mask up. Universal masking should be the norm indoors (except when you're at home with your household members, of course). If you're less than 6 feet apart outside, keep your mask on, experts say. If you're not sure? Err on the side of wearing it. And consider going a step further than you have before. Add another layer to the mask. Insert a filter. Get one that fits better. If people are breathing out more virus, why not ensure that your mask stops more of it from getting to your nose?
Hart was born in England and Holmström in Finland, but both have made their careers in the U.S.; Hart is a professor at Harvard and Holmström is a professor at MIT.

As in If I get a call, tell them they can call me back. Or Did someone leave their books here?
Election Officials Warned 'Someone's Going To Get Shot,' But That Didn't Stop Trump
And ironically, what happened was that one day, someone knocked on our door when I was 16. And he was not Vietnamese. He was a white guy. And because he was a white guy, one of my parents - I think it was my father - let him in. And that man had a gun. And that man put that - pointed that gun in all of our faces. You know, it was only because my mother ran out into the street screaming that our lives were saved.
The first change is to call on states to expand immediately the pool of people eligible to receive vaccines to those 65 and older, and those with underlying health conditions that make them more susceptible to COVID-19.
Mr. ALLEN: Now, look. I mean, that's not to defend their slowness and ambivalence on this issue. I think - and quite honestly, you know, by contemporary 21st century standards, the response from Rome on this and many other things has been abysmally slow. But it is nevertheless to say that from the pope's own point of view, the kind of progress he's made on this issue in the last eight years is, by historical standards, quite remarkable.

I'm not surprised by the response to any comedy taken out of context. Comedy is all about context. If you think about the things that you say to your friends or to people you know, if a stranger hears them they would think you're the most horrible human being in the world. When you know someone, that's when it becomes comedy. That's exactly what comedy is: It's a familiarity that is combined with you breaking down a commonly held belief.

And in that time, he has put the right to religious freedom front and center as he fights against discrimination in health care.

And the most difficult part out of the day was just simply the logistics of him drinking the medication. It's a pretty nasty-tasting concoction. And at this point, he was having trouble swallowing. So he had some difficulty getting it down. And that was a little scary for him because, obviously, you're dealing with a medication that's lethal. And you want to make sure that the dosing is right. And he had choked on some and kind of coughed some up. And so, you know, at that point it's a little scary about - has he taken enough? You know, is it going to work out OK? And it was fine. But that was really the only hiccup in the entire process.

Trump wants lawmakers to boost military spending in the coming fiscal year by 10 percent, or $54 billion. Rather than raise taxes or increase the deficit, the president is calling for equivalent cuts in other areas. Foreign aid would be especially hard hit, with the State Department's budget cut by about 28 percent.

The White House says it remains focused on the denuclearization of North Korea. But the president also tweeted criticism of China, a key player in achieving that goal. And, ironically, it is China that is stepping forward as more of a world leader as the United States has receded, as some see it, under Trump.
Her response was simply 'that's what they want you to think,'  he said. I was just blown away that you know, the largest health organization in the entire world would be written off with a kind of conspiracy theory-like statement like that.
There were no immediate details from the CDC about the suspected case.
Suppose a manager who runs a welfare-service facility can make two types of investment: some improve quality, while others reduce cost at the expense of quality. Additionally, suppose that such investments are difficult to specify in a contract. If the government owns the facility and employs a manager to run it, the manager will have little incentive to provide either type of investment, since the government cannot credibly promise to reward these efforts. If a private contractor provides the service, incentives for investing in both quality and cost reduction are stronger.
That sabotage includes Trump's decision to stop reimbursing insurance companies for discounts they're required by law to give to their lowest-income clients, Pallone said.
To that end, NPR Music commissioned Lara Pellegrinelli and a team of independent reporters to analyze the NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll and see what concrete data could reveal about the role of gender in this particular critics' year-end list and the status of women jazz artists generally speaking. Although the findings are currently limited to a gender binary, dividing artists into unequivocal categories for women and men, we acknowledge the presence of a broader spectrum of identities than our project was able to capture, including cisgender women and men, transgender women and men and those with non-binary, gender non-conforming and gender queer identities.

As you scroll up and down the graphic, it looks like the temperature of Earth's surface has stayed remarkably stable for 10,000 years. It sort of hovers around the same temperature for some 10,000 years ... until — bam! The industrial revolution begins. We start producing large amounts of carbon dioxide. And things heat up way more quickly.
Democrats, though, feel as if they have leverage in this election year on the issue, especially because there is generally bipartisan support for a DREAM Act or a path to legalization, if not citizenship, for people in the U.S. illegally who haven't committed crimes. (The DREAM Act would provide a path to citizenship for people brought to the United States as children.)
BRITTNEY WATSON: They don't see the people who are being rushed to the hospital who are like fishes out of water, who can't breathe.

Given the scope and ambitious nature of the Green New Deal, it might be tempting to criticize or dismiss activists supporting it. But Amy Myers Jaffe hopes older, more experienced policymakers won't do that.
Complicating matters, many health regulations emanate not just from the Department of Health and Human Services, but jointly from HHS and other departments, including Labor and Treasury, which likely means more time to negotiate decisions among multiple departments.
By that time, he had acquired information about Ukrainian corruption way beyond what I knew. So I would say that was a — I don't know. You'd have to ask to president the operation of his mind. All I can tell you is that by that time, he was much more educated on Ukrainian corruption.

After the election of 1876, disputes arose in several Southern states with two sets of electors claiming legitimacy. Republicans of that day said the president of the Senate (the vice president) could decide which slate was proper, but Democrats protested.
The concern instead with the COVID-19 vaccine is about whether you might still have an asymptomatic infection despite immunization — without symptoms, but able to shed virus.

A bipartisan measure, proposed by Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., and Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, was attached to a budget rider that stripped endangered species protections from grey wolves in their home states.
What this is really is a huge victory for someone like — I don't know, a Donald Trump or another developer who wants to build 1,000 homes in the middle of fields and including some wetlands. They now will have more of a free hand to destroy that natural habitat, Pelton says.
FLATOW: Isn't that what we define science as? As being able to - you know, to go back and do the same investigation and come up with the same answer or something different?

SAGAL: Bill, how did Sarah do on our quiz?
This has been a problem from the beginning of the Affordable Care Act because the government didn't understand that people would not know when they needed to sign up for Medicare, says Bonnie Burns, a consultant for the consumer group California Health Advocates. Once they had insurance, that relieved all the stress of not having coverage and then when they became eligible for Medicare, nobody told them to make that change.
This is FRESH AIR. We're going to listen back to an interview with actor Martin Landau. He died Saturday at the age of 89. For 20 years, Landau took many movie and TV roles that he didn't much like.

SANDERS: Thank you all very much.
KODJAK: I mean, it would clearly have to be through some sort of tax increase. Harris didn't specify what she wanted to do in her town hall, and Sanders, in the proposal that he put on the table, did outline some options. Right now we spend about $3 1/2 trillion a year on health care, and Sanders says his - making Medicare-for-all will cost less. But the proposals to pay for it would be maybe a tax increase on employers to replace what they're now paying for health insurance premiums like a Social Security tax or maybe a tax increase on personal income tax. And then there are always proposals to increase tax rates on the wealthy high-earners and reduce their deductions.

In a way, I sometimes feel grateful that I did have this alcoholism, except that there were so many sad events that were caused by it that I can't wholeheartedly say that.

Assuming your parents haven't worked for at least 10 years in the United States, they're probably not eligible for premium-free hospitalization coverage under Medicare, the federal health insurance program for people age 65 and older, Gonzales says. If they've lived in the States for at least five years and their income and other resources meet state eligibility guidelines, however, they could qualify for Medicaid, the federal-state program for low-income people.
But Medicaid has been eating up an ever-larger share of federal spending. The Senate Republicans' plan puts a lid on that by rolling back the Obama-era expansion of the program and then granting states a set amount of money for each person enrolled. Republicans also want to change the way the federal government calculates payments to the states starting in 2025, reducing the federal government's contribution to the states.
It is an interesting hypothesis, Voleski says.
None of that was ever likely to happen. But the vision of it was dark, indeed. The fact is that the speaker can withhold House consent to the joint congressional resolution by which the president is empowered to speak. So barging in would be a breach of more than protocol.

Mr. WEINBERG: The different thing in the early universe is, when you go back to the very early universe when the temperature was something like 10 to the 13 degrees Kelvin, that when photons collided, electron-positron pairs could be produced, charged particles could be produced.

The goal is to breed varieties that aren't super tall, can be planted close to each other and have a high yield. One type Arpaia and her colleague, Eric Focht, are recommending to growers has all these traits. It's called GEM, the great granddaughter of the Hass avocado, and is already sold at nurseries. Arpaia didn't breed it, but she and Focht recommended that the University of California system patent and release the variety.

That could compel the CDC to recommend that when people go outside their homes, they should cover their faces in case they're carrying the virus and don't know it, Redfield acknowledged.
PETRAEUS: ...Iran now respond? Well, I think Iran is not in the strongest of positions, given the sanctions, a dismal economy and widespread Iranian popular unrest. So I tend to think it is more likely that we will see a variety of proxy attacks. And again, Iran has a lot of proxies throughout the region, thanks to the efforts of Qassem Soleimani. But really, this comes down to whether or not this has restored some degree of deterrence, which clearly was lacking, given what Iran and their proxies were doing throughout the region, and steadily ratcheting the efforts upward.

But I think what was fascinating was that the audiences were enormous in the U.K. It was the highest-rated species factual program in the U.K. last year.

She has been signaling for a while that there's a new chapter for her, that this is - that tennis is not forever for her. And she's made it very clear in a lot of sort of vague ways. But if you're paying attention to her, you can sort of understand where she's coming from.

The 2020 race is shaping up to be unlike any other in recent American history. Consider the fact that the current front-runner on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders, hasn't actually been a member of the Democratic Party for most of his career. The head of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, isn't a traditional Republican either. He has reshaped the GOP in his image, inverting longstanding conservative canons on issues like debt, international relations and democratic norms. Is the two-party system as we know it breaking down? And if so, why?

Despite deep red southern and rural areas, Virginia will likely be a challenge for Trump in November; Obama won twice in Virginia, and Clinton took the state by more than five points in 2016. Over the past three years, the state has continued to shift blue, with Democrats claiming the governor's office and flipping both chambers of the General Assembly. The change is most pronounced in the Northern Virginia suburbs, where onetime Republican strongholds have turned into Democratic bastions.
The picture to the right explains the story. Imagine that there is a source of photons (or other small quantum particle). The photons can pass through a double slit. Behind the double slit, there is a screen. If the photons hit the screen, those conducting the experiment observe an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes, typical of waves. If the screen is not there, and there are photon counters aligned with the slits, the photons will hit either one or the other, behaving like little bullets (or particles). So far, this is the typical setup for a double-slit experiment.
SIEGEL: But when you contrast, on the one hand, the Republican rage at Washington and, on the other hand, Bernie Sanders calling for Washington to take over all healthcare and, presumably, to start regulating public colleges and universities to compensate them for lost tuition costs. That's a lot of political energy for a couple of completely irreconcilable views of the federal government. Is it - is it just the polarizing effect of the nominating process, David, or are we that divided as a people?

Trump recently mused in an interview on Sirius XM that had Andrew Jackson been a little later, you wouldn't have had the Civil War. The president was returning to one the most studied eras of American history: the Antebellum Period, the decades leading up to the Civil War. The causes of the conflict can be traced back to the beginnings of the country. It is poignant and instructive to read the accounts of people who lived in the 80 years before the calamity. Many knew that something was going grievously wrong, that the political system was beginning to seize up, caught in its own contradictions. Some desperately warned against disaster. Yet no one truly foresaw what history had in store for them.
WOOD JR: And he was highly respected. My dad was a civil rights journalist back in the '60s and '70s.

And so when it comes to black political talk and when it comes to black political commentary and playing the blues and - my dad did morning news on the radio. My father was the voice of the city of Birmingham for a very long time. His name rang out. And out of respect to my father, guys would leave guns around the corner. They would leave their liquor up the street. And when they came to our house, it was Switzerland. So you might see a Vice Lord and a Gangster Disciple. It's plausible right there in our driveway.
While it's disappointing to see the Trump administration revoke the guidance, the administration cannot change what Title IX means.

One other big decision for the incoming administration is whether it wants to use the opportunity to tweak or add to Trump policies rather than eliminate them. Is it undoing and full stop? asked Keith. Or undoing and adding on?
OTIS: Well, yes. Tomorrow, Guaido is scheduled to meet with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and other Latin American leaders to try to figure out, you know, what's the best way to go forward. Like Trump, Juan Guaido says, you know, we're now - we're not ruling out any options which kind of suggests that he would like some kind of an intervention. But while much of the international community has turned against Maduro and, you know, tries - is trying to help move in humanitarian aid, there's very little enthusiasm for military intervention in Venezuela.
GOLDMAN: ...You know, remember, hired as the team's general manager, the Miami Marlins' first woman, first Asian American to have that job. And then Sarah Fuller of Vanderbilt - first woman to play in a top-tier college football conference. So it was a banner year for women in milestones. We'll see if 2021 can continue that trend.
GROSS: And I read you talking about this. You said that after - you had been getting death threats and these angry emails and everything. After that, everything stopped.

And so, you're right, Nina, that generally speaking, people aren't closely following Supreme Court cases unless you have a big seminal case like same-sex marriage come down. But people are following the fact that, increasingly, our political institutions are broken — and it troubles them. And this becomes I think a symbol of a process that, if Republicans stick to their current posture, promises a tit-for-tat process in which we will never have a clean nomination process on the merits, and presidents — whether they're Democrats or Republicans — are only going to be able to get their nominees through when they have their own party controlling the Senate.
The National Bureau of Statistics of China released the new data on Friday, the same day it announced that the country's GDP growth has fallen to its lowest level in nearly 30 years.
Chris Jennings, a health aide to former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, said he refers to those Trump health policies as bird droppings. As in you have to clean up the bird droppings before you have a clean slate. Republicans, when they take over from a Democratic administration, think of their predecessors' policies the same way.
She was ... pulled over while she was driving and apparently taken and put on a plane to Riyadh in very murky circumstances, he says. She was briefly detained in Riyadh before being released. Then, Coogle says, in May, just before Saudi Arabia lifted a ban on female drivers last June 24, Hathloul was picked up again in the larger crackdown against the women's rights movement.

For her part, Clinton was sounding equally sanguine just blocks away, telling a throng of her supporters that the race was in the homestretch and victory is in sight. She did not say it, but Sanders now needs to win 60 percent of the delegates in every contest remaining — just to overtake Clinton in pledged delegates. He has no discernible path to turning around her advantage in superdelegates.

The White House blueprint does not address major safety net programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which the president has promised to protect. But Trump is calling for sharp cuts in discretionary spending, including the Environmental Protection Agency.

It is truly unfortunate that a teacher charged with proper supervision and care of students failed to fulfill that responsibility in her classroom. Evidence indicates that Leigh Anne Arthur was not in her assigned position at the time of the incident. Evidence also indicates that she allowed students to use her personal cell phone on a regular and routine basis. Evidence also indicates that the phone was routinely left on her desk for student use and was never locked. Ms. Arthur has used the media to transmit false information obviously intended for the purpose of deflecting the incident totally to students. The evidence available, points to the extent of her false statements.

If the Trump administration finalizes the rule before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, Court says that would make it harder, but not impossible, for the new administration to undo it. And he says if it comes to it, banks would likely sue to try to stop the rule.
But Alex Vitale, author of The End of Policing, says it's a mistake to boil Wednesday's events down to questions of police force and tactics. Rather, Vitale, who is a professor of sociology and coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, says that, in addition to examining the role of the police in these incidents, we need to open up a broader conversation about race, politics and justice. (We'll be talking more about this, and other aspects of Wednesday's events, on the next episode of the Code Switch podcast.)

Stop. She'd made a request for information. What was he dealing with? He couldn't easily explain the issues to an outsider. Here at the Institute, the medication had been tested only on mice, never on a human. Worldwide, the medication had been tested on only a half-dozen humans. For a variety of reasons, none had survived. Nothing about the medication was established except its unpredictability. Educated guesswork alone would provide Stanton with the proper dosage for the injections. Edward Reese might have an allergic reaction and die the moment Stanton gave him the first shot. An undiscovered impurity in this batch of the drug could kill him. Yet the patient was on the verge of death anyway. Most likely he would be dead within hours. There was also a chance that the medication would work. In that case, James Stanton and his team would save Edward Reese's life.

You're against the establishment. Both parties share that. And I would say, finally, I do think there's a lot more flexibility about government. People are feeling hurt, and they're willing to let government - even some Republicans, if it'll give them a hand up.
Of the $10.3 billion that donor countries pledged to the GCF during that initial fundraising round back in 2013, the U.S. promised $3 billion.

U.S. Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler is the only Hispanic woman among Republican members of the House, and she has been forced at times throughout the Trump administration to maintain a difficult balance of supporting a president who is very popular in rural parts of her district while also being independent enough to not lose the urban core that makes up the bulk of voters.

I think that what we're going to be hearing, and you heard the president-elect mentioned this, is to really put a lot of effort into making sure the rollout of the vaccine program accelerates. We want to get it to 1 million vaccinations per day, as the president-elect has mentioned. The idea about having everyone for at least 100 days — at least — wear a mask. Everyone uniformly, so we don't have disparities where some people are adhering to public health measures and others are not.

So what they've done is they've put all this impeachment - all the charges against Trump on him to carry into the election. And I think he's going to have to bear that burden, as are a lot of senators who voted that he should get a pass at this time.

And for many people, that's uncomfortable. For a scientist, that's the best. To be perplexed is the best state of mind to be in.
It was really bad, and the other thing that was really bad, and this is something that was my own shame and something that I did not find attractive in myself: The people that came after me were some of the great performers I think of this generation. Fred Armisen came, Will Forte, and then Bill Hader and Jason Sudeikis, and Andy Samberg. And these were people that I was in competition with, and they were my friends. And I felt great jealousy towards them and their successes — which was an awful thing to feel. And so I was kind of saved by the fact that Lorne offered me this position on the writing staff, and then I felt at home. It was the first time that I felt like I was adding value as opposed to keeping space warm.

JOBRANI: I just saw your downward dog.
There are two possibilities: Roughly, stars with masses between eight and 20 times that of the sun become what's called a neutron star, a star made of neutrons, the particles that share the atomic nucleus with protons. Why? Well, in the frenzy of collapse, as gravity becomes tighter and tighter, protons and electrons get so squeezed together that they essentially fuse into neutrons. (The fancy name of this process is inverse beta decay.) These neutrons can get squeezed a lot and still resist gravity's pressure: A typical neutron star can have the mass of the sun and the size of a mountain!
SIMON: What did the Biden people announce?
We thought not about just having a statue or a place to visit that would stay the same but one that would change over time, he says.

There is widespread anger in the state over PG&E's shoddy safety record. Protests broke out at recent public oversight meetings and at the company's San Francisco headquarters, where environmentalists and activists read the names of the more than 100 people combined who died in the Camp Fire and 2017's wildfires in Napa and Sonoma counties. At one customer service center, the company has installed bulletproof glass.

And I have a letter from Bill Clinton saying I was one of the most instrumental in getting it passed. The other two people would have been Chuck Schumer and him. But then when I saw the Council on Foreign Relations interview, and I saw what he said, I said, Oh my God. He committed bribery and he's admitting it. And he's even worse because he doesn't mention that his son is involved. And he has to have known his son was involved. So now he's added, he offered a thing of value, $1 billion loan guarantee, to affect the official action of the president of the Ukraine firing the prosecutor. There's only one other thing you need now. You need to prove corruption. The corrupt intent is to get his son off the hook if his son is under investigation.

Even Astronauts Get The Blues: Or Why Boredom Drives Us Nuts
I believe the intellectual life of the whole of modern Western society is increasingly being split into two polar groups...at one pole we have the literary intellectuals, who incidentally while no one was looking took to referring to themselves as 'intellectuals' as though there were no others...at the other scientists, and as the most representative, the physical scientists. Between the two a gulf of mutual incomprehension — sometimes (particularly among the young) hostility and dislike, but most of all lack of understanding.

Alongside this profusion of options is a rich diet of advice: parenting books, articles, Facebook groups, and friends who swear by one approach or another. For the most part, though, these conversations miss an important question: not just what to learn and how to learn it, but when to do so. In other words, what should young children be learning while young? What's the argument for learning a particular skill sooner rather than later?
Williams followed the proceedings from the courthouse. From his story about today's hearing:
HOOPER: Well, you know, it's the first time I've been asked that question. And - but, you know, I didn't get the kind of response then that as a young film director would get now making a genre piece. They would instantly be embraced because of the numbers, you know, because of the scoreboard. I mean, a hit is something that makes money. And I've seen lots of young film directors embraced for making terrible movies that made, you know, made a lot of money. But, I mean, it was very strange because it as - soon as it was released, it did get mixed critical acclaim, but the positive acclaim was very positive and on a big scale.

The new performance standards, which were first reported by the Wall Street Journal, are part of a wider push to speed up immigration courts and deportations. For instance, Sessions is widely expected to eliminate or cut back on the practice known as administrative closure, which allows judges to put cases on hold while immigrants seek visas or other kinds of relief from deportation. Sessions also is taking steps to limit who gets asylum in the U.S. Immigration lawyers are warning that those changes could mean immigration judges will be forced to turn away more people fleeing violence or persecution in their home countries.
To Sen. Ron Wyden, co-author of the law, the Department of Justice missed the mark for not going after Backpage earlier, since Section 230 does not preclude federal criminal investigations.
White House aides say they are now looking at a number of additional changes, including tighter work requirements and drug-testing rules for food stamps, Medicaid and housing assistance. Those changes may not save much money the way changes in the big middle-class entitlements like Medicare or Social Security might. But it will help the president highlight an issue that seems to motivate his base in a year when getting Republican voters excited is the No. 1 goal.
In exchange for taking on this financing approach, the state will receive a range of operating flexibilities from the federal government, as well as up to 55% of the savings generated on an annual basis when spending falls below the aggregate spending cap and the state meets certain quality targets, yet to be determined.
You might think you're home free in that case, but not yet. Remember that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are not 100% effective, and many in the research community still advise caution. Once most people are protected and there's less virus circulating in the air — and less circulating in the community — the advice and restrictions on this may ease up a bit. One vision of the new normal, whether that's later in 2021 or even 2022, is an eventual relaxation of the recommendations, with occasional renewals when the virus flares up in a community.
Of course, no one is suggesting that slow teaching become the single method used by professors in college classrooms. It shouldn't. But added into the mix, how could it be anything but a boon to pleasure in learning — and pleasure in remembering more of what is read?

Both of the other arguments have merits, and the good news is that technology makes it easier to satisfy both camps. It's important to see the government at work. But increasingly, the briefings are being held around 5:30 p.m. ET, which is the heart of the first airing of All Things Considered. By cutting away to carry the live feed from the White House, NPR has had to jettison other valuable reports on how the country is responding to this crisis, as well as other important news. (And as an aside, I think NPR has been doing an excellent job covering this wide-ranging story, from the science to the financial ramifications to the very personal impacts on people's lives.)

And about 50 or so of these penguins were blown into a gully maybe 50 feet deep. And the sides of the gully are too steep and icy for them to climb out. So they're going to die there. And some of the chicks are starting to die. The film crew observes this. And then a storm comes up. And they have to leave because conditions are just too fierce. And then we pick up the story here - again, David Attenborough narrating.

Since as far back as 1796, when John Adams was vice president, the job of declaring the winner of the presidential election has been at least potentially problematic. Because when Adams was opening the envelopes that year, the winner was himself. There had been some controversy over the paperwork from Vermont, but Adams' main rival, Thomas Jefferson, said he did not wish to make a fuss over the form of the vote when the substance was clear.

RUSSAKOFF: Well, you know, interestingly, there's always been an education industrial complex. The education industry is over $600 billion a year in terms of the amount of money that is spent by all the school districts in the country on private contracts and consultants and textbooks and testing. And, you know, it's just - it's a huge, huge business. But what - what I've found interesting about the education reform movement is that they also have their own education industrial complex. So when somebody who's very friendly to the education reform movement becomes a leader of a school district or when a governor, like Gov. Christie, who's friendly to the education reform movement, is running school districts in the state of New Jersey, all of these consultants just suddenly appear. And they're available to do work on, you know, how to help them develop the best, you know, and most reform-oriented teacher evaluation system, the most reform-oriented teacher and principal contracts, the best data system because the data has to be incredibly cleaned in order to use the data to judge everyone in the system and hold them accountable. And so there's all of these consulting firms and businesses, a lot of them founded or staffed by people who started off, say, in Teach For America, who worked for some of the more famous reform-oriented superintendents and chancellors like Joel Klein, Michelle Rhee.

Claire saw Emily, skipping joyfully outside their apartment building on West 111th Street. She tripped on an imperfection in the sidewalk, a small edge where one slab rose above the next by a quarter inch, no more. That quarter inch killed her. Emily broke her fall with her hands. She wasn't the type of child to scream and cry, but she moaned as she pushed herself up. Both knees were scraped. Brush burns covered her palms. But her face never touched the pavement. Her face remained perfect and lovely to the end . . . the full cheeks, the wide brow, her skin so smooth and soft. The day was warm for June. Emily was wearing her favorite dress, the one with smocking on the bodice. The dress was yellow with a print of green and blue merry-goround horses. Emily didn't want to get blood on her dress. Mommy, hold my dress, she said as they went upstairs to wash and bandage the scrapes. Claire bunched the skirt and held it above Emily's knees. Four days later Emily was dead.

Since taking office, Trump has aggressively sought to roll back environmental regulations, particularly those seen as an obstacle to business.

Reprising familiar themes from his campaign and his tweets, Trump declared that CNN and MSNBC were both fake news. He also once again referred to the New York Times as failing. Turning one of the traditions of the 100th-day milestone on its head, Trump suggested to the crowd that they rate the media's 100 days, adding, because, you know, they are a disgrace. After rattling through a litany of what he saw as the Times' bad business decisions over the years, the real estate mogul and former reality TV star declared that the national newspaper of record was incompetent and dishonest people.

MOORE: The original premise was not too different from the one that we ended up pursuing. But I was to be divorced from a doctor. And rather than having - as we ended up doing - having me live with this doctor through medical school and internship and residency and then been dumped, CBS felt that having been divorced was unacceptable from a societal point of view - that people would see nothing humorous in divorce. How could you possibly laugh at a woman who had a broken marriage in her past? And not only that - but, my God, they would think you were divorced from Dick Van Dyke, the world's most wonderful, adorable person.
And yet we heard few cries of impeachment, few calls for an early transfer of power. Until Wednesday. And since then, those cries and calls are coming from a growing chorus in Congress, including members of both parties.

GARNER: In the past when we've had issues with, say, drinking and driving, drug use - in the '90s, a big problem was racism - the Marine Corps basically sat down and said, no, this is completely unacceptable; we're going to change the culture in this. And it took time, but the way the Marine Corps did it was through a lot of education and a lot of training. Young recruits and poolees - poolees being before they go off to recruit training when they're talking to recruiters - knew right from the get-go where the Marine Corps stood as far as drug use, as far as alcohol abuse, racism and things like that. And so coming into the Marine Corps, they knew what the stance was. And we saw over time a drastic change.

I'm sure we will learn more from this outbreak and do a better job.

Iran appears intent on generating a nuclear crisis early in Joe Biden's presidency. On Monday, the Iranian government said it began enriching uranium to the 20% level, which is close to the purity used in a nuclear weapon. It is preparing further steps in the coming months, according to a timeline passed by parliament. Iran aims to compel Biden to immediately and unconditionally remove the sanctions that President Trump began to impose three years ago after he pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei repeated this demand on Friday, calling on the U.S. to lift sanctions on Iran immediately.

Hardliners have effectively controlled the country's political system since Iran's revolution. But Hassan Rouhani, the current president, is considered a moderate and has worked to improve relations with the West. The election will be a crucial test of his agenda.
How to get a waiver of the penalty
INSKEEP: Is it also a problem that there's been a patchwork of measures by different states? Texas is doing something a little different on a different timeline than New York, which is different from Florida. Is that a problem?
The remains were in such good condition that geneticists were able to extract DNA from one of them. They compared the sample with the genes of people from around the world.
Prof. NELSON: Right. I mean, it's an extraordinary situation. I mean, in an odd way, there was no real preparation, of course, for dealing with the oil spill, that is for responding to it. But at the same time, there was really no comprehensive notion of what this scientific investigation should be like.
SAGAL: Thank you so much. It's good to be here. We're making our Rhode Island debut. We've hit the the big time.
G COURTER: Well, we're at sea, so we see the waves and the stars and the almost-full moon. We have a friend on the opposite side of the ship, and we'll call her and say, what do you see? You know, you look down the hall. In each direction, there are hall monitors or police or something. And we can't even stick our heads out the door.
In one case, the court dealt with the charge of racial gerrymandering in Virginia. Minority voters claimed that the redistricting initially enacted by the Republican-controlled state legislature had diluted their votes by packing them into one district. They won in the lower court; the state of Virginia declined to appeal, so three members of the U.S. House of Representatives appealed to the Supreme Court instead. The court, however, threw out the challenge, ruling unanimously that the House members had no legal standing to sue. In an opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the court said there was no evidence that the House members had suffered any injury.
What was less clear then was that Brooks was also the first filmmaker to capture the essence of bourgeois Bohemianism, the attempt to embrace the cool lifestyle of the rebel while still having money and comfort. That fantasy is alive and kicking among today's urban strivers, who play vinyl, go glamping and drink artisanal coffee as they try to make their millions. While David and Linda are actually uneasy riders, they don't know how to change their lives. The road they travel isn't Easy Riders dreamy America, either.
It has been assaulted before. British troops burned it in 1814, before it had even been completed. More recent violent acts have included bombings and fatal shootings. In 1954, a group of Puerto Rican separatists fired pistols from the House gallery striking several members of Congress.
By email, I asked Cohen how she would respond to a skeptic who might claim that slow teaching coddles students rather than challenges them fully. She told me:
Only two justices would have held that the baking of a custom wedding cake is protected as speech by the First Amendment, said Kaipo Matsumura, who teaches law at Arizona State University.The other justices refrained from commenting on the issue and just reserved that question for future decisions in other cases.

The original story behind the Masterpiece Cakeshop case is both undisputed and well known: a gay couple in Colorado walked into the bakery in 2012 and asked for wedding cake. The owner and master baker Jack Phillips declined to make a custom cake for their party because he said their union violated his religious beliefs.
Mr. WEINBERG: …what he really wants is clues about where to go next and new puzzles, and I think that's what scientists are all about.
Fauci and another top physician, Dr. Deborah Birx, renewed their pleas for Americans to observe social distancing and other precautions to try to depress the rate of infections and deaths.
On Monday, the White House requested $1.25 billion in new funding from Congress and authorization to move other money to get an expected $2.5 billion for emergency preparedness and response. Azar said the money will go toward virus surveillance, state and local preparedness, the development of therapeutic treatments and vaccines, and the building of a stockpile of personal protective equipment such as masks.

The city was once known as the home of NASCAR, but racing has taken a back seat to financial services in recent decades — Bank of America and Wells Fargo employ tens of thousands of people in Charlotte. But just as Charlotte has become a blue stronghold, the outlying, more rural counties have become increasingly Republican.
GUNTON: Two things happen when David is attacked. So the females coming into breeding season is what finally stimulated these - his rivals to come together and make their move. And what's strange is that one of the females is particularly attractive. So, apparently, whenever she gets into - comes into breeding conditions - breeding season - the males get more interested because she's the - they find her the most attractive. Anyway, she came into season, so that's why his rivals picked their moment to attack him. And they attacked him so severely. They, effectively, left him for dead. And we actually thought he was dead.
In court Wednesday, Baraitser said that Assange's mental health condition is being sufficiently managed by prison officials and staff, contrary to the views of Assange's legal team and supporters.
Over several contentious sessions, student leaders hashed out a final version of a Statement of Commitments with members of the Board of Trustees. For days the two sides deliberated over a nine-point list of conditions. In the end, they compromised on seven.
GROSS: Now, you stuck with the Actors Studio as a teacher. You met a lot of actors before they had the screen personas that they're now famous for - for instance, Jack Nicholson who had been one of your students. Would you have guessed working with him early on that he would have become - I don't mean as famous as he is - that he would have had the kind of persona that we now know him for?

Imagine you're doing a journalistic story and you want to prove a point. So you ask one person a question and you don't quite like the answer, so you say, I'm going to ask five people, best out of five. So if after five people you don't get it, you say Best out of 10. And once you have 10 people, if the answer looks good, then you stop.

Made at the very height of the Reagan years, Lost In America, co-written with Monica Johnson, feels as relevant to our selfie-mad times as it did in 1985. Brooks stars as David Howard, an LA ad man who makes Mad Men's Don Draper looks like a figure of Shakespearean grandeur. Living a comfortably middle-class life with his wife Linda, played by Julie Hagerty, the neurotic David is looking forward to a promotion so he can buy a new Mercedes and get an even bigger house. When the promotion is denied, he quits his job in a huff and bullies Linda into quitting hers. He insists they must sell off everything, hit the road and be free. Here, Linda responds to his idea of getting a mobile home.
Sig (ph) Hecker is a former nuclear weapons scientist, now at Stanford University. He's one of the few Westerners who's visited Yongbyon, and he says it's pretty spartan.
That's a perfectly legitimate conversation to have, Ashe says. But having that discussion around the delisting process feeds this dialogue that the Endangered Species Act is broken, and that once a species goes on the list it is difficult to impossible to get it off. And, in the long run, that doesn't help the bear, or the prospect of conservation of threatened and endangered species.
Ten years ago, a slow-moving disaster shook the entire country: a financial meltdown that did not leave a single state untouched.

Refugees often get settled in a country with no advance notice, she says, so they don't have time to learn the language or the customs. Typically they get the first job they can get that doesn't require English or skills, and end up in a warehouse job. Many of them are highly educated — like Salih from Sudan, who has degrees in psychology and philosophy — but their paperwork doesn't translate, or they don't have paperwork due to an emergency situation.
In Detroit, Reeve got to work with WNBA head coach Bill Laimbeer. He was a key member of the NBA's Detroit Pistons championship teams in 1989 and 1990, and one of the former NBA players who successfully made the transition to coaching. Between 2003 and 2008, Laimbeer led the Detroit Shock to three WNBA titles.
SAGAL: Yes, that's who it is.
I think she's doing great....One thing that I think has even increased my respect for her is the fact that when you are the Speaker of the House and when you are the leader of the party there is a necessity, no matter what your political opinions are, where you have your own personal political ideology - what you cast your votes on, how you represent your individual district - and then there's this kind of you know herding cats of trying to bring people together, some of whom don't believe in my opinion and women's rights and others who are the staunchest progressives in the party. And when your job is to get all of those people to do the same thing it's extremely difficult to do. And I think that she's done a really good job so far.
REUSS: And we sat there, and it was very long 'cause everybody had to talk.

Atlantic Ocean Current Slows Down To 1,000-Year Low, Studies Show
Woods said NPR filled 82 positions in 2017 as of Dec. 21 (a slightly different time period than the year-to-year figures). Those included promotions into new jobs, conversions from temporary posts to full time, and the hiring of 35 people new to the company. Of those 82, 30 were people of color, he said, or 37 percent. More than 60 percent were women. Of the 35 new hires specifically, he said, 46 percent were people of color (and 63 percent were women).
The tradition is that while presidents are free to criticize court decisions, they should avoid personal attacks on judges. Why? Because judges have no actual power. They have no power of enforcement, no troops to carry out orders, no power of the purse.

Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn't change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low, said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.
Bilateral trade deficits aren't all that important
Candidates also often bring up the tens of millions of uninsured Americans on the campaign trail, or the fact that some Americans need to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, or a desire to raise workers' wages. Indeed, in South Carolina, an abundance of jobs exists alongside one of the lowest state median incomes in the nation.
ALLAM: But I have to say, he was in the minority.
That work was critical to convincing the Obama administration that there was a real path to get the legislation through, said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of of the Working Families Party. So we plan on using that strategy. Sometimes, the best way to influence a president is indirectly by doing the work on the ground and shoring up members of Congress to inspire in the administration the belief that there actually is a legislative path.

SUMMERS: They're so focused on the state that Steyer will spend the day before New Hampshire's primary campaigning in South Carolina. Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders have their sights set on younger voters here. And all of the campaigns are pointing out the fact that many South Carolinians haven't decided who to support. Naida Rutherford is one of them. Bernie Sanders is among the candidates that has caught her eye. She had been a Kamala Harris supporter.
And then we might ask ourselves: Wait a minute, where's public housing here? Where's housing vouchers? Doesn't the government help? And the answer is, it does help, but only for a small percentage of families. Only about 1 in 4 families who qualify for housing assistance get anything. So when we picture the typical low income American today, we shouldn't think of them living in public housing or getting any kind [of] housing assistance for the government, we should think of folks who are paying 60, 70, 80 percent of their income and living unassisted in the private rental market. That's our typical case today.
And now researchers say they have detected rumblings from that cataclysmic collision as ripples in the very fabric of space-time itself. The discovery comes a century after Albert Einstein first predicted such ripples should exist.
Later Saturday, Pence's chief of staff, Marc Short, said in a statement that Pence shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election.
Yet, Trump teased that maybe we start with infrastructure in the new year.
As things get easier, then people get more restive, and I think there is a desire for the Legislature to assert [itself], Brown said. Gavin will have his challenges, but he's older now than I was when I left the first time, he said, referring to the end of his second term in 1983. Brown said Newsom's age and experience will serve him well.
WAQAS ABID: This is very painful for me. Whenever they go to the school, I try to drop them myself. And we - all family members are very much careful. It's very painful when I think that - what happened with the innocent children in our city.
James Comey: Trump Should Be Impeached But Not Federally Prosecuted

I am pleased that we have such a formidable group of experienced and talented individuals that will work with me to implement real solutions for the economic issues facing our country, Trump said in a statement. He added:
The November election saw President Trump lose Georgia by about 12,000 votes and the 5 million ballots cast were counted three times, including a full hand audit required by law.
All I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have, because we won the state, Trump stated at one point. Flipping the state is a great testament to our country. It's a testament that they can admit to a mistake. A lot of people think it wasn't a mistake, it was much more criminal than that. But it's a big problem in Georgia, and it's not a problem that's going away.

Since then Trump has praised the new rule announcement, but questioned whether those who don't stand for the anthem should be allowed to stay in the U.S.
Can you help me understand the connection between your investigations and the phone call that the president ultimately made. Did he ask the president of Ukraine for help with Biden because of you? Or was he directing you, the president of the United States?
Kaine, the former governor of Virginia and Hillary Clinton's running mate in 2016, took aim at President Trump in his endorsement of Biden, writing, We deserve better in the Oval Office.
KELLY: Do you eventually, if you're trying to make a living here, have to figure out a way to tell these small stories on a bigger stage?
INSKEEP: That's an interesting challenge, to try to convey that sense of morning in America - using a phrase from Ronald Reagan's era, by the way - because hasn't this president been trying to say for several years it's morning in America. Things are moving in the right direction. Things are better. And according to surveys, there's just an awful lot of people out there - even people who may support him - who don't see it that way.
SAGAL: Well, I know. I mean, because the 140 character limit...
Mr. TURNER: And I should say that, you know, for programs like this there's some perception of some people in media that people aren't interested in science. But lots of people listen to this program and we have an event associated with this meeting, yesterday at a high school, 1,000 teenagers spent two hours in the afternoon, and there was no basketball players there. There's you know, three physicists. And it was really gratifying.
Over the years, Newsom has shown a tendency to get out in front of issues.
But in fact, nature surprises us, and every time we put a new window on the universe, almost every time, it's surprised us. Dark energy just came out of nowhere, and so that's what makes science exciting, is in fact, the search - is not understanding.
For me, what's important is talking to journalists in the community and trying to make sure that I am respectfully representing people, De La Cretaz, who does not speak Spanish, said about covering these players. I think the responsibility there lies with newsrooms and that's kind of part of the problem, too, she said. Since I'm a white writer, who is writing and my editor is a white editor there's a huge blind spot there.
Steve Inskeep: It's good to talk with you. I will tell you where we're recording here, obviously. A little bit of this may go out tonight, but the main part will be on tomorrow morning, which is the morning of the expected acquittal of the president.

Mainstream economists often say that trade is ultimately a net good; it creates broad, albeit easy-to-ignore-in-everyday-life benefits, like cheaper goods and a wider variety of products. But it also comes with acute pain for those people who do lose jobs.
Despite President Trump's pledges to rip up the Iran deal, the Trump administration's State Department allowed the deal to continue this past week by continuing to waive sanctions on Iran.
JOHN POWERS, BYLINE: We can all name movies that take place in Africa, from the many adventures of Tarzan to Oscar-winning hits like Out Of Africa. But these are not movies that actually come out of Africa. They were made by outsiders looking in. In fact, I'd wager that most Westerners have never seen an African story filmed from the inside. There's no better way to correct this than Black Girl, the taut, moving 1966 film that's widely regarded as the first ever fiction feature by a black African director. It was written and directed by Ousmane Sembene, a brilliant Senegalese auteur who wasn't merely the godfather of African cinema but probably the greatest artist it has yet produced.

GUNTON: Well, yeah. I mean, the story there is great because, you know, when we - when I - when we decided to do that film, you have to find a crew who are prepared to leave their home and live in Antarctica for nearly a year. And for about four - no, about eight months of that, they are on their own with seven other scientists. There - basically, there's a station there, an overwintering station, which has some scientists and some people watching the weather and some geophysics and stuff. That's it.

The measurement problem seems like it should stop quantum physics in its tracks. What does looking or measurement mean? There's no generally agreed-upon answer to this. And that means, in turn, that we don't really know when the Schrödinger equation applies and when it doesn't.

...it's almost absolute proof of what I have been saying for last couple years now, that the Republican Party's trying to drive conservatives out of the party. But I think it's more than that.

That bolded bit, about making a deal on debt, caused mass freakout in the financial press, and for good reason. Suggesting that U.S. creditors accept haircuts on U.S. debt (that is, accept lower payouts than they agreed to) would be an unheard-of, potentially disastrous policy proposition.

I think hopefully it's reflective of an emerging, or a shifting culture. Hopefully, if we change the type of masculinity portrayed on camera and it's getting good responses, then it's either where we're aspiring to be, or it's people relating to it on a personal level. And I think it's super important.
Black holes come in different sizes, a point well-explained in the Nova episode. Even tiny ones could, at least in principle, be created on Earth, in particle accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, where the Higgs boson particle was discovered in 2012. But don't worry, these tiny guys are harmless, evaporating away in a fraction of a second; they won't grow to swallow Earth.
Colorado state Sen. Mike Foote, who's sponsoring legislation, insisted that it's not a partisan response to Trump's 2016 win. Rather, he said, it's about upholding the democratic principle of one person, one vote.
Humanities students, on the other hand, are (with, of course, brave exceptions) typically those who eschew the sciences or, at least, math. Their training is also technical, involving lots of reading and critical writing. You can often tell, when you teach this kind of class, who the scientists and the humanists are. All you have to do is write an equation on the blackboard and look at the class. Humanists' eyes will quickly glaze over. The scientists will perk up. As you read from Aristotle's Metaphysics, the opposite will happen. To bridge this gap is the challenge.
There are permanent categories like Cuisine or Sports and sort of trending ones, called Live Topics, like Julian Assange or Seth Rich (both reflecting the latest news cycles). Before Gab got rid of trending hashtags, #MAGA, #gabfam and #Trump were the virtually permanent mainstays.

So in the '80s, we had a couple of white neighbors.

GATES: And because it was PBS, we negotiated a deal with this company Illumina which sequences everybody. For $50,000, they sequenced my father, me and then 12 of the guests who were in Faces Of America - not a full genome but a dense genotyping. So that was a steal. Now you can get a full sequence for less than $5,000 - some people say $1,000 or $2,000. That's how much the science of genetics has changed in terms of the retail market since 2009. It's incredible.
GROSS: Did it get worse after the accident? Did they tell you that now you really had to pray?
DAVIES: You know, it was fascinating - at the end of each of the episodes is a few minutes in which we meet the crew, and they talk about what they do.

For more than 20 years, researcher Mary Lu Arpaia has been on a mission to find an avocado tree that can withstand the Central Valley's frosty winters and hot summers. At a test field east of the Central Valley city of Visalia, Arpaia thinks she's found three varieties that can do just that.
Three of them out, two are done. Two more are done. So we have five. And I would say we're through the hardest part of the case, or what I would consider the hardest to explain. You usually do that first in a trial. We could conceivably do it in two more. I think three more is more like it.
It now looks as though we are approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve, and without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days.
Inspirational figures play their part by sitting in the gallery. Everyone's playing to the TV cameras. But there is also a degree of substance, the presidential speech itself.
Finally, in an employment discrimination case, the court made it easier for federal employees to file employment discrimination claims. The postmaster of Englewood, Colo., filed a lawsuit claiming that he was the victim of illegal retaliation after he complained about being denied a promotion based on his race. He claimed that he was transferred to Wyoming as punishment for his discrimination complaint. Because the new job was 300 miles away and paid less, he retired.

Similarly, there were those who faulted Bush's reaction to the Sept. 11 attacks, especially his channeling of the resulting political anger toward Iraq, which he invaded 18 months later. Some also questioned whether the Sept. 11 attacks had even happened as reported, suggesting the damage was far greater than three airplanes could have caused. This fringe group of dissenters, known as Truthers, never gained much traction in the national conversation.
YONG: And it's just moving really easily from one person to another. The speed at which it's moving might be a little slower come the spring or summer but not enough to curtail the spread of the pandemic on its own. One epidemiologist explained it to me like this. It's as if the world is just full of tinder, and you've got this gigantic wildfire that's blazing through it. And hoping that seasonality will help is a bit like hoping that a light rain is going to douse it. It might make it a little weaker.

According to the bureau's plans, workers are generally supposed to try to gather information in person in up to six days in total. At a time of outbreak, however, it's hard to say how many visits will actually be possible later this year.
Kids might also benefit from being exposed early on to fields like engineering, which aren't typically studied in high school, to demystify them, says Cheryan.
SHAWN (Caller): Yes. I was just wondering - it seems to me, I agree that the - this pope has been moving quickly, probably, for obvious reasons. My question is more throughout the world church. I know Mr. Allen is very familiar with what's going on in the church. Is this more of a problem, at this juncture, of looking back? In other words, we're looking at offenses, very grave offenses that occurred in the '50s, '60s, maybe into the '70s, and that we're not really talking about an ongoing problem. Is there - there's no widespread problem, or is there a widespread problem of abuse currently in the Catholic Church? And that's my question, and I can take my answer off the air.

But there is emerging research and data that suggests transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic individuals. Such research has been coming out at least since February; the latest report is from Singapore on April 1.

Why Viruses Mutate: Breaking Down The New Coronavirus Variant
Yeah, that's the exact reason. The reason we did it as an independent school is so we could really push all of the boundaries. Fully mixed age would be very hard in any other context. Every six weeks, we kind of look at what worked, what didn't work, and we kind of reset it and reboot it and we try new things. So it really is in the spirit of innovation of Khan Academy. If we really want to understand what's possible in a physical classroom, we need a lab.

Granting what you've said, Mayor, the president ultimately did make this phone call. And we spoke the other day on the program with Lamar Alexander, Republican senator from Tennessee, who's voting for acquittal.

Speaking on the Senate floor, McConnell called the resolution a fair road map, that closely tracks precedents. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., called the rules completely partisan. He said McConnell's resolution seems designed by President Trump for President Trump.
NOURSE: And I saw this, and I said, this system is rigged. The criminal law was saying there are some people who are just not protected. How can that be equal protection of the law? The Constitution says you have equal protection of the law. How can that be equal protection? That was the core of the kernel that I just kept building out.
Testifying publicly for the first time this week in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, one of the psychologists who designed the CIA's torture program said he now believes the torture techniques went too far.
So who were your millionth-great-grandparents? They are back there somewhere in the deep time that makes up Earth's braided history of life and change. All that struggle, all those moments of hunger, fear, satisfaction and calm: It all happened. And for this one brief moment you represent the tip of that spear. You are the current generation, not just of humans, but also of all life on this lovely blue marble.
Playboy seems to sort of exist in this middle ground, this ill-defined place where, you know, you have a lot of the adult entertainment, which is very sort of hard core and caters to the fringes and is not mainstream at all. And then you have, you know, the other side of Playboy's enterprise, which is this culture and lifestyle section. You know, it came up in the '50s as what the cultured, sophisticated, suave man might read — a real sort of Esquire-like lifestyle publication. And then, you now, as it's evolved, it's kind of become a character of itself. So I think it's trying to get back to its roots as, you know, as a culture publication.

Was more leadership needed here from the White House?
Jane and Bernie Sanders hired a lawyer this spring, after news of the investigation was public. Sanders' detractors say the move shows that there is something the couple is trying to hide. Family spokesman Jeff Weaver told the Post that there is no truth in that argument. He says the couple brought lawyers on because of fears that Trump or Sanders' other political adversaries would improperly use the Justice Department to damage the senator's reputation.

Lieber isn't Chinese, but many of the researchers getting arrested or fired over accusations they took money from the Thousand Talents program are Chinese nationals or of Chinese ethnicity. That has led some to assert that the government is racially profiling, a charge Lelling denies.

I can speak to that from an FDA point of view. And I can tell you this: We are learning organization. We are always and I mean always looking for ways to improve. And we have responded to feedback from stakeholders on the therapeutic, the vaccine and the test development side. We will always incorporate that. And when there's an opportunity to do a look back, we will do that because we always want to do what's best for the American people. But I have to tell you, 17,000 strong, incredible scientists, doctors, nurses, pharmacists, are working around the clock on this effort.

And you could write a prescription for a drug that's an off label. FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine, the doctor's got to make that decision based upon individual patient situation. You know, I'm going to put my doctor hat on, not my FDA hat, David, if that's OK. So I'm a doctor and I'm seeing a patient and I'm thinking about this. You know, what I want to know is what are the data behind this? And I mentioned this yesterday because it's such an important thing for a doctor — right drug, right patient, right dose, right time. And the problem with the current situation is that we don't have all the facts. We don't have all of the data per say now. Some of the reports are encouraging and we're gathering all those data. And what we'd like to do is to make this particular drug available to what's called expanded access. We're going to have the ability to do what's called a pragmatic trial. Doctors can prescribe and use it. And then we'll collect those data. But I mentioned yesterday, and David I think this is so important — I'm a cancer doctor and you always want to provide hope. And I do very much believe there's hope here from a therapeutic point of view. But you don't want to promote false hope.

So we'll be having that done pretty quickly.
Mr. GREENE: I like to say that it's also good to think about scale, though. I think when one says that the photons are very far apart, we need to have in mind how small the photons are. I mean, in any cubic meter of space, there are roughly 400 million of these guys running around.

Blakely says if the disease does reach the Central Valley, citrus farmers will eventually need something else to grow. Maybe that could be avocados.
GOLDMAN: You know, there's a case to be made for that. But the other side of the argument holds more sway when it comes to professional team sports. That argument is the championship happened. Nothing will change that, even if it's deemed fraudulent. Mostly in the pros, they punish forward. Future draft picks, fines, suspensions. So perhaps an asterisk, but I don't see World Series being taken away.
SUMMERS: Tom Steyer has been among the candidates most aggressively courting black voters in South Carolina. At last night's debate, Steyer made clear that he believes he has ground to gain here.

There was a lot of - you know, a huge cacophony of sound, you know, rumpus of all this going, the howling of the hyenas, him roaring, all the rest of it. His half-brother was also out and about and heard this in the distance and looked over and came running over. And when he saw it, he ran in. And as soon as the hyenas saw there was another male lion, they stop it because suddenly, there were two jaws to fight - to bite rather than just one. And the odds were then completely against them. And so that - his half-brother, basically, saved his life.

That shift can be partly attributed to job decline in traditional Western extractive industries, such as timber and mining. In recent years, there have also been clashes over culture as rising housing costs along the West Coast have pushed urban residents from Seattle as well as Oregon and California into the quickly growing region. At the same time, Clark County — Southwest Washington's most populous county — has seen significant growth in white-collar sectors like technology and finance.

The lesson of Finding Your Roots - we're all immigrants. Black people came here - not willingly, of course. They came in slave ships. But they came from someplace else. Even the Native Americans came from someplace else about 16,000 years ago. So everybody who showed up on this continent is from someplace else. And under the skin, we are almost identical genetically. And that is the strongest argument for brotherhood, sisterhood and the unity of the human species. And I make it every week over and over with Finding Your Roots.

But my feeling is that these lawsuits were - are based on evidence or facts they say they have that show that the company did this in the past - not what's going on today.

How the poll works: Participants in the NPR Music Jazz Critics Poll are instructed to pay tribute to the performers who created the best recorded jazz in the past calendar year. They submit their choices for the top 10 new releases, which are assigned points via a weighted system: 10 points for first place, nine for second, etc. If a participant files an unranked list, albums receive 5.5 points each. Voters also provide single choices for Vocal, Debut and Latin jazz albums, as well as three Rara Avis selections, a category that includes reissues, historical recordings, and vault discoveries. The system is modeled on rock critic Robert Christgau's Pazz & Jop poll, which began at the Village Voice in 1971 and was a successor to polls published by Jazz & Pop magazine in the late 1960s.

AUBREY: You know, the CDC guidance is pretty open-ended It says cloth face coverings fashioned from household items made from, quote, common materials at low cost can be used. And if you go online, there is no shortage of ideas of how to make these masks. You can fold them. Origami masks. You can 3D print them. You can sew them. There are Burberry-inspired masks on Etsy for the fashion minded. So, you know, there are some unanswered questions. Not all studies point to a benefit from cloth masks compared to other types of medical-grade masks. And the type of material you use probably can make a difference. A physician I spoke to yesterday pointed out that a face covering made of a knitted wool scarf where you can see the holes is probably not as protective compared to, say, a tight weave cotton fabric. So a CDC spokesperson told me they do hope to add some more details soon, and they have information on there now about how best to wear and how to clean your face coverings.

Van Hove says he wanted to make the audience feel the intensity of being in the middle of a live TV show. If you have been in a live TV show, it's always a pressure cooker, he says.

And that thrill I wanted to give. And at the same time, another thing became for me important, that there would be cameras everywhere. It's as if the world became a television studio.

The hard thing about programming is, it hasn't been there traditionally. So, you know, we're trying to find space for it in the traditional school system. A lot of educators haven't been exposed to it when they were young. So that's the challenge. But there's also an opportunity in that there isn't anything to replace. It's green field, it's a new area, and there's all sorts of incredible tools for people to learn. And when I talk about people, I'm not just talking about students — I'm talking about people of all ages. I encourage parents, teachers, people of all walks of life to start dabbling a little bit.

His cheeks were hollow, his skin leathery and tight against his bones. His eyes were open but unfocused, like the glass eyes in a box at a doll factory she'd once photographed. Although his hair was full and dark brown, not gray, Claire pegged him at over eighty. His head swayed from side to side as the orderlies slid the stretcher out of the ambulance and onto the gurney. Beneath the once-white blanket, his right leg was grotesquely swollen.
Heinrich said he confronted the children with a snub-nosed revolver. He handcuffed Jacob behind his back and drove away as Jacob asked, 'What did I do wrong?' Heinrich admitted sexually abusing Jacob and then shot him twice. Heinrich said he left Jacob's body and went home and went back later to hide the body, using a Bobcat to dig a hole. He returned to the site a year later to discover Jacob's jacket partially exposed. He picked up Jacob's remains and took them to a new spot.

One of the things we've grown unaccustomed to is a competent administration, he said. When people are competent, they can do a lot of things pretty quickly.
EDMUNDS: In some of the places where we were, by August of 2017, when we were last there before the hurricane, one-tenth of the sea floor or less was covered by live coral. And now 3 or 4 percent of that has been killed. And the rate of recovery will be slow. Corals grow very slowly. So probably by next summer, we'll start to see baby corals settling on the reef. And some of those will survive and produce the reefs of tomorrow. But whether they do that or not will depend on these progressive changes in the environmental conditions and whether or not there are further Category 5 storms in 2018 or 2019 or 2020.
Meanwhile, the state's Republican Party has opened its first field office in the city — on its predominantly African American North Side.

Caring all that much about the U.S. trade deficit with Germany in particular doesn't make much sense, said Douglas Irwin, professor of economics at Dartmouth College, because Germany is part of the European Union.
MARTIN: I mean, we should just point out it wasn't that long ago that there was an overhaul of the American health care system that gave birth to the Affordable Care Act. So - and these Democrats are arguing that didn't go far enough. But this is a very politically difficult issue. I mean, how does it poll with the public? Do Americans want a single-payer system?

LIASSON: I do. As it was described to me, unless he got the full amount of funding for the wall that he was demanding, he would do this because this is a way for him to keep faith with his base, to say that he did everything possible to build the wall, even if it's stopped in the courts. His advisers really believe - he really believes that the wall is absolutely key to his re-election. Now, of course, now he has to convince the courts that a national emergency is whatever a president says it is. And he really undercut himself in that speech in the Rose Garden, where he said, I didn't need to do this. In other words, he's doing this for expedience not necessity. He said, I just wanted to build the wall faster. He's also said at various times that the wall is already being built. So if it's already being built, why do you need to declare a national emergency to build it?
Dr. D'ELIA: Yes, I've heard of other cases anecdotally. But I think that there are a couple of other points we made in our Washington Post op-ed piece that are really critical, and they bear on this, as well, that probably, the foremost one is something that Cary Nelson just said, which is we're not really planning, in a comprehensive way, how to deal with large-scale scientific disasters. And what plans apparently do exist seem to be within the government only, and do not extend to the academic community.

Still, the information may be of great interest to the uninsured and to the increasing number of Americans with high-deductible plans, in which they are responsible for hundreds or even thousands of dollars in costs annually before the insurer begins picking up the bulk of the cost.
NOURSE: There were no good names for what was going on. At the time, Biden called it a dirty little secret that society had, and one way that kept being reinforced with the names. So domestic violence, you know, sounds like an oxymoron. There's nothing domestic about a hook to the left jaw. There's nothing tame about it. I needed something very clear. And so one day, I think I said violence against women.

KANDER: That's part of the reason. The story of how the other one got written is Fred and I were writing songs for a film called New York, New York. Martin Scorsese was directing it. And it starred Liza Minnelli and Robert De Niro. We wrote five or six songs and went down to Marty's (ph) office to play them. And Liza and Marty were there. and then in the background - I don't know if we got introduced or not - was Robert De Niro sitting on a couch. I'm not sure I even knew that at the time. Anyway, we played the songs for them. and everything was all set until suddenly we saw this arm waving from the couch. And Marty went over and said excuse me, De Niro wants to speak to me. And then we watched what was a very animated conversation. and we couldn't hear anything. And Scorsese came back and in a very embarrassed way said that De Niro had felt that the title song, which was very much attached to him in the film, was just too lightweight compared to the song that was attached to Liza, which was The World Goes Round. And would we consider taking another crack at it? And of course we left and thought, some actor is going to tell us how to write a song? And we could not have been more internally pompous, I think. Anyway, we went back to Fred's apartment.

Well, the thing that was most striking was the intense militancy of the crowd. The willingness of the demonstrators to engage in physical combat with the police — to fight with them over barricades, to fight with them with their own pepper spray and weapons.

The last best chance to stop either Trump or Clinton may well be next week, when Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware hold the next-to-last round of multistate primaries. A total of 144 delegates will be available for Republicans and 392 for Democrats. There will not be a comparable package until the season's final day on June 7.
Many Black people, and more broadly, other people of color, are not really under the illusion that the police are going to keep them safe. But a lot of white people are. And a lot of white people, I think, see chaos or violence or what they perceive to be dangerous situations and think, I want a police force. I want something standing in the way of me and violence. The solutions that you're talking about and the kind of radical change that we're talking about are obviously going to take time. In the meantime, how much is that fear of violence a barrier?

Thereafter, the economic and political gains that had been made by emancipated African Americans in the South were largely lost — including access to the ballot.

Breaking with tradition, Trump was a no-show at the annual White House Correspondents' Association Dinner Saturday night in D.C. It was the first time in 36 years that the president has not attended the event. Back in 1981, President Ronald Reagan did not attend because he was recovering from an assassination attempt.

MCMULLIN: Well, I would say that I do support a harder line with North Korea. Presidents of both parties for decades have tried a more traditional diplomatic approach with the Kim regime unsuccessfully. They do present, I believe, a threat to U.S. and global security. But I've questioned whether Donald Trump's rhetoric has been part of the smartest, wisest strategy. And I also would advocate for a little more caution around some of the red lines and threats that the president is drawing now. I think a much more productive approach is to increase the cost of the status quo for China in North Korea so that China can be then more inspired to do more to rein in that regime.

The first question Wednesday came from Susan Collins, Mitt Romney and Lisa Murkowski, three Republican senators who have signaled they may support a vote to hear from witnesses.

And at that point the process has broken down. Democrats have not been blameless in this process.

And with billions of dollars at stake, the government and BP will head to court. The extent of the damage and how much spill should cost BP will be decided through the legal system. And as one of my guests writes in an editorial in the Washington Post, both sides will seek to use science in a legal context.
Kim visited the Korean People's Army as the self-imposed mid-August deadline for a missile demonstration approached, the Korean Central News Agency reports. But after hearing the plan and considering it, Kim opted not to give the order to launch missiles, and instead would watch a little more the foolish and stupid conduct of the Yankees, the report says.
Modi said failing to act on climate change would be a morally criminal act. Merkel had previously vowed to convince the doubters among world leaders that protecting the climate matters to all of us.
Brenda Baer, a nurse in rural Northwest Pennsylvania, was more circumspect. The riots, she said, were not okay, and there has to be some accountability for Trump.
During an exchange over how high to raise the minimum wage in Thursday night's Democratic debate, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders began to shout over each other, hands raised, fingers pointed, both seeming to get a bit red in the face, while the audience cheered and booed in equal parts.
Compare the MVNOs cell phone plans listed below with any mainstream, Big four plans and you'll see that these offer much more value for money. That's just one reason why MVNO plans are becoming so popular.

The disaster, which made headlines across the nation, helped create the modern environmental movement. It also led to restrictions on offshore drilling — restrictions the Trump Administration is trying to loosen.
The American Geriatrics Society lists benzos as inappropriate for use in the elderly, because of their potential for adverse drug interactions. In older people, benzos also heighten the risk of falls and can hamper memory.
In a statement released just after the certification was finalized, Trump at long last acknowledged his election loss. He said that even though he disagrees with the outcome, there will be an orderly transition on January 20th.
SAGAL: It was, but you - all right. This is fine.
These are very complex rules, says Stacy Sanders, federal policy director at the Medicare Rights Center, which spearheaded an effort in 2015 by nearly 50 unions, insurance companies and seniors' advocacy organizations to convince Medicare officials to address the problem.
Modi had three problems he wanted to solve if the country relied less on cash:
Seventy-five percent of those surveyed are not confident about the tech companies, a 9-point increase from a similar 2018 NPR/Marist poll.
My form of alcoholism was much more controlled because I grew up in that very uncomfortable, very sad situation, and I determined that I was never going to do that, never be drunk. And I probably never was really out-and-out drunk. And I certainly never drank during the daytime. But I wasted a lot of my time, and I forgot a lot because I didn't remember much of what had happened the night before. I got out-of-proportion angry about things that were really unimportant. But that's what alcohol does to you.
First launched in the 1950s, Playboy surprised many when it announced in late 2015 that it planned to cut out nudity.
The region had been known as Terra Australis Incognita or Unknown South Land according to the National Library of Australia. It was later named New Holland by Dutch explorers. But after Flinders' expedition, he wrote Australia on a map and the name stuck.
In any event, the custom of a written speech took hold and prevailed for more than a century. It was not until Woodrow Wilson arrived in 1913 that the notion of in-person delivery was revived.
Rudell says he feels a profound sense of sadness and anger because when he met the couple, they told him they were excited about creative projects they were going to work on. He was stunned and gratified his tweet captured worldwide attention, including from celebrities including Sarah Silverman, high-profile journalists such as Jake Tapper and Chris Hayes, and politicians including California Democrat Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. He says more needs to be done to ensure Hathloul and the others are released from Saudi prison.
They had agreed with the owners to a $90 million partnership to fight social [injustice], so I think that they had believed that they had reached an accommodation, Bryant says. Now we're seeing that that accommodation isn't such an accommodation and I think the players are trying to strategize with their union to figure out just what's going to happen.

Approaching her afterward, Claire moved slowly, trying not to startle her. Mrs. Reese?
We all stand to lose from this gulf between the sciences and the humanities. The sciences run the risk of being decontextualized from their moral and social consequences, pursuing technologies that should be regulated and scrutinized. Artificial intelligence research, for example, as many philosophers and, thankfully, scientists have recognized, needs to have safeguards so as to guarantee that, in the advent that we do build machines more intellectually capable than ourselves, they would still be willing to work with us and not against us. The same with CRISPR/Cas9 biotechnologies, that can effectively and specifically change genes within organisms, thus allowing us to engineer life following target goals. On the other hand, the humanities run the risk of becoming disconnected from the pace of scientific discoveries and myopic to how they are effectively transforming the world we live in.
SCHLAPP: We are ready to have this discussion with the Democrat leadership. Question is, are they going to come to the table?
LONG: And Mister Rogers decides that he's going to devote the first week of his national program to issues of war and peace.
HARKINS: (As Reverend Burns) So go ahead, my dear, laugh for Chuckles.
Mr. ALLEN: Yeah. This is - I suppose for Catholic insiders, the Legionaries of Christ would be one of the more high-profile new religious orders in the Catholic Church, founded in the middle part of the 20th century and known for being very - or I should say fairly conservative and very loyal to the pope, loyal to the Vatican. The founder was a high-profile Mexican priest by the name of Father Marcial Maciel Degollado, who actually died in 2008. Father Maciel was one of these sort of charismatic figures who was very skilled at generating a following, and very skilled at ingratiating himself in senior levels in Rome.
MultiCare said it found another vendor for N95s in early December and is in the process of distributing them.
It seems, then, that evolution has given us the short end of the color-vision stick. But, thanks to work over the last decade or so, it is now possible to understand why this, actually, is not really true. Human (and primate) color vision may, in fact, be superbly well-adapted to its primary purpose.
GROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Viet Thanh Nguyen. And his novel The Sympathizer won this year's Pulitzer Prize for fiction. Let's take a short break here, then we'll talk some more. This is FRESH AIR.
Stevie Wonder was writing about former president Richard Nixon when he released Big Brother in 1972. But when he sings the line, I'll change if you vote me in as the president of your soul... he was being scarily prescient.
In announcing its new goals, McDonald's also touted its success in removing sugary soda from the Happy Meal section of menu boards. This action was taken as part of a commitment with the Alliance for a Healthier Generation, a group that aims to empower kids to develop lifelong healthy habits.
These conversations began with the social scientist Francis Fukuyama, who famously proclaimed the end of history just as the Cold War was coming to an end. What Fukuyama meant was that a single form of government — liberal democracy — was on its way to triumph over competing models like communism. A quarter century later, the forms of democracy remain in place around the world. But many are becoming less liberal. Russia has an elected president and parliament but has cracked down on dissent and the press. Turkey has also cracked down on the press, and in a recent democratic vote chose to concentrate power in the hands of one man.
We've had a lot of rain, but we got lucky. It was a constant rain but not a heavy rain, Regina Myers, emergency management director in Walker County northwest of Birmingham, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.
MALEK: I will tell you this. One day, I did get a call. I got a call from Mara Casey, who was a casting director for the Gilmore Girls. And she asked to speak with Rami Malek's agent, and I said, speaking. And she said, well, can I talk to - about Rami Malek coming in for a role on the Gilmore Girls? And I said, yeah. And she said, and who am I speaking with? I said, this is he. And she said, you don't have an agent, do you? And I go, no, but we can work on that. And she started laughing. And she said, well, are you SAG? Are you part of the Screen Actors Guild? And I said, as of yet, no. But that's something else we can work on, as well. And she kept laughing. And she's like, listen; you're cute. Call me when you get representation. And I said, listen; we're doing all right. We're having a good time. I see that the scene has only three lines. How about giving a guy a break? And if you're laughing now, chances are I might have you laughing in the room. And she took a few seconds, and she said, you know what, kid? Come on in.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reviewed his military's plans to rain an enveloping fire around the U.S. territory of Guam — but opted not to fire missiles at this time, according to state media. Despite the stand-down, some Guamanians were alarmed after two radio stations aired an erroneous emergency alert Tuesday.
The health insurance offered by big companies is typically pretty comprehensive, the better to attract and keep good employees. But Obamacare broadened some coverage requirements. Under the law, insurers and employers have to cover many preventive services without charging people anything for them. The services that are required with no out-of-pocket payments include dozens of screenings and tests, including mammograms and colonoscopies that are recommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force; routine immunizations endorsed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices; and a range of services that are recommended specifically for children and for women by the federal Health Resources and Services Administration.
DWYER: But that future may well still include Virginia's embattled leaders, all three of whom have defied calls to step down. Alison Dagnes is a professor at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania. She's been studying and writing about political scandals for a long time, and she says something has changed lately in the way that leaders handle them. They've got the benefit of deep political polarization, the growth of partisan media and now the model of President Trump, who has often survived his scandals simply by riding out the news cycle.
The United Kingdom's government is urging the public to work from home and avoid pubs, restaurants and theaters to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the death toll hit 67, with 1,950 confirmed cases. But, unlike some other European countries, including Ireland, the U.K. will keep schools open for now.
I sent her to school yesterday, and she was supposed to be safe, he said, choking back tears. My job is to protect my children, and I sent my kid to school.
When Chris Servheen was named the nation's first grizzly bear recovery coordinator, tasked with saving and restoring the iconic species, he wasn't optimistic.

Slowly affection transformed Patsy's face. Her clenched hands relaxed. Claire wondered how she herself looked when she talked about Emily and Charlie, wondered if she revealed the same combination of joy and love that Patsy now showed.
Last week's challenge: This challenge came from listener David Curren of Arlington, Mass. Think of a familiar two-word phrase (5, 2). Replace the last letter with the next letter of the alphabet. The result will be a palindrome (the seven letters will read backward and forward the same). What phrase is it?
Venezuelan Opposition Leader Guaidó Declares Himself President, With U.S. Backing
Pelosi, a California Democrat, is 80 and has served in Congress for 33 years. She hinted last year that this might be her final term as the leader of the House. She has no clear heir apparent, and her closest deputies, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Rep. Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, are 81 and 80, respectively.
That tendency in Newsom was not always appreciated. After his first marriage fell apart, he had an affair with a top aide's wife. Some felt he often seemed bored being mayor; spending too much time thinking about his political future including a run for governor a decade ago.
The first Earth Day took place just over a year later in April of 1970. The Environmental Protection Agency was created in December of that year. Environmental laws passed or strengthened during this period included the Clean Air, Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts.
As ordinary as it is, that use of they has always been a bit disreputable — you might say it, but you wouldn't want to write it down. But now it's a pronoun whose hour has come.

In the aftermath of the 2020 election cycle, observing how the electoral sausage gets made isn't just something for skeptical Republicans. Democratic monitor Karen Tindall threw herself into volunteering this year at the age of 71, in part because she wanted to help take partisan politics out of the way our votes are counted.

GENTRY: ...Because we're so far down the calendar. But yeah, I think it's over, and I think that the healing process will start as it does in every presidential cycle. There's always an amount of healing that has to occur, and I think we're going to do fine. I think as a party - I think we're strong, and we're going to make it through this.
So how did you come up with your own perspective?
McConnell's judgment was endorsed by Republican Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. Trump responded with a tweet promising a primary challenge to Thune's next reelection bid.
To cut corners, Bartlett used charitable donations and special deals, as CBS put it — including once splitting a $1,000 truck full of corn dogs with a sheriff of a nearby county and then feeding the inmates corn dogs twice a day for weeks.

So I don't think of it as my story. I think of it as 'I'm so sorry that Andy lost his mother without even saying goodbye', but I see it in this bigger picture of how this pandemic has just steamrolled us in every direction, he says.
The senator said he believes that even if it isn't directly targeting Russian missiles, the U.S. facility will make Moscow think twice about causing trouble in Eastern Europe.
The bird count first launched in 1998, and over time, Brown said scientists can get a big picture idea of what's going on with the avian population, especially when combined with data from other popular bird counts, such as the National Audubon Society's Christmas Bird Count.

STEVE TSANG: If we are looking at the overall interests of China as a whole, I think the policy is backfiring because a vibrant, prosperous, successful Hong Kong is in the best interest of China, not only of Hong Kong.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: Your favorite neighbor is about to get his face on a stamp, his own movie starring Tom Hanks and two documentaries. It's no coincidence tomorrow will be 50 years since Mister Rogers' Neighborhood first aired on national TV. NPR's Andrew Limbong has this on the lasting legacy of the show.
WHO and other agencies have also raised concerns about the potential problems that could arise due to the wearing of a mask — for example, a false sense of security that would undermine other preventive measures or self-contamination from touching a contaminated mask.

For a vice president who has navigated service to a mercurial president with praise and public acts of loyalty, Vice President Pence faced the ultimate challenge on Wednesday as he presided over a joint session of Congress that will make official Joe Biden's election — and President Trump's loss.
Mr. GREENE: So, all these little pieces of the puzzle, where they to happen - again, I consider it a long shot - but where they happen again, you would have much great confidence that this set of ideas was going in the right direction.
FLATOW: All right. Let me - I've got time for one more caller.
The time for persuasion and public appeals is over, Pritzker said at a press conference on Sunday as St. Patrick's Day revelers in Chicago were already hitting bars in large groups. This is not a joke. No one is immune to this.
The rule puts that all into the light, says Gelfand. When an employer sees these ridiculous prices, for the first time they will have the ability to say no. That could mean rejecting specific prices or the hospital entirely.
PETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Omar tweeted that it's, quote, all about the Benjamins. And by that, she meant AIPAC. The PAC in AIPAC, though, doesn't stand for political action committee. It's public affairs committee. Josh Block is head of The Israel Project and is a former AIPAC staffer.

SHARP: Well, but it's not about one student's rights being more important than another. It's about protecting every student's rights to privacy. And so what we've seen schools do is offer accommodations to any student, including transgender students, that are not comfortable with communal restrooms, allowing them to use single-stall restrooms or whatever's available so that they've got a choice. But they also have a duty to protect every other student's constitutional right to privacy when the courts across the country have recognized as implicated when you've got restrooms and locker rooms and why Title IX was drafted the way it is. So schools have to protect that. And what they're trying to do is make sure that every student has a place where they can use restroom, change and shower and feel comfortable without having to break down our traditions of having separate restrooms on the basis of biological sex.
Shutdown Could Have Long-Term Effects On Wildfire Disaster Response
This is where I'm going with this. As you know very well, your critics have said Mayor Giuliani has been misled. He doesn't really know the country. He may not really know the backgrounds of the people who were giving him information, doesn't know his sources very well. How do you respond to that?

Still, law professor Frank Wu says a recent increase in criminal prosecution marks a big change. Up until a few years ago, universities were urging their researchers to collaborate with China. If there was a funding issue, a researcher might face disciplinary action, but you wouldn't face being fired and going to prison and having your name dragged through the mud as a spy, Wu says.
I'm really energized by Steyer, she said. He's for everyone. I really believe that race, along with climate, have to be the top priority, and he seems to be the candidate that is putting it first and foremost.
You see the soft landscapes that A. Hitler painted, of thatched-roof houses, old stone churches, slim flowers and snowy countrysides, and realize one of the most frightening facts of all.
And while some lawmakers floated the idea of removing no-excuse absentee voting enacted by (and primarily used by) Republicans for the last 15 years, Republican House Speaker David Ralston said he would appoint a new bipartisan committee to tackle any changes.
It was an interesting situation where the international media and police officers outnumbered the actual protesters. This afternoon here in Hong Kong, I attended a pro-democracy march. And now, there were a couple thousand people who showed up to that. But according to Isabel Chang, a local Hong Kong resident, it paled in comparison to the turnouts of previous years. And here's what she said.
SEBRELL: That too. I actually make a lot more money now that I'm retired (laughter). You know, I was glad to do it at the time, but it shouldn't be that way.
The next year, Woody Allen gave him a part in Crimes And Misdemeanors as a philandering husband who has his mistress murdered when she threatens to tell his wife about their affair. Again, Landau was nominated for an Oscar. He won an Oscar for his 1994 portrayal of Bela Lugosi in Tim Burton's movie Ed Wood. More recently, he received two Emmy nominations for his performance in the TV series Without A Trace. Back in the '60s, Landau was best known for his role in the TV series Mission: Impossible as covert operations agent Rollin Hand.
The attacker in this case, a virus, is not great and imposing but small, microscopic – indeed, invisible. We don't know which way to strike back, which may be one reason many are reluctant to believe the attack itself is real.

But immigrant advocates say U.S. officials have exacerbated the situation at the border by limiting the number of migrants who can seek asylum at legal ports of entry. They say that's pushing a growing number of migrant families to cross illegally in more remote areas of Arizona and New Mexico, miles from the nearest food, water and medical care.
Physically and spatially dead, Jerry told us, generic academic realism, the equivalent of mediocre exercises in aping good penmanship. He was an adequate draftsman, utterly unimaginative, and made the equivalent [of] greeting cards.

Even a California loss for Clinton wouldn't really change the race, because she and Sanders would very likely split the state's delegates, says Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. He worked on the Clinton campaign in 2008.
One thing that we need to do is start thinking far more seriously about global governance because the only solution to such problems will be on a global level, not on a national level.
But these shows of force may end up being self-defeating, as they turn more countries against Tehran. For example, increased Iranian provocations may push Gulf Arab states closer to Israel, strengthening the agreements normalizing relations between these countries and Israel that were brokered by the Trump administration last year.

Jobs have come back to Springfield. The unemployment rate is pretty low — around 5 percent.
Unimpeded, oil and gas under tremendous pressure opened five separate gashes in the soft sandstone seabed. So much gas bubbled to the surface near Platform A that the water appeared to boiling. And oil from the underwater fissures began to form a slick that would eventually cover an area nearly the size of Chicago.
But it sort of felt the entire time like that's as far as I was going to get. And what I was really doing was spending most of my time writing scripts of movies that I dreamed of one day making. You know, I wanted in this movie hopefully to say something about that state of mind, you know, of being in a city like LA, the sort of dream factory city, living in your head a lot, living in your dreams a lot and having to reconcile those dreams with the sometimes not-so-pleasant realities of, you know, the life you're actually living.
Nobody would ever say, 'Every candidate thanked his spouse, including Hillary.' When you utter 'he,' you always bring a male to mind.
We are also aware of the effects of this process on the cast and crew members who work on our show, they added, and to avoid further disruption on set, we have decided to remove the role of 'Jamal' from the final two episodes of the season.
Bosworth says the Trump Twitter spotlight is shining the most on big companies with well-known household brands.
GATES: Yeah. No one's ever asked me that, but the answer's yes because I studied with a person who has been on your show, Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian playwright, when I went to the University of Cambridge. He was there in exile because he had been in prison and to be offering civil war for 27 months and was given a fellowship at the University of Cambridge. And I showed up from Yale, and he became my mentor. And so he introduced me to the Yoruba people. You know, we used to say tribe, but now that's not politically correct - so the Yoruba ethnic group in Western Nigeria. And I wanted to be from them. But when I started the series, it wasn't called Finding Your Roots. If you remember, it was called African-American Lives. I only did black people.
Mr. GREENE: Although I might just add one thing to that, I don't think it was by design but this notion of creating a black hole that could eat up Geneva and the rest of the world was perhaps the greatest PR ploy that one could ever have imagined for the Large Hadron Collider.

The measurements are dramatic proof that gravitational waves exist. The signal in the detector matches well with what's predicted by Einstein's original theory, according to Teukolsky, who was briefed on the results. It matches predictions of the ripples produced by two large black holes, in the final moments before they merge, swirling together at an enormous speed.
Much of the early criticism revolves around the scope of the plan, which backers say is big to match the challenge of the climate change problem.
Colorism is personal for both Abdi and Ali, who describe themselves as dark-skinned. Growing up, if somebody in my family was mad at me, they'd call me koor madow, which means, 'Hey darker-skinned,'  explains Ali. And it was an insult, she adds.
Our World in Data, an online publication based at Oxford University, also expects the number of people around the world with higher-education degrees to increase as advanced skills become more important in both developing and developed economies. The International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis projects that this number will reach 1 billion by 2030 and 3 billion by 2100, compared with 725 million in 2015.

Some cost information is already made available by insurers to their enrollees, particularly out-of-pocket costs for elective services, but most people don't consult it, he says.
Humans, too, seem to have sensitive periods, with language learning among the most studied. When learning a second language, for example, a child's age of exposure (up to puberty) predicts proficiency as an adult, even when total exposure is taken into account. Similarly, when it comes to music, musicians who are trained early, versus late, perform better on various tasks, even when their total musical experience is equated. For these domains, at least, we have evidence that early exposure is beneficial, and there are surely many more.

COLLINS: During the summer, there was a lot of optimism. You know, there was a big rally in the park, including city council members, about defunding the police. And what has happened is that the city council has been moving money out of the department. It's not happening super-fast. It's not a majority of the money, but they're moving it into services, not law enforcement, that they say prevent crime. And activists have claimed this movement of funds is a victory. At the same time, Mayor Jacob Frey has been announcing some departmental changes to the police force. Just this week, they announced that they're going to beef up investigations into officer misconduct, so that leads to the officers that we fire for misconduct losing their jobs permanently and not being put back on the police force.

Vice President Pence is between the Constitution and President Trump, Goldstein said. He finds himself in a situation where the president is articulating unfounded and unrealistic and simply wrong expectations of his role, and it's a very unforgiving president.
Baraniuk agrees their work will radically change camera design.

SOFIA: That's Atlantic science reporter Ed Yong, who, these days, is pretty busy.
This is what the numbers looked like in 2019: 86 different recordings received first-place nominations from 141 critics. Kris Davis landed in the top spot with a total of 260 points; she appeared on just a quarter of the ballots. A project needed only 105 points to earn a place in the top 10 (a minimum of 11 ballots), and a mere 33 points to place in the top 50 (a minimum of four ballots).
But neither side is seen as doing a very good job of it right now — 57 percent think the Trump administration is doing too little to work with Democrats in Congress; 55 percent think that Democrats are doing too little to work with the administration.

The Chicago Manual of Style provides nine different strategies for achieving gender-neutrality without having to resort to using they — change the subject to a plural, repeat the noun and so on. That can be prudent. Even when you know your sentence is fine as it is, you don't want to make some pedant's morning. But if I could have back all the time I've wasted writing my way around a perfectly grammatical singular they, I could have added another book or two to my name.
HIGGINS: Oh, believe you me - it's not easy.
After the deal's Thursday release, she also cast the plan as simply one of any number of environmental proposals the House might consider.
Off the coast of California, thousands of passengers were confined to the Grand Princess cruise ship near San Francisco after 21 people aboard tested positive for the virus.

3. Is the online U.S. census prepared for cybersecurity threats?
A sweep for either front-runner next week would make stopping Trump or Clinton not only daunting but mathematically infeasible. Even the chances of a second ballot at either convention would go from forbidding to remote.
MOORE: (As Laura Petrie) We got the wrong flowers.

Importantly, it's a nonbinding resolution, meaning that even if it were to pass (more on the challenges to that below), it wouldn't itself create any new programs. Instead, it would potentially affirm the sense of the House that these things should be done in the coming years.
Several top executives of a Brazilian iron mine company have stepped down temporarily after a government investigation into January's deadly dam collapse. About 300 people were killed.
Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., criticized the Trump administration Wednesday for what he called hypocrisy after the president's refusal to condemn Saudi Arabia after the journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in Riyadh's consulate in Turkey. Let me get this straight, Khanna wrote. The US is sanctioning Venezuela for their lack of democracy but not Saudi Arabia?

GARCIA-NAVARRO: So I want to take us back a little bit because the coverage of congressional Democrats - how they were perceived as presenting a strong and united front, how cool and steely House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was. You know, they seemed to be winning the day on this. But Trump said this in the Rose Garden on Friday.
Austin's E. 11th Street was once a business and entertainment corridor for the city's black residents. Back in the 1950s and 60s, nightclubs on the street hosted major music acts. Shops also served residents during the day.
We don't accept influence. ... The second we let corruption, greed and money get involved with this in the wrong sense, we lose track of where we're going, Kasky said.
WEN: This Title X gag rule isn't about providing good medical care. It only does one thing, which is to restrict patients' access to reproductive health care. It has no basis in medicine or science. And the only effect is going to be preventing 4 million Americans from receiving basic health care, including breast and cervical cancer screenings, affordable birth control and STI tests.
Hong Kong police have asked mainland officials where Lee is, but say they have yet to receive an answer. On Monday, C.Y. Leung, Hong Kong's pro-Beijing chief executive, insisted there was no evidence Lee had been abducted. But if Chinese agents were responsible, he said, it would be illegal and a violation of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
Republican state Sen. Jerry Sonnenberg, who represents the plains east of Denver, worries about the impact of a popular vote on rural America. He said it would lead candidates to only campaign in the largest media markets, like New York and Los Angeles.
Steckel said he was particularly concerned that public health insurance and other Sanders ideas would raise taxes for his children.
Sarmento hears that frustration from a lot of the locals he interacts with. Some, he says, have even stopped collaborating with him on projects.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: OK. So, Mara, last night, the president called into Judge Jeanine Pirro's show on Fox News. And we'll talk Russia elsewhere in the show. But he said about the shutdown that he was still thinking about declaring a national emergency. Is that still a plan?
Farmers are burning through the cash they stashed away during the good times, Kauffman says. Now, they're forced to borrow to pay for essentials like seed and fertilizer.

NGUYEN: Well, he's an advisor on this movie, which is certainly, you know, clearly alluding to Apocalypse Now. But it's really a compilation of all the movies that I'd scene about the Vietnam War because Apocalypse Now is actually a great movie, even though it traumatized me. And it's a problematic movie. But so many of the movies that were made about the Vietnam War were not that great. And The Hamlet is going to be one of these films. But his job on this film is to be the authenticity consultant.
SAGAL: Budweiser is going to be renamed America for most of the rest of the year. It makes sense because when you think of terrible tasting beer water, you think America.

Another study by the same researchers, Wijnand van Tilburg and Eric Igo at the University of Limerick, found boredom increases our feelings of nostalgia when we reflect on the past. They made participants bored (by copying passages about concrete mixtures) before asking them to think of a memory. The bored volunteers thought of memories that were more positive and nostalgic than their non-bored counterparts. In both of these studies, the researchers say they believe boredom causes us to search for meaning and that's why we have nostalgic memories and align more closely with our in-group.

Adding in even more coronavirus tests along the way to see if the vaccinated volunteers had picked up or were transmitting the virus would have delayed the initial results considerably, Corey says. And in the midst of the pandemic, speed was of the essence.
The EPA's policy, like those of other technical agencies within the government, is designed to encourage its scientists to participate in the scientific process.

GROSZ: I would love it if, like, at the convention, Trump gives a speech and then just stands up and holds a boombox over his head and playing In Your Eyes.

It's very hard to describe it after that except to say that we improvise together at the same time, in the same room. It's a kind of unique way of working for us. Most people do not work that way. Either somebody hands somebody a melody or - and - or somebody hands somebody a lyric. We - that never happens to us or almost never. And for the 26 or so years that we've been together, that's always been the way we work.
NGUYEN: Well, I knew that we were different as Vietnamese people really early. And, you know, soon after I came - we came to San Jose, Calif., - my parents had to open this grocery. And I walked on that street, and I saw a sign in a window that said another American business driven out by Vietnamese people. So that was my first sense that, somehow, we had arrived in a place that looked at us as different. And then not long after that, the VCR arrived on the scene. And I was about 10 years old. We got a VCR.
I think people already are troubled by some of the extreme rhetoric that we've seen in the presidential race. I think people already are troubled by the extreme gridlock in Washington. I think people already are concerned about excessive obstructionism that goes beyond principled disagreements, but becomes a systematic no to everything.
Although there is not yet any formal research on gendered language in jazz criticism, a 2014 study by Kieran Snyder that collects performance reviews of employees in the tech industry provides some parallels.

We have 12 years, according to science, if we're going to meet the challenge of the climate crisis. And to do that we have to tackle fossil fuels head-on. And the resolution just doesn't quite get us there, says Nicole Ghio, senior fossil fuel program manager at Friends of the Earth.
This action may well have brought our nation closer to another endless war, exactly the kind of endless war the president promised he would not drag us into, Schumer, D-N.Y., said.
That was the source of my anger as I watched it, because we were faulted as a government after 9/11 by the 9/11 Commission for a failure of imagination, not imagining how the terrorists might attack us. This required no imagination at all. This was just a failure.
One of the biggest questions around self-driving cars is about safety. In the blink of an eye would the vehicle, say, endanger the occupant to save another driver or pedestrian?

And not only the constants can change from one universe to another, the locations of particles relative to each other can also be different.

Trump faces an impeachment trial this month tied directly to his efforts to get Ukraine to launch an investigation into one of his potential 2020 rivals, former Vice President Joe Biden.
Tehran will try to prevent Biden from taking advantage of this leverage by creating an atmosphere of imminence and crisis. Even as Tehran reacted to the siege at the U.S. Capitol this week, President Rouhani repeated his call on Biden to lift sanctions, saying, If you won't fulfill your commitments, we won't bow to you. Tehran's efforts can be divided into three categories.
For his part, Biden has announced his own climate change agenda that stops short of endorsing the Green New Deal. It includes trillions of dollars in spending on green initiatives and calls for the elimination of greenhouse gas pollution by 2050.

Deb Haaland to lead the Department of the Interior. Haaland is a congressional co-sponsor of the Green New Deal.

People never like to hear that they're going to have to pay more taxes even if it replaces their insurance premiums. And of course the insurance industry is going to fight this like crazy...

Second, science fiction often revolves around the moral questions of technology. It can help the public understand potential problems before they become real. Take for example, a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR-Cas9. While it's not yet well-known outside the world of science, this inscrutably-acronymed technology allows researchers to cut and paste genetic code like lines in a word-processing document. Researchers are already looking ahead to how such gene-editing might be used in humans to eliminate disease.

And one of the young males in this - in Charm's pride - as they do it, this - they're - just before they're beginning to probably leave and go off and live their own lives, he was wandering around and thinking he was a bit of a - you know, bit invincible and ended up caught in a kind of a corral of hyenas and very quickly discovered that he was completely outnumbered.
We've spent a lot of money on housing and urban development over the last decades without a lot to show for it, Mulvaney said Wednesday. He added that Trump prefers to invest in cities' infrastructure and school choice.
Today, I hold a H-1B visa, which is a work visa, that will expire in 2015. My wife is from Brazil as well. She filed the same path as I. She has her own H-1B visa. We have a daughter now here in the United States. She is an American citizen. And we still don't have anything that's going to, you know, back us up. We put a lot of effort to be here, you know. We expend a lot of money. We're investing everything. We're investing in time for life here, getting degrees and trying to do the right thing. So we feel very injustice.
Precisely that, she told Peter. We also knew very well that should Raisi win, he would bring the same people that were of the (hard line) principalist camp, which would drive the country backward.

The owner of one small cellphone accessory shop on the ground floor sits at a desk, enjoying a cup of cardamom-laced Saudi coffee and some dates. The owner, who goes by the name Abu Saud, has three shops in this mall. He says he was a happy man, and business was good, until the Saudi government told him to replace his foreign workers. For years he hired mostly South Asians who are skilled at fixing cellphones.

RUWITCH: But to really get Xi's attention, some experts say, it would take something like coordinated sanctions on top Chinese officials and possibly even on Xi himself or a boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics, which China is hosting.

The shakeup is already under way. PG&E's CEO, Geisha Williams, abruptly resigned from her post and her board seat in mid-January. Another board member, Roger Kimmel, resigned a few days later.

PERALTA: Sarah Bireete of the Center for Constitutional Governance says young people in Uganda represent the largest part of the electorate, but they are left at the margins of society with few jobs or opportunities. She says that's the way it's been for decades. And so in the previous two elections, young people stayed home. But five years ago, Bobi Wine was elected to Parliament. He led a rebellion against the social media tax and against changing the constitution to allow President Museveni to run again. Both efforts failed but...

From the beginning, Barr echoed the president, aping his dishonest characterizations of the department's work and appearing to respond to President Trump's self-interested demands for investigations and prosecutions, Comey writes.
Conducting a breakout session during World Water Week in Stockholm last year, Akvo's Bjelkeman-Pettersson demonstrated the mobile-phone-enabled water-quality tests that their lab in Bengaluru uses. One kit contains a simple strip test, say for pH or phosphates. Another consists of a collection jar and a reactant chemical that can test for fluoride — a big problem in India and Bangladesh. There, too much fluoride in the drinking water has led to mass fluorosis, a condition that leads to calcification of ligaments.
But these two fields, though, do have some things in common. You can't really know about one without knowing about the other. So this hour, we're going to bring them together for you and get an update on what's happened at the frontiers of both fields.
Reversing many of those changes will be a big part of Biden's health agenda, in many cases coming even before trying to act on his own campaign pledges, such as creating a government-sponsored health plan as part of the ACA.
Biden has sidestepped questions about whether he supports doing away with keeping the 60-vote threshold, but several top Senate Democrats have signaled they back changing a rule that many of them once insisted was essential to the institution. There will be intense pressure on Biden and Democratic leaders to show they can pass some bills with GOP support, but if Senate Republicans stay largely unified to thwart the new administration's agenda, calls to eliminate the filibuster will increase.
The shift away from coal-fired electricity to natural gas power generation has helped the state achieve greenhouse gas reductions below its 2005 levels, according to the state's draft climate action plan.

I think the Congress has important interests to vindicate. I think he ought to be impeached. And ideally, he would be convicted by the Senate and barred from further office. I also think that the local prosecutors in New York should continue their work to hold him accountable for his life of being a garden-variety criminal before he became president. I'm just talking about not giving him the platform of a daily drama outside the federal courthouse in Washington, while Joe Biden is trying to change this country in a good way.

And in fact, some of the early scripts done by freelance writers, who didn't know what the possibilities were and were sure that on television you don't go for anything substantive, wrote, in essence, McHale's Navy in Korea. You know? And McHale's Navy on the ground. And it really scared me at that point. But by then we had already had an agreement because before I agreed to do the show, I had a midnight meeting with Larry Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, who were producing the show. And we all agreed that we wanted to do a show in which the war was seen for what it is, as a, you know, a place where people are badly hurt. And the humor came out of the reaction to that. The humor came out of the crazy pressure everybody was put under.
Precisely the history of U.S. intervention in Latin America is such that it always seems to engender a worse backlash than the original issue that mattered to American interests, he says.
So the old guys - I mean the old, wonderful, imaginative fellows historically have always had imagination and broken conventional thinking.

It would not have been conventional thinking on anyone's part for, you know - in fact there were people who after they'd heard I'd been cast in that role who were involved were surprised at the casting. But the...
What could that possibly look like now? Even as you nod to the positive effect of these charges, where do you begin that larger level of healing and reconciliation to try to address some of those huge issues?
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are going to try to heal a country both spiritually and literally, because so many of our fellow citizens are sick and dying. And I just think Donald Trump's craving for attention is something we don't want to accommodate now. We don't want him center of our lives. I'd rather him in his bathrobe yelling at cars on the lawn at Mar-a-Lago with the camera lights off. I think that's the best thing for the country now. But look, I'm not sure that I'm right.
So far, what he can say with certainty is that that maintaining the weight loss and exercise can successfully prevent the onset of the disease for more than a decade. In the follow-up study to the Diabetes Prevention Program, one-third of those at highest risk of the disease are still diabetes free.
Do judges and juries dole out harsher punishments when they're bored? This study suggests they may, but only for people different from themselves. In exchange for a drink, researchers asked a group of Irish people to consider one of two hypothetical cases: an Irishman beats up an Englishman or an Englishman beats up an Irishman. They made some of the participants bored (by making them trace spirals on a piece of paper) before asking them to play judge. They found the bored volunteers assigned longer jail sentences to the English villain and shorter sentences to the Irish one.

This 'little port' is a small church on a corner lot in a residential neighborhood. The exterior white paint is chipped, and a steeple rises above the gabled roof.

Seventy-seven percent of women in Nigeria use skin lighteners, more than anywhere else in the world, the World Health Organization reported in 2011. In 2004, nearly 40 percent of women surveyed in China, Malaysia, the Philippines and South Korea reported using use skin lighteners, and in India, 61 percent of the dermatological market is comprised of skin lightening products, according to the same WHO report.
GROSS: So the education reform movement that we've been discussing in Newark was initiated by then-Mayor Cory Booker who brought in Governor Chris Christie. And then Booker enlisted Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, to donate a hundred million dollars. And then the two politicians kind of moved on to other things. Cory Booker becomes a senator. And you say he hasn't really spoken about the Newark reform initiative since becoming a senator. I don't know if that's changed since you completed the book.

First of all, people's well-being, their health, their safety, their lives, are the most important thing for us. So we'll do our best to protect people's well-being in a sense at whatever cost. At the same time, people also need economic development. They have to have the economy grow and more normal social life. So we are also trying our best to restore normal economic and social activity.

Because you mentioned openness and transparency, I need to ask about Dr. Li Wenliang who, as you know very well was a doctor who sounded the alarm late last year about the coronavirus, was detained by the authorities and made to retract what he had said. This got even more attention after he himself died of the virus. Why was he detained and made to retract his statements?
Advocates for the environment have countered with op-eds in defense of the fund. Even comedian John Oliver jumped into the fray. In his Sunday night HBO show, Oliver offered a point-by-point rebuttal of numerous incorrect statements that Trump made about the fund, including the erroneous claim that the GCF, which is funded through voluntary contributions, would likely obligate the United States to commit potentially tens of billions of dollars.

Einstein predicted the existence of such ripples, known officially as gravitational waves, in 1916, as part of his general theory of relativity. General relativity re-imagines the gravitational pull between heavy objects like Earth and the sun as a warping of space and time. When very heavy objects such as black holes are involved, the theory predicts that gravitational waves will emerge and ripple across the entire universe.

When home prices began to fall, their initial reaction was to stick it out. They could have kept paying their mortgage.

And as Pete Buttigieg said - yesterday, he said the only true way to deliver on any of the progressive changes we care about is to be a nominee who actually gives a damn about the effect you're having from the top of the ticket on frontline Democrats. And what you hear from those frontline Democrats - incumbent Democrats in the House and Senate - are candidates who want to flip a Senate seat. They're worried that with Sanders on the top of the ticket, they could possibly lose the House and lose the chance to pick up the Senate seats in Colorado, Arizona, Maine or hang on to one in Michigan.

There are other threads, or cracks in the earth of her life, that she weaves in and out of these narratives, so that at times there is a sense that we are wandering away from the main question a chapter opened with. Owusu always brings us back just on time, so that what seems at first like free association is revealed, instead, as potent context. The effect ties directly into another of Owusu's main themes: Storytelling is how we understand ourselves, others, and the worlds we live in, and any story that is too simple or that holds no contradictions is suspect, for that means it lacks the nuance necessary for a deeper understanding. In her capable writing, stories become nearly tangible objects she holds to the light, turns over and over, eager to discover a never before glimpsed sparkle or a surprising divot in their familiar shapes.
The behavior here is just fascinating in all these groups. And gender roles are very clearly defined, and it's interesting how they vary among species. You know, in the episode on lions, we see a pride of lions in which a female has this enormous burden of both protecting and feeding her young over long distances and long periods of time. And the reason is that the male lions in the pride have just left. Is that typical? Is that natural behavior?

Democrats have fought back against block grant Medicaid proposals since the Reagan administration and most recently in 2018 as part of Republicans' failed effort to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act.

Yet he had to move forward. Holding the syringe upward, he pushed the plunger to make certain no air remained inside. He capped the needle. Tia watched intently, as if poised to catch any misstep.

Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana issued a joint statement Saturday claiming unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.
SASSE: I heard late last night that Mr. Humphreys had made this recommendation, and I have not been shy in my criticisms of Josh Hawley, either in public or in private. This was a terrible, terrible idea. The mechanism of how the Senate handles it next is something that we'll obviously need to talk about. But the most fundamental issue for any individual senator is their conscience to their oath of office to the Constitution and their relationship with the citizens of the state that they serve. So Missourians are the most important people in that conversation. But obviously, I think lots of deliberation needs to be had on the perverse incentives inside our Article I branch right now.
As a bear management specialist for Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, stationed in the rural, agriculture-rich Rocky Mountain Front, he gets calls all the time.
But in Etowah County, the News found the paper trail.
Newsom is taking over a state whose economy is the fifth largest in the world, and he has ambitions to match. California has the nation's highest rate of childhood poverty, which Newsom wants to address. He also wants to reform the health care system and provide government-subsidized child care.

BIANCULLI: Alan Alda in the pilot episode of M*A*S*H. When Terry Gross interviewed Alda in 1997, she asked him about that pilot.
UNIDENTIFIED WOMAN #2: Thank you for the opportunity to share my comment.
He's real, said Bobbie Clark, a Cruz supporter from Algona. There's something there. There's substance behind it. It's not just talk.
I think, by the time we're communicating with the media, it should be very well established – to the general public, I mean. So I think textbooks would be better than the most recent study. And if we're covering the most recent study, we should realize, these are ideas, these are prototypes.
MOMTAZ: You know, they found a kind of new normal, I guess. It doesn't mean that they don't constantly every day ask when is this going to stop, when is the siege going to end, when are we going to be free again? They spend their days waiting, and there doesn't seem to be much hope on the horizon. She asks constantly, you know, what do you think is going to happen? Do you have any news about this? And I have to tell her, well, you know, we - we're hearing what you're hearing, that there are talks and people are trying to solve the situation.
GROSS: But you start to fall in love, and at the end you must choose between God and Elvis.
Recognizing that, some workers — like the nurses at Mission Hospital — are forming new unions or thinking about organizing for the first time. Others, who already belong to a union, are taking more active leadership roles, voting to strike, launching public information campaigns and filing lawsuits against employers.
SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Hours after the deadly confrontation inside the Capitol, Trump supporters outside faced a line of police. That didn't discourage John (ph) who, like all the demonstrators we spoke to, refused to give his last name. After all, he'd made the trip from Connecticut to attend this protest at the president's own urging.
McConnell called for the Senate to support a GOP-drafted bill that includes expanded unemployment insurance, aid for small businesses and loans for large corporations, among other proposals.
The two days of Senate questions set the stage for a Friday vote on whether to allow witnesses.
McConnell needed a simple majority — 51 votes — to approve his resolution laying out how much time House impeachment managers and the president's defense team will get to make their arguments. The Republicans hold 53 seats in the Senate.
I was thinking about my kids ... Harris says. Like, are we still going to be doing this with my daughters? Telling them, you know: You can be ambitious but not too ambitious. Stay in your lane. Stay in your little box.
The Union County School District's interim superintendent, David Eubanks, says the phone wasn't locked with a passcode, and in a statement released Wednesday, he also questioned whether Arthur was where she should have been.
Bradley could care less about hunting. Her frustration is more about what she sees as a broken promise, and a feeling that she has no say in how bears are managed.

MONTAGNE: The goal, as we hear from that tape from KMOV TV in St. Louis, is higher pay for thousands of janitors in the city. Right now, janitors working for private companies make around $10 an hour.
GOMEZ: I loved it. Thank you so much. I appreciate it.
Perhaps the biggest change in the document released Thursday is that it leaves in place the Affordable Care Act taxes on wealthy individuals. It uses that money to reduce the number of people left without insurance coverage by the law's changes. This latest version adds $70 billion to a fund for states — bringing the total to $132 billion — to help support coverage of low-income people.
The administration is proposing cutting the EPA's budget by 31 percent, from $8.3 billion in fiscal year 2017 to $5.7 billion in fiscal year 2018. That's the largest cut among all Cabinet departments and major agencies.
With cases and deaths surging throughout the U.S., the people who are treating COVID-19 patients really want you to continue to wear a mask, keep your distance and wash your hands, even if you've been vaccinated, until the research on shedding has yielded some answers. Dr. Carlos del Rio of Emory University says he knows taking precautions can be taxing, but he urges us all to hang on and keep it up.
In fact, Mercer is typical of a new kind of mega-donor in politics these days, she says.
What he's found is a trend in the nutritional quality of grasses that grass-fed cattle (and young cattle destined for grain-heavy feedlots) are eating. Since the mid-90s, levels of crude protein in the plants, which cattle need to grow, have dropped by nearly 20 percent.
How many weeks of social isolation is enough? It is a life-or-death question. Every day that people stay indoors could save many lives, although people would also like to go out and restart the economy. Yesterday, the president leaned heavily on the side of the economy.
And Nakagawa says it's entirely possible that by the time the GCF is in need of its next cash infusion, it could find better favor from the U.S. Four years from now, another administration could decide to put the money in, she says.
As long as they mind their own business and stay out of my cows, I could really care less if they're here, she says. I enjoy having them here and I think most ranchers do.

According to Iran's Interior Ministry as reported by Press TV, Rouhani won about 57% of the vote with more than 23.5 million votes against his main challenger Ebrahim Raisi's 15.7 million. Rouhani appeared to have benefited from a large turnout that forced polls to stay open until midnight, NPR's Peter Kenyon reports. More than 40 million out of 56 million eligible voters cast their ballots.
KELLY: That's NPR's Diaa Hadid reporting from Lahore. Diaa, thank you.
Though it can't be determined if the change is due to fear of hospitals in the pandemic, health talk in the media or other factors (like spending more time at home), the study authors suggest medication adherence could be a big contributor to how long the ER visits were able to stay so low, as medications are able to maintain better control of symptoms over time.

It's a theme that predated Trump within the Republican Party and one that will probably plague American democracy long after Joe Biden is sworn in as president on Jan. 20.
Pence also told governors that a survey was being done to determine the supply of ventilators. Birx, the response coordinator, urged them to ensure that coronavirus test results are reported centrally so that supplies can be surged to the right areas.

Sounds delicious. Green-mold medicine didn't bother Claire, if it worked. She saw Emily's small and perfect hands folded upon her chest as Claire waited for the undertaker. Who had folded those delicate hands? Claire herself ? She couldn't remember doing it. Her own mother, who might have remembered, was dead now, too, so this was something else Claire would never know.
Meanwhile, there's little chance of a Green New Deal getting a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Usually people need to sign up for Part B within three months before or after turning 65 if they aren't getting job-based insurance, or when their job-based health insurance ends if they are older than 65, according to Medicare rules. Most people under 65 who receive Social Security disability benefits qualify for Part B after 24 months of benefits.

I mean when she fell down going into the car. I had an instinct it was gonna happen because I'd seen her at those events at other times, they're very grueling. You stand up for a long time and it tends to be humid. Anybody could get a little — and I knew she was weak, and I said, I bet she's gonna collapse. And she did. Biden will not be able to keep up with the pace that this man keeps. I mean, he's — I don't sleep much, and he doesn't sleep much, and man, he campaigns like a whirling dervish.
The two Republican Hill leaders were supportive of the blueprint but both signaled a long process lay ahead. I welcome the president's blueprint for next year's budget, which turns the page from the last eight years, House Speaker Paul Ryan, of Wisconsin, said in a statement, adding that he looked forward to reviewing this with the Appropriations Committee and our entire conference. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky, said he pleased to see an increased focus on our national security and veterans budgets, calling them positive steps in the right direction, according to the Washington Examiner. But McConnell added he looked forward to reviewing this and the full budget when it is released later this spring.
Some of the biggest contributors to the cause have been celebrities. Clooney and his wife, Amal, pledged $500,000, and Winfrey pledged to match that. Director Steven Spielberg and Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg also donated half a million dollars each.
Now that Jeb Bush has left the race, Rubio has become Trump's preferred punching bag. Rubio tried undermining Trump with insults, but that didn't work. Trump needled him about this on Tuesday night, helpfully pointing out that, hostility works for some people. It doesn't work for everybody, OK? 
It's not a simple solution and it doesn't happen very quickly, right? It's going to be two more years almost until we have another round of congressional elections. And so we have to sustain this analysis. We have to sustain this anger and indignation about what's happening. And we have to turn that into real political power. And to see members of Congress last night talking about using the Sedition Act against protesters as somehow the logical solution to this problem is a way of absolving their own responsibility for this mess.
BERNIE SANDERS: Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of these disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.
ORBACH: (As Jack Rosenthal) You know, you're not aware of what goes on in this world. I mean you sit up here with your four acres...
JONES: And I had a huge fight scene with Randy Quaid. But I was a giant insect that was guarding my pile of eggs, and he was coming to kill us. So we had a big knockdown drag-out in a cave. He came in there with weapons.
And to think if they would've gotten through the door that I could've shot one, reloaded and then shot another one if they're trying to do me harm really went against every bit of training I ever had, he says. So I did move to a semiautomatic firearm after that.
RICHEN: Yep, Esso gas stations. He eventually printed around 15,000 copies. And somebody actually got up at one of my screenings too and said, you know what? It's also important to remember that not everybody bought a copy. They would share a copy, so they would pass it to their neighbor, to their family member who was traveling, you know, who was about to take a road trip. And I think it was word of mouth. And the businesses had had them as well.
And I think that what we have a responsibility to do is show what another America looks like. OK. Let's take all of that political energy, all of that resource that would go into building a massive second medieval wall on our Southern border. And what if we actually took all that concrete and poured it into roads? What if we took all of that engineering and dedicated it to new energy? What if we took all of that but actually invested in something that will have payback and a return on our investment for the American people?
For May, Catton has put the $3,800 copay on a credit card. But, she says, her family can't afford to pay nearly $9,000 a year out-of-pocket for the foreseeable future.
But then my question is, are you the one who brought this to the president's attention?
Mint Mobile is an appealing cell phone carrier that ships you a prepaid SIM card to utilize with your cell phone. Mint Mobile's costs are very unique because you have to pay upfront. For instance, to purchase the $15 a month plan, you pay for 3 months in advance, they name it as wireless in bulk.
But some lawmakers are already balking.
China says neither a humanitarian crisis nor regime collapse are acceptable outcomes for North Korea. But Zhang Liangui, a veteran North Korea watcher at China's Central Party School in Beijing, says that at the end of the day, China cannot save North Korea from its fate.
The public radio debate, at least that which I have heard, is heated, but the arguments are also as thoughtful as you'd expect, coming from station employees who take their public service role seriously, and listeners who are seeking out trustworthy information sources.

I'm relieved that he didn't become governor earlier, Paul Saffo says, adding that Newsom's eight years watching political master Jerry Brown will give him a better sense of when to lead and when to follow. I suspect going into this governorship he's gonna understand that timing better than ever.
DAVIES: You know, there are a lot of heartbreaking scenes here. I mean, this will bring tears to viewers' eyes, and I think that's partly because, you know, we have so little contact with the natural world. I mean, my daughter weeps if her - one of her cats gets a mouse. And we see a - you know, real competition for food and space and territory and mates. And you know, particularly in the lions series, I mean, you know that there are droughts, and there are predators and all these things.
Tia and David left. After writing his notes, Stanton gave Claire an appraising glance. As attractive as she was, he wasn't in the mood for small talk or flirtation. He retrieved a back issue of the Journal of Biological Chemistry. Might as well use the empty hours between injections to catch up on his journal reading. He didn't want to leave the room for any length of time until he had a clear understanding of the outcome of the experiment.

If any House member is joined by a senator in objecting to any state's electoral vote tally, they can object and force a debate and votes. More than a dozen Republican senators and a large group of House GOP lawmakers had indicated they would register challenges to multiples states' results.

SASSE: But a big part of the problem with our polarized politics at this moment is that there's a massive demand for it. This isn't just a supply problem. We have a big chunk of voters. They're not a majority. But they're really loud, and they're growing. There is a large group that is hopped up on rage clicks, and they're demanding nonsense stunts like the objection to the Electoral College vote. So Senator Hawley was doing something that was a really dumb-ass, and I have been clear about that in public and in private since long before he announced that he was going to do this. This was a stunt. It was a terrible, terrible idea.
There's no question this is a hard-power budget, Mulvaney also said Wednesday. It is not a soft-power budget. This is a hard-power budget. And that was done intentionally.
Under Maduro's rule, Venezuela's economy has nose-dived, inflation has soared and basic foods and medical supplies have grown scarce. Millions of Venezuelans have fled the country, mostly to neighboring Colombia and Brazil as well as Ecuador, Peru and other Latin American countries.

The U.K. has also announced plans to merge its Department for International Development into its Foreign Office, a move that more than 100 charities say risks politicizing U.K. aid.

Cruz is in the No. 2 spot — only about 100 delegates behind Donald Trump. He has the strongest case to make that if the nominee is not going to be Trump, it should be him. Some establishment Republicans in the #nevertrump movement are coming around to the idea that as much as they dislike Cruz, he might be their only choice. Lindsey Graham, no fan of Cruz's, says it may be time to rally around the Texas senator. Still, Cruz has a total of ZERO endorsements from his fellow senators.
Well, first of all, I think you have to look at the circumstances of where we are with the rollout. It's the very beginning. And whenever you take an undertaking of a magnitude of trying to vaccinate essentially most of the country, there's always going to be a bump in the road or a hiccup that we see. That's not an excuse, we can't make excuses. But I think that's something to be expected.

Noyer credits the election of Macron with much of the change. The French president is quickly following through on his promise to transform the country.

Noyer says today France has the highest labor flexibility in continental Europe, and Paris is now an obvious destination.
This [fluoride] test on a mobile phone is of equivalent quality as an ion selector device used in the lab; the difference is this cheaper and portable, Bjelkeman-Pettersson says. The data is calibrated, interpreted and sent to the cloud with time stamps and GPS markers. The test can be extended to check chlorine, bacteria levels in the water, and, soon, arsenic — another big problem in the Indian subcontinent.

Now, if we compare the shape of the spike protein on this new coronavirus to that of, say, the original SARS virus from 2003, we see that it sticks to the ACE2 protein much more tightly, much more strongly. And that is likely to influence the course of an infection. So in very broad terms, the stronger the stick, the less virus you probably need to actually start an infection.

RUSSAKOFF: Yes. Cami Anderson, the superintendent, saw this plan as a way to expand charter schools and stabilize the school district at the same time. This is one of the great challenges of, you know, urban districts where charter schools are expanding rapidly - is, you know, that when children leave the school district and go to charters, the money goes with them, and the school district ends up under tremendous stress. The other huge thing that she did in this was that she created something called universal enrollment.

GOMEZ: Every state has what we call their own intestacy statutes. And those are the statutes that set forth how assets will pass when you pass away. Some states, you know, give a certain percentage to the spouse. Sometimes it depends on whether the children are minors or they're not minors. Families aren't - we're not all the same, right? Some families, you have kids from different marriages or from different unions. Some couples have been together for a very long time but aren't legally married. It is very possible that without a will your assets will pass how you would have wanted them to anyway. But, again, it's important to look and make sure.

Yeah, these are things that we're working on. We're working on concepts, on how do we break these cycles, not how do we continue them. So many people just are focused on, but if we change this, then it won't go on like it always has, but maybe we don't want it to go on like it always has. We have three to four times as many people in need of affordable housing as we can provide. The more we can move out the more others we can help. Success is not how many people we can put into public housing, it's how many we can get out of it.
SCHMITZ: Well. I've heard many complaints about Xi Jinping and Chinese rule during my reporting here this week. But what's interesting is that there were many protests scheduled yesterday and today countering Xi Jinping's visit. And in every single one of them, the turnout was less than expected. Yesterday, the student activist leader Joshua Wong called on people to protest Xi Jinping's visit, and only a few dozen people showed up.

We don't have enough nurses; we have people waiting far too long for operations.
While it is important to recognize that the military still wield significant power and that they are primarily to blame for the recent exodus of refugees in the wake of ARSA [Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army] attacks, the absence of Daw Suu's moral leadership on this critical issue is of great concern, says Richardson.
Now, if you remember - Jose Altuve hitting that dramatic series-winning homerun versus the Yankees last year in the playoffs. And as he headed for home plate, he grabbed his jersey, told his teammates not to rip it off. That's the popular celebration with game-winning hits. And the suspicion now is that he did that because if his shirt had been ripped off, it would've exposed one of these electronic wearables. Now, Altuve denies wearing anything illegal. Major League Baseball says there's no evidence of it. But, obviously, it's sent this story into the stratosphere. And people are wondering who's cheating, who's innocent.
There is a big catch in California — the state's upcoming presidential primary is still partially closed. That could cause confusion for independent Sanders supporters, who will have to specifically ask for a separate Democratic ballot.

On Sunday morning, Trump railed against Raffensperger on social media, retweeting baseless claims of election fraud and stating that Georgia's top election official was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions about alleged election problems in the state.
RONNIE MWANGE: This supposed to be a dining.
Meanwhile, scores of public school districts and charter schools closed for the day for lack of staff. According to an analysis by The Arizona Republic, more than 840,000 of 1.1 million students — or about 75 percent statewide — have been affected by the closures.
You will recall Mr. Cipollone suggesting that the House managers were concealing facts from this body. He said all the facts should come out, Schiff told senators. Well, there is a new fact which indicates that Mr. Cipollone was among those who are in the loop. Yet another reason why we ought to hear from witnesses.

Among the changes agreed to in the dayslong negotiation is an overhaul of the school's sexual assault policy, the creation of a food bank to serve students and the surrounding community and a review of policies allowing campus police officers to carry weapons, WAMU member station reporter Patrick Madden told NPR.
GATES: And they said, OK, we won't tell you. And so then they came in - this is a big deal back in 2008. And we filmed the whole thing. They had two geneticists. They had a medical doctor who specializes in sharing this information. They flew him in from San Francisco. And another person to interpret my genetic data because it's 6 billion base pairs, right? It's a lot of data to process. And I sat down. We started to roll. And the first thing they said was, you don't have any of the genes that's going to give you Alzheimer's.
Our State Of Disunion: Will Delaying Trump's Big Speech Help End The Shutdown Too?
Political analyst Roger Hartley says there's widespread frustration. With a lame duck mayor and at least a third of the City Council also set to change, he says it has left a vacuum.
Claire hadn't waited for her boss to telephone her. Immediately she arranged for Charlie to spend the rest of the day around the corner with the family of his best friend, Ben. Charlie was thrilled, especially because they simply left the clothes in a pile on his bed. Claire went to the office. When she arrived, she learned that Mr. Luce had ordered the week's issue remade, a tremendous expense because they'd already closed and were in production. Trying to get an overview, Mack Mahoney, the photo editor, had sent photographers around the city for shots of ordinary people and their reactions.
GATES: Otherwise they wouldn't be in a database. But I think that you should have to get permission before someone is creeping around in your DNA.
There Will Be Books: James Comey Sequel Signals New Wave Of Memoirs In Post-Trump Era
And the moment I came up with that idea and we sat there, I was like, What if she had a best friend that had died? Both me and Vicky were like, Oh no, that's a horrible story. And I was like, Yeah, I love it. I love it. Every time I'd say something and Vicky's face would scrunch up and go, No, that's horrible, I'd be like, Haha, brilliant, it's going in. And then that informed a lot of it. And just seeing things that I loved in my life and imagining if I wasn't lucky enough to have them — kind of sadomasochistic, really.
I think the world of Bob Mueller and I have worked with him and considered him a friend for a long time, but I think the way he handled the conclusion of his investigation allowed it to be distorted, lied about by the president and the attorney general. And the reason I say that is: Bob did the old-school thing. He prepared a very long report in single-spaced, 12 Times New Roman with, I think, thousands of footnotes and sent that over as his report. Well, that's not how Americans consume information. I don't know that they ever did, but they certainly don't today. And that allowed the attorney general to go to the keyboard and write pithy letters and offer snapshots in a statement at a press conference to the American people, which drove the entire narrative.

How Election Fraud Claims May Disenfranchise Black Voters
SASSE: Well, we're not very healthy right now. But I want us to be sure we focus on the fact that we're going to get healthy again. But obviously, Americans are angry right now, and our country's mourning. And particularly, I guess we should start by acknowledging the death of Officer Sicknick overnight and grieve with his family and obviously also with the families of the other four who've already died. The loss of life is gut-wrenching.
STABENOW: At this point, we don't know. You know, this is someone who makes national security decisions. This is someone who, you know, is extremely erratic, as we know, and making decisions that are based on emotion and what he views as vindicating himself, you know, for all his - the grievances against him. And so we don't know. We don't know. And so - and I do believe that we don't need all the cabinet leaving right now. What we need are people that are going to stay and provide some guardrails around him because I don't think he has any personal limits on what he might do. So there have to be people around him that provide that.

As we hit the one year mark since the first U.S. state (California) issued a stay-at-home order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we put out a call to see if any of you would take us to your secret escape spot and record audio there. And you astounded us with what you brought in. In this soundrich, kaleidoscopic episode, we journey around the planet and then, quite literally, beyond it. Listen only if you want a boatload of fresh air, fields of wildflowers, stars, birds, frogs, and a riveting tale involving Isaac Newton and a calm beyond any calm you knew could exist. This episode was produced by Matt Kielty and Lulu Miller, with production support from Jonny Moens and Suzie Lechtenberg.

That — and the fear of stoking the Islamophobia that persists in the world today. Many women are worried that speaking out will give the public a reason to further blame Muslims, says Daisy Khan, the executive director of the Women's Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality. The tendency is to keep it under wraps.
But I think that Donald Trump's rhetoric and some of his actions - for instance, after Charlottesville - encourage unfavorable race relations in the United States. And I think that that's sad. And I don't think that he understands how much power that - to heal, to bind that the Oval Office metaphorically has. Barack Obama understood that and, I think, certainly helped our nation to heal.
Jean Ho is a writer in Los Angeles. She is currently a doctoral candidate in USC's Creative Writing and Literature Ph.D. program.
The United States' total global trade deficit of $734 billion matters more than the U.S. trade deficit with Germany (or China or Mexico or whatever other country Trump may be tweeting about on any given day). And that might sound bad — it sounds like the U.S. is consistently sending all of its money out into the world and getting no money back.
Other Slupsk residents I spoke to worried that the base will make them ground zero for any Russian retaliation, fears that were exacerbated by a Russian military jet conducting a barrel roll last month over a U.S. Air Force plane that was flying a reconnaissance mission above the Baltic Sea.
HOYER: Well, I think that that is going to depend upon what the language in the bill is as to how the money can be used. Again, I haven't seen it. I don't know that there's going to be 2 billion. I don't know that there's going to be barriers in there. I presumed because a conference is a compromise, and the president and the Senate members of the conference committee wanted some barrier.
Come Monday, though, two new items on Sonic's menu will make that leap. They're blended beef-mushroom burgers, a food that the institute has boosted through its menus of change initiative. According to the institute, this is the kind of menu change that's a powerful, and previously underappreciated, way to drive improvements in our health and our planet.
And by all accounts, it triggered what I have described - I mean, it's my language, not his - but what I've described as something of a conversion experience, because prior to 2001, in the very few public statements Cardinal Ratzinger had made about this crisis, he came off to be frank, as just another Roman cardinal in denial. But after 2001, when he actually had to sit down and read all the case files for every Catholic priest, everyone in the world who had credibly been accused of sexual abuse, he began to talk much more openly about what he described as filth in the Catholic Church and became much more aggressive about prosecuting abusers. And that has followed into his - flowed, rather, into his papacy, where we see him as the first pope to embrace a zero-tolerance policy on sex abuse, the first pope to meet with victims, the first pope to, in effect, break the Vatican's wall of silence on this issue.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: So, Mara, this brings up the issue of tensions inside the Democratic Party. Sanders himself has said he's running against the Democratic establishment. How are these tensions kind of playing out in real time?

Blood poisoning. Emily had died of blood poisoning. In one gliding motion, a stately, straight-backed nurse took the chart from Claire's hand and reattached it to the end of the bed. Chief Nurse Brockett, her identification badge read. Beneath her regulation cap, her steel gray hair was pulled into a bun.

And ultimately, the - every film is uplifting. It has the kind of uplifting and - not that we engineer that. It's just - I think it reflects the fact that these animals have within them this sort of unquenchable fire to survive and - doesn't matter what Mother Nature and what rivals and competitors throw at them. They will never give up. I think the little extra twist is the impact of humanity just tipping the balance a little bit too far against them. I think that's - and I don't - we don't answer that question, but I think that is something that will be in people's minds.
GARCIA-NAVARRO: That's almost two weeks. That's a long time. We wish you the best.

But while the U.S. has few economic ties with North Korea to cut, China has plenty of screws to tighten. And so whether international sanctions work or fail may depend to a large degree on how strictly China implements them.

Kaine's endorsement came shortly after a poll by the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University showed Biden gaining 22% of likely voters in the Democratic primary. That's four points higher than Biden scored in a Feb. 18 poll conducted by Monmouth University. Sanders declined in support to 17%, but is still close behind. Bloomberg, meanwhile, slid to 13%; he and Sanders had previously been tied in first place.
Saudi Arabia needs to be part of that change, he adds, as the country has little time to waste.
The group, the Green New Deal Network, plans to invest in partner organizations in 20 key states to mobilize grassroots power to pressure elected officials to support their goals; introduce Green New Deal-related legislation at the state and local level, spearhead federal legislation that would implement parts of the Green New Deal agenda, and to pressure the incoming Biden administration to enact a series of executive actions related to climate, jobs and justice.
COLLINS: The protests have changed. They are more focused, and the folks who are coming out to protests are experienced. And they know how to deal with police, and they know kind of what their demands might be in. And it is a younger constituency than you would see in protests, say, two years ago. So George Floyd was killed on May 25, and there were protests, you know, in Minneapolis and St. Paul. The protests started out very peaceful, you know, as marches. It was signs. It was the stuff that you typically see during these protests. And when they were met with force by law enforcement, activists would say they escalated. And what ended up happening is that the protests turned into riots, looting and arsons in some case. What did come out of it was that George Floyd Square, which is 38th and Chicago in Minneapolis, has been occupied by protesters since May. And the city doesn't seem to really have a plan to reopen it. So that's a tactic that they've used, is creating this sort of de facto autonomous zone, and that's something that we've seen in Seattle and other places, too.
Unfortunately, this still leaves us with an untested psychological hypothesis: that assuming one is wrong can change community norms for the better, and ultimately support better science (and even, perhaps, better judgments and decisions in everyday life).
And I know he didn't do it. And people come to me and they oversold it. They oversold it as almost as if the Ukrainians are going to have done the collusion, substituted for the Russian collusion. You can't. But they didn't oversell it in terms of, there was a substantial amount of illegal activity that involves Hillary Clinton, the Democratic National Committee, members of it, the ambassador, the embassy in collecting specifically dirt, described as dirt, from Ukrainians. And the irony of that is they're investigating Trump for dealing with Russia to get dirt, which proved not to be so. And they did exactly that in Ukraine, and now I think it's almost proven beyond a doubt that they did that. Question is, how much of it did they do?
Throughout the book, you talk about this reservoir of trust that's necessary for the Justice Department to function. In what way do you believe former Attorney General Bill Barr eroded this trust you speak of when the Mueller report was released?

I think that the less the president does over the next 12 days, the better. Mike Pence fulfilled his obligations on Wednesday while blood was being shed at the people's Capitol. The president was actively rage-tweeting against his vice president because the vice president was fulfilling his oath of office to the Constitution to affirm the fact that Joe Biden won. ... We were in the Senate chamber and the Secret Service had to rush in and grab the vice president from the dais and rush him out of the room and the president of the United States was rage tweeting against him at the same time.
Having it done pretty quickly could be an overstatement. Republicans are going to need 60 votes, which now means the support of nine Democrats or independents after Democrat Doug Jones was sworn in Wednesday.
As the GOP promised, not a single Republican voted for either health care measure before the chamber. This is truly a remarkable moment in the life of this nation. Some say we're making history.

The Georgia code says that anybody who solicits, requests or commands or otherwise attempts to encourage somebody to commit election fraud is guilty of solicitation of election fraud, Kreis said.  'Soliciting or requesting' is the key language. The president asked, in no uncertain terms, the secretary of state to invent votes, to create votes that were not there. Not only did he ask for that in terms of just overturning the specific margin that Joe Biden won by, but then said we needed one additional vote to secure victory in Georgia.

The area's diversity is projected to grow. Between 2010 and 2015, the overall population of Memphis grew 2.2 percent, while the immigrant population increased 2.7 percent. The trend mirrors one the entire country is experiencing, with U.S. foreign-born population reaching its highest level since 1910 (13.7 percent in 2017, up from 13.5 percent in 2016), according to U.S. Census data.
Under the consent decree, there are many more changes in store. For example, the Department must produce a monthly report about use of force incidents; it bans police from using Tasers on people who are simply running away. The agreement also expands mental health services for police, including a initiative for suicide prevention — a big concern recently after a rash of police suicides.

But court actions also might help the Biden administration short-circuit the onerous regulatory process. If a regulation the new administration wants to rewrite or repeal has already been blocked by a court, Biden officials can simply choose not to appeal that ruling. That's what Trump did in ending insurance company subsidies for enrollees with low incomes in 2017.

With less than a dozen days left in power, the Trump administration on Friday approved a radically different Medicaid financing system in Tennessee. With this move, the federal government is for the first time granting a state broader authority in the operation of its health insurance program for the poor without interference from Washington, allowing Tennessee to make decisions on such issues as whether to add new benefits or eligibility categories or spend Medicaid dollars outside of health care, if it thinks that would help enrollees.

Rather than attending the annual dinner — where the president traditionally is the opening act for a well-known Hollywood comedian and is also the butt of many of the event's jokes — Trump opted to take a short trip from Washington to Pennsylvania where he visited a tool manufacturing company in Harrisburg and signed two executive orders focused on trade. One of the orders directed the Commerce Department and the U.S. trade representative to conduct a review of existing U.S. international trade and investment agreements and another created a new White House Office of Trade and Manufacturing to be led by Trump adviser Peter Navarro. Then Trump held a rally in in the Pennsylvania city and gave a nearly hourlong stump speech.

HALIHAN: There are still some people that the pattern for this type of activity is not a really clean one. It's not, hey, there's an injection well, and you made an earthquake right next to it. It's that there's an injection well, and miles away, there's an earthquake. And so the pattern isn't really simple. And in Okla., if you're miles away from an injection well, you're close to another injection well. And so figuring out what caused it and where - that pattern isn't simple. It's really difficult to say, yes, we're really, really certain about this and that. But what you can check is when the rates have been lowered or wells have been shut in, seismicity has dropped, so that's a pretty good indicator that there's that nice connection where you see that those changes and injection have resulted in less seismicity in some areas.

Democrats have groused among themselves about the causes of the losses in 2020. One complaint has been that the party's failure to repudiate issues said to be perceived by voters as extreme, such as defund the police, hurt it with the moderate voters it sought amid the broader presidential election.
McConnell set up yet another procedural vote to move forward on the legislation. Two previous attempts failed to advance the bill – one on Sunday and again Monday when Democrats largely held together to try to force more changes to the bill. If there is an agreement the Senate could vote earlier.

In the opening episode of season 1, you walk into a coffee shop - Ron's Coffee shop - and you start talking to the owner of the shop. Let's listen to that scene.
The racially diverse crowd was made up of supporters from teenagers with their parents in tow to college students to grandparents.

He quickly shifted to the new platform, and describes himself as an avid poster.
Rosalind Thompson Courtesy of Rosalind Thompson Spent 40 years as a Human Resource executive in some really big companies. Never felt super good about it--always chasing the all mighty dollar at the expensive of people. At age 63, my daughter encouraged me to apply to the charter school network where she taught. She was in love with this revolution in education. Not having a clue what I could do for them, I did send my resume and was hired right away. Almost 4 years later I have had 4 different jobs with them, moved 3 times and love everyday.
Dr. BASS: Individual males build a territory, if you will, under a rock shelter. And from that rocky shelter, they produce that hum advertisement call to attract females to their nest.
There is an upside. If we are actually able to adhere to strict protocols, we'd be rewarded with more than personal protection, Squires says. A virus mutates when its RNA is incorrectly copied in a host. So when there is less virus circulating, there is less opportunity for those mistakes — making it less likely to mutate further.

So he was - like, on your way to work - and in these days in the '80s, you have to remember that black radio was very consolidated. So a black station in the '80s and '90s, before the, you know, corporate split of the genres of music - you would get R&B and upbeat '70s black music during the day. You would get current pop hits - black pop hits in the middle of the day. And then at night was rap, so all black people listened to the same black station at a different time of day to hear their favorite genre of music. So no matter your age, you knew who my father was.
Well, you know what? That's exactly what I've done. And so there's no contradiction between what I'm doing and what Joe Biden suggested a president in my circumstances should do.

Science fiction plays an important role in two ways. First, most people are not familiar with the latest findings on antimatter, but they do know Star Trek. So if I can use Mr. Spock to introduce the concept, then I'm giving our readers and listeners something to grab on to: a little piece of the familiar in a story that is otherwise abstruse. (In fact, new research on antimatter was the one case in recent memory where I indulged in the cliché.)

As more lawmakers test positive for the virus and even more self-quarantine because of possible exposure, Congress itself is racing a clock to pass a bill and likely recess for at least a few weeks. While some lawmakers continue to call for allowing remote voting in the House and Senate, both Pelosi and McConnell remain resistant to the idea, which has never been done before, would require votes to change the rules of both chambers and could face constitutional challenges.

N. SHAHIN: I'm hoping so. I'd hope to see the pendulum swing back the other way. I know my parents have always said, if you want to be a teacher, go work in industry for 20 years first and save up some money before you do it. And if things keep going the way they're going now, that's how it's going to be. And I'd like to, you know, as my father said, help the generations going forward.
March 26 - we admitted someone to the intensive care unit today who wasn't going to survive. But we had an intensive care unit bed - and getting them up there just offers the family together for the necessary things that go into grieving. But in the United States today, because this is a pandemic, hospitals are limiting one visitor at a time per day. And so the COVID patients in the United States, which are dying at a rapider rate right now than anywhere else in the world, are dying alone. And I can tell you that, as a physician, some of the most rewarding moments I've had in my career are not necessarily the great save that I brought people back from the edge of death but when I helped people, when it was inevitable, to make that final journey with their families and loved ones around them. And the fact that that kind of grieving can't go on at the moment is even more tragic for patients, for families, for the nurses, for the doctors and those that care for them. Unfortunately, it's not over. We're still going up. And so I'm still going back to work tomorrow.

QUINONES: I suspect they may. I think it's more of a - kind of a bellwether of where this issue is going because when you talk about how we got into this, really Purdue Pharma is the company that led the way. Their promotions and their sales and their aggressive marketing really led the way into all this. And so people are now looking to say, well, look. We are turning away from that. We have learned our lesson. We want to be part of the solution - I think as they said in that statement that you read. I'm not sure how much effect it will actually have. And I think time will tell that this is a problem that is not going away. It's very deeply rooted now in American culture. And will this change in marketing and promotion mean much after the company's gone to such lengths to root this in America? I don't know. I guess we'll see.
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is among the most famous members of Congress. And for now, among the less-influential, a freshman in a house where seniority counts. Her status is reflected in her new office, down a distant corridor of an office building on Capitol Hill.

And we think that OSTP really is where there should be much more of this planning going on. They coordinate national science efforts, and we would hope to see more of that, or to have seen more of that. The second point I would make - and it's very important - is there's a de facto inability to get out if there's no money to go out and study what's going on out there. And the federal government has made very, very little money available for independent research to do studies of the oil plumes.

The amount raised is nowhere near what was projected when a Republican-led Congress officially opened the coastal plain to drilling in 2017 as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The bill ordered two lease sales, the first by the end of this year, with the revenue aimed at offsetting massive tax cuts.
FLATOW: Well, and it also looked to me as a journalist and as someone who'd deal with the public, it goes back to the question you were saying before. Whatever you say just spell its name right.

And they begin to talk about it and there can't be anything wrong with people talking about science.
Since he's now legally an adult, Lindenberger's mother cannot stop him from getting the vaccinations. For minors who want to get their shots, it can be trickier, since there are no federal laws regulating the issue. Instead, a minor's ability to get vaccinated varies depending on state laws. In many cases, 18 is the requirement to get medical procedures without a parent's consent.
But I think we broke new ground. And that was helped by my insistence on wearing pants, you know, jeans and capri pants at the time because I said, I've seen all the other actresses, and they're always running the vacuum in these little flowered frocks with high heels on. And I don't do that, and I don't know any of my friends who do that, so why don't we try to make this real? And I'll dress on the show the way I do in real life.

When the league started [in 1997], you had players who were professionals overseas, Voepel says. But you didn't have coaches who were used to coaching professionally. A lot of the coaches they got came out of the college ranks or the NBA. NBA players, not coaches. Honestly, you had a hodge podge of coaches [in the WNBA] and some of them weren't very good. They weren't as good at coaching as their players were at playing.

In her home in Scotland, before B.1.1.7, people were advised to work from home if they could while schools, colleges and cafes remained open. Even with social distancing, wearing masks and hand-washing — these were insufficient to quell this variant, she says. Now we have a hard lockdown with all nonessential retail closed and schools closed — and we're still at risk of a collapse of the NHS [the country's publicly funded health care system] because of the crush of patients.

Yes, sir. She looked as if she doubted it herself. Afterward, she went into the hall, where the light was brighter, to read it. Claire took a shot looking through the darkened doorframe, the hospital bed a shadowy presence on the left, Nurse Brockett in full light in the hall beyond as she read the thermometer. It was a design that reminded Claire of Dutch paintings: women glimpsed through doorways. Claire was risking handheld long exposures because she didn't think Dr. Stanton would take well to flashbulbs going off near his patient or to the maneuvering of the tripod.

As Prasertong points out, It's not a strict scientific study. One limitation of this experiment is that the customers who came to the stall were all in a higher-than-average income bracket. Prasertong says that may be one reason why the vast majority of customers of color – African-Americans, Latinos and Asians – declined to sign up to receive the redistributed money made from charging whites the higher price.

And the way that I think about it is that I have to insist all the time that I am not an immigrant and that I - the story that I'm telling in my novel is not an immigrant story. I'm a refugee and the story I'm telling is a war story because one of the ways that the United States tries to contain the meaning of these histories is to think that all of these Asians are here because they're immigrants, and that their story begins once they get to the United States. But again, my understanding is that many of these Asians are here because of the consequences of wars. And many immigrant stories and refugee stories need to be understood as war stories.
Safehouse, a Philadelphia nonprofit, had been trying for years to open the first such facility in that city.

The uncertain timeline of the coronavirus outbreaks, however, could further complicate the constitutionally mandated head count of every U.S. resident. Major disruptions could derail the Census Bureau from gathering accurate numbers used to determine how many congressional seats and Electoral College votes each state gets for the next 10 years.

So there was a significant population of Vietnamese people who were in California. And they migrated to different cities.

One of the most shocking parts of Wednesday's pro-Trump mob attack on the U.S. Capitol was just how quickly it all unfolded. We examine the historic, and troubling day.
Marius-Lucian Obreja, who heads the Romanian Senate's Defense, National Security and Public Order Committee, says Russian actions are destabilizing Ukraine. And Russia's annexation of the Crimean Peninsula, some 300 miles off Romanian shores, caught us off guard and leaves us in huge need of help from a military power.

Though other communities across the country are tracking slower doubling rates than New York, these are still a cause for concern.
CORNISH: I spoke with Damien Chazelle back in December. I asked him whether he'd ever had that moment himself and thought he should change his dreams and grow up.
Over the years, there must have been times when Capitol Hill leaders wished they could lift that powerful device deftly from the hands of the president and put it on a shelf. But even those speakers of the House most at loggerheads with a president have felt they had to issue the routine invitation and sit there and take it. To do otherwise would have been unthinkable.
LANGFITT: Well, there were thousands of people in Parliament Square, people wearing Union Jack flags as capes. There were fireworks, lots of smoke. Then a totally different kind of scene in other parts of the city, where a lot of people wanted to remain in the EU. There was candlelight vigils. It felt almost funereal.

It's important to remember that President Trump inherited an economy that was already making steady progress towards full employment, said economist Elise Gould of the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. Today's numbers of 235,000 are very much in line with what we saw in January — 238,000 jobs added — or what we saw in February of last year — 237,000 jobs.

OCASIO-CORTEZ: Absolutely. And I think that that is an important distinction to make because when they were advancing that cause, they had no evidence to say that these things were going to happen. But we actually do have the evidence. For every $1 invested in infrastructure, we get $6 back.

The voter-approved amendment, known as the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, required that voters, not lawmakers, have the final say on tax increases, and it capped tax revenue, Jenny Brundin of Colorado Public Radio explained in 2016. Anything the state raised over that cap — typically in boom years — would be refunded to taxpayers.

And Mercer's wealth has allowed him to make his voice heard politically. While some of the beneficiaries of his largesse, such as the Heritage Foundation, are well within the conservative mainstream, others are decidedly unorthodox.
I believe that it would be one of the great corrupt events in American history if this case is not investigated, about crime at the highest levels of two governments. Where our government was a part of what we decry in Ukraine. Corruption. And we made millions from it. And I think it would be a real crime not to investigate the Biden family that's been involved in corruption for over 20 years. The same situation that happened in Ukraine, happened in Iraq. The same situation that happened in Ukraine and Iraq happened in China. Every place Joe Biden was point man, the Biden family made millions. There's something very wrong with that. And there's something very wrong with someone getting away with it, because they can sell to a very biased press that this is being done to persecute them because they're running for president. If you have sold your office over two decades, just because you're running for president of the United States doesn't mean you shouldn't be treated like you and me. He did it in Iraq. He did it in Ukraine. He did it in China. In China he took his son with him. He failed in his mission for the United States to back China off from the islands that were being contested by Japan. All over the newspaper that he was a failure. And the son was a great success.

Zack Cooper, an associate professor of public health and economics at Yale, doubts that the data alone will make much of a difference for most consumers.
The meeting next week with China will be a very difficult one in that we can no longer have massive trade deficits ... and job losses, the president wrote across two tweets. Trump continued, American companies must be prepared to look at other alternatives.

You're saying that's why he was made to retract what he had said, because people didn't understand what he was revealing?
There should be ubiquitous testing so we know who has the virus and who doesn't have the virus before we send people back to work. We should know that our hospitals have the capacity to treat patients, have the staff, the gear, the equipment to treat the patients before we risk a new surge in cases. So again, I think rather than focusing on the date, there's, like, a series of tasks to be done. Those tasks need to be done. The Trump administration has failed to do those tasks already, but I think we should put those tasks back front and center in the conversation the president wants to have.
I think it is a good idea to send out as much vaccine as possible — as long as there is an indication that the manufacturers will be able to supply more, she says. [If] that supply becomes jeopardized, it would absolutely be a reasonable strategy to go back to the strategy of reserving some vaccine for that second dose.
GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Let's get back to the interview FRESH AIR's Dave Davies recorded with Michael Gunton, the executive producer of the BBC series Dynasties.

YONG: So if we look at the structure of the virus, we see certain clues about why it's behaving in such an extreme way. So like all coronaviruses, this one is basically a ball with some spikes sticking out of it. Those spikes are what the virus uses to launch an infection. They bind to a protein called ACE2, which sits on the surface of our cells. And this binding, like a key fitting into a lock, is the first stage of any infection.
Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health — who advises both the Trump administration and the incoming Biden administration on the federal COVID-19 response — tells NPR there's no plan to abandon the two-shot regimen.
GOMEZ: What I would say to that - if that is what's - the need that somebody has either because of, you know, right now movement restrictions or it being cost prohibitive, that you make sure that you're working with a reputable provider that has done their homework, that has done their due diligence and that you feel understands your state-specific issues.
As NPR has reported, the rules, put in place in 2015, banned cable and telecom companies from blocking or slowing down any websites or apps. They also prohibited broadband providers from striking special deals that would give some websites or apps 'priority' over others.
I'm well known in Ukraine. I'd have 500 reporters following me around. I couldn't do any investigation. So I sent them specifically to find prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, former prosecutor general Viktor Shokin, who I always have considered the chief witness, and to find the present prosecutor general then, the prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko. And also two other witnesses, the assistant to Shokin, a gentleman named Konstantin Kulik and the head of the special prosecutor's office, a man named Nazar Kholodnysky. Very hard names to pronounce. But once you get used to it it's a little easier. And over a course of about a month, they found two of them for me. And they went to Ukraine on their own. They found them. They called me up. I talked to either their relatives or friends on the phone. Mr. Prosecutor-General Lutsenko would have no trouble coming here because he was a government official and he said he was coming to visit his son anyway in late January and he'd visit with me. And Shokin wanted to come. Shokin went to apply for a visa. He was turned down. I tried to help him with a visa. I was told, you can't get involved with a visa. Then I was told by other sources from Ukraine that it's well-known that Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch has over the last year been turning down visas for anyone who has information about what happened during the 2016 collusion because her embassy was involved in it. That proved to be true.

Think you've seen that before? Nope, you haven't, says Valli, who's been teaching a special class for the past four years on lowering the glycemic index of gelato. Because of that darned range, sugars have always had to be replaced, usually with substitutes such as stevia or sugar alcohols. That doesn't necessarily lead to bad gelato, but most folks agree there's room for improvement. For instance, consuming sugar alcohols can lead to bloating and diarrhea.

ERIC GARCETTI: Hi - great to be with you, Lulu.
BALDONADO: Well, speaking of the Catholic Church's influence, the parents in the story - Connor's parents - are kind of in the process of ending their marriage. They wish they could divorce but historically, I guess, at this time period divorce wasn't legal in Ireland, in the 1980s, is that right?

On today's show, we talk to Gordon. His argument has profound implications for everything from how the next generation will live to whether robots really are about to take our jobs.
SAGAL: Speaking of which, one of the things that makes our job challenging is just when we figure out what we're going to talk about on our show something else happens and we have to change everything. And then it happens again. So we have just written today's script, well, Mad Libs style. And we're just going to fill in the blank as the news happens. So as of show time, this is what we've got - Donald Trump verbed (ph) an under-age noun while riding a domesticated noun, a scene onlookers described as adjective and unbelievably adjective. Many nouns are now calling for him to be im-verbed (ph).

And then we were able to get a - because that's also the location where we filmed the whole story of the painted wolves, we are actually able to get a specific closing to that - to the painted wolves film with him in the absolute signature David Attenborough thing, which is David Attenborough standing next to the animals, delivering his great lines and then turning to the animals. And we were able to do that with the painted wolves. And it was an amazing experience to do it because I've worked with him for 30-odd years and done many of those things. And I wasn't sure I - that would happen again. And to be able to do it one more time was amazing.
All at once Claire liked him, his dry humor, his hidden shyness. Retrieving his binder, he sat at the desk in the corner and began writing, his legs stretched out and crossed at the ankles.

Forgotten for the moment was the business at hand. But to its eternal credit, the Congress returned to that same chamber later that night. It resumed the counting of votes from the Electoral College, votes cast on Dec. 14 in 50 state capitals and in the District of Columbia. Votes certified by every governor in America. Votes upheld in more than 60 cases in state and federal court.

Lee was the fifth person in the city connected to the publication of sensational books on top Chinese leaders to disappear since October, prompting speculation among democratic activists that Chinese security agents may have detained them.
YOUNG: Executive orders, regulatory actions that were unconstitutional and, very frankly, that we had to do it because otherwise they could undo it. And it could have been done again by another president in the future. So I think that site is very productive. And you look at the stock market where it was before, where it is now. And general attitude, regardless of what you in the media may think, the general attitude in the public's arena think that this country is on the road back to greatness again.

He considers himself a conservative, but he's also a member of the No Labels group, which is trying to work toward bipartisan solutions to big political issues. And we asked him about whether immigration reform is going to get through the House anytime soon, if it's even going to be taken up. And this is what he had to say.

On Policing In Baltimore, Activist DeRay Mckesson Gets Retweets. Can He Get Votes?
Named for the sweeping proposal for cutting U.S. contributions to climate change over the next decade, the coalition has already raised more than $20 million, organizers say.
The scene that unfolded at the Capitol on Wednesday was the culmination of months of efforts by Trump and his allies, publicly and privately, to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Some of those efforts were based on unproven claims of fraudulent vote counts, while others were founded on baseless conspiracy theories.
What we've seen in sports over the last couple of years now is to paint the players as unpatriotic, he says. Instead of thinking about their reasoning — which is police misconduct and about supporting some of the people who don't have a lot of power in our country — it's been directed toward the flag as if the players don't care about their country when actually, they do.
NGUYEN: You know, it's a hierarchal feudal society. The Vietnamese were already exploting each other. And then that was exacerbated by colonialism and American occupation - or intervention - however you want to describe it. And so it was ironic and not ironic that when they came to the United States, they would do the exact same thing to each other because in Vietnam during the war years, you know, in order to survive in Vietnam, you had to exploit each other.
RICHEN: Before I saw it, I had - you know, definitely had kept up with the sort of criticism it was getting around - of course it's winning a lot of awards, but the criticism it was getting from the family of Dr. Shirley - that this was, you know, a story told by the white driver's perspective. And that's certainly the case. It's not really - it's definitely through a certain lens. That's the white driver's lens. But in terms of the Green Book - the thing that I found frustrating is that it only shows places that they go to, you know, through the Green Book as being - really as dumps, as really not nice places. And that's not the case.
You see, as a doctor, he could find things from specific cases. But for the government to make an alert, any announcement, they need more evidence. They have to base themselves on scientific analysis. So all this would take some time. But now, of course, with the benefit of hindsight, everybody knew that Dr. Li was right. And he continued to work in the hospital. And it was very tragic for us that he, in his work, he lost his life. But I think he was one of the good doctors. There are tens of thousands of them still working as a front line, still risk their own lives to save other people.

There needs to be a limit placed on carbon emissions from the power sector, Williams said. We're talking about setting a firm statewide limit on the CO2 emissions coming from the power sector that would then incentivize the development of a cap-and-trade program.
Mr. WEINBERG: In that case, it's natural that we are on one of - the minority of planets which are at the right distance from this star. It's just common sense.
Basically speaking, I think if we adopt the premise that this problem probably is a global Catholic problem - that is, it's no more likely to flare up in North America or Europe than it is in Latin America or sub-Saharan African - then the truth is, there's probably at least two-thirds of the Catholic world where this crisis has not yet erupted, but where it very well could. And so if I were in senior leadership in the Catholic Church today, if somebody were trying to tell me that we're rounding a corner, that this story is almost over, I would be deeply skeptical of that.
MOORE: (Laughter) I don't know. I guess it began with the cry. The first time I cried was the episode in which Laura bleaches her hair blonde, looks in the mirror and with her friend Millie's help decides she looks more like Harpo Marx than what her goal had been. And so she quickly tries to dye it back before Rob gets home from work. Now, this is a real stretch of the imagination. She decides to dye one half of her head back, not being able to get the other half done before Dick walks in the door. And so she greets him half blonde, half brunette and sobbing.

I think it's very important - at least it always has been important for us to stay very loose, which allows you to write badly as well as to write well. But we write a lot and we tear up a lot.
Former chief of staff Mick Mulvaney is also rumored to be publishing, and his resignation this week coupled with statements about Trump not being the same man he was eight months ago suggest he may be more disaffected than when he was reassigned as special envoy to Northern Ireland.

There are other ways to get at the answer. The COVID-19 Prevention Network has proposed an experimental study that would involve vaccinating more than 20,000 college students with Moderna's vaccine, checking them multiple times per week for virus shedding and doing contact tracing when infections occurred. The trial, which would cost several hundred million dollars, has so far been turned down by federal funders.
Mass mailings can also be the victims of their own success, as the overwhelming quantity of comments forces officials to use machines to read them. It's a prospect that infuriates activists, like Stanford Law School Professor Michele Dauber.
GROSS: They confused him so much with the character.
The confirmation of these new cases in the U.S. may actually be somewhat delayed, in part because there was an initial backlog in testing for the virus within the U.S. A problem with the test kits that the CDC distributed across the country required most testing to happen at the CDC headquarters in Atlanta. Federal health officials now say they have resolved the issue and are now working to distribute new test kits across the country.

GARCIA-NAVARRO: One of the things that has been so striking is how quickly voters shed the ideology of their party once a populist comes to power. Does that show that all this political edifice, all the political sort of intellectual underpinnings of liberals and conservatives are simply a house of cards, which populists can exploit to their advantage?
Sanders followed that up on Thursday when he sent a fundraising plea on behalf of former Wisconsin Sen. Russ Feingold, who's in a rematch with GOP Sen. Ron Johnson in a race critical to the balance of power in the Senate.
The mayor's office says it wants every neighborhood to do its fair share in the city's effort to phase out the use of cluster housing and commercial hotel facilities to house the homeless.

His father was a French colonialist in Vietnam. My guest tells part of his own story in an essay at the back of the book. Viet Thanh Nguyen's parents grew up in the north of Vietnam when the country was divided in the mid-1950s. With the North under communist control, his parents fled to the South. When the South fell to the North in 1975, the family fled to America. Viet Nguyen was 4 years old at the time. He is now a professor of English and American Studies and Ethnicity at the University of Southern California.

That could be a long (but worthwhile) process of filing complaints with the World Trade Organization. Still, a long string of nonsplashy administrative actions may not suit President Trump's decidedly unsubtle governing style.

He also thinks the DPA could prove useful in preparing to face the next crisis. We obviously need a stockpile of certain kinds of things for these pandemics that we should put in place and don't have sufficiently set up, notes Bialos. And you could use this authority to buy things to stockpile so that five, six months from now we're not in the same situation again.
But this is how everyone lived, and because everyone was doing it, then it's normal. I'm very lucky in that I never look back at it as a tough upbringing because it was the only upbringing I knew, and everyone was doing it with me. Essentially it's like being in a very stringent fitness class — if everyone is suffering together it doesn't seem so bad.
GARCETTI: Well, I think it's, you know, a kind of vicious circle. I think people who aren't making those decisions, who come from our community - they're not going to have the opportunity to tell those stories. And those stories, when they're not told, just confirm folks who don't greenlight those sorts of stories that they either don't exist or that nobody wants to see them. We know that there are amazing American stories in every community. Eva Longoria, who's helped us launch this, will become a director soon telling the story of the man who invented Flamin' Hot Cheetos, the number one snack in the world now, you know, something that people know all over. And I think also, too, in Hollywood sometimes and we're so proud of folks in Latin America who have won awards, especially directors from Mexico recently. But that is a different experience than Latinos in the United States of America.

INSKEEP: So we have a wide range of trade positions. Donald Trump has very loudly denounced NAFTA and other trade deals, has said the United States has done a terrible job of negotiating them. Bernie Sanders has a position on this. He's very skeptical of trade deals. Hillary Clinton favored the idea of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But does not like the reality. We could go on for some time. What is the basic difference here as you follow the different campaigns? What are the sides?

Still, it fell short of what some parties had hoped for. Island nations — which face an existent threat from rising seawaters — had pushed hard for a target of 1.5 degrees Celsius. (Why not even lower? Well, as of 2015, the global average temperature had already risen by 1 degree Celsius, and even with robust efforts to cut emissions, some further increase is essentially inevitable.)

And what happened was - through their personal connections, they started to send the signal out that California was a good place to live. The weather was nice. The economy was good. There were excellent welfare benefits. And Vietnamese people who had been scattered all over the country by deliberate government policy in order to encourage assimilation - many of them heard that message and came to California and to other places like it, such as Texas. And that's how we ended up - that was one of the reasons why we ended up in San Jose.
Throughout this campaign, Sen. Sanders has been focused like a laser beam in building progressive power both in the short term and in his presidential campaign, said Neil Sroka, spokesman for Democracy for America. I think the work that he's doing supporting a lot of the candidates that he's announced so far is a reflection of that focus.
I think in 2017, the protests — there was support for the protest and the opposition, but there wasn't a tangible mechanism to be supporting. Now there is something to be supporting.

I mean, imagine if the Trump administration issued a rule that forbid doctors from telling our patients about their options for any other aspect of health care. It's a direct interference with the practice of medicine and with our ethical obligation to our patients.
