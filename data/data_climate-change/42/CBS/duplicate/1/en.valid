MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington. And this week on FACE THE NATION, the government's plan to vaccinate Americans is already showing signs of strain, as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths climbs higher than ever, and concern over a new variant of the virus grows. It's been a sobering start to 2021. Bad behavior over the holidays, as defined by CDC guidelines, threatens to make January the deadliest month, yet, in years since the virus was discovered. The U.S. has now recorded over twenty million infections, a number that's doubled in the last eight weeks. In some parts of the country hospitals, morgues, and funeral homes are at or overcapacity. Health care workers are overwhelmed.

Was two-time All-Big Ten, even got a look in free agent camp in the NFL, Gough explained. Had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. But being a smart kid Curtis already had other goals in mind.

Jack Welch, who became a celebrity CEO and management guru after reviving General Electric in the 1980s and 1990s, is dead at age 84.
The competition is fierce, so much so their technology is akin to a state secret. But Price points us to a network of sensors, cameras and radar devices strapped to the outside of the rig, all of it hardwired to an internal AI supercomputer that drives the truck. It's self-contained — so a bad WiFi signal won't wreak havoc on the road.

MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm glad we have you today to talk about the vaccine and distribution. I want to quickly ask you something though on the political front as a Republican. Nearly a quarter of Senate Republicans say they have concerns about voter integrity, and plan on Wednesday to challenge Joe Biden's Electoral College win. This is, to be very clear, all but certain to fail in terms of changing the outcome of the election. But other Republican senators say this is destructive to do in the first place.

Newsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed.

What's that, you may ask? The term first emerged in 2012, coined by The Atlantic writer Alexis C. Madrigal. It refers to social content that is shared through private channels, rather than more public forums like Facebook where posts can be seen and shared openly by a wide circle of people. Think e-mail communications or chats on messaging apps like Kik or Snapchat. As a result of being shared through private channels, this content often exists beyond the reach of standard analytic tools and metrics that companies use to assess how content is shared and where it is being shared from.
GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: The federal government is giving directly to them. All we're doing as a state is telling them where it goes and allocate it.
But since stepping down from GE's top job in 2001, Welch's leadership at the company has come into question, especially since the financial crisis. GE's stock has floundered in recent decades, and the company faced steep losses in its financial businesses after the collapse of Lehman Brothers. Welch also became a vocal critic of President Barack Obama and other Democrats.

Danny Clinch: I'm photographing all the time. I'm such a visual person and I don't want to miss that moment.
Matt Benassi: This is really, really hard, right? 'Cause Section 230. When that was written, it was probably done with the intent that social media companies would police themselves in some manner. And social media companies haven't done that very well. They need to police themselves quicker or the government needs to step in and figure out some mechanism to make them liable. 'Cause making them liable would make them police themselves.
All the rifles are becoming smaller and lighter, but Col. Roger Turner -- the man in charge of developing new weapons for the Marines -- says the addition of a telescopic scope is the biggest change.

In 2015, reporter Alison Parker and cameraman, Adam Ward, were shot, on camera, by a fired co-worker. The scene has been posted hundreds of times. This one got more than 600,000 views. And to the right, the automatic ad means the person who posted this made money and so did YouTube.

The Nassar scandal has continued to trigger developments across the country, from Texas to the nation's capital. Texas Gov.

PG&E serves about 40 percent of California's utility customers, Newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. It operates in three-quarters of California's land most vulnerable to wildfires, Newsom said.

To best explain it, Swan used the example of a grandmother copying and pasting a link and sending it to her grandson. It's a popular news story that's been trending, but the original site that housed the content has no idea that the traffic generated from that simple share stemmed from grandma's original email. Her grandson can tweet out the story, which gets re-tweeted by 10,000 people who then click on it. It starts a domino effect with an untraceable chain, which carries with it implications for how brands and organizations need to better assess their analytics and how they're reaching users.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, we've-- we have forty million vaccines that-- that were delivered in December. Five million were injected into arms. That's thirty-five million vaccines sitting on a shelf somewhere.

Continue to-- to accomplish that mission because it's important, but also take some of this excess supply and push it through a retail channel to the general public. If someone who's seventy years old or sixty-five years old wants to schedule an appointment at CVS to get a vaccination, they should be able to do that this month. So I think we should start working through the age brackets and just work our way down until we work off some of the supply. There's more vaccine coming on the market every day. We're going to have a significant backlog right now or, you know, warehouse inventory of vaccines.

People fight and argue all the time, Maher noted to Det. Gibson.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay, so you're saying that still has to be up to the states to figure out where they have the need. But let's talk about the portion you can control, and that is the federal supply. If the goal is preservation of life, how can you still justify holding back more than half of the manufactured doses that you have? You know we just heard from the U.K. that they're just trying to hit as many people at once. Why not do something like that and space out the time between doses?
Rapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores Haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge.

Unfortunately, the federation tries to convolute it to the general public by saying, well, it's equitable. But what's equitable mean? That's the same thing as equal. Really, we're still not there yet. That's another part of my platform, gender equality, she said.

This echoes a glitch that impacted payment of the first stimulus check for some people who used tax prep services and for whom the IRS didn't have direct-deposit information. With the second round of stimulus checks, a similar issue may impact some people, with H&R Block warning its customers who used a service called a refund transfer that they might see an account number you don't recognize on the Get My Payment website. Refund transfers are offered to allow people to tap their refund to pay their tax prep fees, according to H&R Block.

How much government revenue it would raise: Bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. But that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.
It was just surreal, said Dobrzynski.
One of the hypotheses is that the joints get loose and lax, and because of that, the bones kind of move differently than they would in a normal situation, said Zhao.
Anderson Cooper: Yeah. Was he driving?
MONCEF SLAOUI: So that-- those-- no. Those studies, frankly, are going to be based on observational data into the population. I don't think we will have data before late in the spring.
Her obvious delight was just off the wall, Raben said, referring to Aquilina's death warrant remark and others. I am not defending Larry Nassar at all, but what I saw with her was a real abandonment of judicial demeanor. ... The process doesn't change because everybody hates the defendant. That is the absolute glory, or should be, of the American justice system.
So why wasn't that the end of it for you? I mean, you have Dr. Bowman who says undetermined, you have now Dr. Shaku Teas, who is accredited and is telling you, 'look it's undetermined, I don't see a problem with it,' Maher asked the detective.
Swan said that basing an opinion solely on the SXSW crowd might be skewed given the fact that he and Jensen addressed an audience of pretty well-educated people well-versed in the intersection of privacy and technology. That being said, he stressed that there is a legitimate education gap between the latest technologies and their privacy policies and people taking responsibility for their own security.

President Trump has long claimed that there is a crisis at the border due to the high number of people seeking to cross into the U.S. (though he does not differentiate between illegal immigrants and asylum seekers). And he has repeatedly threatened to bypass Congress and use emergency funds to build a wall, which was one of his core campaign promises during the 2016 election.

Samsung also said its phones are facing stiffer competition, and its stock fell 1.7 percent in Seoul.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, that's another reason to be making this more generally accessible. It is a reality that some people aren't going to want to get vaccinated, or are going to be reluctant to get vaccinated. It's going to take more work. There's about a hundred and fifty million Americans who get vaccinated for flu each year. About sixty million of them are under the age of fifteen. So that's about ninety million people who get vaccinated for flu. I think that's your low hanging fruit for getting COVID vaccinations out. Some high proportion of the people who get a flu vaccine are also going to get a COVID vaccine. If we just simply make this generally accessible to sixty-five and above this month, that's fifty million Americans, probably about thirty million of them will take it. That's your low hanging fruit. That's the pent-up demand. We need to start working that off because trying to push it into, you know, very discrete populations, you're going to be bumping up against people who don't want it and it's going to create friction. It's going to create a slowdown in trying to get this vaccination out. We need to get more people vaccinated quickly and recognize that every vaccination--

No matter what Tinder's market research may have shown about the younger users' relative income and willingness to pay for the service, as a group, as compared to the older cohort, some individuals will not fit the mold, the 26-page ruling said. Some older consumers will be 'more budget constrained' and less willing to pay than some in the younger group. … Because nothing in the complaint suggests there is a strong public policy that justifies the alleged discriminatory pricing. … Accordingly, we swipe left, and reverse.

Garrett asked everyone if they had seen or remembered a Bloomberg TV ad. All but two had. Trump supporters said they thought Bloomberg might give the president the toughest challenge.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, we're not vaccinating quickly enough to create a backstop against the spread of this new variant. Right now there's some estimates that the new-- new variant probably represents about one percent of all infections in this country. By March, it's going to be the majority of infections. It's going to grow quickly. And so one of the-- the real key to controlling this new variant is to control the epidemic. That means doing the things that we've been doing, mask wearing, social distancing, but it also means getting more people vaccinated quickly. I think that the-- the existence of this new variant that spreads more readily really creates more urgency around trying to get this vaccine out more quickly and get more people vaccinated, even if it's a more general population. There's a lot of excess demand for the vaccine right now, particularly in the elderly population. I think we ought to think about moving quickly through these phases that we've delineated and move more quickly into a general vaccination program for those sixty-five and above.

I, unfortunately, expect to see more in the years to come because there's a limited amount of space in Miami that's developable, Calvo said.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. The federal government right now is telling states to prioritize people seventy-five years old and up along with front-line workers. There are state governors, Florida, Texas, who have moved the age qualification downwards, right, to hit more of their elderly population. Are you going to do that or are you going to stick with what the federal government's telling you to do?

I think Director Haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, Morell said. In this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-Trump or anti-Trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.

In my opinion, for the most part machine guns will actually change or paint the actual outcome of the battle space, said Moore. I'm going to instill confidence in my squad and their ability to move forward, and then I'm also going to put that fear in the enemy where they don't want to fight.

Although the CIA and Haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding President Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance last August; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, Haspel's own involvement in the CIA's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. In doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.
Two dynamics threaten to precipitate the inflation surge: The long-awaited rise of wage pressure and the ability of businesses to pass higher costs onto consumers via higher prices.
In 2012, collections director for the museum Scott Stephenson gave CBS This Morning: Saturday co-host Anthony Mason a preview of some of the items that will go on display.

She went to Neiman Marcus and went in the dressing room and tried them on for someone and they made a big order, and then Oprah chose her as one of her favorite things, Case said.
It wasn't a pretty sight: a fumble cost the Patriots their first turn over with just about two minutes left in the fourth quarter.
Danny Clinch: I was at a Madonna show many, many years ago and I was in the sweet spot and she came out and I mean it was the best part of the show. And I was shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting. And I'm like, God, I must have shot a hundred pictures have I not run out of film? And I opened the back of my camera and there was no film in there. So that happened to me only once.
Separately, producer price inflation increased 0.6 percent last month from the month prior, double the gain expected and landing the annual rate at 1.6 percent -- another level not seen since 2014. You get the idea.
Yeah, we need a verdict. We need some kind of closure -- some kind, said Steve Belko.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. And, quickly, do you have a date for when you will know whether once you've been vaccinated, you can still give the virus to others? Is there any timeline?

Now, out of storage, the tent is once again set up -- this time not on the fields of Valley Forge, but behind a layer of thick protective glass.
GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: --to the general population, we're going to have to utilize more resources to get this out than we've got planned right now.
Still, there are some glitches that are delaying the payments of the stimulus money and creating confusion and questions for consumers. Chief among them: Some people who had their 2020 tax returns filed through tax preparers like H&R Block may have had their stimulus check sent directly to the tax firm, rather than their bank account.

Some of the jurors who would decide Curtis' fate spoke with 48 Hours.

Rapp will be the first to newly assume the role since former CIA Director John Brennan's modernization push, which shifted some oversight away from larger directorates and funneled them into discrete Mission Centers focused on some of the thorniest issue areas in national security.

Earlier in the day, PG&E announced it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes.

Anderson Cooper: It's like a history of rock and roll.
MARGARET BRENNAN: There's confusion. I mean I know people who-- who ask-- where do I find out when I qualify? What do you tell your members? Do they call their doctor? Do they get an e-mail? Who do they ask? Their local health department?
If you do go the mask route in spite of expert advice, it's important to note that face masks have a very specific lifespan. While there are some with longer lifespans or that have replaceable filters, the most common face masks on the market are disposable and single use. Each one of those is only good for a few hours.
GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, it's a-- a process that they have the right to initiate. I think it's a little bit of a Don Quixote jousting at windmills efforts. I think it is designed-- certainly it will fail. Joe Biden is our president-elect and he will be confirmed in that capacity. I do think that from a state perspective, the challenges have been initiated through recounts and court challenges. And that's how we work in our Electoral College, state by state. And so when it gets to Congress, it's really a limited opportunity to review the intricacies of the election process. We should have confidence in what has been done and the reviews and the recounts. And let's all recognize that while the system is not perfect, it worked state by state, and we should accept those results and move on to do some good things for our country.
And life went on? Maher asked Gough.

There is a limited supply of masks and while companies are increasing their production, demand is increasing at a very high rate, cautions Pekosz. There will most likely be shortages of personal protective equipment at medical institutions and this may in part be driven by supplies being purchased by the general public. Emergency preparedness efforts will address supply chains, but there really is no reason for the general public to purchase large numbers of N95 masks.
A rally in battered crude oil prices that began Friday appears short-lived. After modest gains earlier in the day, U.S. crude was down $1.10 to $31.09 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Friday, it shot up $2.66 to $32.19 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils, lost $1.11 to $31.07 a barrel.

I also saw people scraping Facebook about Black Lives Matter and selling it to police departments, I saw financial institutions using Facebook tools to discriminate in housing.

Jenkins and playwright Tarell Alvin McCraney both grew up in Liberty City; they know the neighborhood where the film takes place. They both attended the same elementary school, at different times.
A priority of the new president and Congress will be reining in the giants of social media. On this, Democrats and Republicans agree. Their target is a federal law known as Section 230. In a single sentence it set off the 'big bang' helping to create the universe of Google, Facebook, Twitter and the rest. Some critics of the law say that it leaves social media free to ignore lies, hoaxes and slander that can wreck the lives of innocent people. One of those critics is Lenny Pozner. After a tragedy in his own life, Pozner has become a champion for victims of online lies, people including Maatje and Matt Benassi, who, overnight, became the target of death threats like these.
Shelter costs in particular are a big deal because they're heavily weighted in inflation measures (at about a third of overall spending) and have been rising steadily in recent years.

MARGARET BRENNAN: --the plan you have in place? You know, CVS and Walgreens say they have-- they are expecting to get the vaccine in the spring to distribute to the population at large. Why not give it to them now? If the states are having a problem, go to the private sector.

The Sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest American families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.

The best way to prevent coronavirus: Wash your hands
The city, whose most exclusive neighborhoods are close to the sea and barely above sea level, is increasingly getting flooded during high tides. The city is moving to raise streets and sidewalks by two feet, at a cost of about $1 million a block, but adaptation will only be a partial help.

Good morning, and welcome to FACE THE NATION. As we begin the New Year, optimism over the prospect of vaccinations is facing the reality of delays, confusion, lack of communication, and, once more, a federal government seemingly without a coherent plan for making the millions of doses already manufactured accessible to Americans. Overwhelmed states, many struggling with this latest surge, have been left in charge of getting the vaccine to Americans, and they're having a hard time doing so. Meanwhile, the death toll continues to climb. More than three hundred and fifty thousand people have now died of COVID-19 in the U.S. California is the new epicenter of this latest outbreak. CBS News correspondent Carter Evans reports from Los Angeles.
Jon Wertheim: Do you have to tell anyone when you test?
It was an emotional testimony, she said. Thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.
There's a lot the general public likely doesn't realize about these masks — namely, that they are not the best way to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Why is the time Cory Lovelace died so critical? Ask a man who deals in death for a living, Deputy Coroner James Keller. That Valentine's Day morning, he was there to transport Cory's body.
His death was confirmed Monday by GE, according to the Associated Press. The cause of death was renal failure, his wife Suzy told the New York Times.

In March of 1999, an up-and-coming photographer named Danny Clinch got two phone calls that would change his life.

She was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to show how Cory's were positioned. And I went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff.
Maatje Benassi: We're gonna put a bullet in her skull. Let's load up the trucks. Let's go get 'em. Let's hang 'em. They posted our address, our full address, where we live.

This is just dragging it out more. But if they're hung, they're hung. And there's nothing we can do about it. We just wait for the next round, Lyndsay said of the outcome.

Let me give that praise for developing and helping the private sector get these vaccines. But we are at a pace right now to deliver vaccines in Los Angeles in over five years instead of over half a year at this pace.
For 20 years during my career I fought for change within the system. I fought for gender equity, I fought against injustices, and we weren't really getting anywhere. So this became kind of a natural step for me to really, really continue that fight, to run for president and to really get inside the organization and force this change that we've been fighting for 20 years to do, Solo said.

Whether it's a Native American kid or not, have the same end goal -- which is to reunite a child with his or her biological relatives so they can be raised into the family they were born into, a lawyer for the tribe said.
As fears over the coronavirus outbreak spread, thousands of Americans are clamoring to buy face masks in an effort to protect themselves, sending prices soaring and leading manufacturers like 3M to ramp up production.

Hadden knew his wife wasn't joking either.
CARTER EVANS: With a new year comes new hope.
I'm sitting in the front row like, wow, this is the greatest thing I ever did. Then right in the beginning of the presidential campaign in 2016 I see things going wrong and it makes me very concerned.

I was totally afraid to make the leap. What we talk about in the book or what I talk to readers about is getting outside of your comfort zone. It's so easy to get locked in a place where you're comfortable and everything's okay, but it's not really the life we aspire to. I like to say no things that are great come from the comfort zone. You have to get a little uncomfortable and push yourself.

Another statute allows the Pentagon to apply the resources of the Department of the Army's civil works program, and to reprogram those resources to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.

Everyone around the world, we found, has ideas about what they might do to change the world, but often they're stopped by the idea that maybe you need a special genius or wealth or certain connections or graduating from the right school, Case said Friday on CBS This Morning.

How much and what the state can do remains to be seen. Lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened PG&E bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility.

GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: We're looking at reducing that to seventy, as well. The argument that it should be allocated seventy-five and up first is because there's a limited supply. It might be easier for you to distribute it and know exactly who you're distributing it to. But the seventy and up population we're looking at, we're trying to save lives getting to the most vulnerable first. And so we're still looking at that as to whether that should be lowered.

Today is a sad day for the entire GE family, current GE chief executive H. Lawrence Culp Jr. said in a statement. Jack was larger than life and the heart of GE for half a century. He reshaped the face of our company and the business world. Jack was a strong and constant influence throughout my career despite never having worked directly for him.
With both of our boys, we had families, support and a ton of stuff, Hadden said. This mom didn't. She had nothing. No family that was there.
Medina also applauded Haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. Overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up.

SHEBOYGAN, Wis. -- A Wisconsin sheriff has defended his decision to hire a man convicted of killing and dismembering his girlfriend nearly 40 years ago in Texas.
Right about now you might be thinking, they should sue. But that's the problem. They can't file hundreds of lawsuits against internet trolls hiding behind aliases. And they can't sue the internet platforms because of that law known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Written before Facebook or Google were invented, Section 230 says, in just 26 words, that internet platforms are not liable for what their users post.

The White House said Thursday that they would declare a national emergency in order to fund a barrier along the southern border. But the move is almost certain to invite challenges.
Within six months after the mysterious death of his wife, Cory, on Valentine's Day 2006, Curtis Lovelace rekindled his love life and began dating a student in a class he taught at Quincy University. The woman, named Erica, was eight years his junior. They married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, Lyndsay, didn't get along. Lyndsay became estranged from her father.
He definitely was a pillar of this community, no question about it, Gough remarked.
Clinch wears many hats, pun intended. As the official portrait photographer at the Grammys, he covers the musical spectrum. Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga.
The show, in short, was proudly tradition-bound, and prevailed to the end as a TV tradition for the faithful fans who watched it every week and, during each offseason, eagerly sought its return.

One of Facebook's early investors and a former mentor to CEO Mark Zuckerberg is warning of the social media giant's harmful and potentially irreversible effects on society. Roger McNamee told CBS This Morning on Wednesday that Facebook not only needs to take action, it needs to fix the product.
Read on to learn about that commercial and four other controversial Super Bowl ads.
Note that if you opt out of your MA plan and switch to original Medicare, you may have a challenge purchasing a Medicare Supplement plan. Most states allow insurance companies to require that you satisfy medical underwriting requirements to obtain coverage (insurance companies are prohibited from applying medical underwriting only when you're first eligible to enroll in Medicare at age 65). So if you have a preexisting condition, you may not be able to elect a Medicare Supplement Plan.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So I understand you do not support that effort. Thank you for your clarification there, Governor. I want to move on to the virus. The CDC says Arkansas has only distributed a third of the vaccines that you have been given. What's the biggest challenge getting the doses into arms?
Jury members got on the floor -- put themselves in this position like this. To try and figure it out, Maher commented.
Medically, you can survive for several days if you have air, she told reporters at a news conference.
However heated the debate over guns and civilians, few question the importance of firepower for our armed forces. Here's David Martin:
What to make of the encroachment of a telephone, or the very idea of a lady out pursuing a career! The changes navigated by the Downton denizens provided us viewers, a century removed, with the opportunity to measure ourselves against them as we, too, cope with change that alternately gladdens and confounds us. And as we, too, cut ties with the past.
Chinyere Tutashinda, a spokeswoman for the activists, says some chained themselves along the track.
Wood, a scholar of the revolution, said, There have been museums for almost every conceivable event in American history or person in American history. But not the American Revolution. Which is extraordinary when you think of the revolution as the most important event in our history.

MONCEF SLAOUI: I don't think it's a problem, frankly-- I actually-- well, we are here to help. Let me just, for instance, say over the last seventy-two hours 1.5 million vaccine doses have been inoculated. Even though there is a gap in reporting. That's quite an important number. That's five hundred thousand a day. We are optimistic as we go beyond this holiday season that the numbers will go up and we are standing ready to do what we are asked. Where there is help to be given, we're standing by to help. I don't think we are able to identify exactly which long-term care facility or which CVS store should be getting more vaccine or less vaccine. That has to be done with people that have granular knowledge of their population, their movements, where the older people are, or, you know, the--

Bloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. But that's not unique. All of the major Democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.
Like most other immigration data points, pinpointing the total undocumented population and how they arrived in the U.S. is equal parts art and science, Vaughan said. Using deportation data from ICE, which tracks how immigrants arrive in the U.S., Vaughan estimates that visa overstays comprise somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of the undocumented immigration population.
He interviewed the three oldest children. Those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. He just took notes and then turned in a report in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their father being there. And they all told him they had seen their mother that morning, said Gough.
With momentum from the defense, Tom Brady and the Patriots drove up the field to set up James White's impressive 26-yard touchdown run. Eagles lead 15-12.
Curt chose his second wife over his daughter, said Belko.
The disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. That wouldn't be cheap. And many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of theIr wealth overseas.
How it would work: A key in understanding Bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. That means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.
SENATOR KELLY LOEFFLER (R-Georgia): We have to hold the line here against socialism. We need y'all to get out and vote.

What did you determine would have caused the suffocation? Maher asked.
In my report, I stated 10 to 12 hours. Rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. And with her arms in that position, which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that position, suggests to me that she was in full rigor, said Dr. Turner.

The Eagles had a first down at the 5 after Corey Clement's 16-yard gain on a catch and run. But a penalty and two incomplete passes forced Philadelphia to settle for the field goal.
Tom Brady has thrown for more than 400 yards for the second straight Super Bowl, and the New England Patriots are within three of the Philadelphia Eagles for the second time in the second half of the Super Bowl. Brady threw a 26-yard scoring pass to Chris Hogan, pushing him to 404 yards passing and getting the Patriots within 29-26 late in the third quarter. Brady set the Super Bowl record with 466 yards last year in Houston.
GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: It may happen. We're also looking at some other modifications to the recommendation of the CDC, which is simply recommendations to the governors.

In the future, the class of workers affected by automation could grow as machines become more intelligent. The Brookings report analyzed each occupation's automation potential based on research by the McKinsey management consulting firm. Those jobs that remain largely unscathed will be those requiring not just advanced education, but also interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.
We want to go now to the chief adviser for the U.S. vaccine effort, that's Operation Warp Speed. Doctor Moncef Slaoui joins us from Miami. Good morning to you, Doctor.
Learning the ropes, Clinch was an assistant to photographer Annie Leibovitz. He prefers shooting in natural light, and agrees with what the famous war photographer Robert Capa said: if your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough. And even when he's not working, he's still looking for that perfect shot.
How much more Bloomberg would pay under Sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion.
Ackerman also argued in his piece that calling a national emergency to build a wall would be illegal because of statutes saying that military forces could not be used for domestic purposes.
Throw my name in the hat if this baby's being put up for adoption, Hadden said jokingly.
Jon Wertheim: What's your response to the technology companies that say, Look, I'm trying to do something more efficiently, and I'm going to improve safety. This is American enterprise. What are you gonna get in the way of this for?
Protesters blocked the line shortly after 2 p.m., saying they were protesting police brutality as well as the light-rail line being turned over to Super Bowl fans for the day.
From what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said Gough.
Our babies are right in our face, like the saliva, the mucus membranes are all around us, she said. We both have toddlers and I mean, they're literally little petri dishes of disease walking, they just have everything. So we're sick sometimes.
The Mayo Clinic study is ongoing, and researchers have not yet reached any conclusions. But what doctors do already know about osteoarthritis in the thumb is that it occurs more in women than men.
The Nasdaq composite gained 74 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish at 6,897. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 19 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 1,425.
When he finally sat down with his crew to eat dinner in the middle of his 24-hour shift, the phone rang — and he had to hop into an ambulance to make an emergency call.

Almost like a mannequin? Maher asked.
According to Curtis, his wife Cory was not feeling well that Valentine's Day morning. She came down the stairs and sat down for a while. Detective Baird said that three of the children also told him they saw their mother alive that morning.
REVEREND RAPHAEL WARNOCK (Democratic Senate Candidate): You can either help Kelly Loeffler to help herself or you can help me to help you.
Another concern the researchers want to address is the impact of so much thumb movement on children. What it will mean for them later in life is unknown.
Under the Immigration and Nationality Act, the president can declare an immigration emergency, which is defined as when an actual or imminent influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the United States is beyond the existing capabilities. A state attorney general can request the president's response to an immigration emergency and detail what is needed to address it. However, only $20 million is available under that statute.
The New England Patriots have won the opening coin toss and have deferred to the second half.
My nanny is a huge Eagles fan, so we're all Eagles today. And they're the underdog, right? So, you know, it's kind of cool, she said.
I don't know. I don't wanna believe it. Because everything I know about Curt, he could not have done it. And -- I don't even know if it would've been done in a crime of passion, he replied. I think of Cory on that. Because I know Cory is -- is one tough cookie. She'd have fought to the death to defend her children.
Anderson Cooper: You know you do a lot rock and roll bands, don't see a lot of rock and roll bands with a sousaphone.
The Super Bowl remains a rarity on TV, a broadcast where people tune in not only for the main event but also for the commercials. But that combination -- a huge audience and one that's primed to listen to TV ads -- can sometimes prove to be a mixed blessing for brands, given the enormous pressure to score a touchdown with a memorable ad.
To prevent problems, start by giving your thumbs a break, doctors say. Mix up your method by using your forefinger to peck the screen, or use your voice to dictate a message.
And I was at the office ... just reading old case files, and the Lovelace case popped into my head, he said.
Garrett said of his excursion that, among Democrats, he did not find hard-core supporters of Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders or Joe Biden. Flat line across the board, Texas Democrats are waiting for Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada to sort this out, he said. Democrats said they were keeping an open mind for Texas' 'Super Tuesday' primary.
Prior to Sunday's ceremony, former double play partner Robinson Cano sent congratulations to Jeter on Twitter:
The Buttigieg and Klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. Neither campaign responded to comment for this article.
Downton Abbey is smart to bring its saga to a close before it lets more time pass. It has gotten through in magnificent fashion, albeit more and more predictably. Now it's adapting to obligatory change on its own classy terms: by saying goodbye.
Editor's note: Health officials' views on wearing face masks have shifted as the outbreak spreads. On Friday, April 3, President Trump announced that the CDC now recommends Americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask, not a medical-grade mask, in public.

We will be defending freedom of speech, freedom of art, and freedom of culture, and will not take it down, he said.
Welch's GE makeover was a huge success during his tenure. Revenue soared at GE under Welch, up 600% to $130 billion. He also made GE's investors a lot of money: General Electric's stock market value under Welch rose to more than $400 billion, from $14 billion when he took the job of chief executive. During his tenure, GE's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.
The sun is about 3% larger in the sky on Saturday — not enough to be noticeable with the naked eye. Remember: You should never look at the sun without proper eye protection, and sunglasses are not a sufficient replacement for solar-viewing glasses.
A condition that doctors used to only see in factory workers is becoming more widespread.
Metro Transit was busing fans the rest of the way to the game.
Although sunlight is more intense on Saturday, winter in the Northern Hemisphere is unaffected, due to the 23.5-degree tilt of Earth's axis. Being closer to the sun does not change the Earth's tilt, so the North Pole is still tilted away from the sun.
Because in the court of public opinion, you think people will always feel like he did something, said Maher.
The museum's collection will include a letter, written in Washington's own hand, celebrating the French joining the cause. The original enlistment form for recruits to an uprising printed in the spring of 1775 will also be featured, according to Stephenson.

Based on earned income alone, Bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. Consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Wharton Budget Model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that Bloomberg is proposing). About $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.

The screen actor's guild was not for the big screen, trust me, Edelstein replied. It was for Laura Petrie and it was for Mary Richards. …Anyone who, in this lifetime, gives us a character like Laura Petrie and Mary Richards, can really die happy, you know?
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, we're seeing a person every six seconds contract COVID-19 here in Los Angeles County, I think the nation's largest county, ten million people. And it's two reasons, one is just simple density. We're the densest metro area in the United States. But we're also seeing the household spread now. One person is coming home, an essential worker, there might be five, seven, ten people in that household. And this is a worrying trend that the fatalities now are not just people with pre-existing conditions. Ninety-two percent of previous deaths were people who had an underlying condition. That is rapidly falling. So, my message to everybody is this is not only going to come for somebody that you love. This is going to possibly come for you. And so everything we do is either lifesaving or life-taking at this point.
She said she was totally afraid to make the leap, but she had to get outside her comfort zone.
The common surgical mask you might be picturing in your head will not help you at all, Pekosz said.
Last year's group of commercials lost their impact collectively because there were so many serious-minded ads, he noted. I think they will shift back to a more lighter tone to get people to pay attention, to have surprises and not be as preachy.

Took the youngest to Cory's mother's house. Gave the youngest child to Cory's mother and said, 'Cory's dead' and left, Gough said. The first call was not to 911. The first call was not to the paramedics. The first call was his boss, the state's attorney.
But investors have become notably more optimistic about an eventual deal, a sharp reversal of the concerns that helped send stocks plunging in October and December. An agreement between the two biggest economic powers in the world could remove a major obstacle to global economic growth.
He's right. The autonomous truck revolution is here. It just isn't much discussed - not on CB radios; and not in statehouses. And transportation agencies are not inclined to pump the brakes. From Florida, hang a left and drive 2000 miles west on I-10 and you'll hit the proving grounds of a company with a fleet of 41 autonomous rigs.
In an interview on CBSN's Red & Blue, Trump told host Elaine Quijano that the riot on Capitol Hill was a direct result of [the president's] unwillingness to concede the election. His insistence that it was stolen or rigged.

Lyndsay, apparently, didn't have a place in that family. Why, I don't know, said Steve Belko.
We've seen this become a national conversation, added Barbara Parker. Whereas, even a couple of years ago, no one would talk about it. But now people are all discussing it, and telling us, 'What you're doing is important.'
The team then called for backup and rushed to the hospital to drop off the mother and child. While filling out routine paperwork at the hospital, Hadden overheard nurses say the new mom requested the baby girl be put up for adoption immediately.
We would just have girl moments and just dance around and sing 'Dancing Queen.' I still listen to them because it brings me so much joy from that, she said.
MONCEF SLAOUI: Yes, so that's the information we have. The virus-- this virus actually mutates as part of its normal behavior and, therefore, it is normal to expect that there will be variants. What's very important is to study those variants and understand how infectious they are, whether they have more impact in terms of morbidity or mortality, and critically now, whether they are still sensitive to the vaccines that have been developed. And on those three counts, based on the information shared with us by the U.K. scientists and early data that we have here, we think that these viruses, these various variants should be under control with this vaccine. Fortunately, they are not more deadly--
Eagles, 41, Patriots 33. It was the first Super Bowl title for Philadelphia (16-3), which went from 7-9 last season to its first NFL crown since 1960.

MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with the chief adviser or Operation Warp Speed, Doctor Moncef Slaoui. Plus, we'll here from Los Angeles mayor, Eric Garcetti. His city is ground zero for the holiday COVID-19 surge. Arkansas Republican governor Asa Hutchinson will also join us, as well as former FDA commissioner Doctor Scott Gottlieb, and the head of the association representing tens of millions of America's seniors, AARP's Jo Ann Jenkins. Then, a preview of Tuesday's Georgia runoff elections. Those outcomes will determine control of the Senate. Will the state that went from red to blue in November see enough Democrats turn out to defeat not one, but two Republican senators?
And then came Lyndsay, the final key testimony for the prosecution. She was 12 at the time her mother died, and now she's the star witness at her father's trial.

It's the whole picture -- she had drying artifact of her lips. She had drying artifact of her eyes. Again, something that develops with the passage of time after death, Dr. Turner told Maher.

When an commercial succeeds, it can both charm viewers and change the way consumers think of a brand. Witness Apple's 1984 commercial, which broadcast the message that the computer company was breaking away from colorless rivals. But for every 1984, there's at least one advertiser that wants to succeed on a similar scale but falls far short. Sometimes, those ads make viewers cringe, spark boycotts or calls for the commercial to be yanked.
With this kind of messaging, a picture is literally worth a thousand words, Jensen said.

This is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion. Ninety-five percent of people can be doing the right thing. It's still dangerous.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, I think we can have a dual strategy here where we continue to prioritize certain hard to reach communities and have public health departments focus on that mission. And they're uniquely skilled to do that mission and then make the vaccine more generally available through the retail pharmacies, through Walmart and Walgreens and CVS, to a broader population, to a general population starting with age. We can walk it down the age continuum, make it available for seventy-five and above first, then seventy above, then sixty-five and above. There's fifty million Americans sixty-five and above, a large percentage of them probably want to be vaccinated. At some point we need to allow supply to meet demand here and get the-- the shots into the arms of the people who really want to get vaccinated and are going to go out and seek out the vaccination. If we're pushing it through the retail pharmacies, you're not going to see the long lines. They're going to have a scheduling system in place and it's going to be a more orderly distribution. And then, commensurate with that, we can have the public health departments focusing on the critical mission of going into homes, reaching harder-to-access communities, people who are more reluctant and need a little bit more encouragement to get vaccinated.
Chuck Price: There's certainly a lot of money to be made. There's a-- there's an opportunity to solve a very big problem.
8:19 p.m.: Justin Timberlake kicks off halftime show
The changes will hit hardest in smaller cities, especially those in the heartland and Rust Belt and in states like Indiana and Kentucky, according to the report by the Washington think tank. They will also disproportionately affect the younger workers who dominate food services and other industries at highest risk for automation.
Yes. It was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the position of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a surface. They were almost suspended in air, which tells me that there was ... an object that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied.
Haspel's immediate predecessor, Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named Haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, Brian Bulatao, to serve as COO. Brennan chose associates from within the Treasury Department and National Security Council to be his deputies.
It was steadfast, too, in its posh confinement to Downton Abbey, where, even as change gradually imposed itself, the narrative refused to change, and -- let's face it -- eventually began to feel repetitive. Even at that sprawling country estate (with occasional excursions to London) there was only so much fresh story to tell.
MONCEF SLAOUI: --to immunize more people. And, of course, we continue to produce more vaccine doses.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I didn't hear a lot of specifics from-- from the-- the governor or from the head of Operation Warp Speed on what they want to change. And I'm wondering from you what your view is because we did hear earlier in the week from Operation Warp Speed saying that some nursing homes aren't vaccinating until they have enough doses for everyone in the facility. That's a federal requirement. Should the government suspend it?
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, governors-- governors would have to mandate that, right? Is that what you're asking governors to do?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the higher incidence of death due in any way to the fact that you have a shortage of medical personnel?
Original Medicare usually gives you the most flexibility to choose your health care providers, but it's also the most complicated way to receive benefits. It's recommended that you supplement original Medicare with a Medicare Supplement Plan to help cover Medicare's substantial deductibles and copayments
To that point, Chuck Price is emphatic that driverless trucks pose fewer dangers.
One other thing: when we asked people what they thought about the November election, they said two words: anticipation, and dread.
A decade after Cory Lovelace's death, the murder trial of her husband was about to begin at the Adams County Courthouse. After hearing all the evidence, it may come down to just one question for the jury: Do they believe Cory's children, who say they saw their mother alive that morning? Or do they believe two medical examiners who insist the science says she was killed the night before?
A sentence of four consecutive life terms was accepted by the judge, in addition to the three he's already serving in a 2005 Fairfax, Va. rape. Capital murder - a charge which carries a possible death sentence - was taken off the table.
She said her platform would focus most importantly on developing youth.
Chuck Price: No, not for individual tests.
MONCEF SLAOUI: --to have been able to have five vaccines in phase three trials, two approved, probably one more to be approved in the next four to six weeks and twenty million doses of vaccines that we-- as we had promised would be made available to the American people to be immunized with have been made available: seventeen and a half million have been shipped. Now, we do acknowledge--
Steve Viscelli: It's gonna be one of the biggest.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Doctor Slaoui, thank you for your time this morning.
It was meant to be, Hadden said. Everything that happened that day changed: my station, assignment, the location. So many things happened that made us 100 percent sure.
But that did little to placate those who want the artwork removed. A protester remained camped out in a tent at the museum on Monday with a sign reading Respect religions. Police watched closely as local Christians complained to reporters in front of street signs spray-painted with crosses and windows still shattered from last week's clashes.
Linda Allen: I wasn't aware 'til I ran across one on the Florida Turnpike and that just-- it just scares me. I can't imagine. But I didn't know anything about it.
What I learned in working with him was to try to do less and work to not act, Ali said. And that's an important reminder for someone like myself who's been very fortunate to be working for a couple of decades now.
Because people can't update their bank account information on the Get My Payment site, there's concern that some checks might be sent to accounts that were recently closed. If that's the case, the IRS says you'll have to wait until you file your 2020 tax returns.
The term dark social certainly gives people pause when they first hear it. It sounds a lot like the Dark Web, conjuring headlines of hackers, cyberterrorism, and illicit online content. But Greg Swan, VP of public relations and emerging media at the digital advertising agency space150, said that rather than something sinister, it simply refers to personal communication that is happening below the radar.

Additional video showed Graham crossing Charlottesville's downtown pedestrian mall, then leaving a restaurant with Matthew, his arm wrapped around her.
It's set for retrial. And we plan to retry it, said Prosecutor Ed Parkinson.
We're on a mission. I don't think it's quixotic, Andy Parker told correspondent Erin Moriarty. And I don't think we're going to fail.

Anderson Cooper: And you can get a photo out of it. You can capture it.
MONCEF SLAOUI: --to the population. They are more infectious, and, therefore, they will further exacerbate the surge that we are having.
Our weapon system is basically your tool to keep yourself and your friends alive and then do the job at hand, he said.
Spanning from 1912 to the dawn of 1926, Downton Abbey was always about change. The Old versus the New. Time-honored values accosted by modernity. Social graces under fire.
Matthew, who was a taxi driver before going to work at the University of Virginia hospital, also had been accused of raping students in 2002 and 2003 at Liberty University and Christopher Newport University, where he had played football. But those cases were dropped when the women declined to press charges.
Amazing, because same to him, he replied.
The DNA evidence in the Fairfax sexual assault, in turn, linked Matthew to the Harrington case, authorities have said.
Even if the lethality doesn't go up, the fact that it is so much more transmittable is a very real problem, he said.
The perihelion isn't the only celestial event this weekend. Saturday night into Sunday morning also marks the peak of the Quadrantid meteor shower — one of the best of the year.

Yeah. You never know what anybody is gonna say, he replied.
Raben said there was a horrible dynamic last week in Judge Rosemarie Aquilina's courtroom, even if the judge had the option to allow so many people to speak in a case that involved just seven victims.
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: No. We have great compliance. We look at our data. People are moving less. I was talking to the head of the Red Cross out here who just moved from another state. She was blown away by how many people wear masks compared to where she was coming from. This is something now that really is spreading in the home. And once you get past that tipping point, and it's a message for all of America, we might not all have the same density as Los Angeles. But what's happening in Los Angeles can and will be coming to many communities across America. If you get two households together for Christmas, if you went to a New Year's gathering even if it was people you know and love so you thought it was okay. That's when this virus exploits that weakness and is going far. L.A. was the first place to close places down that-- where people meet, have a mask mandate, offer widespread testing to folks with or without symptoms, surge into our senior and skilled nursing facilities--
The length of time that it takes for rigor mortis to set in, I think I've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so I'm not sure. And if I'm not sure, I'm not sure a jury member is sure, Gough pointed out.
They called the police and the FBI which got them nowhere.
Hundreds of Christians calling for the removal of the sculpture, entitled McJesus, demonstrated at the museum in the northern city of Haifa last week. Israeli police say rioters hurled a firebomb at the museum and threw stones that wounded three police officers. Authorities dispersed the crowds with tear gas and stun grenades.

The Philadelphia Eagles will start the game with the ball and hope to be the first team to score on the opening possession of the Super Bowl since Devin Hester returned the opening kickoff for a touchdown for Chicago against Indianapolis in the 2007 game.
It costs anywhere between $5,000 to $11,000 per year for a young kid in travel expenses, just for registration fees. And most kids can't afford it anymore, she said.
SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --at this point really is a public health win.
The leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the Trump administration. They help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest.
Cory was all about family. She had a great childhood growing up, she replied. She wanted the big family. ...The happy marriage.
Digging into the consumer price index (CPI, chart above), energy is playing a big role, with gasoline prices up 7.8 percent as we eclipse last February's energy price wipeout before OPEC started teasing a production freeze agreement that was eventually finalized late last year. But other areas of upward price pressure include apparel, new vehicles, household furnishings, housing and medical care. So the forces are broad-based.

A timid boy named Chiron is having a tough time growing up in Liberty City, one of Miami's poorest neighborhoods.
Andy Parker: We shouldn't have to be the ones policing their platform. Their terms of service say, We don't allow this. We don't allow violent content. We don't allow harassment. My biggest beef with Google, and YouTube, and Facebook for that matter is, that video is still out there. It's still out there today in essence, they profit from my daughter's murder. And I can't abide by that.
U.S. Soccer has $150 million in surplus funds and they don't put it back to the youth in America, and so it's really become this sport here in America that's dedicated to the rich white kid and we are excluding so many potential great youth players, Solo said. U.S. Soccer's mission statement is to make soccer the preeminent sport here in the United States. We can't do that unless we make it accessible and affordable for every young kid in America.
U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which administers DACA, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.

Brian McCarthy of the NFL public relations team says that 67,612 fans were in attendance to watch Super Bowl LII Sunday night:
MARY TYLER MOORE: Expectations, perfectionism, loath to communicate any failings.
He wasn't just any player. Lovelace, who studied business administration, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the Big Ten -- a team captain who lead the University of Illinois to the Big Ten Championship his senior year.
If you are reading this I am no more, Dulos wrote in the note. I refuse to spend even an hour more in jail for something I had NOTHING to do with. Enough is enough. If it takes my head to end this, so be it.
He's targeted because he's invented ways to fight back. He copyrighted photos of his son to control how they are used. He published a letter to Facebook's CEO that read, [You] have deemed… our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.
It's one of the great touchstones of Americana: the romance and possibility of the open road. All hail the 18-wheeler hugging those asphalt ribbons, transporting all of our stuff across the fruited plains, from sea to shining sea. Though we may not give it a second thought when we click that free shipping icon, truckers move 70% of the nation's goods. But trucking cut a considerably different figure on a humid Sunday last summer on the Florida turnpike. Starsky Robotics, a tech startup, may have been driving in the right lane, but they passed the competition with 35,000 pounds of steel thundering down a busy highway with nobody behind the wheel. The test was a milestone. Starsky was the first company to put a truck on an open highway without a human on board. Everyone else in the game with the know-how keeps a warm body in the cab as backup. For now, anyway. If you didn't hear about this, you're not alone; in Jacksonville, we talked to Jeff Widdows, his son Tanner, Linda Allen and Eric Richardson - all truckers; and all astonished to learn how far this technology has come.
It bothered me for years, said Keller.
As the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and gossip continue.
This is very offensive and I cannot consider this art, Haifa artist and devout Christian Amir Ballan said. We will continue through peaceful rallies and candle vigils... We won't be quiet until we reach a solution.
The charge against Matthew in the Graham case was later upgraded to capital murder, giving prosecutors the option to seek the death penalty.
Jon Wertheim: No one's talkin' about it at work.
Jenkins said, I think it's really important to remind, reinforce people that their lives have value, you know? That their lives have worth.
I think it -- it is definitely time to open, Keller replied.
Spokeswoman Toril Hofshagen from the Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate called the landslide unique in its destruction.
The pictures show Cory's body in bed - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the air.
This company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.
Harrington's father Dan Harrington also spoke before the judge, reading a statement prepared by his family, reports CBS affiliate WTVR.
Jon Wertheim: Or how-- how often you test?

Eagles score three now leading 32-26.
Douglas Leff, the top FBI official in Puerto Rico, told CBS News the island is facing a crisis of violence fueled by drug trafficking and gang turf wars.
MARK STRASSMANN: More than three million Georgians have already voted. Some in lines, almost four hours long. The wildcard: President Trump's groundless griping about election fraud here and its impact on Republican turnout this Tuesday.
Maatje Benassi: Yes. Once my address was posted, that was it for me. That did it. Because they put me in danger, my family.

The Patriots will take over looking for their first points in the first quarter in eight Super Bowl appearances with quarterback Tom Brady.
Lenny Pozner: I don't think they were prepared for their online platforms to be used this way. I think they were more focused on growth and expansion and likely had more of an idealized notion of the internet and the way it would be used for the greater good.
But the IRS cautioned, The bank information shown in Get My Payment will be a number associated with your Direct Express card and may be a number you don't recognize.

His prize possession: a 1948 Pontiac silver streak. The sort of car his father always noticed when Clinch was a kid.
There was nothing to prepare us for this, it was probably worst day of my life, she said.
As if it weren't tough enough to get a date as you get older, dating site Tinder also charges more if you're over 30. But now a California appeals court has revived a lawsuit that alleges Tinder's pricing discriminates against older users, who must pay more to access certain features of its service. That ruling was a reversal of a lower-court decision.
MARGARET BRENNAN: There are reports, though, in the U.K. that more children are becoming ill. From the models you've seen, what does this new virus strain do to children?
Her time with the team came to an explosive end in 2016 when the United States Soccer Federation terminated her contract for negative comments she made about an opposing team at the Rio Olympics. Now, Solo has launched a bid to lead the same organization that axed her.
The Choctaw tribe agreed to let Lexi stay with the Pages until she could be re-united with relatives. The tribe's statement Monday said the Choctaw nation desires the best for this Choctaw child.
It'll make people think twice about staying, Vaughan said in a telephone interview with CBS News. I think it'll help.
Look, if Harry Truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this President doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border, Rep. Adam Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told CNN Sunday. So that's a non-starter.
Cloth surgical masks are not helpful
How much government revenue it would raise: Saez and Zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. Penn Wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.
He had me express for him in court how terribly sorry he is for everything that's happened, and how much he loves his family and is sorry for everything they've been put through because of this, Ramseur said.
Can you show me? Maher asked.
And regardless what happens next, Park has the conviction of knowing where home is.
Even though the latest round of trade talks between the U.S. and China ended without word of progress, investors were heartened that there were no evident signs of setbacks either.
MARK STRASSMANN: In dual runoffs here, if Republican Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue both lose, Democrats will seize control of the Senate. It would be a fifty-fifty split with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris breaking any tie vote.

On Feb. 4 2016, closing arguments begin. Curtis Lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his own murder trial. His new wife, Christine, says the trial has taken a toll -- especially on Curtis' sons.
Gerson said the change reflects the organization's efforts to expand eligibility. Legal permanent residents and residents of U.S. territories like Puerto Rico have also been allowed to apply in recent years.
Yes. Absolutely, Gough replied. I mean, bigger they come, the harder they fall.
The state's first confirmed diagnosis of the contagious new strain was detected in Saratoga Springs. The man who tested positive is affiliated with a jewelry store there, CBS New York reported. The person had no known travel history, Cuomo said.
The stimulus checks are actually a tax rebate that can be applied to your annual tax returns — but that means people may be waiting weeks or even months for their stimulus money to show up through their tax refund.
Paula: You gonna tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time, huh?
What's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, Bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. For instance, Bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans lowered it in late 2017. (Rivals like Pete Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren would like to roll back Mr. Trump's corporate tax cut completely.) That 2017 corporate-rate change saved Bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.
King Harald V, Queen Sonja and Crown Prince Haakon plan to visit the disaster area on Sunday to pay their respects to the victims and to meet with residents and rescue workers. The 83-year-old monarch said in his New Year's speech that the royal family had been deeply moved by the tragedy.
Now it takes nothing away from this glorious series to recognize that change, and a resistance to changing, has paved the way for the show's impending end.
I will solidly give the president credit for doing it, said Lindsey.

Rafael George Macias has worked as a radio technician for the Sheboygan County Sheriff's Department since 2011 after performing similar duties as a contract employee for 10 years.
During a Wednesday court hearing, the former hospital orderly pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and two counts of abduction with intent to defile in the September 2014 death of 18-year-old University of Virginia student Hannah Graham and the 2009 death of 20-year-old Virginia ech student Morgan Harrington. Matthew, 35, made no statement to the judge and showed little emotion.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I-- I thought it was, interesting. Governor Hutchinson sort of leaned into that concept, saying they were looking at what the governors of Florida and Texas have done with making this available to other age populations at this point. Would you ask of-- other governors to do that? Because Governor DeSantis was really kind of hit hard by, you know, images of long lines of older people waiting. It didn't seem to be moving quickly in terms of vaccinations, though, he widened the number of people who qualify for it.
Maatje Benassi: First they said I brought it to China. And when I crashed, I spread it. And that I spread it in the hospital which I never was in a hospital. All these lies about vials in my bicycle hidden. And I have no idea.
Most of her two million fellow truckers are less enthusiastic. Automated trucking threatens to jack-knife an entire $800 billion industry. Trucking is among the most common jobs for american's without a college education. So this disruption caused by the driverless truck, it cuts deep.
That could be risky, said Martin.
Curtis Lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago.
Throughout her long acting career, Moore produced and starred in plays, including Sweet Sue. She won a Tony award for a role as a quadriplegic in the play, Whose Life Is It Anyway?
Merely bad commercials often lose the plot because they're trying to push the envelope, often with humor. One notorious spot came from Snickers in 2007, which showed two mechanics snacking on opposite ends of a candy bar, meeting in the middle with a kiss. The men, shocked, try to prove their heterosexuality by tearing out their chest hair and, in one version, fighting. The spot was condemned as homophobic.
Our little girl, Morgan was killed by Jesse Matthew. How can that be? The brutality and intentionality of Morgan's murder pierces our every day, and will continue to do so until we join her, his statement read.
The battle for the Super Bowl isn't just waged on the field: Dozens of advertisers are collectively spending more than $350 million to reach the game's massive audience.
But everything fell apart on Valentine's Day 2006, when Belko got a call from Curtis's father that Cory had died.
Dead air time during the Super Bowl was because of a brief equipment failure that was quickly resolved, according to an NBC Sports spokesman Sunday. The program went black for about 20 seconds in the first half, but no game action or commercial time was missed, the spokesman said.

I do everything from texting to emails, social media. Everything, he said.
There are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: Warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. Billionaires would pay 6%. That should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as Bloomberg proposes.
Lyndsay's dad was a man on the move. In 2005, he opened up his own law firm while still at the state's attorney's office. Years later, he left to concentrate on his own practice. And, if his schedule wasn't busy enough, Lovelace was elected president of the school board. He became a captain in the Illinois National Guard, and an adjunct professor at Quincy University.
MONCEF SLAOUI: Yes, so a scientific answer and then an alternative. I think it's not reasonable when vaccines have been developed with two doses given twenty-one days apart, or twenty-eight days given apart, and where we have the data on their safety and their efficacy and we have no-- after two doses. We have no data after one dose. If we leave people a month, two months, three months with maybe incomplete immunity, waning immunity, maybe even the wrong kind of immune response induced, that is then corrected by the second dose--
The U.S. Surgeon General put it bluntly: Seriously people — STOP BUYING MASKS!
Democratic presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg says he would pay more to Uncle Sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans. What the former New York City mayor hasn't said: He'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. Bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.
It was one of the best days, you know, in our lives, said Belko.
It happened in that space, McCraney said. And it was probably one of the most terrifying moments for me, 'cause it was always -- you just never knew what was gonna happen.
Moncef Slaoui , Operation Warp Speed Chief Adviser
Bloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. That includes him: Bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to Forbes.
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI (D-Los Angeles/@MayorOfLA): Good morning, Margaret. Good to be with you.
Welch quickly climbed the ranks at GE, becoming its youngest chairman and CEO in 1981 at age 45. He also shook up the company laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. That earned him the unwanted nickname Neutron Jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact.
Oh, they're all, like, 'Alex, you're a big movie star now. Slide me some change!' he laughed.

CIA director Gina Haspel has named Cynthia Didi Rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the Directorate of Analysis. Rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official Haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months.
And-- if they were stuck in this position, they're in rigor-- what does that tell you at that point? Maher asked.
To a Marine infantryman like Sgt. Joshua Sherman, his weapon may mean the difference between success and failure, life and death.
It's actually tendinitis, when the tendon that bends and flexes the thumb becomes inflamed. More and more people are complaining about this type of pain in their thumb each year, say doctors at the Mayo Clinic.

For Det. Adam Gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher.
USA Gymnastics cut ties with the ranch earlier this month, a few days after Olympic champion Simone Biles said she dreaded the thought of having to return there to train.
Washington's victories led to the birth of a nation, and that story is written in this collection -- artifacts of an act of defiance that would literally change the world.
Congress can cancel a national emergency, but it would require a rare amount of bipartisanship. Congress would have to approve a joint resolution disapproving the national emergency, which would easily pass the Democratic-controlled House but could face opposition in the Republican-majority Senate. If both houses pass the joint resolution, it would require the president's signature, and Mr. Trump would be unlikely to sign a bill which overturns his own declaration.
It did not, Keller said. It just didn't seem to add up.

One person they were keeping in mind, because he's on TV so frequently in Texas, is Mike Bloomberg, he added, noting the billionaire's strategy of creating an impression with voters via paid ads while his opponents — fighting it out in Iowa, New Hampshire and elsewhere — have yet to make an impression in the Lone Star State.
The only case that's out there that's even similar in stature is Penn State, and this is now six times as big as Penn State, maybe seven times, Grewal said, referring to boys who said they were sexually abused by assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky.
CBS Philadelphia reports thousands of fans have taken to the streets in Philadelphia to revel in their home team's win over the Patriots at Super Bowl LII.
JO ANN JENKINS: Well, I think one of the things that we've tried to do at AARP is, you know, we have AARP.org/coronavirus where we're listing everything that we have from the states about what-- how the vaccine, the priorities in each of the states, how they're going to be able to get their vaccinations. Clearly, we're hearing directly from our members that they are confused about whether or not they should be calling their physician, whether or not someone's going to contact them, which of the vaccines should they be trying to take if they live in rural America or in an urban city, just how that's going to happen. And I think that there could be some simple clarity and transparency about what is to be expected, the time frame that individuals all across this country should be thinking about. Clearly, we need to keep up the protections of wearing mask and washing our hands and doing all of those things. We shouldn't let our guard down. But there needs to be further clarity about and-- and expectations set about when this vaccines are going to be administered widely.

GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: Well, there are a number of challenges and we've got to do better both at the federal and at the state level. One of the challenges is that we have a limited supply. And when you have a limited supply that means you've got to prioritize and you've got to make sure you're giving it to those with the greatest needs, or those of the greatest risk. And that's a challenge in and of itself. Secondly, you do have some reluctance and that creates some complications. We're focusing on our long-term care facilities and that has to have consents in many instances and that slows up the process. But even with that, we have to do better.

At least nine buildings with over 30 apartments were destroyed.
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Absolutely. And we've actually had a lower incidence of COVID-19 among our un-housed population than those of us in housing because of the way we did plan. And we did bring medical personnel to the streets and we have distributed masks. And that is a great platform to help make sure that vaccines are going to go to the most vulnerable. In fact, this week we stood up three and we're about to do four more seven community walk-up vaccine sites for folks that are working right now in some of our community clinics, working on places like Skid Row. But to go to your point earlier, the federal government can't tell the local governments and state governments to do something and not give us aid.

So, no, we're not moving fast enough.

For so many who have called themselves Eagles fans for a generation, this is the day, the game, the season, and the team we've dreamed of. The 2017-18 Philadelphia Eagles are Super Bowl Champions, and they've brought tremendous joy to hundreds of thousands throughout the City and region. They consistently wowed us with their dynamic play and relentless pursuit of victory. Their Next Man Up mentality when injuries arose was inspiring to anyone who has ever faced a setback, as was their willingness to embrace the role of underdogs. They looked another storied football franchise in the eyes, and never blinked. So to every member of the Eagles, from owners Jeff and Tina Lurie, and Christina Weiss Lurie, to Howie Roseman and the entire front office staff, to Doug Pederson and his coaches, and to the players who won our hearts with their resilient and exciting play: thank you. You are champions, and your accomplishments will forever be part of the rich history of Philadelphia sports. To the fans: I have long felt that our City's professional and collegiate sports teams bring Philadelphians together, regardless of race, income, neighborhood or gender, and that was never more true than during the Eagles' brilliant season. We know you have waited years, some for decades, for the chance to crown your Birds as champs. I urge everyone to celebrate in a way that is safe and respectful to everyone from neighbors to strangers. Go forth and celebrate, but do so in a way that will make Philadelphia shine.
Danny Clinch: Yeah. It is - I get out there and I'm like, Jeez, I should probably have some earplugs. And then I'm like, I forgot them.

Welch took over the industrial giant in 1981 at a time when the U.S. economy was emerging from recession and conglomerates were falling out of style among investors. The executive took GE's many industrial divisions global and instituted a management method for better testing the profitability of its divisions, selling off those that were underperforming. That led to higher profits, but also massive layoffs. GE cut more than 100,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its employees, during Welch's tenure.
You know that universal sign we give truckers, hoping they'll sound their air horns? Well, you're going to be hearing a lot less honking in the future. And with good reason. The absence of an actual driver in the cab. We may focus on the self-driving car, but autonomous trucking is not an if, it's a when. And the when is coming sooner than you might expect. Already, companies have been quietly testing their prototypes on public roads. Right now, there's a high-stakes, high-speed race pitting the usual suspects, Google and Tesla and other global tech firms, against small start-ups smelling opportunity. The driverless semi will convulse the trucking sector and the two million American drivers who turn a key and maneuver their big rig every day. And the winners of this derby, they may be poised to make untold billions, they'll change the U.S. transportation grid and they will emerge as the new kings of the road.

MONCEF SLAOUI: --to give them-- well, it is-- we-- I'm-- I'm going to tell you the alternative in one second. Just let me finish the point I'm making, which is we always said that these vaccines will be developed on the basis of science and all decisions will be made transparently on the basis of data. Changing the decisions made, the choices made, which was to give two doses of vaccine, the second dose gives you ten times higher immune response than the first dose, without any data I think would not be responsible. Here is the alternative. We know that for the Moderna vaccine, giving half the dose to people between the age of eighteen and fifty-five, two doses, half the dose, which means exactly achieving the objective of immunizing double the number of people with the doses we have. We know it induces identical immune response to the hundred microgram dose and, therefore, we are in discussion with Moderna and with the FDA. Of course, ultimately it will be an FDA decision to accelerate--

As many Americans come together to watch the Super Bowl, Melania and I extend our greetings and appreciation for those who make occasions like this possible, particularly the brave men and women of our Armed Forces, Mr. Trump's statement read.
Nonetheless, Parker's parents, Barbara and Andy, have turned their grief into motivation to require tougher background checks for gun purchases, and to close loopholes in gun purchase requirements, in spite of strong lobbying by gun rights proponents (such as the NRA) against such laws.
GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: We have to act with a sense of urgency and we can do that. We have to learn whenever you're in a battle that you have to adjust to the circumstances of that battle.
They play the traditional music of New Orleans. A distinctive sound -- and some distinctive instruments.

The interview is part of a special edition of Sunday Morning, titled Guns and America, which looks at the role of firearms in the country from a variety of historical, cultural, political and personal points of view.
Given her past, some say she may be a great athlete but that she's not the best role model.
What in that file made you say, 'Huh, I'm gonna go find the pictures and the hard copy of this file? Maureen Maher asked the detective.
So she was on her back. And her arms were like this. A little bit lower than that, she replied, positioning Maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.

The event could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another county that ended with Nassar getting sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. The judge in that case described it as signing the doctor's death warrant.

SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's possible. You know we were hoping that we'd have more injections in people's arms at this point and the vaccine could be starting to have an impact on the trajectory of the epidemic. And the new variant certainly creates more risk that this epidemic peak could get extended. We're going to see the epidemic probably peak at some point this month, hopefully earlier in the month. I mean, that was the original estimates and the original modeling. But the lag in terms of the effect on a health care system is going to be about three weeks. And so the health care system is not going to see maximal resource utilization told closer to the end of the month. And that's when we're likely to see the peak number of deaths on a daily basis as well. So we still have a ways to go with this current surge of this epidemic until we start to see cases decline, hospitalizations start to decline, and, hopefully, deaths start to decline. The new variant does create a lot of risk, however, that we start to see accelerated spread.

Welch, trained as chemical engineer, championed the belief that the main job of a CEO was to boost shareholder wealth. I had plenty of money in the first three years I was CEO — the next 17 was spent making other people rich, Welch said two years ago in an interview. I mean it's a turn-on. I used to call guys in my office and give them a million bucks. You realize how good that feels?
What did he say happened? Maher asked Steve Belko.
CBS News' Jamie Yuccas snaps a picture ahead of Justin Timberlake's performance.
Search teams patrolled with dogs as helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras flew amid harsh winter conditions over the ravaged hillside in Ask, a village of 5,000 people 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of Oslo.
Parker and Ward were killed by a former coworker as they were reporting live on the morning news in Roanoke, Va., last August. The man who shot them had passed a background check and legally bought the gun he used to kill the two reporters and seriously wound another person, before taking his own life.
After police named Matthew a person of interest in Graham's disappearance, he fled and was later apprehended on a beach in southeast Texas. He was charged with abduction with intent to defile, a felony that empowered police to swab his cheek for a DNA sample. That sample connected Matthew to the 2005 sexual assault in Fairfax, a Virginia suburb of Washington, according to authorities.
By then, it was about 9 a.m.

The data collected by every truck, along every mile, it's uploaded and used by TuSimple, they say only to perfect performance on the road. Maureen Fitzgerald is convinced that tusimple's technology is superior to human drivers.

What did you think of @jtimberlake at halftime? #SuperBowl — CBS This Morning ❄️ (@CBSThisMorning) February 5, 2018
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: --we could have been training out of work folks and students to be ready. We knew that the surge was coming in the winter. We also knew that the same medical personnel who would need to give the vaccines, if we were lucky to get them by the end of the year and we did, would also be pulled into those hospitals to treat people.
Hibbert added, At first I was watching to see if my mom was there, 'cause my mom is very strict and she doesn't like me saying 'words.'
How many people would pay Bloomberg's wealth surcharge: Income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. But that might not be true for Bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.
Matt Benassi: There was like 60 or 70 death threats over the span of, you know, four or five weeks.
The last witness to speak at Nassar's sentencing hearing last week was Rachael Denhollander, a Kentucky lawyer and one of the first women to publicly identify herself as one of Nassar's young victims. Denhollander contacted Michigan State University police in 2016 after reading reports about how USA Gymnastics, which trains Olympians, mishandled complaints of sexual misconduct. Nassar worked at Michigan State and also was the national gymnastics squad's doctor.
ELIZABETH PALMER: One in London has hit hard, too, and hospitals are at full capacity. So, it was a huge relief when regulators approved the cheap and easily stored Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine just before the New Year. Tomorrow, it will be rolled out in Britain with such urgency that for now people will only get one shot of it or the Pfizer vaccine, instead of the recommended two, to make supplies go further. Israel's vaccine program is in full swing. It hopes to be the first country in the world to immunize all its citizens by sometime in March. That's likely to be before some countries in Africa even get started. COVID ruined most New Year's parties. In London, small groups of people hoping for fireworks were chased away by mounted police.
The company plans to develop the plot in the next three to four years, building luxury housing along with up to 2,500 units of affordable housing, Feldman said. He added that none of the mobile home residents would be forced to move if they didn't want to. He also denied that mobile home residents have been evicted, describing the eviction notices as a negotiating tactic.
How much government revenue it would raise: The Sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. Penn Wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.
They don't like us. They don't worry about us. They want more money, she told CBS News.
Is it the trial of century in Quincy? Maher asked Gough. Yes, he replied.
The practice of allowing accusers to speak even if they are not tied directly to a case has raised questions about fairness. But attorneys say the victim statements probably pose little risk on appeal, especially since Nassar pleaded guilty, agreed to allow the statements and is expected to get another long prison sentence as part of his deal with prosecutors.
And I've had a long time to think about that and it's almost frustrating not to remember, because you want to, she said in an interview with Dreasler.
Scott Pelley: Have you seen a difference, a practical difference in Facebook?
It did. I think, probably five of the jurors said, 'There is no way anybody is ever gonna change my mind.' And two of those, I think, were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror Mike Hayden said. And that just deflated me so much.
I don' think the case should've been brought to start with ... all they got is circumstantial evidence, no smoking guns, a resident told 48 Hours.
I never had any, Belko replied.
GOVERNOR ASA HUTCHINSON: No, there has-- there is a plan and that plan has been coordinated at the federal level, but let me lay it out for you. In phase one, we're supposed to be doing our health care workers and we're doing our long-term care facilities, residents and staff. The federal government allocates that based upon where we want it to go, but they're working through the pharmacies and they made a contract with Walgreens and with CVS, two major chain pharmacies. But the states can or-- or the local long-term care facilities can opt out. Sixty percent of ours opted out for independent pharmacies. They're doing a better job of getting it out than the chain pharmacies. They are acting with more urgency. And so that's an example of where I have learned that whenever you look now at the challenges with a specific population, what it's going to be like when we move to essential workers and whenever we move--
Giles asked, When you typed the word 'faggot' for the first time, and you saw it on the page, what did you think?
Wages certainly look poised for a move higher, assuming the tepid but steady payroll gains continue. The National Federation of Independent Business survey found a growing shortage of qualified, desirable applicants. The latest numbers show the net share of small companies saying they're receiving inadequate applicants for job postings rose to 47 percent from 44 percent in December.
Completing the play the Patriots couldn't, Nick Foles caught a touchdown pass from tight end Trey Burton on fourth down before the end of the second quarter. The gutsy play call puts the Eagles up 22-12.
And why is that, just because of who he is?
Hurst hadn't tuned in the morning news that day because, he explains, Parker claimed she'd mess up if she knew he was watching. Hurst added that he lost everything that day.
With the backing of Harvard, Park applied for the Rhodes scholarship last year as part of a broader effort to underscore how DACA recipients didn't qualify for the venerated award and others like it. The scholarship was created in 1902 by British businessmen and politician Cecil Rhodes and provides all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --seems to be, you know, frustrating for people here because they want it now. So, what about jumpstarting--
I believe he did it, said Stevens.
Christine Lovelace says she will never stop fighting to clear her husband's name.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, let's get to that solution then because it is the fastest vaccine development in Western history. Congratulations to you as overseeing that part of it. Now, we're at the really complicated part of actually getting it to Americans. The President twice this week has blamed the states for failing to distribute it. If they're not up to the task, what are you doing in Operation Warp Speed to help them?
People thought I was crazy to leave what was really a good career trajectory at GE to take this big risk on a start-up. But actually I believed in my heart that I could achieve more of the goals I'd set out for myself and make a bigger difference in the world if I had done it, Case said.

Now, he watches the Parkers honor their daughter's spirit by fighting for change. That fight, however, comes with risks, as they have become targets, he tells Moriarty: But, we don't have any fear. We really feel like [Alison]'s guiding us, and we're just following her lead.
Kate Warne, an investment strategist for Edward Jones, said the market's large moves reflect investors' questions about major issues including economic growth, the threats of recession and trade tensions, and rising interest rates. She said it's normal for stocks to change course as traders grapple with those issues on a day-to-day basis.
The world is a different place from the way it was, my lord, says the butler, Carson (Jim Carter), to his boss Robert Crawley, the Earl of Grantham (Hugh Bonneville). Then, with stiff-upper-lip resolve, he adds, Downton Abbey must change with it.
Danny Clinch: Somehow I can't remember what happened after that.
Was there a life insurance policy, Maher ask Gough.
Part of our delight from Downton was following the struggle of getting through as waged by those who seemed to have it all. We feasted on how the 1-percenters of that day kept up appearances, however much they seemed to be living on borrowed time.
Macias told The Associated Press on Thursday that he never lied about his past and was upfront with Sheriff Todd Priebe when he wanted to bring him on as a regular employee. Details of the case resurfaced when an anonymous letter was sent recently to media outlets, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, questioning why Sheboygan County employees had to work with someone who committed such a horrible crime.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the vaccine that is being distributed now? You've publicly called for the vaccine manufacturers and the federal government to deliver more, but it's your governor who controls the distribution. Is he not giving you what you need?
Oil prices also continued to rally. U.S. crude was on track to rise for the eighth day in the last nine and jumped 2.3 percent to $49.71 per barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 1.7 percent to $58.33 a barrel in London.
It's unfortunate we still have to talk about gender, because it's not really relevant to the quality of the work – it's relevant to the diversity of the work. But I think she's very brave for appointing so many women, Medina said of Haspel's leadership choices.
But making social media liable would also mean Facebook, Twitter, even Wikipedia and Yelp, couldn't exist as we know them. President-elect Biden wants to revoke Section 230. The federal government is already suing to break up Facebook and Google. No one can say what social media 2.0 will look like or whether the innocent will ever be protected from a world wide web of lies.
Norwegian police have published the names and birth years of the 10 people initially reported missing, including a 2-year-old child. Officials haven't yet identified the three recovered bodies.
Jeff Kosseff: So the difference between a social media site and let's say the Letters to the Editor page of The New York Times is the vast amount of content that they deliver. So I mean you might have five or ten letters to the editor on a page. You could have I think it's 6,000 tweets per second. And so Section 230 really recognizes how exceptional the internet is and says, We want to encourage this marketplace of ideas. 25 years later, that marketplace has a lot of really great stuff, but it also has a lot of really terrible products in that marketplace. And that's really what's driving this debate right now.
Lenny Pozner: Conversations denying the tragedy-- accusing the government of staging it.
And finally, here is Jeter being introduced to the Yankee Stadium crowd:
Chuck Price: We believe we'll be able to do our first driver-out demonstration runs on public highways in 2021.
In 2012, Moore was honored for her remarkable body of work.
Giles asked Hibbert, How does that make you feel?
MAYOR ERIC GARCETTI: Well, I respectfully disagree because I said six months ago, calling with Senator Chris Coons and a bipartisan coalition in Washington for a Care Corps, a Cares Corps that would have trained people for all sorts of things, including vaccine distribution, while Washington dithered, while they went on vacations, while they didn't pass a relief bill for seven or eight months--
Chuck Price: We did not disengage. This vehicle will detect that kind of behavior faster than the humans.
The candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before President Trump took office. That would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.
The Bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. Here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about Bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other Democratic candidates have proposed, including Sanders and Warren as well as Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar.
In social media, trends change rapidly. Last week's Snapchat could be this week's Yik Yak. What is consistent is the shift toward personal, private communications through larger social channels. For instance, members of Generation Z -- the group younger than millennials, born in 1996 or later -- have gravitated away from the very public forums presented by social networks like Facebook and Twitter and toward messaging apps that are immediate, visual, impermanent, and most crucially private. It is a more intimate take on the kind of social media interaction that exploded in popularity over the past decade.
NEW YORK -- Sunday night at Yankee Stadium, the New York Yankees celebrated Derek Jeter's career by retiring his No. 2 jersey and enshrining him in Monument Park. Many great Yankees were in attendance.

Downton Abbey may well have reached a what-do-we-do-now point in its told-and-retold cycle of ailments, heartache, duplicity and politesse, plus withering commentary from the Dowager Countess, as played by Maggie Smith (who in the finale weighs in on what makes the English the way they are by observing tartly, Some say our history. But I blame the weather).

The carvings on a soldier's powder horn show that the stakes were high, with phrases like kill or be killed and liberty or death.
MONCEF SLAOUI: Well, its-- and its capacity to spread is higher. Frankly, I'm-- I'm not very clear about the data showing a differential in accelerated spread between adults and children, but the fact of the matter is it will spread faster into the population. I think it should be a signal, again, to say what we need to do as a population is wear masks, distance ourselves, wash our hands, be very aware of people around us and continue to be very careful around the transmission.
Quincy Police Detective Jeff Baird would not speak to 48 Hours. But that day he did speak with Curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning Curtis swears to police and to friends, Cory was still very much alive.

The fight over a border wall is a typical issue of 'fighting the last war': ten years ago was the fight against Mexican migration to the U.S., Capps said in a telephone interview with CBS News. The problem isn't Mexican migration anymore. Now the immigration problem is overstayers, not border crossers.
Danny Clinch: I'm not like a strong-arm guy. I want to collaborate.

The Yankees also presented Jeter with various gifts to mark the occasion. He received a replica of the Monument Park plaque and retired number, as well as 14-karat white gold career milestone ring. Here's the ring and the gift reveals:
Anderson Cooper: Wow. I'm surprised you can even hear me.
I don't hear anyone in this little triad saying, 'No way, no how, he didn't do it,' Maher said to the Lovelace's friends. There's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'My friend didn't do it.'
That morning seemed like so many others. According to Curtis Lovelace, Cory helped get the kids ready. They had breakfast and jumped in dad's car. It was 8:15 a.m.
Lenny Pozner: That Noah did not die. That I'm not Noah's father. It all revolves around the notion that these are staged shootings, that they're scripted events, that I'm an actor, that I'm paid to fake the death of a child.
She'd been dead long enough that there was no need to start CPR. It wouldn't do any good, said Miller.
It is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as I work towards my dream of competing in Tokyo 2020, I will have to continually return to the same training facility where I was abused, Biles said in a statement.
Trump also criticized the Republican Party for not doing enough to hold the president accountable. She said that their refusal to take action after the violent insurrection has left Mr. Trump feeling enabled to do whatever he feels he needs to do in order to stay in the Oval Office.
They had heard about racial profiling following the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but never personally experienced it.
Case also tells of her own story, jumping from a comfortable job at GE to a startup.
In late December, Colorado became the first state to confirm a case of the variant, in a man in his 20s with no travel history. Southern California reported a case soon after in a 30-year-old man with no travel history, and public health officials in Florida said they had also discovered evidence of a case in a man in his 20s with no travel history.
The former USA Gymnastics sports doctor pleaded guilty to molesting girls and young women. Some of the nation's top gymnasts, including Olympians Aly Raisman, McKayla Maroney, Simone Biles and Jordyn Wieber, said they were among his victims.

While there has been an increase in Central American migrants arriving at the southern border recently, a vast majority have claimed asylum, a legal mode of immigration, said Capps.
Which statutes could Mr. Trump use to build the wall?
With this administration maybe the best thing she can do is make sure all the 'I's are dotted and 'T's are crossed – it's a difficult time, Medina said. You need a really firm foundation and to make sure everything is being done well before you have the space to innovate.
Ironically, the National Emergencies Act of 1975 was intended to constrain the power of the presidency, to create a structure for the president to declare national emergencies in the post-Watergate era. Under that law, the president can declare a national emergency, but must outline the specific emergency powers he is using under existing statutes. So Mr. Trump would have to justify his actions using acts already passed by Congress.
Lenny Pozner: I was being attacked, the memory of my son, my son's very short life was being attacked. And I just wasn't going to stand for that.
I want people to remember Cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told Maher. The jury will decide if somebody took that life from her.
JO ANN JENKINS: Well, I think if you look at the data of where people are dying and if, in fact we can stop people from dying of COVID, we know that that will offer some relief to the hospitals all across this country. We have examples that we're hearing from thousands of our members, particularly like those in Florida, who are standing in lines of three, four hundred of them at three and four o'clock in the morning trying to-- to get that vaccination. I think that we have to really solve this issue and really come together so that there is some standard for which the states and the local nursing homes know how they're going to get this vaccine and what it is they're supposed to be doing.
He became arrogant more and more, yes, Belko said. There was a little bit of holier than thou. ...Maybe you were entitled to this living. I think he lost friends over time because of that.
