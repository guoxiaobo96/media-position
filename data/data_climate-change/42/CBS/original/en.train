starbucks is only serving customers to go in the u.s. and canada in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. the coffee chain will also completely close stores in some areas, including in regions which are seeing wider outbreaks of the pathogen.\n\nthe company announced the closures, effective immediately, on sunday. company-run stores in high-risk areas including new york and seattle that have a high count of covid-19 cases, the disease caused by the coronavirus, are among those shutting down. stores in high social-gathering settings such as malls or on university campuses will also be temporarily closed, according to the seattle-based company.\n\nthe contagious illness caused by the coronavirus is also prompting the company to remove chairs at thousands of locations for at least two weeks to help prevent prolonged social gatherings in our cafes, rossann williams, executive vice president at starbucks and the president of u.s. retail operations, said in a statement.\n\nlocations remaining open are pausing the use of all seating including patio seating, modifying the condiment bar and making a change to the cash handling process. those outlets will take orders in-store, through mobile order & pay methods and via drive-thru windows, with delivery still available.\n\nthe moves come a week after starbucks cited the outbreak in saying customers could no longer bring their own cups into its stores. it also expanded catastrophe pay for employees, providing up to 14 days of pay to any starbucks worker diagnosed with, or exposed to, covid-19 so they can stay home.\n\nin its latest announcement, starbucks said it would offer assistance to any workers affected by store closures or reduced hours, including providing catastrophe pay.\n\nstarbucks in january temporarily closed 2,000 restaurants across china — roughly half its shops in the country — due to the outbreak that had been centered in the city of wuhan.\n\nthese are the actions we know are effective based on our experience in china, williams said of the company's measures in the u.s. to contain the virus.\n\nmore than 3,700 people have tested positive for the coronavirus in the u.s., and at least 69 have died. globally, the death toll was just over 6,500 on monday, with the weekend seeing an alarming spike in fatalities in three european nations grappling with aggressive outbreaks.\n\nwhile more than 169,000 people have caught the virus around the world, almost half have already recovered, and the vast majority of cases remain mild.
new york - meal-kit companies have exploded in the past four years, shipping boxes of raw meat, seafood, fresh vegetables and other ingredients to busy city folk who want to skip the supermarket and still cook at home.\n\nnow they want to tempt even more people to give them a try.\n\nbut the companies face several challenges as they grow. they need to hold onto customers they already have, figure out how to ship uncooked food further outside of cities and continue luring funds from increasingly tight-fisted investors. the industry is growing quickly in the u.s., after first gaining popularity in europe, and competition is heating up as more players join the fray.\n\nbecause of that, meal-kit companies are doing all they can to stand out. blue apron started to ship wine last year to pair with its meals. hellofresh began airing tv commercials in november featuring celebrity chef jamie oliver. gobble promises that its meals can be cooked in one pan within 15 minutes. and purple carrot, which ships vegan meals, brought on cookbook author mark bittman to come up with recipes like tofu fries and onion-stuffed crepes.\n\neven martha stewart wants in. the ceo of sequential brands (sqbg), the brand management company that bought martha stewart living last year, said in december that the company is considering a meal kit by the home goods mogul that would be similar to the blue apron model.\n\nmeal kits are shipped to people's doorsteps, and the raw ingredients come in an insulated cardboard box. customers then cook the meals using included step-by-step recipes. each kit comes with enough food to make several meals, which average about $10 each. subscribers can get a new box every week.\n\npeople around the world spent $1.5 billion on these kits last year, with less than half of that coming from the u.s., according to the technomic research group. it was the first time the company measured spending on meal kits.\n\nthe market in the u.s. is expected to grow faster than in any other country in the next five years, to as much as $6 billion by 2020, technomic said.\n\nwe don't know how the market will shake out in five years, but there's going to be some big winners, and there will be some folks that won't make it, said erik thoresen, a principal at technomic.\n\nholding on to customers may prove to be particularly challenging. jumping from one meal-kit service to the next is tempting because many offer free meals or heavily discounted boxes for new subscribers, said thoresen.\n\nto help fund their expansions, the companies also depend on investor cash, which has showed signs of tightening. venture capitalists raised $28.2 billion last year from clients to invest in startups across all industries, down 9.5 percent from the year before, according to the national venture capital association.\n\nshipping raw food isn't easy, either. currently, many customers live in cities, where it's easier to get boxes delivered, said darren seifer, a food and beverage industry analyst at npd group. but expanding into more suburban areas may be tough since homes are more spread apart, he added.\n\ni don't believe we'll see mainstream adoption of home meal kits, seifer said.\n\nkeith and sharon robinson in evanston, illinois, began using meal kits from blue apron and plated about two years ago after finding discounts at daily deals websites groupon (grpn) and gilt city. the kits let the high school vice principal and his pediatrician wife cook healthy meals for their two daughters without having to shop at the grocery store.\n\nit literally comes to the door, keith robinson said. everything is right there -- the little baggies of seasoning and spices, the meat, all the vegetables.\n\nsome meal-kit sellers have shaken up their businesses to get the attention of potential customers and venture capitalists, too.\n\ngobble, based in san francisco, started in 2010 by delivering already-cooked meals that needed only to be heated in a microwave. but growth slowed, and after talking to customers, founder and ceo ooshma garg realized that people actually want to cook.\n\nthey felt guilty feeding their kids out of a microwave, she said.\n\nso, she came up with a different concept: sending raw ingredients that people can cook in one pan in 15 minutes. company workers slice and chop vegetables, marinate meats and simmer sauces at gobble's kitchens before shipping them to subscribers.\n\nthe change was a hit with customers, and it boosted subscribers twentyfold in the first year. investors in silicon valley also liked the new concept, giving gobble nearly $11 million to help it hire more people and ship its meals in more cities around the country.\n\nnew york's purple carrot, meanwhile, last year brought in bittman, whose cookbooks and articles focused on eating plant-based foods for part of the day. purple carrot, founded in 2014, shipped 100,000 meals in its first year. that's small potatoes compared with blue apron and hellofresh, which say they ship millions of meals in a month. but purple carrot has big plans with bittman, who is now a part owner, and the service has since expanded to the west coast.\n\nother kits go beyond dinner, sending ingredients to make cupcakes or smoothies.\n\nfoodstirs, co-owned by buffy the vampire slayer star sarah michelle gellar, ships monthly kits with ingredients and tools to bake chocolate cake pops, vanilla loaf cakes and other treats. and for those who prefer liquid meals, green blender in new york sends boxes of cut fruit, vegetables, chia seeds, almonds and other ingredients that can be dumped into a blender to make a smoothie.\n\nit's really cool that customers have become comfortable getting ingredients and food in the mail, said green blender co-founder jenna tanenbaum.
if you're reading this from the comfort of your home office, you may want to thank ibm for helping to make that possible.\n\nthe technology giant that gave us the floppy disk, automated teller machine and watson supercomputer has also been a trailblazer in terms of allowing employees to work remotely. ibm began allowing some of its employees to work at home during the reagan era, and by 2009 40 percent of its 386,000 staffers worldwide were no longer tethered to a traditional office. tens of thousands more worked remotely at least occasionally, according to a company report.\n\nnow, big blue -- which helped launch the work-from-home movement to slash its real estate costs and retain talent -- has become the latest corporate behemoth to call some of its troops back to the office. honeywell, yahoo, best buy, hewlett-packard and bank of america have made similar moves over the last several years. like ibm, they cited the need to improve teamwork, idea-sharing, speed and agility.\n\nneedless to say, not all their employees are thrilled. some ibmers have reportedly polished up their resumes and begun looking for new jobs.\n\nas more and more companies in the u.s. have adopted work-from-home policies, employees have grown to expect a measure of control over when and where they work -- and they appear to be getting it. last year, 43 percent of employees worked remotely in some capacity, meaning they spent at least some of their time working in a different location than their co-workers, according to a gallup report. that was up from 39 percent in 2012.\n\nibm, however, is among a handful of big employers that are reversing course. last month, the company informed its u.s. marketing team of about 2,600 people that working remotely on a full-time basis would no longer be an option, according to media accounts.\n\nian colley, an ibm spokesman, confirmed that marketing employees have been asked to work out of six new digital marketing facilities located in austin, texas; san francisco; new york city; cambridge, massachusetts; atlanta; and raleigh, north carolina.\n\nas a result, employees who worked remotely -- whether from home or an office other than the one to which they are now assigned -- will need to commute, move, change offices within the same city or find another job. colley declined to say how many staffers are impacted by the policy change or when it takes effect.\n\nibm is helping to pay moving expenses for workers who opt to relocate. for employees who need to move because of the new policy but can't for some reason, ibm will help them find other jobs internally, according to colley.\n\nmost ibm marketing employees already work out of an office (rather than from home) and live within commuting distance of one of the six new facilities, he said.\n\nibm remains committed to work-life balance and still allows members of co-located teams to sometimes work at home, colley said. those teams include not only marketing but also chief information officers, the watson division and certain software development groups.\n\nas marketing shifts to digital marketing, the need to work in an agile way becomes more apparent, said colley, explaining the reason for the new marketing-department policy.\n\nmarketing is no longer a 'waterfall' type work process, where work is handed from one person to another. modern marketing requires that people on a team be able to iterate programs in real-time based on live feedback. this requires them to collaborate much more closely, he added.\n\nibm appears to be bucking a trend. on the whole, companies are offering workers greater flexibility in terms of when and where they work, and not just because it helps with their recruiting efforts. studies have shown that employee engagement and productivity often improve as a result.\n\nin 2016, 40 percent of large companies allowed employees to work at home at least some of the time on a regular basis, up from 33 percent in 2012, according to a study by the society for human resource management and the families and work institute.\n\nmany companies allow working from home because it holds down their office-rental costs and the low- or no-value-added time workers spend commuting, particularly in cities with heavy rush-hour traffic, explained brad harrington, executive director of the boston college center for work & family, whose corporate sponsors include ibm.\n\na lot of times people think of [working from home] as an accommodation for working parents, but that's not necessarily the case, he explained. there are organizational benefits to it, added harrington.\n\nthere may also be organizational costs in terms of teamwork, innovation and corporate culture, experts said.\n\nyou start to get an erosion of corporate culture when you have workers spread far and wide, said tom gimbel, chief executive officer of staff and recruiting firm lasalle network in chicago.\n\nthe same can be said for the culture of colleges that specialize in online programs, gimbel added. you don't see many people wearing a college sweatshirt for the university of phoenix, he noted.\n\nfor employees, there may be some drawbacks to working from home from a career-growth perspective, gimbel said. less face-time with higher ups could be a liability.\n\nyour opportunities for promotion are less if you're not in the office interacting with senior management, he said.
some frustrated parents of athletes who survived sexual abuse by larry nassar say they don't care what happens to the former doctor, who was employed by the u.s. olympic committee (usoc), usa gymnastics and michigan state university. they want the institutions and the people who enabled him held accountable.\n\nin a candid and at times emotional conversation with cbs this morning co-host norah o'donnell, the parents -- kyle keiser, julie and doug powell, gina and john nichols, lisa lorincz and christy lemke-akeo -- applauded senate lawmakers' call for a special investigation into the usoc and usa gymnastics.\n\n(l to r) kyle keiser, julie powell, doug powell, christy lemke-akeo, lisa lorincz, gina nichols, john nichols, and norah o'donnell cbs news\n\nif all of us are really going to heal, the parents and the girls, [then] we really need to know who enabled it. and that's only going to happen from an independent investigation. so larry going away was just kind of like the first chapter in the book. and the healing has started, but you can tell that there's something still hanging out there that hasn't been answered yet, said lisa lorincz, mother of 18-year-old gymnast kaylee lorincz, who testified she was assaulted at 13.\n\ni don't care about nassar anymore. he's gone, said john nichols, father of gymnast maggie nichols who was first abused in 2012 when she was 15 years old. but these girls deserve justice. they need to know that this is never going to happen again. they need to know the enablers, whether they're individuals, institutions, processes, whatever it may be, [are] eliminated, eradicated. that's the only way that they're going to be able to move on.\n\nmore than 260 women and girls have reported being sexually abused by nassar, who was sentenced to three prison terms, the longest of which puts him behind bars for up to 175 years.\n\nwe talked to our kids as they grew up, and coming from a law enforcement background and perspective, nothing ever good happens after midnight. 'go home. don't do this. don't do this. be conscious of what you're doing.' how do you guard from a doctor? said doug powell, father of michigan state university pole vaulter kassie powell who was assaulted at 16 years old. how do you put that guard in your daughter's mind? it's a whole component of her college career that we never even thought to look at and guard her for and teach her to that. it's saddening and sickening.\n\nlast month, the board of usa gymnastics stepped down after the usoc demanded their resignations.\n\ni just want somebody to step up and say they're sorry. that's what i want, said christy lemke-akeo, mother of current michigan state gymnast lindsey lemke.\n\nbut the apology, for some, may come too late.\n\ni feel like now it would be forced, lorincz said. the opportunity to say you were sorry and genuinely mean it, that ship has sailed. now i don't mean to sound like this, but now, i want people that were responsible to lose their jobs and not be able to do this to other, you know, parents and kids, primarily.\n\nin a statement to cbs news, usa gymnastics said they will hold the organization to the highest standards of care and safety in further developing a culture of empowerment for our athletes and members.\n\nafter nassar's third sentencing, michigan state university released a statement saying: nassar's behavior was horrific and repugnant, and it is deeply disturbing to know that his crimes were often committed on campus. his sentencing of a few hundred years in prison will mean he will rightfully spend the rest of his life in behind bars. now we must support the courageous survivors of nassar's abuse and provide them with the help they deserve. msu is committed to making sure that we are doing what we must to provide a healthy and safe environment for all members of our community. president engler has called for a culture change at msu and we will be taking all necessary steps to begin a new day and improve the environment at the university.\n\nlast week, usoc announced an independent investigation into the nassar abuse to determine when individuals affiliated with usa gymnastics or the usoc first became aware of any evidence of nassar's abuse of athletes, what that evidence was and what they did with it. usoc ceo scott blackmun also released a statement of apology after more than 150 women and girls confronted nassar and testified about his abuse in a michigan courtroom.\n\nwatch their extended conversation with norah o'donnell here.
by moneytips\n\nwealthy people achieve their wealth in many different ways, but typically, those who maintain it stay wealthy for a reason: they do not spend any more than they have to on any item. that principle applies just as much to buying a smartphone or vacuum cleaner as it does to buying a multi-million dollar conglomerate.\n\none founding principle of spending only what is necessary: avoid fees whenever possible. here are a few common fees that tend to trip up the average consumer.\n\nlate payment fees – with scheduling, discipline, and the occasional reminder, late fees are completely unnecessary. set as many bills as possible on auto-pay and make sure you maintain a sufficient balance. spread the auto-pay drawing days out if possible so that not every bill is paid at the same time. if you don't, you could run into cash flow problems and experience the next fee on the list.\n\n– with scheduling, discipline, and the occasional reminder, late fees are completely

cancellation and other fees attached, so investigate your deal carefully. other hotel fees to watch out for include mandatory resort fees covering items like internet and pool access, and the stocked refreshment bar in your room that tempts you with high-priced drinks and treats.\n\n– cancellation or early check-in fees can run into significant dollars and are usually avoidable through proper

that you understand all the fees associated with each airline by reviewing their website. check the baggage restriction on each airline to minimize your checked bag fees and avoid overweight bag charges. try to fly with only carry-ons when possible (or fly southwest, where two checked bags are still free). for trips with lots of luggage, see if it is cheaper to ship your luggage ahead to your destination.\n\n– cheaper tickets sometimes come with associated fees. make sure that you understand all the fees associated with each airline by reviewing their website. check the baggage restriction

other bank's atm, and then on the back end as your bank charges you for using someone else's atm. limit use of other bank's atms whenever possible and search for a bank that will refund atm charges.\n\n– using atms outside of your bank's network can rack up double fees — on the front end to use the other bank's atm, and then on the back end as your bank charges you for using someone

you will end up paying more for the purchase in the long run. whenever possible, pay in full, or pay with credit but pay off the bill in full at the end of the month.\n\n– by splitting a larger purchase into multiple payments over time, you will end up paying more for the purchase in the long run. whenever possible, pay in full, or pay with credit but pay off the bill in full at the end of

yourself, 'what do i want to get from the card, and how do i use it?' says creditcard.com senior industry analyst matt schulz. that's a good way to help you understand what cards are a good deal and what aren't. then once you figure that out, you look at things like interest rates, and which cards have the fewest fees, and that sort of thing. but it's important to know thyself before you really apply for that card. search for a credit card that meets your needs with the limited number of attached fees. cards with limited fees may have higher interest rates to compensate — but that's not a problem if you never carry a balance, which should be your goal.\n\n– running a balance is an indirect fee, but cards have direct fees as well. annual fees, foreign transaction fees, and similar

devices unless you really need them.\n\n\n\ntake a long look at your spending habits and your bank and credit card's policies. are you passing up opportunities to cut your spending by eliminating

dallas — without the shocking video, it's unlikely that the world would have learned or cared about the violent manhandling of 69-year-old david dao on a united airlines flight last month.\n\nthe outrage on social media, the mea culpa by an airline ceo, the promise to treat customers better - none of it would have happened.\n\nthe passengers who shot those videos on a united express plane in chicago violated united's policy on photography. by the letter of the airline's law, they too could have been ordered off the plane.\n\nunder united's policy, customers can take pictures or videos with small cameras or cellphones provided that the purpose is capturing personal events. filming or photographing other customers or airline employees without their consent is prohibited. american, delta and southwest have similar policies.\n\npassengers are accustomed to using their cellphones to take photos and videos that they can upload to facebook, twitter or instagram. airline rules on photography are sporadically enforced, but passengers should read them in the in-flight magazines because there can be consequences.\n\nthis month, a united ticket agent ordered a passenger's reservation canceled as he filmed her while disputing a $300 baggage fee in the new orleans airport. after navang oza posted his video online, united apologized, saying that the video does not reflect the positive customer experience we strive to offer.\n\nin april, a jetblue airways crew called airport police to meet a man who they said continued to record a selfie video during a security-sensitive time in flight, while the cockpit door was opened. michael nissensohn insists that he wasn't recording the procedure.\n\ni told them there is no rule against talking a selfie on a plane, nissensohn says. he says he was ordered off the plane and held up at laguardia airport in new york for more than an hour before being let go without charges. jetblue declined to comment on the incident. a spokesman says the airline doesn't publish its photography policy for security reasons.\n\nwith airline customer service in decline, videotaping is the only way that passengers can make sure they are treated fairly, says gary leff, a travel blogger who has criticized the airlines over the issue.\n\nthe tsa allows more photography at the checkpoint than the airlines allow on board their planes, he says.\n\nthe transportation security administration says that photography at checkpoints is fine if people don't take images of monitors or interfere with screeners. travel bloggers say, however, that people have had run-ins with tsa officers, and you should expect to be questioned if you snap more than a casual photo of a companion.\n\nlawyers who specialize in first amendment or travel law say airlines generally cannot limit photography or video recording in an airport because it is a public space. but airlines have more power on planes because as private parties they are not bound by the first amendment.\n\nthey are within their rights to establish these rules, they are within their rights to throw you off the aircraft if you continue filming, says joseph larsen, a media-law attorney in houston.\n\nhowever, there is no law against taking photos or video on an airplane, and it is unlikely that anyone would face legal jeopardy for taking pictures of an altercation on a plane or their own peaceful dispute with an airline employee, larsen says.\n\nif you see something going on that is a matter of legitimate public interest, he says, go ahead and capture it even if you don't have express permission to film another passenger. the man who was roughed up by airport officers on the united express plane, david dao, has already got his settlement with united, larsen says. he is probably pretty happy that was documented.\n\nindeed, dao's attorney, thomas demetrio, said, dr. dao has become the unintended champion for the adoption of changes which will certainly help improve the lives of literally millions of travelers, cbs chicago reported.\n\ndocumenting perceived injustices has become a powerful way for passengers, particularly economy class passengers, to push back against major airlines. it's a frustrating moment for economy-class travelers, who increasingly face airline fees for everything from cabin blankets to checked baggage to carry-on bags. in 2016, passenger airlines collected a total of $4.2 billion in baggage fees and $2.9 billion in reservation change fees, according to the u.s. department of transportation.\n\nlong security lines exacerbate the problem, particularly for passengers who don't have access to expedited screening.\n\nafter a recent video of a confrontation over a stroller between an american airlines flight attendant and a mother with two young children, the airline grounded the employee. the person who shot the video violated american's policy, which prohibits unauthorized photography or video recording of employees or other passengers.\n\nprivately, airline officials say it is unlikely they would take action in such cases. american is reviewing its policy because of the difficulty of enforcing it.\n\neven if the law is on the side of the passenger with a camera, there are practical considerations.\n\nunless it's a legitimate safety issue like annoying other people, i don't see a problem with taking photos on a plane. but that's a call of the captain, and in the first instance the captain is right, says thomas dickerson, a retired new york state judge and author of travel law.\n\npassengers can challenge the captain's judgment in court, and might win, dickerson says, but the problem for consumers is, do you really want to get thrown off the plane?
new york -- it was a dream-come-true ending for clemson quarterback deshaun watson: a touchdown pass on the last play to win college football's national championship.\n\ni am just thankful for the people who i have around me, believing in me, watson said after monday night's game.\n\nbut actually, watson's dream came true long before, in 2006 when he was 11, and his family was able to move to a better life.\n\ni was in a government apartment, a lot of bad influence around. it wasn't something that everyone wanted to stay in for the rest of their life, he said.\n\ndeshaun and his family were one of more than 150 helped by former pro-football star warrick dunn's charity.\n\ndunn partners with habitat for humanity to make home ownership a realty for single parents.\n\ni just try to provide an opportunity for stability, dunn said.\n\nit is how dunn honors his mother's memory. she was an off-duty baton rouge, louisiana police officer killed during a robbery. at 18, he became the guardian of five siblings, using his mom's life insurance to buy a home for them and learning early about the stability a home can provide.\n\nwarrick dunn, left, and deshaun watson, second from left, after dunn helped house the watson family in 2006 watson family\n\nit gives them opportunity to reach for their dreams and to change their outcome of their future, dunn said.\n\na nice story a decade ago became a great story monday night.\n\na dream came true, and all the success has been coming and blessings been coming through, watson said.\n\njust ask the guy living the dream, now building habitat houses with his clemson teammates so others can live theirs.
new york -- nbc now says never mind to its bold scheduling move of shifting the hit drama this is us to thursdays next season.\n\nthe network said tuesday it was shelving that plan and leaving the heartwarming series in place on tuesday nights.\n\na network executive familiar with the plans told the associated press there was concern that with nbc airing thursday night football games in the late fall, there would be too many interruptions for the serialized show, perhaps annoying viewers. the executive spoke on condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to discuss the plans publicly.\n\nwith the move back to tuesday, nbc will be able to air nine or 10 continuous episodes of this is us before there are any interruptions, the executive said.\n\nthe move had been the centerpiece of nbc's plan, announced just two weeks ago, to create a schedule that echoed its must-see tv thursday nights of two decades ago.\n\nit's not unusual for a television network to tinker with plans that it announces to advertisers in the spring, but rarely are the changes this high-profile and extensive. the move essentially requires nbc to completely restructure its tuesday and thursday schedules.
the world's vital insect kingdom is undergoing death by a thousand cuts, the world's top bug experts said. climate change, insecticides, herbicides, light pollution, invasive species and changes in agriculture and land use are causing earth to lose probably 1% to 2% of its insects each year, said university of connecticut entomologist david wagner, lead author in the special package of 12 studies in monday's proceedings of the national academies of sciences written by 56 scientists from around the globe.\n\nthe problem, sometimes called the insect apocalypse, is like a jigsaw puzzle. and scientists say they still don't have all the pieces, so they have trouble grasping its enormity and complexity and getting the world to notice and do something.\n\nwagner said scientists need to figure out if the rate of the insect loss is bigger than with other species. there is some reason to worry more, he added, because they are the target of attack with insecticides, herbicides and light pollution.\n\nco-author and university of illinois entomologist may berenbaum, a national medal of science winner, said, insect decline is kind of comparable to climate change 30 years ago because the methods to assess the extent, the rate (of loss) were difficult.\n\nmaking matters worse is that in many cases, people hate bugs, even though they pollinate the world's foods, are crucial to the food chain and get rid of waste, she said.\n\ninsects are absolutely the fabric by which mother nature and the tree of life are built, wagner said.\n\ntwo well known ones — honeybees and monarch butterflies — best illustrate insect problems and declines, he said. honeybees have been in dramatic decline because of disease, parasites, insecticides, herbicides and lack of food.\n\nin this september 11, 2020, file photo, a monarch butterfly pauses in a field of goldenrod at the flight 93 national memorial in shanksville, pennsylvania. gene j. puskar / ap\n\nclimate change-driven drier weather in the u.s. west means less milkweed for butterflies to eat, wagner said. and changes in american agriculture remove weeds and flowers they need for nectar.\n\nwe're creating a giant biological desert except for soybeans and corn in a giant area of the midwest, he said.\n\nlast month, trump administration officials announced tuesday that the monarch butterfly was a candidate for federal designation as a threatened species — but will not receive the designation for several years, as there are other priorities.\n\nthe numbers of honeybees are down from the dangerously low levels of less than 30,000 monarchs for the past two years, the zoo said. the incredible migration of western monarchs is a unique yet fragile piece of north america's natural history, and it is on the brink of collapse, said paige howorth, director of invertebrate care and conservation at san diego zoo global.\n\nmonday's scientific papers don't provide new data, yet show a big but incomplete picture of a problem starting to get attention. scientists have identified 1 million insect species, while probably 4 million more are still to be discovered, berenbaum said.\n\nuniversity of delaware entomologist doug tallamy, who wasn't part of the studies, said they highlight how the world has spent the last 30 years spending billions of dollars finding new ways to kill insects and mere pennies working to preserve them.\n\nthe good news is, with the exception of climate change, individuals can do much to reverse insect declines, tallamy said in an email. this is a global problem with a grassroots solution.\n\nsophie lewis contributed to this report.
the following is from the script face blindness which originally aired on march 18, 2012 and was rebroadcast on feb. 28, 2016. lesley stahl is the correspondent. shari finkelstein, producer.\n\nmost of us take for granted that we can instantly recognize people we know by looking at their faces. it's so automatic, it almost sounds silly to even say it. friends can put on a hat, cut their hair, and we still know them by their face. we can do this for thousands upon thousands of faces without ever giving it a moment's thought. but imagine for a second what life would be like if you couldn't, if your wife or husband looked like a stranger; you couldn't tell your kids apart; couldn't recognize yourself in a mirror. as we first reported a few years back, that's what life is like for people who suffer from a mysterious condition called face blindness, or prosopagnosia, that can make it nearly impossible to recognize or identify faces.\n\nif you've never heard of face blindness, you're not alone -- chances are your doctor hasn't either. it's been unknown to most of the medical world until very recently. hearing about it can feel a little like entering the twilight zone. but for people who are face blind, the condition is very real.\n\njacob hodes is one of them. he's 31 years old, he has a college degree, has had great jobs, and he seems perfectly normal -- just don't ask him to identify any faces.\n\nlesley stahl: we're going to put up the first one, even very famous ones.\n\njacob hodes: [picture of john travolta] no idea.\n\nwe showed jacob faces without hair, a pure test of facial recognition.\n\njacob hodes: [will smith] no.\n\njacob hodes: [jimmy carter] nope. i can't say if i've ever seen that person.\n\nhe's seen jimmy carter plenty of times and he knows michael jordan too.\n\njacob hodes: oh lord.\n\nhe just can't recognize their faces.\n\njacob hodes: [elvis] now that's just impossible.\n\nlesley stahl: can you describe my face? you're staring right at it.\n\njacob hodes: yeah. high cheekbones. light eyes.\n\nclearly jacob could see my face, but he says if we happened to run into each other in a few days, he wouldn't know me from any other woman with short blonde hair.\n\nbrad duchaine: they meet somebody, they have a good time with them, they have a nice relationship. then, a week later, they walk past them.\n\nbrad duchaine is a professor at dartmouth college who has been studying face blindness for nearly 15 years. he says the hardest thing to understand is how people can see a familiar face but not recognize it. so he created a demonstration to give me a little taste. faces turned upside down.\n\nbrad duchaine: so here are some famous faces. you're gonna be tempted to twist your head, but don't do it.\n\nlesley stahl: ok.\n\nbrad duchaine: you know, can you--\n\nlesley stahl: boy, that is hard.\n\nbrad duchaine: can you identify any of these people?\n\ni was completely at a loss.\n\nlesley stahl: you think i'd know all of these people?\n\nbrad duchaine: you've seen them all a lot.\n\nlesley stahl: i don't know any of these people. i really don't.\n\nbrad duchaine: you wanna see 'em upright?\n\nlesley stahl: sure.\n\nit was astonishing. with just that click, they became recognizable people before my eyes.\n\nlesley stahl: i know john travolta. i know morley.\n\nand there was denzel washington, jennifer aniston and sandra bullock. but the one that really got me was the young woman on the lower right, my daughter.\n\nlesley stahl: i didn't know my own daughter?\n\nbrad duchaine: yeah.\n\nlesley stahl: i didn't know my own daughter. wow.\n\nlesley stahl: so is this-- am i getting a feeling for what people with face blindness have?\n\nbrad duchaine: this is, when you look at that, there's clearl-- there's a face there.\n\nlesley stahl: oh yeah.\n\nbrad duchaine: there are parts. there are eyes. there's mouth. but you just can't put it together.\n\nlesley stahl: wow. that's stunning. i feel terrible for them now.\n\nbrad duchaine: yeah. it's really difficult.\n\nand largely unknown. prosopagnosia only got its name in the 1940s, when a couple of soldiers came back from world war ii with head injuries and couldn't recognize their wife or parents. and it took another 50 years for science to discover that people could be born face blind, like jacob hodes and jo livingston, a retired teacher, ben dubrovsky, a software products designer, and meg novotny, a doctor.\n\nlesley stahl: if i were your patient, we-- you'd spent a long time with me discussing a problem. i come back the next time.\n\nmeg novotny: oh, no, no, no. you walk out to the window at the front and start checking out and i walk out of the room and i don't know who you are.\n\nlesley stahl: come on.\n\nshe relies on patient charts, she told us but there aren't any of those in ben's office where lunch in the cafeteria can be tricky.\n\nben dubrovsky: i was sitting down at lunch having a discussion with someone about one of my projects and the guy across the table gets up from lunch and says, god, that's really interesting. when you have that meeting can you invite me? thanks. see ya. who is it? i don't know.\n\nlesley stahl: who is it?\n\nben dubrovsky: i have no idea.\n\nlesley stahl: is it a memory issue?\n\njacob hodes: not only.\n\njo livingston: the memory is never created.\n\nlesley stahl: the face doesn't get put--\n\njo livingston: it doesn't get filed.\n\nso they have to rely on other strategies to identify people: hair, body shape, the way people walk, their voice, even style of dress. but jacob told us it can all fall apart when someone changes their hair, like a colleague named sylvia who he couldn't find one day until she started putting her hair into her usual ponytail.\n\njacob hodes: and she like put it into the ponytail. and once it was in place that was sylvia. it clicked. then she took her hair back out of that ponytail.\n\nlesley stahl: right then and there?\n\njacob hodes: yep. she just put it in and then took it out and--\n\nlesley stahl: so she went from sylvia, not sylvia, sylvia, not sylvia?\n\njacob hodes: she disappeared.\n\nlesley stahl: come on.\n\njacob hodes: yeah.\n\nto him it was as though her face had changed into someone else's before his eyes.\n\njacob hodes: so now i'm confronted with this situation that got weird. because i knew this person was sylvia, but it didn't feel like sylvia.\n\nfaces mean so much to us: identity, beauty, character, a place to hang all our memories about a person. faces have captivated artists forever, so it may surprise you to learn that the man who painted these faces, renowned portraitist chuck close is also face blind, and severely so.\n\nlesley stahl: let's say you went out to have dinner with somebody and then you saw her the next day--\n\nchuck close: wouldn't remember her.\n\nand yet he has spent his career -- even after a collapsed spinal artery left him mostly paralyzed -- painting, well...\n\nlesley stahl: faces. chuck close has face blindness and he paints faces.\n\nchuck close: the reason i think i was driven to it was to take images of people that matter to me and commit them to memory in the best way i can, which is to slow the whole process down, break it down into lots of little memorable pieces.\n\nwhich is exactly how he creates these works. he can't make sense of a whole face, so he works from a photograph with a grid on it, and translates what he sees -- square by square -- onto his canvas.\n\nlesley stahl: well, guess what we've done?\n\nchuck close: i don't know.\n\nlesley stahl: we put together a quiz for you.\n\nwe brought some of our famous faces along to show him...\n\nchuck close: from the chin, i think it's-- um, leno.\n\n...and were surprised that he did pretty darn well.\n\nchuck close: well, from the lips, i think it's tiger woods.\n\nlesley stahl: yeah, well you're pretty good.\n\nbut of course not perfect...\n\nchuck close: i don't have a clue.\n\nlesley stahl: that's tom cruise.\n\nchuck close: right now, my guts are tied in knots because this very activity is the thing that makes me most nervous. oh, now i have to figure out who this person is...\n\nbecause he isn't recognizing these faces the way most of us do. every face is a puzzle he has to solve.\n\nchuck close: what i'm thinking? you don't see too many people with just a mustache anymore, so that means it's probably somebody who's not alive. so if it's an african american of a certain age with a mustache, it might be martin luther king.\n\nlesley stahl: you're amazing. you deduce, deduce, deduce. you're like sherlock holmes here.\n\nchuck close: yeah, this is how i get through life.\n\nof course he knew we were showing him famous faces. with our group, we threw in a trick one, a photo of jo's daughter.\n\nlesley stahl: does anybody know who that is? jo?\n\njo livingston: no.\n\nlesley stahl: jo, work on it, because it's somebody that jo knows.\n\njo livingston: well, it may be but nothing's coming.\n\nlesley stahl: it's someone in your family.\n\nbut still she didn't get it...\n\nlesley stahl: it's your daughter. now can you see it? is it clear now?\n\njo livingston: it is believable now.\n\nwe were baffled that a condition so extreme it could keep people from recognizing their own children could have been almost completely unknown until very recently. we spoke with dr. oliver sacks, the chronicler of fascinating neurological conditions, who passed away last summer. he wrote about face blindness in his book, the mind's eye.\n\n[oliver sacks: it is with our faces that we face the world...]\n\nlesley stahl: how do you explain that the medical world did not identify this problem?\n\noliver sacks: it is not usually a complaint of people. people do not bring it up. many people who are color blind, do not know of it until they take an army medical. one sort of assumes that other people are the way one is.\n\nben dubrovsky: it never, ever, ever in my life occurred to me that people would look at a face and just get it like that.\n\njo livingston: i believed that i was not good with people but i had no idea of the reason. i just thought i was stupid.\n\njo only learned there was such a thing as face blindness when she stumbled across this article, and came in to be tested in duchaine's lab. a few hours after her second visit, in a bizarre coincidence, she and duchaine ended up attending the same event.\n\nbrad duchaine: i kept placing my face in a position where she could see it.\n\njo livingston: i realized that one of the group was staring at me in a way that people don't normally.\n\nbrad duchaine: and so finally at one point i said, do you know who i am?\n\njo livingston: ah.\n\nbrad duchaine: and she put it all together.\n\nduchaine had seen face blindness in action; jo had seen the missed connections of her life.\n\njo livingston: if that had been anybody else, they would have been presumably furious, would not have spoken to me and would have probably never have spoken to me again. but i would never have known they were there.\n\nlesley stahl: yeah.\n\njo livingston: it made me realize, how many times have i done this?\n\nlesley stahl: right. how many friends have you offended? how many people aren't talking to you and you don't know why?\n\njo livingston: and we'll never know.\n\noliver sacks: people do think you may be snubbing them or stupid, or mad, or inattentive. that's why it's so important to recognize what one has. and to admit it.\n\nwhich is exactly what sacks himself had just done -- written about the fact that he too was face blind.\n\n[oliver sacks: i have had difficulty recognizing faces for as long as i can remember. my problem extends not only to my nearest and dearest, but also to myself. ]\n\noliver sacks: i've sometimes had the experience of apologizing to someone, and realizing it's a mirror.\n\nlesley stahl: no.\n\noliver sacks: i have indeed.\n\nlesley stahl: no. because you didn't know it was you?\n\noliver sacks: i could see that it was a large, clumsy man with a beard. now, i've now found a way of dealing with this. i have one special feature. i have rather large ears. if the large, clumsy man with a beard has extra large ears, it's probably me.\n\nlesley stahl: i shouldn't be smiling, but it's funny.\n\noliver sacks: well, it is. i mean, these things are both comic and serious.\n\nand, surprisingly common. recent studies show as many as 1 in 50 people may be face blind. and the search is on for clues inside their brains. we'll show you what the research is finding, plus, would you believe, super-recognizers...\n\njennifer jarett: i would say mike wallace.\n\nlesley stahl: that is mike wallace!\n\n...who never forget a face...\n\njennifer jarett: i don't even know how to get rid of people.\n\n...when we come back.\n\npart two\n\nno one knows what causes lifelong face blindness. it was discovered so recently, scientists are just beginning to unravel its secrets. and some of the clues are coming from people who once had normal face recognition, but lost it after suffering damage to part of the brain. and in an interesting twist, those people are also offering insight into the way the rest of us recognize faces. imagine waking up after a trauma and not being able to recognize the people closest to you -- that's what happened to colleen castaldo.\n\nlesley stahl: up until the fall of 2009, did you have any trouble recognizing faces at all?\n\ncolleen castaldo: no, not at all.\n\nlesley stahl: just like everybody else?\n\ncolleen castaldo: like everybody else, yeah.\n\nthat all changed late one night when colleen had a seizure and was rushed to the hospital. her doctors found a brain tumor and did surgery to remove it, but as she recovered, she started noticing that something wasn't right.\n\ncolleen castaldo: the nurses. i thought that i was meeting them each for the first time. and then, i would, you know, listen to them and think, i don't know, they were acting like they knew me already.\n\nlesley stahl: oh, disorienting.\n\nshe figured it was the medication, until her close friend doreen came to visit wearing white, and colleen assumed she was part of the medical staff.\n\ncolleen castaldo: i looked at her, i smiled and i turned back to my husband and started to talk to him, and he stood up and said, doreen. and i looked and thought, doreen? and then, it hit me. i knew right then and there, this is the problem i had been having, that i--\n\nlesley stahl: faces.\n\ncolleen castaldo: i just-- yeah, faces.\n\nnow even faces she knew well before...\n\ncolleen castaldo: [george clooney] no.\n\nlesley stahl: ok, well that's george clooney.\n\ncolleen castaldo: oh, wow. no, i wouldn't know that.\n\n...are a mystery to her.\n\ncolleen castaldo: no, i don't know who that is. who is it?\n\nlesley stahl: the president.\n\nbrad duchaine showed me an mri scan of colleen's brain.\n\nlesley stahl: is that a hole in her brain?\n\nbrad duchaine: that's right. it's in the right temporal lobe.\n\nlesley stahl: so back here.\n\nbrad duchaine that's right.\n\nand the location of that hole where the tumor had been was a clue. if removing that area caused the loss of face recognition, could that be where all our brains process faces? it turns out that neuroscientists have been trying to figure out how it is that our brains recognize faces for decades.\n\nnancy kanwisher: face recognition is a very difficult problem, because all faces are basically the same.\n\nmit neuroscientist nancy kanwisher...\n\nnancy kanwisher: there are these two roundish things here. there's this thing there. there's this thing there. they're all the same. and so discriminating one face from another is a very computationally difficult thing, because it's those subtle differences in the same basic structure that distinguish one thing from another.\n\nand it is exactly those subtle differences face blind people like jo livingston miss.\n\njo livingston: i could describe anything i can put into words. eye color, general overall shape, whether your ears stick out. but those things would bring it down perhaps from the population of the world to a few million.\n\nso she could say this person has dark eyes, high cheekbones, an oval face, which would allow jo to distinguish her from this person, but this face and this face? impossible.\n\njo livingston: i can say what i can see. but i cannot say the micro-measurements that are what tell a normal person that it's you and not somebody of the same specification.\n\nbut how is it that the rest of us can perceive these two people as distinct individuals despite the similarities? an important clue comes from what we can't distinguish: as we saw earlier, faces upside down. like these two duchaine showed me, which look very similar.\n\nbrad duchaine: maybe you don't even see that there's any difference.\n\nlesley stahl: i see something different in the lower lip.\n\nbrad duchaine: yeah.\n\nlesley stahl: eyes are a little different.\n\nbrad duchaine: but then, if i show them to you upright, so here's the one that you saw on the left there. looks perfectly normal. and then--\n\nlesley stahl: oh!\n\nbrad duchaine: here's the one you saw on the right, you saw upside-down.\n\nlesley stahl: oh my goodness.\n\nthe eyes and mouth in the photo on the right had been turned upside-down.\n\nbrad duchaine: and now the face looks really grotesque.\n\nlesley stahl: wow.\n\nbrad duchaine: but--\n\nlesley stahl: but upside-down--\n\nbrad duchaine: upside-down it's really hard to see that.\n\nnancy kanwisher: if you look at a face upside-down, you're very bad at recognizing it. if you look at a word or an object or a scene, you can recognize it fine upside-down.\n\nlesley stahl: so what did that tell you?\n\nnancy kanwisher: it tells you that there's something very special about face recognition. it works in a very different way from recognition of everything else.\n\nand that got kanwisher wondering if there might be a part of the brain responsible just for seeing faces. she started putting people with normal face recognition into mri scanners and watching what happens in their brains as they look at different images.\n\nlesley stahl: this is what she's seeing?\n\nnancy kanwisher: yeah. this is what she's seeing.\n\nlesley stahl: she's seeing faces.\n\nnancy kanwisher: exactly. and now she's seeing objects because we want to know not just what parts of the brain are active when you see faces, but what parts are more active when you see faces than when you see objects.\n\nkanwisher discovered that there was indeed a place in the brain that becomes very active when we look at faces.\n\nnancy kanwisher: in every subject, boom, there was this nice, big response there. it was very exciting.\n\nand it was right in the same area where colleen's tumor had been. it's called the fusiform face area. so could that be what's missing in people with lifelong face blindness, like jacob hodes? kanwisher put him in the scanner to find out.\n\nnancy kanwisher: i really did not expect to see a fusiform face area.\n\nlesley stahl: so you thought there'd be nothing there. like as if instead of having a bullet go through it, he was just born without it.\n\nnancy kanwisher: that's right. that's right.\n\nlesley stahl: and?\n\nnancy kanwisher: and we looked at the data and his face area was beautiful. it's textbook.\n\nshe scanned jo, ben and meg as well, and they had fusiform face areas too.\n\nlesley stahl: so what does that say to you?\n\nnancy kanwisher: it tells us that the problem is not that this thing doesn't exist. there it is. but see, that's the fun of science. it's fun to be told you're just completely and totally wrong because now you have to go back and, you know, think anew.\n\nand one thing she and other researchers are thinking about is a phenomenon as mystifying as face blindness -- its polar opposite - super-recognizers like jennifer jarett, who say they recognize almost every face they have ever seen.\n\nlesley stahl: waiters?\n\njennifer jarett: yes.\n\nlesley stahl: salespeople?\n\njennifer jarett: yes. yes.\n\nlesley stahl: oh, like, of course.\n\njennifer jarett: yes, absolutely. yes. i'll be walking down the street and i'll see someone, and i'll think, oh retail. and then i'll remember, oh ok. that person works at-- as-- whatever store and that's where i s-- or they used to work at that store 10 years ago. and then i remember.\n\nlesley stahl: 10 years ago?\n\njennifer jarett: yes, yes.\n\nlesley stahl: so they're-- it doesn't matter how far back you saw these people?\n\njennifer jarett: yes, yes.\n\nlesley stahl: so as long as you look at a person and take notice, they're in there?\n\njennifer jarett: i don't even know how to get rid of people.\n\nonly a handful of super-recognizers have been discovered so far, and duchaine and his colleagues had to come up with a whole new way to test them.\n\nbrad duchaine: so here are three faces here, which you're familiar with.\n\nlesley stahl: i am?\n\nit's called the before they were famous test because super-recognizers can also recognize faces as they change through time.\n\nbrad duchaine: does that help at all?\n\nlesley stahl: you sure i know that person?\n\nbrad duchaine: that's dick cheney.\n\nlesley stahl: oh my god. that's dick cheney?\n\nhe told me the top right was richard gere, and the bottom, nancy pelosi.\n\nlesley stahl: wow. those three people have changed dramatically.\n\nhe even gave me a hint with this one: he's now an actor.\n\nlesley stahl: and i'm supposed to know this actor?\n\nclearly, i was not a super-recognizer.\n\nbrad duchaine: that's george clooney.\n\nlesley stahl: man. and these super-recognizers just know this?\n\nbrad duchaine: the supers are really good at recognizing these faces.\n\njennifer jarett: george clooney.\n\nlesley stahl: how could you tell that was george clooney?\n\njennifer jarett: it just looked like george clooney to me.\n\njennifer jarett: oh, prince charles. oh, madonna. michael jordan.\n\njennifer jarett: oh that's kato kaelin.\n\nlesley stahl: the o.j. simpson trial.\n\nlesley stahl: wow, you are good.\n\nbut we thought we had finally stumped her with this one. she said she only had a guess.\n\njennifer jarett: if i were to guess i would say mike wallace.\n\nlesley stahl: that is mike wallace.\n\nshe recognized the late mike wallace as a 6-year-old!\n\nlesley stahl: i don't even understand how you do that. i can't fathom it.\n\njennifer jarett: as people age i guess the aging process somehow in my brain just seems very sort of superficial. and, you know, as if someone gets a haircut you can still recognize them. it's still the same face to me. it's just the adult version.\n\nso why is 60 years like a haircut to her, while face blind people can't recognize someone they just saw? a team of scientists at harvard has begun scanning the brains of super-recognizers too, to see if they might yield any clues. the science of facial recognition is in its infancy. but new discoveries can't come fast enough for one last person we'd like you to meet --13-year-old tim mcdonough from boston, who is severely face blind.\n\nlesley stahl: can you describe what it feels like when someone comes up? you know you're supposed to know who they are--\n\ntim mcdonough: i usually just say, you know, hi, nice to see ya.\n\nlesley stahl: so you sometimes pretend?\n\ntim mcdonough: yeah.\n\nlesley stahl: you fake it?\n\ntim mcdonough: i fake it, yeah.\n\n[researcher: so you think it's not your mom?\n\ntim mcdonough: yeah.\n\nresearcher: ok, so that actually was your mom.]\n\ntim is working with the harvard team to see if they can help him learn to recognize his mother's face. it's part of a pilot program to see if face blindness might someday be treatable. so far, it's not.\n\ntim mcdonough: i just hope that nobody tries to talk to me because, if they do, they--\n\nlesley stahl: they want to talk about something you've done with them, or something.\n\ntim mcdonough: yeah. and i don't know who they are.\n\nlesley stahl: so it must be really hard to make friends.\n\ntim mcdonough: it is, yeah. takes me a while to make friends.\n\nit turns out making friends can be tricky at both ends of the face recognition spectrum. super-recognizers can seem like stalkers.\n\njennifer jarett: i would see someone, you know, weeks or months later at a party and people would say, oh, do you know each other? and i'd say, yes. and the other person would say, no. and i'd say, no, don't you remember the first week of classes? you were walking to english class with someone... and people would look at me really strangely and sort of uncomfortably, i think, a lot.\n\njennifer says she's now learned to take her cues from others, ironically, just as face blind people do...\n\njacob hodes: i'll play this eye contact game where i'll wait. i'm not gonna really look at you, but i'll wait to see if you look at me. and then, oh, you look at me. oh, look-- oh, hi.\n\nlesley stahl: so you're always waiting for a cue from them?\n\njacob hodes: yeah. so i'll hang back a little bit, which i don't wanna do.\n\nlesley stahl: in any social situation, are you always a little anxious?\n\noliver sacks: i'm more than a little anxious. and i tend to keep my mouth closed before i make some awful blunder. of course, another tactic, or strategy, is to smile at everybody.\n\nthat's what chuck close told us he does.\n\nchuck close: you have to be really charming. if you are going to insult them by not remembering them, you just have to be extremely charming so that people don't hold this stuff against you.\n\nlesley stahl: do you feel now that you're missing out on something?\n\nben dubrovsky: oh yeah.\n\nmeg novotny: yeah.\n\nben dubrovsky: definitely. i notice a loss.\n\nben dubrovsky: i understand someone by an abstraction. i put together a set of information that to me means mother or means lesley.\n\nlesley stahl: but it's not a visualization of a face.\n\nben dubrovsky: and the question, the thing that i wonder next, you know, is how does it affect even things like love?\n\nlesley stahl: how does it?\n\nben dubrovsky: when people talk about love they say, i carry the person with me. i carry their image with me. i don't carry their image. does that mean i experience it differently? and how would i ever know? i don't know.\n\njacob hodes: there's a long tail of stuff that happens that you're missing. connections you're not making.\n\nlesley stahl: still?\n\njacob hodes: oh yeah. yeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nmeg novotny: at least now we understand why.\n\njacob hodes: yeah, right.\n\nmeg novotny: and it's therapeutic, but it doesn't fix it.
with words and actions, several nba teams showed dismay wednesday hours after a violent mob loyal to president trump stormed the u.s. capitol and in response to a decision by a wisconsin prosecutor not to charge a police officer who shot a black man last year.\n\nin miami, the heat and boston celtics released a joint statement saying they were playing with a heavy heart in a game where most players and coaches knelt for the national anthem. in milwaukee, the bucks and detroit pistons both took turnovers on their first possessions - intentionally, with all 10 players on the court kneeling. in phoenix, the suns and toronto raptors stood in a circle and linked arms for the american and canadian anthems. many other tributes took place around the nba.\n\nearlier in the day at the capitol, a mob delayed congress from certifying the results of november's election and paving the way for president-elect joe biden to be sworn in later this month.\n\nit's an embarrassing and shameful day in our country, new orleans coach stan van gundy said.\n\nwednesday's events came one day after the announcement of a decision to not bring charges against the officer who shot jacob blake in kenosha, wisconsin, last year. blake's shooting was one of the many issues players focused on last season in the nba restart bubble, where the issues of racial injustice and police brutality were a constant focus.\n\nthe boston celtics and the miami heat teams kneel during the playing of the national anthem before the start of their nba game on january 6, 2021, in miami. marta lavandier / ap\n\nthe joint heat-celtics statement said, in part: 2021 is a new year, but some things have not changed. we play tonight's game with a heavy heart after yesterday's decision in kenosha, and knowing that protesters in our nation's capital are treated differently by political leaders depending on what side of certain issues they are on.\n\nthe celtics discussed the blake decision earlier in the day, before the events in the capitol unfolded. the celtics then met again as a team after arriving at the arena in miami, discussed options, and coach brad stevens even called his wife to say that he didn't think his team would take the floor.\n\nboston ultimately chose to play, beating miami 107-105.\n\nthey've operated in a win-at-all-costs attitude, stevens said of the trump administration. i don't know, our sports world is a lot less important, obviously. but i've always thought if you operated with a win-at-all-costs attitude, it's going to be a pretty unfulfilling ending. and in this situation, a disgraceful ending. so, i'm looking forward to two weeks from now, as i know a lot of other people are, too.\n\nphiladelphia coach doc rivers, who is black, spoke of the stark difference between rallies across america last summer that often included violent skirmishes between protesters and police and what he watched at the capitol on wednesday.\n\nthe symbolism of storming the capitol without force done to them, if you're a black american, it definitely touches you in a different way, rivers said. this is not a black thing. this is an american thing.\n\nthe golden state warriors and los angeles clippers also decided to take a knee prior to tip-off, cbs sports reports. the two teams took the knee while the national anthem played at the chase center in l.a.\n\nin addition, the warriors donned black lives matter t-shirts during pregame warmups.\n\nit was unclear if any of the teams who knelt would be subject to penalties. the nba had a rule for decades that players and coaches must stand for the national anthem. that rule was relaxed last year when the season resumed at the covid 19-spurred bubble inside walt disney world.\n\nthe bucks won the opening tap of their game, and instead of running a play, two-time reigning nba mvp giannis antetokounmpo simply held the ball as all players knelt. that resulted in a turnover, as did the ensuing detroit possession when blake griffin held the ball and players took a knee again. the bucks said after the game they held the ball for 7 seconds to reflect the seven times blake was shot.\n\nthe bucks and pistons took a knee immediately following tip-off. pic.twitter.com/i7ledawqgg — nba tv (@nbatv) january 7, 2021\n\nwe want to do things to help make change, be on the right side of the fight, continue to fight, not be in any way, shape or form distracted or slowed or moved in the wrong direction, bucks coach mike budenholzer said. we need to keep moving forward in all ways, shapes and forms.\n\nmeanwhile, a men's college basketball game scheduled to be played in washington on wednesday night was postponed after a city curfew was imposed in response to the mob's actions at the capitol. the atlantic 10 conference game between george washington and umass will be rescheduled by the league.\n\nanother washington-based college team, georgetown, took a knee for the anthem before facing butler in indianapolis. i'm saddened, hoyas coach patrick ewing said in response to the day's events.\n\nwe see the two different usas that we live in. the nba world reacts to today's events in washington, d.c. pic.twitter.com/nd39uxyfno — nba tv (@nbatv) january 7, 2021\n\nthere were 11 games on wednesday's nba schedule. all were played.\n\nit feels a little odd to play a game tonight, to be honest, charlotte coach james borrego said before his club played in atlanta.
when sarah mellema wanted to shoot a quick, encouraging message to her friend sam, she didn't open facebook, instagram, twitter, snapchat or whatsapp. she didn't email, text or call.\n\nshe used venmo.\n\nmiss you boo. here's a kiss and some money , the 26-year-old chicagoan wrote, attaching a digital payment of 50 cents to the message.\n\nvenmo\n\nthat one note may not seem significant, but it represents venmo's unlikely status as a thriving, millennial-heavy, emoji-infused social phenomenon, even though its reason for existing involves the boring business of paying bills and ious.\n\nthe u.s.-only mobile app, which is free to download and mostly free to use, pairs with people's bank accounts to let them pay each other or request money, similar to square cash and chase quickpay. the difference is that venmo lets its users make those payments and their associated messages public on social feeds that others can comment on and like.\n\nwhy would someone want to tell the world he just gave his roommate the rent money or paid back a friend for ? perhaps a better question: why not?\n\ninterviews with more than a dozen venmo users showed how they are are finding new ways to jury-rig the app into a more social experience, such as using the messages for crude and silly inside jokes (sex swing for new apt; money i stole from your wallet), cataloging memorable events, sending money for drinks to a missed bachelorette party, or -- like with mellema -- making micropayments to friends as a clever way of saying hi.\n\nvenmo is not an inherently social app in the way of facebook or twitter, but it offers emotional support and the ability to keep in touch, said cliff lampe, a social-media professor at university of michigan's school of information. young people are good at repurposing feeds and emojis and signals to mean different things and to become social even when it's not intended to be social.\n\nvenmo has even been used to troll white house press secretary sean spicer. when someone uncovered an account with his name and picture, people inundated it with requests for money.\n\nvenmo and owner paypal say they're keenly aware of their responsibility to preserve venmo's sometimes crass, sometimes goofy culture, and are working on more ways to help users express themselves.\n\neggplant emojis and oversharing\n\nthis mashup of payments and social worlds, which launched to the public five years ago this month, doubled its user base last year to nearly 9 million, ahead of all but four u.s. retail banking apps, according to app annie. paypal said venmo doubled its total transactions to $17.6 billion during the same time. and, a whopping 81 percent of venmo's users are millennials -- 10 percentage points higher than millennial darling snapchat, comscore reported last year.\n\na mix of its young users shunning credit cards, oversharing social culture and fewer moms and dads infiltrating the service have bolstered venmo, which braintree acquired in 2012 for $26.2 million. (paypal bought braintree a year later.)\n\nthe social feeds sparked new behaviors among users and revealed just how interactive payments can become. a typical usage involves one person paying for a large dinner party with her credit card, then venmo'ing requests to everyone else for their shares. alma cook, a 25-year-old singer-songwriter in los angeles, said she's put her venmo account name on show posters to create a virtual tip jar for the audience.\n\nsince most people already know why the money is being transferred, they instead crack jokes in the messages, including plenty of use of the eggplant emoji (code for penis). there are also a lot of drug references -- although it's doubtful all of them are jokes.\n\nvenmo has allowed for some new, and sometimes uncomfortable, forms of interaction. brent schneiders, a 28-year-old actor from north hollywood, california, said he's charged back women for dinner or drinks if dates go poorly.\n\nit's more of me throwing a fit and trying to communicate to them that 'i never want to see you again,'  he said.\n\nhe also noticed his ex-girlfriend paid his friend over venmo and used the beer mug emoji . i had no idea they even knew each other! schneiders said, adding that he stopped talking to both of them.\n\na friend bailed on hanging out with raman deol, saying she was sick, but then deol noticed later that night the friend venmo'ing someone else thanks for the drinks with wine glass emojis thrown in for good measure.\n\ndeol wasn't mad at her friend. she was mad at venmo.\n\nthe social feed of it, i don't understand what it gets venmo and what it gets users, deol, 27, of san francisco, said. and i think it's extreme oversharing and toxic for our culture.\n\nall these points of tension are part of the growing pains of a new social network, lampe said.\n\na lot of concern about how these financial exchanges change social relationships, he said, are just frictions of norms not catching up to the changes of technologies.\n\norigins of venmo\n\nvenmo becoming a social network comes as a surprise to iqram magdon-ismail, the service's boisterous, curly-haired 33-year-old co-founder. (he left venmo in 2014 and is now working on an audio platform called ense.)\n\nhe and andrew kortina, who met as freshman-year roommates at the university of pennsylvania, came up with the idea after magdon-ismail forgot his wallet when visiting kortina in new york in 2009 and had to rely on his friend to pay for everything upfront. it spurred him to ask: why can't i just text andrew back the money?\n\nthe first version of venmo (it stands for vendor mobile, magdon-ismail said) was private, text-based and only for blackberry phones. but, as more of their friends tested it out, magdon-ismail would wake up every morning and see all the latest payments.\n\nfor me, it was like reading the newspaper, magdon-ismail said. i was thinking in the back of my head, 'what if we made a feed for everybody. this kind of is like facebook or twitter for me.' \n\nthe decision to expose the payments publicly was controversial. some at the company worried about privacy issues, others argued that the feed would be boring. magdon-ismail pushed for the change, and it helped the app go viral.\n\nnew users seeing their friends paying with the startup service created a layer of trust, known as social proof, lampe said, and encouraged them to bring more friends along.\n\nbut, in addition to that trust, there are still clearly wrong ways to venmo. after all, it exists in the highly regulated banking industry.\n\nross lipschultz, 26, from chicago, said his account was suspended for days after he paid a friend back for drinks and wrote the message, as some forgotten joke: a cool night in havana. venmo emailed him that the reference to cuba's capital was flagged for potentially violating us sanctions under the federal office of foreign assets control.\n\nvenmo\n\nit can be so easy to send and receive money that sarah vakili accidentally messed up the process. at the bar american whiskey in manhattan watching a university of georgia football game, her boyfriend offered to cover the tab upfront for a large group of friends.\n\nvakili grabbed his phone and sent out venmo messages to over 20 people for $60 each. but, she accidentally sent them money instead of requesting it, charging her boyfriend (temporarily) about $1,200 through the app.\n\njust like when they say don't drunk facebook, don't drunk venmo, she warned.\n\nsocial calculator apps\n\nthis year, venmo plans to partner with more retailers, so people can use it more often and venmo can make money off the business transactions. that could endanger the social feeds by clogging them with boring, personal or embarrassing purchases, such as paying for an oil change or hemorrhoid cream.\n\nmindful of the app's culture, ben mills, venmo's head of product, said the service will give people more control on what they share when buying from retailers.\n\nwe want to enhance that social experience, mills said. our users are teaching us payments are rarely about sending money.\n\nvenmo's rise might spur the creation of other mundane apps with social functions -- like, say, a social calculator app -- to make them more engrossing. or, maybe venmo is just another youth-focused it social app destined to flame out.\n\nnot all social app concepts will work. amazon lets people share their purchases on social networks, but it's not a widely used feature.\n\nif the designers of new systems understand the power of social feeds, i think that's for sure a common design element you're going to see, lampe said. any time humans interact with one another we're constantly interested in what other humans are doing.\n\nin the meantime, be sure to venmo your friends 50 cents and an emoji or two to let them know you're thinking about them.\n\ncnet magazine: check out a sample of the stories in cnet's newsstand edition.\n\ntechnically literate: original works of short fiction with unique perspectives on tech, exclusively on cnet.\n\nthis article originally appeared on cnet as venmo: the secret, hip social network you never heard of
tsa administrator david pekoske has approved a one-time $500 award for each uniformed tsa screening officer, utilizing unique authorities provided tsa in law. the award is equivalent to about four days' pay for many officers. it's essentially a performance bonus for the holiday season.\n\nthe government entered its fourth week of a partial shutdown on saturday, officially making it the longest shutdown in american history. around 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. as tsa screeners are considered essential, they have been working without pay since the shutdown started on december 22.\n\nthe government entered its fourth week day of a partial shutdown on saturday, officially making it the longest shutdown in american history. around 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay. as tsa screeners are considered essential, they have been working without pay since the shutdown started on december 22.\n\nthe bonus is in recognition of their hard work during yet another busy holiday travel season, maintaining the highest of security standards during an extraordinary period, pekoske wrote on twitter.\n\nthe $500 award, as well as payment for those who worked on december 22, should appear in screeners' accounts in the next few days.\n\none tsa official compared the agency's efforts to find any available means to push payments out to officers to looking for loose change under cushions. there is a clear sense of frustration at tsa headquarters over the situation, given that the shutdown substantially limits the options to pay essential staff who are working.\n\nthe number of tsa employees are calling in sick is on the rise. miami international airport closed one of its concourses in the afternoons this weekend as a precautionary measure after tsa officers' sick calls doubled during the week. federal employees are not permitted to strike by law.\n\nwhile screening times have stayed relatively consistent nationally, sick calls climbed higher on saturday -- up 70 percent from the same day a year ago. still, more than 94 percent of staff reported as scheduled.\n\nassistant administrator for public affairs michael bilello tweeted a statement saturday security standards remain uncompromised at our nation's airports, despite the sick calls.\n\nnationwide, tsa screened 1.96 million passengers yesterday ... 99.9 percent of passengers waited less than 30 minutes; 95 percent of passengers less than 15 minutes, he said.\n\nhowever, tsa leaders remain worried about a national tipping point, when screeners look elsewhere for work.\n\nit's profoundly unfair and almost disrespectful to put us in the middle of this debate over border security when we have absolutely nothing to do with it, tsa officer mike gayzagian told cbs news.
an ethereal blue light riding the waves along a beach in tasmania may be enchanting, but it's actually a signal that the bay may be in danger. that's because the eerie glow comes from a bloom of bioluminescent algae that are known to destabilize marine food webs, according to news reports.\n\nthe shimmering blue light in tasmania's preservation bay, off the south coast of australia, is emitted by noctiluca scintillans — microscopic plankton more commonly known as sea sparkle, the bbc reported. the bioluminescent creatures chemically emit light when disturbed, according to the bbc. (in contrast, animals that are biofluorescent absorb light at a high-energy wavelength and then re-emit it at a lower wavelength, which is typically green.)\n\nthe algae aren't toxic to people, though they may cause skin irritation to some who swim in their waters. however, they can be harmful to the greater ecosystem. [bioluminescent: a glow-in-the-dark gallery]\n\nthe luminous n. scintillans thrive in water with low oxygen levels. for instance, a 2014 study published in the journal nature reported that oxygen-deficient water in the arabian sea led to three massive outbreaks of n. scintillans.\n\na beach in tasmania, an island off the south coast of australia, was bathed in an eerie, bluish glow, thanks to a large bloom of bioluminescent algae. sarah kubank\n\nthese n. scintillans blooms displaced microscopic algae, known as diatoms, to become the lowest link in the food web, live science previously reported. this change at the food chain's base can alter the entire food web, even disturbing the larger fish that people eat, the researchers said.\n\nwe contend that n. scintillans blooms could disrupt the traditional diatom-sustained food chain to the detriment of regional fisheries and long-term health of an ecosystem supporting a coastal population of nearly 120 million people, the researchers wrote in the 2014 study.\n\nit remains to be seen how the current n. scintillans bloom will affect preservation bay, but researchers are keeping an eye on it. other people have visited the bay to catch a glimpse of its iridescent light.\n\ni was gobsmacked, photographer brett chatwin told the bbc. it was just an amazing sight.\n\nn. scintillans outbreaks aren't always blue. sometimes they are green, according to a 2017 study in the marine pollution bulletin; and other times they are red, as when they bloomed in 2012 at sydney's famous bondi beach, the bbc reported.\n\noriginal article on live science.\n\neditor's recommendations
a year after it emerged, covid-19 has now claimed more than 2 million lives worldwide. experts have said for much of the last year that the only way to escape the coronavirus' grasp is through widespread vaccination. weapons to win that war have been and continue to be approved by individual countries' drug regulators in record time.\n\nbut the pace — and a host of other unique factors — have left many around the globe with concerns about the vaccines' safety and efficacy.\n\nsafe, effective, and urgent\n\nnational regulatory bodies insist corners haven't been cut. they've reviewed and accepted data provided by pharmaceutical companies showing the major vaccines already approved, and those expecting a greenlight within weeks, are between 70% and 95% effective at preventing symptomatic covid-19 infection.\n\nmore importantly, none of the trials carried out on the three vaccines to emerge first, by pfizer/biontech, moderna and oxford/astrazeneca, have shown any significant side effects.\n\nmillions of people have now had doses of all three of those vaccines, and apart from a small number of severe allergic reactions – mostly among those with a history of severe allergies – and the minor, short-term aches and pains associated with many long-established vaccines, the new drugs appear to be well tolerated.\n\na survey published by the pew research center in early december showed an increase in overall american confidence in the vaccines, with 60% saying they would get vaccinated.\n\nthere are divergent views among experts on the best near-term goals for vaccination programs, including the emphasis that should be put on achieving herd immunity, versus simply giving health care systems room to breathe.\n\nbut most experts agree with dr. anthony fauci, who told cbs news in november that the bottom line is simple: we need to get as many people as possible vaccinated.\n\nbelow is a snapshot of sentiments on vaccination in nine countries from cbs news journalists:\n\nu.k.: the roll of race and income\n\nby haley ott - a december poll by the royal society for public health showed that overall, 76% of adults in the u.k. would get a coronavirus vaccine if their doctor recommended it, but that willingness varied significantly based on a person's socio-economic status and ethnicity.\n\nthe vast majority of people in office jobs, 84%, said they would get a vaccine, but only 70% of people in unskilled/semi-skilled manual occupations or who were unemployed said they would.\n\n79% of white people said they would get a vaccine, compared to 57% of black, asian and other non-white people, according to the survey. this is reflects opinions in the u.s., too.\n\nmisinformation about the vaccine online was thought to be fueling some of the mistrust in the south asian community and among certain religious groups, bbc news has reported. messages falsely claiming the vaccines contain alcohol or animal products could deter muslims and hindus from wanting a shot.\n\nmosques across the u.k. have joined a campaign organized by the mosques and imams national advisory board to counter the false narratives, saying they'd use their friday sermons in january to urge people to get vaccinated.\n\nmore than 3 million people have had a first dose of either the oxford or pfizer vaccines in the u.k.\n\nfrance: growing confidence\n\nby elaine cobbe - the number of french people who say they're happy to be vaccinated has been on the rise. at the end of december, a poll found that just 40% were willing to have a covid-19 vaccine. that reflected a drop from polling in november and over the summer.\n\nbut as the vaccine program in france actually got underway — slowly and fraught with bureaucratic problems — surveys showed growing confidence. a poll on january 7 found that 56% of french adults were in favor of getting vaccinated: 26% said they would definitely get the vaccine when it was their turn and 30% said they would probably get it.\n\nthe young appear to be the most reluctant, with more than half of those aged 25-35 consistently saying they don't want a vaccine.\n\nmore worrisome for health authorities is the number of health care workers voicing reluctance to being vaccinated has also been high. a poll conducted in the first week of december among nursing home workers found that just 19% were keen to be vaccinated, while 76% said they did not want a vaccine.\n\nfor many, however, it's looked more like a wait and see approach than a blanket no. in the december poll, 86% of those against the vaccines said they were worried about potential side effects, especially of the vaccines like pfizer's and moderna's which have been developed using new technology.\n\nseeing the first wave of vaccinations — of nursing home residents and medical staff — go off without any serious side effects may have contributed to the rise in confidence in january.\n\ngermany: nervous nurses\n\nby anna noryskiewicz - many german health care workers have also been skeptical of the coronavirus vaccines, but one doctor tells cbs news that's likely to change.\n\na nationwide survey of medical staff, including many intensive care workers, carried out in early december found that 73% of physicians said they wanted to be vaccinated, but among nursing staff, the figure was only around 50%.\n\ndr. petra creutz, a pulmonologist in berlin, told cbs news she believed it was more a matter of uncertainty than rejection.\n\ni think it's a common reaction to be reluctant with new drugs and vaccines. but in a few weeks' time, when more people get vaccinated and more explanatory work is done, the willingness to be vaccinated will eventually grow, she predicted.\n\nmedical staff line up forthe pfizer/biontech coronavirus (covid-19) vaccine at havelhoehe community hospital in berlin, germany, january 14, 2021. fabrizio bensch/reuters\n\ngermany's leaders and health officials will be hoping she's right, as reluctance, particularly among health workers, can have a serious impact due to their inherent higher risk of contracting the virus.\n\nit is particularly important that this group is vaccinated, bavarian state premier markus söder said this week, sparking a debate among politicians after suggesting the consideration of compulsory vaccination for medical staff.\n\nitaly: reluctant health workers\n\nby chris livesay - early last year, italy was at the epicenter of the pandemic, and it became an early leader among european nations in the drive to inoculate people against the disease. almost 1 million italians had been given a first dose of coronavirus vaccine by friday.\n\nbut there is resistance, and italian officials may be hoping for the kind of growing confidence seen in france and predicted in germany. italian health care professionals have shown significant reluctance to get a shot.\n\nhealth workers prepare doses of the pfizer-biontech covid-19 vaccine at a coronavirus disease (covid-19) vaccination centre in naples, italy, january 8, 2021. ciro de luca/reuters\n\naccording to research published in december by italy's ansa news agency, one in five italian health care workers said they would refuse a vaccine at the time. in some parts of the country that figure was even higher: in the northern piedmont region, only 10-20% of nursing home workers said they planned to get vaccinated, according to the region's pandemic response unit.\n\npope francis was vaccinated this week, and he called on everyone to follow his example. speaking to italian tv on sunday, he called refusal of the vaccines suicidal.\n\nit's an ethical choice, because you are playing with health, life, but you are also playing with the lives of others, he told italian television.\n\nrussia: trust in putin, trust in sputnik\n\nby alexandra odynova - the majority of russians, 58%, are not ready to get the country's first domestically-made coronavirus vaccine — the only one available in russia to date — according to the most recent independent survey. despite the government's insistence that it's safe, many in the country remain wary of the sputnik v vaccine, which was certified for use in august before phase-3 human trials even began.\n\ndespite the lack of final data, the government lab that developed sputnik v says it's 95% effective and causes no major side effects.\n\nthe independent lavada center's poll, published just after christmas, found that most of those willing to get the vaccine were supporters of president vladimir putin. one of putin's daughters was said to have received the sputnik v vaccine before it was even approved, but the 68-year-old president hasn't received a shot yet himself.\n\nthe overwhelming majority of the president's opponents are not ready to get vaccinated, noted the lavada center.\n\nonly 38% of the overall respondents to the survey said they were willing to get the shot. about 30% said they wanted to wait at least until trials on the vaccine were completed. only 10% said they opposed vaccines in general, while 12% of the respondents said they saw no reason to get vaccinated against covid-19.\n\nlast month, kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov dismissed suggestions of a link between putin not getting vaccinated and the low public confidence in sputnik v.\n\nwe don't see any connection here, peskov told reporters. putin said months ago that he was planning to get immunized. sputnik v's developers say more than 1.5 million people in russia have received the vaccine to date.\n\njordan: royals and refugees\n\nby amjad tadros - jordan launched its national vaccination campaign on wednesday, and it was the first country to specifically include refugees in its covid-19 inoculation drive.\n\nbut national uptake hasn't been enthusiastic off the starting block: some 6 million people are eligible for inoculation in the first stage, including the elderly, people with chronic diseases, and medical workers. registration was opened on december 24, but as of this week, only about 250,000 jordanians had signed up for a shot.\n\nwe call on people to come to our centers to take the doses, wael hayajneh, a senior jordanian health official, told reporters. to encourage vaccinations, jordan's king abdullah ii, along with his 73-year-old uncle prince hassan and his eldest son crown prince hussein, were shown on state television getting their first shots this week.\n\njordan's king abdullah ii (center), along with his 73-year-old uncle prince hassan and his eldest son crown prince hussein, are seen on state television getting their first doses of covid-19 vaccine. jordanian government handout\n\nminister of health dr. natheer obeidat told reporters that he hopes that the nationwide campaign will reach between 20% and 25% of the country's citizens in the coming months.\n\njordan is home to some 750,00 syrian refugees, and that population has been hit by the coronavirus. the united nations refugee agency's representative in jordan, dominik bartsch, told cbs news that the first few refugees who have the same medical priorities as their jordanian brothers and sisters were included in that very first round of vaccination.\n\nat least 43 refugees were among those vaccinated this week.\n\njapan: history of rumors and mistrust\n\nby lucy craft - compared to the rush elsewhere to get shots into arms, japan's tortoise-like approach to vaccination might seem incomprehensible. japan's first round of vaccinations, using the pfizer vaccine, is still more than a month away.\n\npublic health officials here are under unusual pressure to reassure the public that covid-19 vaccines are safe. japan, according to a recent study in the lancet medical journal, is among the world's most vaccine-wary nations in general, and consequently has some of the highest rates of vaccine-preventable disease in the world.\n\nthere was a marked swerve toward vaccine hesitancy in the early 1990s, when reports linked the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (mmr) — without any definitive data — to cases of aseptic meningitis.\n\nhistory repeated itself in 2013, when anecdotal reports claimed the hpv vaccine was causing serious side effects, including one young woman who said she was left in a wheelchair by it. researchers in japan and europe confirmed the vaccine's safety, but the damage was done.\n\nhpv vaccination rates dropped from 70% to less than 1%. that drop is now blamed for 5,700 needless cervical cancer deaths.\n\nsensationalized coverage of purported side effects, and what the lancet describes as a passive government vaccination policy, have nurtured public suspicions.\n\na recent poll by national broadcaster nhk showed 36% of japanese wouldn't take a covid-19 vaccine. that's not remarkably low trust, but public health officials will be incredibly alert to any unvetted reports of side effects sparking another media-fueled panic.\n\nindia: some convincing to do\n\nby arshad r. zargar - india's mass-vaccination drive kicks off on saturday. it's using a domestically produced stock of the oxford/astrazeneca vaccine, and another indian-developed drug.\n\nboth the vaccines have been authorized for emergency use and there should be no doubt about their safety. they have been tested on thousands of people and side-effects are negligible, said dr. v.k. paul, of the indian government's coronavirus and vaccines taskforce.\n\nbut not everyone is convinced.\n\na survey by public engagement social media platform local circles earlier this month found 69% of indians said they wouldn't take a coronavirus vaccine, or would at least wait for months before deciding to get one. only 26% of respondents said they would get a vaccine shot as soon as it becomes available.\n\ndelhi-based marketing professional rupali dhanda, who has a masters in biochemistry, told cbs news she wasn't ready yet, arguing that there's not enough research yet on the vaccines.\n\ndelhi hospitality worker ravi kumar said he trusts the vaccines somewhat, but not the government's vaccination program.\n\ni would prefer to buy the vaccine on the market when it's available, he said, explaining that he lost trust in the government's health care system when he caught the coronavirus last year, but had six tests with different results. it was like a joke, he said.\n\nepidemiologist ramanan laxminarayan, director of the washington-based center for disease dynamics, economics and policy (cddep), told cbs news that attitudes towards the covid vaccine will likely change a lot in coming months, based on any side effects and the speed and efficiency of the rollout.\n\npakistan: can't even beat polio\n\nby imtiaz tyab - pakistan's government has pinned its hopes of inoculating the nation's 230 million-plus citizens with a coronavirus vaccine created by a chinese company. officials say the cansinobio vaccine is near the end of phase-3 human trials in pakistan and has shown considerable promise.\n\nthe south asian nation is one of seven countries testing the chinese vaccine, but a recent poll conducted by gallup pakistan showed 37% of pakistanis wouldn't get a covid-19 vaccine when it's available.\n\npakistan suffers from extreme poverty, rampant corruption, and has a tiny health budget. it's struggled to contain the virus largely because hospital space is limited and many areas only have rudimentary health care facilities.\n\nbut it's the nation's deep mistrust of vaccines causing the most concern. for years, pakistan's efforts to wipe out polio have been thwarted largely due to public fear of foreign vaccines.\n\nthese anti-vaxx sentiments have been inflamed by tribal leaders and religious clerics claiming the polio drops are part of a western plot to sterilize muslims.\n\ntoday, pakistan and neighboring afghanistan remain the only two countries where polio hasn't been eradicated.\n\nthe deep-rooted mistrust has, for years, seen dozens of people killed in attacks on polio vaccination teams, including an attack this week.\n\nthe vaccine conspiracy theories only got worse after a pakistani doctor was accused of running a fake vaccination campaign to help the c.i.a. track down osama bin laden.\n\nwhile the dangers of polio have been well known for decades, covid-19 is a new disease, and the government's weak messaging around the virus have likely made things worse.\n\nprime minister imran khan ordered a national lockdown early in the pandemic, but quickly abandoned it as the virus spread widely in the country.\n\npakistan has officially recorded a total of over 423,000 coronavirus infections and close to 8,500 deaths. but experts say the real toll is likely much higher, because the government is only doing a fraction of the testing it should.
steven spielberg's critically-acclaimed new movie, the post, dramatizes the washington post's historic decision to publish top-secret government documents detailing america's decades-long involvement in the vietnam war. none of that would have happened without daniel ellsberg.\n\nthe former defense department analyst, who is still alive today, leaked the documents known as the pentagon papers to the new york times and the washington post, setting off a chain of events that would forever change america's perception of the war.\n\nactor matthew rhys portrays ellsberg in the new movie starring meryl streep and tom hanks. he joined cbs this morning to discuss what it was like to play one of america's most famous whistleblowers.\n\ni was ashamed to say i didn't know as much as i should know about what he did, rhys said. he was a pioneer in his time in whistleblowing, if you will, and had such clarity of intention about the wrongdoing this war was doing not just to the united states, but to the country of vietnam as well.\n\nrhys says little has changed about the man he describes as ardent and fervent.\n\nhis campaigning is tireless, rhys said. the more i learned, the more i was staggered by his bravery.\n\nin the movie, ellsberg takes the classified documents from the rand corporation, where he worked, and proceeds to photocopy them in secret with the help of his colleagues. in real life, ellsberg's children were his helpers.\n\nit was what ultimately got the fbi onto him, rhys said.\n\nhe was divorced at the time and when the children went back to be with their mother, they told their grandmother what they'd been up to.\n\nand what was it like for rhys to work with director steven spielberg?\n\nit's everything you want and then, you know, the worst thing in the world, to some extent, when it happens because it's like acting in front of god. he's like an icon.
over the past 40 years, damage from major weather and climate disasters has cost the united states nearly $2 trillion dollars. a closer look at the data reveals that recently the cost of such incidents has been escalating quickly, due in part to human-caused climate change.\n\naccording to noaa's assessment of the biggest u.s. weather disasters — those with an inflation-adjusted cost of a billion dollars or more — the economic toll rose from an average of $17.8 billion a year in the 1980s to over $81 billion a year in the 2010s.\n\nnow a new study from stanford university puts a number value on the portion of the increasing costs caused specifically by the rise in floods linked to climate change. the study, published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences, examines flooding related to rain and snow events and finds that of the $199 billion in u.s. flood damage from 1988 to 2017, more than one-third is directly related to trends in intensifying precipitation.\n\ntwo recent disasters that come to mind in which flooding made up the vast majority of economic damage include 2017's hurricane harvey, which cost the u.s. a staggering $125 billion, and the historic 2019 midwest floods which devastated the heartland and cost around $3 billion.\n\nflooded homes are shown near lake houston following hurricane harvey, august 30, 2017, in houston, texas. win mcnamee/getty images\n\nbut how much of the financial toll of disasters like these is due to climate change making things worse, and how much is due to socioeconomic factors like increased population and value of assets? this study helps to clarify this debate among many experts who work in disaster-related fields. that's important because, with the impacts of climate change continuing to mount, there's an urgency among scientists and economists to quantify how much climate change is costing us and how much it may cost us in the future.\n\ndr. noah diffenbaugh, co-author of the research and professor of earth system science at stanford university, says obtaining this quantification was the motivation for this study. there has been a lot of research about the impacts of climate change on different natural and human systems, but relatively little of that has focused on generating hard numbers quantifying the financial costs of those impacts, diffenbaugh said. this study provides those numbers for flooding, which is one of the most costly natural disasters.\n\nthe mechanism behind why climate change is causing more extreme floods is very straightforward: a warmer ocean and atmosphere provides more energy to fuel more extreme weather systems.\n\nto start with, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and dump more precipitation. a simple equation called the clausius-clapeyron rate calculates that for every 2 degree fahrenheit increase in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold 8% more moisture, and thus produce more rain or snow.\n\nhowever, the extra energy in the earth system goes a step further. a warmer atmosphere and ocean can also power more intense weather systems, which increase rainfall rates and also the overall precipitation which falls in a storm. so, even if a region's average rainfall is decreasing, individual storms still tend to produce more precipitation.\n\nin recent decades, heavy rain and snow events are increasing due to a warmer atmosphere. this is especially true in the midwest, great lakes and northeast. climate central\n\nthe most extreme events have been intensifying more rapidly as a result of climate change, and this is a pattern that is true across the country, even in regions where average precipitation has not changed or has decreased slightly, explains the study's lead author, frances davenport, a phd student at stanford earth.\n\nwhen asked how much of the increased extreme rain was due to climate change versus natural pattern changes, davenport said, while natural climate variability has also had some effect on precipitation over the historical time period, the observed changes in extreme precipitation are very consistent with what we expect to occur as a result of human-caused climate change.\n\ndavenport says that the flood damage cost from rainfall in hurricane harvey, which dumped up to 60 inches of rain on texas's gulf coast, made up about 20%of the $199 billion evaluated in her study. a series of studies after harvey found that climate change resulted in the storm dumping up to 38% more rainfall than it otherwise would have.\n\nthese more extreme precipitation events more easily overwhelm infrastructure like flood barriers and drainage, which were built for the tamer climate of the 1900s, not the souped-up climate of the 2000s. the image below shows this is also true for rivers and streams, many of which have seen an increase in streamflow since the 1980s.\n\nwhile some rivers have seen a decrease in streamflow, the majority of u.s. rivers are seeing increases, which are leading to more flooding events. climate central\n\nin order to calculate which portion of the flood damage between 1988 and 2017 was due to increases in extreme events on a warmer planet, the team started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data and then applied advanced methods from economics and statistics. using these tools they constructed an economic model to analyze the relationship between observed precipitation and flood damage month by month and state by state.\n\nthey also used the model for a counterfactual analysis in which they calculated what the damages would be if there were no changes in extreme precipitation.\n\ntogether, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the u.s. overall, the study found 36% of the cost of flooding over that time period can be attributed directly to increasing extreme precipitation events, or almost $75 billion of the estimated $199 billion total.\n\nand with much more climate heating anticipated in the future, the team says the proportion of costs due to extreme events will only get worse.\n\nour analyses show that exceeding the 2 degrees celsius level of global warming identified in the u.n. paris agreement is likely to result in further intensification of extreme precipitation, says diffenbaugh. so, if the future is anything like the past, we can expect continued increases in flood damages from future changes in precipitation.\n\nbeyond the impact from flood events, diffenbaugh says the study goes further by establishing a methodology for economists to apply on various forms of extreme weather going forward. the study provides a framework for calculating how much climate change is likely to cost in the future, as well as the economic value of reducing emissions in order to limit the level of global warming, he said.\n\nmuch of the concern about taking action to limit global warming has been framed around how much it will cost to transition from fossil fuels, diffenbaugh added. indeed, it will cost too much is a familiar refrain among those who oppose action to combat climate change, to which the climate-concerned always counter: we can't afford not to. that's because as the planet gets warmer, the impacts of climate change increase exponentially.\n\nthe team's findings provide a method to separate the costs of the different variables — vital pieces of the puzzle for policy makers who must weigh the costs of action versus inaction. armed with this understanding, they can use cost-benefit calculations to determine how, and how much, to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation.\n\nthe need for these calculations is becoming more and more important, because as the climate warms, diffenbaugh says, the costs of inaction continue to increase.\n\nthis study shows that changes in precipitation are already costing billions of dollars, and that we can expect more global warming to further intensify the precipitation events that are driving those climate-related costs.
pennsylvania state police believe they have solved a 20-year-old somerset county kidnapping case that sparked a four-state manhunt and gained national attention on the crime-fighting television show america's most wanted.\n\nstate police arrested 50-year-old timothy david nelson, of cumberland, maryland, at the cumberland police department tuesday morning. police said nelson was named as a suspect through fingerprint identification following a decades-long investigation. an unidentified dna profile in the case had previously linked it to two other similar cases in maryland, police said.\n\naccording to police, on the afternoon of sept. 19, 1999, nelson grabbed a 10-year-old girl who was walking with two friends along a street in cairnbrook. trooper steve limani, a pennsylvania state police spokesman, said the child's friends reported to police that the man threw her into his car through the driver's side door before driving away. the man displayed a handgun and threatened to shoot the child if she screamed, limani said, and at one point put the gun down and struck the girl on the face.\n\ntimothy david nelson cbs pittsburgh\n\nhe pulled the car over in southern somerset county, north of pennsylvania's border with maryland and west virginia, and sexually assaulted her, limani said. investigators believe he was startled by passing cars and he continued driving south towards west virginia. he again pulled the car over and sexually assaulted the child before driving a short distance away and releasing her. she was found walking along a road by a passerby in markleysburg, fayette county, just north of the west virginia line and more than 50 miles from where she was abducted.\n\npennsylvania state police scoured the area and uncovered what would later become a key piece of evidence in the case, limani said — a paper bag that the suspect had tossed out of the car following the second assault, which contained bodily fluid and a fingerprint.\n\nthe kidnapping prompted a multistate search for the driver of a teal-green geo metro, the vehicle used to commit the crime. in the weeks thereafter, metro drivers were stopped, some as many as 20 or 30 times, by authorities looking for the kidnapper.\n\nthe kidnapper, a white man in his 20s or 30s, wore an unusual moss green t-shirt featuring a cartoon alien reading a newspaper in front of a fireplace with human heads mounted on a wall. a $10,000 reward was offered for information leading to his arrest. the crime was also featured on the oct. 30, 1999, episode of america's most wanted, garnering about two dozen tips.\n\ntrooper jeff brock led an extensive investigation involving numerous local, state and federal law enforcement agencies, but no leads were able to be developed.\n\nin 2004, using a dna profile developed from the body fluid on the brown paper bag, police determined that the same suspect — then unidentified — was linked to two other unsolved kidnappings in 1988 and 1989 in hagerstown, maryland. no further leads developed, however, police said.\n\nthen, in late 2018, nearing a career landmark of 20 years with the state police force and determined to close the case, brock again contacted an fbi agent he had worked with over the years.\n\ni'd been carrying this around with me for 19 years — i had to try one more thing, brock said.\n\nthe agent used a high-tech computer system to re-run the fingerprint found on the bag against national databases to scan for a match.\n\nshe called me about a week later and said, 'are you sitting down?' brock told reporters thursday.\n\na match had come up: nelson. his fingerprint was now in the system after a recent arrest, limani said. the automated fingerprint identification system or afis hadn't been available to investigators back in 1999, limani said.\n\nbrock became emotional as he spoke to reporters, saying the arrest wasn't about him but that he wanted to help bring closure to the victims.\n\ni just have a hard time believing they weren't thinking, 'where did he ever go? is he still alive? is he dead? where does he live?' brock said. 'does he live down the street from me, or does he live thousands of miles away?' you don't know. but by getting to this point, now you do know. and to me that's the most important thing, is bringing this to a closure.\n\nbrock said he notified the pennsylvania victim in person.\n\nnelson was in custody in cumberland, maryland, for an unrelated case on tuesday when pennsylvania state police served a search warrant for his dna and arrested him in the 1999 case. nelson has been charged with 23 counts, including 16 felonies, in somerset county. the charges include kidnapping, rape, unlawful restraint, aggravated indecent assault and terroristic threats. he is being held without bond and has waived extradition to pennsylvania, according to online maryland court documents.\n\npolice believed at the time of the kidnapping that the suspect may also have been responsible for attempted abductions of children in central city and richland township. no other charges have been filed against nelson in pennsylvania, according to the unified judicial system of pennsylvania web portal. the washington county sheriff's office in maryland, which handled the 1988 and 1989 abductions in hagerstown linked to the pennsylvania case by dna, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from cbs news regarding whether they expect to charge nelson in those cases.\n\nlimani said it's not common for a suspect linked to multiple crimes over the course of decades to stop the pattern of criminal behavior unless there's some type of lifestyle change, such as joining the military or getting married. he said investigators found no such gap with nelson are are concerned there could be more victims. he encouraged law enforcement who may have encountered similar cases or any other possible victims to contact them.\n\nthe arrest was welcome news for many somerset county residents, some of whom feared to leave their children alone outside following the abduction.\n\nformer somerset county 911 dispatcher geraldine budzina took the emergency call from the missing girl's parents in 1999.\n\nit's one of those calls that sticks with you, she said wednesday. it's one of those things where you don't hear nothing for 20 years. you don't think it'll come up.\n\nbudzina said she's amazed investigators finally tracked down the suspect.\n\ni'm really glad that, even though it's been 20 years, he's going to pay for what he did, budzina said.
this segment originally aired dec. 5, 2004. ed bradley is the correspondent. michael radutzky, producer.\n\nthere is no living musician who has been more influential than bob dylan.\n\nover a 43-year career, his distinctive twang and poetic lyrics have produced some of the most memorable songs ever written. in the 60s, his songs of protest and turmoil spoke to an entire generation.\n\nwhile his life has been the subject of endless interpretation, dylan has been largely silent. at 63, he wrote a memoir called chronicles, volume one. correspondent ed bradley got to sit down with this music legend in his first television interview in nearly 20 years.\n\ndylan is mysterious, elusive, fascinating – just like his music.\n\nover more than four decades, dylan has produced 500 songs and more than 40 albums. does he ever look back at the music he's written with surprise?\n\ni used to. i don't do that anymore. i don't know how i got to write those songs. those early songs were almost magically written, says dylan, who quotes from his 1964 classic, it's alright, ma.\n\ntry to sit down and write something like that. there's a magic to that, and it's not siegfried and roy kind of magic, you know? it's a different kind of a penetrating magic. and, you know, i did it. i did it at one time.\n\ndoes he think he can do it again today? no, says dylan. you can't do something forever, he says. i did it once, and i can do other things now. but, i can't do that.\n\ndylan has been writing music since he was a teenager in the remote town of hibbing, minnesota. he was the eldest of two sons of abram and beatty zimmerman.\n\nhow was his childhood? i really didn't consider myself happy or unhappy, says dylan. i always knew that there was something out there that i needed to get to. and it wasn't where i was at that particular moment.\n\nin his book, dylan writes that he came alive at 19, when he moved to greenwich village in new york city -- which at the time was the frenetic center of the 60s counterculture. within months, dylan had signed a recording contract with columbia records.\n\nyou refer to new york as the capital of the world. but when you told your father that, he thought that it was a joke, says bradley. did your parents approve of you being a singer-songwriter? going to new york?\n\nno. they wouldn't have wanted that for me. but my parents never went anywhere, says dylan. my father probably thought the capital of the world was wherever he was at the time. it couldn't possibly be anyplace else. where he and his wife were in their own home, that, for them, was the capital of the world.\n\nso what made dylan different? what pushed him out there?\n\ni listened to the radio a lot. i hung out in the record stores. and i slam-banged around on the guitar and played the piano and learned songs from a world which didn't exist around me, says dylan.\n\nhe says that he knew even then that he was destined to become a music legend. i was heading for the fantastic lights, he writes. destiny was looking right at me and nobody else.\n\nwhat does the word destiny mean to dylan?\n\nit's a feeling you have that you know something about yourself - nobody else does - the picture you have in your mind of what you're about will come true, says dylan. it's kind of a thing you kind of have to keep to your own self, because it's a fragile feeling. and if you put it out there, somebody will kill it. so, it's best to keep that all inside.\n\nwhen bradley asked dylan why he changed his name from robert zimmerman, he said that was destiny, too. some people – you're born, you know, the wrong names, wrong parents. i mean, that happens, says dylan. you call yourself what you want to call yourself. this is the land of the free.\n\ndylan created a world inspired by old folk music, with piercing and poetic lyrics, in songs such as a hard rain's a-gonna fall. these were songs that reflected the tension and unrest of the civil rights and anti-war movements of the 60s.\n\nit was an explosive mixture that turned dylan, by 25, into a cultural and political icon -- playing to sold-out concert halls around the world, and followed by people wherever he went. dylan was called the voice of his generation -- and was actually referred to as a prophet, a messiah.\n\nyet dylan says he saw himself simply as a musician: you feel like an impostor when someone thinks you're something and you're not.\n\nwhat was the image that people had of him? and what was the reality?\n\nthe image of me was certainly not a songwriter or a singer, says dylan. it was more like some kind of a threat to society in some kind of way.\n\nwhat was the toughest part for him personally? it was like being in an edgar allan poe story. and you're just not that person everybody thinks you are, though they call you that all the time, says dylan. 'you're the prophet. you're the savior.' i never wanted to be a prophet or savior. elvis maybe. i could easily see myself becoming him. but prophet? no.\n\nhe may not have seen himself as the voice of the '60s generation, but his songs were viewed as anthems that sparked a moment.\n\nmy stuff were songs, you know? they weren't sermons, says dylan. if you examine the songs, i don't believe you're gonna find anything in there that says that i'm a spokesman for anybody or anything really.\n\nbut they saw it, says bradley.\n\nthey must not have heard the songs, says dylan.\n\nit's ironic, that the way that people viewed you was just the polar opposite of the way you viewed yourself, says bradley.\n\nisn't that something, says dylan.\n\ndylan did almost anything to shatter the lofty image many people had of him. he writes that he intentionally made bad records, and once poured whiskey over his head in public.\n\nhe also writes that, as a stunt, he went to israel and made a point of having his picture taken at the wailing wall wearing a skullcap. when he went to israel, he writes that the newspapers changed him overnight into a zionist. how did this help?\n\nif the common perception of me out there in the public was that i was either a drunk, or i was a sicko, or a zionist, or a buddhist, or a catholic, or a mormon – all of this was better than 'archbishop of anarchy,' says dylan, referring to being considered the voice of a generation opposed to everything.\n\ndylan was especially opposed to the media, which he says were always trying to pin him down. he wrote, the press, i figured, you lied to it. why?\n\ni realized at the time that the press, the media, they're not the judge -- god's the judge, says dylan. the only person you have to think about lying twice to is either yourself or to god. the press isn't either of them. and i just figured they're irrelevant.\n\ndylan tried to run away from all of that. in the mid-60s, he retreated with his wife and three young children to woodstock, new york. but even there, he couldn't escape the legions of fans who descended on his home, begging for an audience with the legend himself. he says people would actually come to the house, wanting to discuss things with me, politics and philosophy and organic farming and things.\n\nwhat did dylan know about organic farming? nothing, he says. not a thing.\n\nwhat did he mean when he wrote that the funny thing about fame is that nobody believes it's you?\n\npeople, they'll say, 'are you who i think you are?' and you'll say, 'i don't know.' then, they'll say, 'you're him.' and you'll say, 'ok, you know, that – yes,' says dylan. and then, the next thing they'll say, 'well, no, you know? like are you really him? you're not him.' and, you know, that can go on and on.\n\nhe says he doesn't like to eat in restaurants because of all the attention he gets. and he says he has never gotten use to it.\n\nat his peak, fame was taking its toll on dylan. he was heading toward a divorce from his wife, sara. and in concerts, he wore white makeup to mask himself. but his songs revealed the pain.\n\nabout his ex-wife, dylan says: she was with me back then, through thick and thin, you know? and it just wasn't the kind of life that she had ever envisioned for herself, any more the than the kind of life that i was living, that i had envisioned for mine.\n\nby the mid-1980s, dylan felt he was burned out and over the hill. and he wrote some pretty harsh words about himself: i'm a 60s troubadour, a folk-rock relic. a wordsmith from bygone days. i'm in the bottomless pit of cultural oblivion.\n\ni'd seen all these titles written about me, says dylan. i believed it, anyway. i wasn't getting any thrill out of performing. i thought it might be time to close it up. … i had thought i'd just put it away for a while. but then i started thinking, 'that's enough, you know?'\n\nbut within a few years, dylan said he had recaptured his creative spark, and went back on the road. he performed more than 100 concerts a year. and he won three grammy awards in 1998 for his album, time out of mind.\n\nat 63, dylan remains a voice as unique and powerful as any there has ever been in american music.\n\nhis fellow musicians paid tribute to him when he was inducted into the rock and roll hall of fame, joining him in a rousing rendition of his most famous song, like a rolling stone. that song was recently named by rolling stone magazine as the no. 1 song of all time. and he has 12 other songs on their list of the top 500.\n\nthat must be good to have as part of your legacy, says bradley.\n\noh, maybe this week. but you know, the list, they change names, and you know, quite frequently, really. i don't really pay much attention to that, says dylan.\n\nbut it's a pat on the back, says bradley.\n\nthis week it is, dylan replies. but who's to say how long that's gonna last?\n\nhis success, however, has lasted a long time. dylan is still performing all of his songs on tour, and he says he doesn't take any of it for granted.\n\nso why is he still out there?\n\nit goes back to that destiny thing. i mean, i made a bargain with it, you know, long time ago. and i'm holding up my end … to get where i am now, says dylan.\n\nand with whom did he make the bargain? with the chief commander, says dylan, laughing. in this earth and in the world we can't see.\n\ndylan's book was a bestseller. it was published by simon & schuster, which is owned by viacom, the parent company of cbs. dylan is planning to write two more volumes of his memoirs.
like many athletes, simon wheatcroft loves chasing that runner's high. i still get a real buzz from doing it, he said. he trains on this path near his home in doncaster, a village in north-central england. but to really stretch his legs, he takes to the open road, sharing the solitude of his run with passing traffic. now, any jogger knows that that can be a dangerous proposition, but for simon it's especially so.\n\nsimon wheatcroft is completely blind.\n\ni was born with retinitis pigmentosa, which is a genetic disorder where your vision deteriorates over time, he said.\n\nhe was diagnosed with this rare condition when he was about 11. for a while, he could still discern shapes and recognize some faces, but by age 27 it was all gone.\n\ncorrespondent lee cowan asked, how did you handle that at first?\n\nat first didn't handle it very well at all, you know? i was struggling to see, to move around, on a daily basis. but there's nothing you can do, you know? your vision's slipping away; you can't stop that.\n\nit really hit home the day he decided to propose. in 2009 he made his way to the u.s., with the hope of popping the question to his girlfriend high atop half dome in yosemite national park.\n\nbut halfway in, he realized the hike was more than he could handle.\n\nso, what were you thinking knowing you had to turn back? cowan asked.\n\ni was incredibly angry, wheatcroft replied. i was faced with an obstacle, [and] the only reason i couldn't overcome it was because i couldn't see.\n\nhe did end up proposing, in the shadow of half dome instead of on top of it, but what he also vowed was he would never let his lack of sight get in the way of his mobility again.\n\noften in life we all seek control of our own destiny. and i felt like i needed to readjust, to gain control and learn to overcome these obstacles, wheatcroft said.\n\nhe is a bit of an over-achiever; he's now run the new york city marathon three times, and the boston marathon three times. he's even attempted two 100-mile plus ultra-marathons, all while testing different pieces of technology that he hopes one day will help the quarter-billion people around the world who are visually impaired either walk, hike or, yes, run without the help of a guide.\n\nwheatcroft said, i wanted to prove that my mobility could be mastered, 'cause mobility is hard for a blind person. so it seemed like the only sort of viable decision was to learn to run alone.\n\nand were you a runner before? cowan asked.\n\nno!\n\nso, just how does he do it? well, he started out slow, first on a soccer field running back and forth between the goal posts.\n\nto guide him he tried out an app called runkeeper by ibm that uses voice commands to tell a runner time and distance.\n\ncowan asked, when you were running back and forth, nobody could tell you couldn't see?\n\nno, you know, even today i still don't particularly wear anything that says that i'm blind, he replied.\n\nsoon, he upped it a notch, to a stretch of road about a third of a mile long that was closed to traffic. yeah, just running up and down and up and down. i peaked at ten laps of it, he laughed.\n\nrunner simon wheatcroft shows lee cowan a haptic navigation device. cbs news\n\nhis confidence grew, but so did his boredom. one day, almost without thinking, wheatcroft left that closed road and ran into traffic. he couldn't see the cars, but he could hear them, and reasoned if they got too close they'd just drive around him (or so he hoped).\n\ni was definitely overcome with emotion, he said. i did burst into tears and think, wow, you know, i've really broken through a barrier there.\n\nhe showed cowan how he stays near the curb, on the double yellow lines. he says he can actually feel the thickness of the paint through his sneakers.\n\ni'm trying to feel the lines and feel the difference between the one foot and the other, he said. so, the feeling right now for the right foot feels very different from the left foot. and it's that difference that helps to guide.\n\nsimon wheatcroft can sense the lines of yellow paint to guide him. cbs news\n\ncowan asked, did the noise of the cars ever get you a little [scared]?\n\nno, because i can hear them coming from a fair distance away.\n\nit is easy to forget that everything simon is doing is in the dark. once while running simon shot video of what it would look like for him. it's pretty un-nerving, seeing metal lampposts and street signs go flying by, knowing that he can't see any of them coming.\n\nroad obstacles that simon may face during his run. cbs news\n\nbut he's memorized where each and every one of those obstacles is, by creating a mental map of his five-mile route.\n\nhe knows these roads so well he could practically drive them. in fact, he gave cowan driving directions. he was flawless; cowan, me not so much.\n\nso, you're about to sail by it … yep, yep you sailed by it! wheatcroft laughed.\n\ni just missed the turn!\n\nso, go straight at the roundabout.\n\nit's all pretty impressive, and wheatcroft was getting noticed.\n\nwhen the designers of runkeeper heard how he had adapted their app to help him navigate, they featured him in an ad campaign.\n\nin 2016 he teamed up with ibm to develop a guidance system that he nicknamed eascot, after his guide dog. it was a prototype that with the help of gps - gave simon audio cues that kept him on course.\n\nits big test was a grueling 155-mile ultra-marathon, through the namibian desert no less. he made it almost half way totally unassisted.\n\nthe system worked, said wheatcroft. you know, there was a point where i'm just running through the desert alone and it's just, like, you know, this was a dream a few years ago, and now i'm actually doing it.\n\nand then what happened? on the second day, i managed to run into the only flagpole in the desert! yeah, i took a big blow from the flagpole to the face.\n\nit's not the first time he's taken a serious body blow.\n\nthe worst, though, was when he ran head-long into the twisted remnants of a burned-out car while training on his route near his house.\n\ni thought i was sweating really badly, but it turned out it was blood that was pouring down my arm, he said. and that's when i pulled out my phone to call my wife and say, 'you've gotta come find me over here, it's bad.'\n\nsian, the woman he'd proposed to on that ill-fated hike in yosemite, told cowan, it was quite scary. we didn't know where he was, what we were going to find.\n\nso, what changed after that incident?\n\ni think he became a little bit more careful, she said.\n\nsian isn't always keen on her husband pushing the envelope, especially since they have two young boys together, grayson and franklin. but she knows that, although it's dangerous, there is a bigger picture.\n\nhe wants to change the world for blind people, she said. and he wants to prove that they can do whatever they set their mind to.\n\npretty lofty goal, cowan said.\n\nyeah, and i think he can actually do it.\n\nwe were there when he opened a new piece of technology to test, called aira.\n\ni feel all space-age, wheatcroft laughed, putting on what appears to be a google glass on steroids. aira is a new service that visually-impaired people can now subscribe to in the u.s.\n\nit works like this: a camera on those glasses beams video back to a sighted agent, who then acts as the user's eyes. one agent demonstrated with a user: directly in front of you, juan, is a sign. if you'll go slightly to the right, towards one o'clock, to avoid it.\n\nsimon wheatcroft wears a pair of aira glasses, which can transmit images to a sighted assistant. cbs news\n\nwheatcroft was the first in the u.k. to try it. he took it to a local market where the agent at the other end helped him browse the store shelves.\n\nyeah, i'm after the one with the green top, he said in the milk aisle.\n\nok, that one's got a green top on it, said emma.\n\noh, perfect. ok.\n\nhe told cowan, the reason i wanted it is, i wanted to demonstrate to as many blind people as possible to say, 'look, look what we can get our hands on in a few months. this can remove all those difficult points in your life, and this could be a true independence piece of technology.'\n\nwheatcroft thinks aira just might be the breakthrough that could make his dream of running solo come true.\n\nhe is studying for his masters in computer science, and he hopes to continue perfecting more technology for the blind. the goal is that these pieces of technology exist so people can do all these things and more, safely, he said. they shouldn't have to take the risk that i took.\n\nhe's no hero, he says, nor does he consider himself an inspiration. he's a test pilot of sorts for those who are blind or visually-impaired who, like him, hope technology one day may brighten their world.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\nstory produced by deirdre cohen.
teen climate activist greta thunberg squashed criticism from president trump and treasury secretary steve mnuchin on the last day of the world economic forum on friday, saying it's had no effect on her. she also took part in a climate march, days after calling for world and business leaders at the event to divest from fossil fuels.\n\nalmost two years since her first school strike, thunberg concluded her week in the swiss alps by participating in one of her signature climate action protests with other young people. during a news conference before the march with fellow youth leaders, thunberg fielded a question from a reporter who asked about the effect mr. trump and mnunchin has had on targeting her publicly. she said it's had no effect on her.\n\nif we care about that, we wouldn't be able to do what we do, she said. we cannot care about those kinds of things. if we put ourselves in this spotlight, then we know that people do not understand the situation. the situation is not being treated as the crisis it is.\n\nswedish climate activist greta thunberg marches during a friday for the future youth demonstration in davos, switzerland. fabrice coffrini/ getty images\n\nshe expressed frustration on lack of action from influential people at davos in position to mitigate the climate change crisis.\n\nwe must remember that as long we do not treat this crisis as a crisis, and as long as facts and science are being left completely ignored, then we will not be able to solve this crisis, she said. before we came here, we had a few demands for this wef and of course, those demands have been completely ignored. we expected nothing less.\n\nas long as the situation is not being treated as a crisis, then world and business leaders can continue to ignore the situations and don't have to do anything because they are not being held accountable, thunberg added.\n\nthe strike caps off a newsworthy week for thunberg. on wednesday, she accused politicians of all stripes of making promises but failing to deliver any results, saying, our house is still on fire. she also demanded companies and governments divest from fossil fuels, as well as immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nmnuchin dismissed her remark and said she could explain it after she goes and studies economics in college. thunberg fired back on twitter, as experts in the field, including a chief economist at mnuchin's former employer, goldman sachs, touted the benefits of policies to fighting climate change and its positive impact on the global economy.\n\nthe activist has been criticized by mr. trump, who took a veiled swipe at her remarks when he spoke at davos. mr. trump said it was time to reject the warnings of prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.
xerox (xrx) is reportedly discussing a variety of deal options with fujifilm holdings, including a change of control, as the american copy and printer giant battles activist investor carl icahn.\n\nthe discussions, as reported by the wall street journal, are said to preclude a full takeover of xerox. it's also possible that no deal could be reached, the publication said.\n\nxerox is under fire from icahn to install new leadership, warning in december that the company could turn out like eastman kodak, the once dominant photography company that filed for bankruptcy several years ago. icahn is pushing for new board members, arguing the company needs to invest in new products and research and development.\n\nxerox and fujifilm, which already have a joint venture, could cut costs through a deal, the journal noted. shares of xerox rose 16 cents to $30.35 on wednesday. in the late 1990s, the stock traded as high as $160 per share.\n\nthis is a developing story .....
as a teenager grammy-winning singer-songwriter meghan trainor believed she had the talent to be a superstar, but not the right look, she tells correspondent tracy smith in an interview for cbs' sunday morning with charles osgood, to be broadcast march 6.\n\ntrainor, 22, now has the kind of success many artists dream of, including the hit all about that bass, an anthem for self-acceptance. yet not so long ago, she hid her body as a teen growing up on the island of nantucket, massachusetts.\n\ni -- every day -- wore sweatshirts and sweatpants to cover up my body, 'cause i was so insecure, trainor tells smith. and it would be summer. and i would go on vacation and i'd be in trinidad and tobago, 90-degree weather, and i'd be wearing sweatshirts that said 'nantucket.'\n\ntrainor said she would resist family members asking her to change into more weather-appropriate clothes.\n\ni didn't want to show my arms, she said. i didn't want to show anything, and i was just so insecure and uncomfortable, and i thought, 'all right, if i'm fully covered -- i'm good.\n\nand that's not what i should have been feeling.\n\nshe can't explain exactly why she felt like that: i see pictures of my face and i'm just -- i'm like sad, and i'm in a sweatshirt and i'm in my room producing 'cause i just turned off the idea of, like, 'you'll be the face.'\n\nback then, trainor said, she told herself she would worry about dieting and getting her body together when she was 25 or so. but thanks to the phenomenal success of all about that bass and a number of other hits (including lips are movin' ), trainor learned to accept herself, and as a result has become an important role model for young listeners struggling with similar body image issues.\n\ni get messages all the time: 'i hated myself, i didn't wanna go to school. i was so uncomfortable, and now i love myself. and i was in a really dark place until your song came out,' trainor said. and i was like, 'whoa, man, we gotta do more of these songs!'\n\nsmith also visits with trainor in the recording studio where she is working on her second album, as well as at her old school, cape cod's nauset regional high school.\n\nthe emmy award-winning sunday morning, hosted by charles osgood, is broadcast on cbs on sundays beginning at 9:00 a.m. et. executive producer is rand morrison.\n\nfollow the program on twitter (@cbssunday), facebook, instagram (#cbssundaymorning) and at cbssundaymorning.com. you can also listen to sunday morning audio podcasts at play.it.\n\n\n\nfor more info:
cedar falls, iowa — unite the country, an independent political action committee supporting joe biden, is on pace to outspend his campaign in iowa with just a week to go before the iowa caucuses.\n\nthe super pac, which is able to collect unlimited donations, has purchased or reserved more than $4.5 million on broadcast and cable advertisements through monday, when the iowa caucuses take place. the biden campaign is on pace to spend a little less than that, about $4.2 million on television and radio advertisements so far, according to kantar/cmag data.\n\nother major candidates, like elizabeth warren and bernie sanders, have forsworn and repeatedly criticized super pacs on the campaign trail. they object to the fact that the groups are allowed to raise unlimited amounts of money as long as they do not coordinate with a campaign. individual donations to political candidates are capped at $2,800 per election (primary and general elections are considered separate). biden had initially opposed super pacs, but dropped his opposition in the fall.\n\njust in the week leading up to the iowa caucuses, unite the country is on pace to spend about $800,000 on advertisements compared to about $467,000 by biden's campaign. that would put him on similar footing in ad time with sanders and warren. this week, sanders is on track to spend $1.3 million, warren has placed $1.1 million in ad buys, amy klobuchar has so far booked $383,000 in ad buys and entrepeneur andrew yang has purchased $188,014 on the airwaves.\n\nthe spending from the pro-biden super pac comes as polls have shown an incredibly tight race in iowa with just a week left until the caucuses. the latest cbs news battleground tracker showed sanders leading iowa with 26%. he was followed by biden (25%), buttigieg (22%), warren (15%) and klobuchar (7%).\n\nit's not immediately clear how much buttigieg will be spending in the final week on tv in iowa.\n\nbusinessman tom steyer, who has spent $15.8 million on advertisements in iowa, has reserved $920,000 worth of air time in the final week in iowa. the richest guy in the race, mike bloomberg, has dwarfed the field in ad spending, dropping more than $270 million on ads so far, but he's skipping the early states and focusing his attention on the states that vote on march 3, known as super tuesday.\n\nbiden ignored questions from cbs news in cedar falls, iowa on monday about the super pac spending in iowa. he dropped his vocal criticism against super pacs after the trump campaign pledged to spend millions of dollars against biden's primary candidacy.\n\nif that was happening to any other candidate, there would be democrats responding the same way...to take on trump, biden told cbs news at the time.\n\ni have done nothing — nothing — to cooperate with [the super pac], biden said and pledged that if he's elected, he would try to move toward public funding of elections.\n\nunite the country was established in october by several longtime biden allies and on friday faces its first required disclosure of its donors, according to federal election commission rules.\n\nit's going to take more than a special-interest funded tv ad to win the caucus, sanders campaign manager faiz shakir told cbs news. nothing will fundamentally change for the working class if candidates continue to solicit funds from millionaires and billionaires into superpacs.\n\nthe biden campaign has not responded to cbs news' request for comment.\n\niowa voter barb dietz, 75, said even though she doesn't like the idea of super pacs, she likes the ads unite the country is broadcasting in iowa. dietz argued that it's unfair for biden to have to weather the negative trump campaign ads and at the same time compete with the self-funded campaigns of biden's billionaire rivals, bloomberg and tom steyer.\n\niowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses will begin the presidential nominating process next monday. the state's complex rules require candidates to have at least 15% support in most rooms to win delegates, meaning some people will end up supporting their second-choice candidate.

for the first time, a new network of satellites will soon be able to track all commercial airplanes in real time, anywhere on the planet. currently, planes are largely tracked by radar on the ground, which doesn't work over much of the world's oceans.\n\nthe final 10 satellites were launched friday to wrap up the $3 billion effort to replace 66 aging communication satellites, reports cbs news' kris van cleave, who got an early look at the new technology.\n\non any given day, 43,000 planes are in the sky in america alone. when these planes take off, they are tracked by radar and are equipped with a gps transponder. all commercial flights operating in the u.s. and europe have to have them by 2020. it's that transponder that talks to these new satellites, making it possible to know exactly where more than 10,000 flights currently flying are.\n\ntucked inside the spacex falcon 9 rocket that was blasted into space on friday are 10 advanced iridium communications satellites, each the size of a mini cooper. once active, they'll power satellite phone communications, space-based broadband and carry a device which will solve an issue that's plagued aviation for decades.\n\nseventy percent of the world's airspace has no surveillance. aircraft fly over the oceans and report back their positions to air traffic control every 10 to 15 minutes at best and in between those periods, no one knows where they are, said aireon ceo don thoma.\n\n\n\naireon, based in mclean, virginia, was developing the technology to change that even before mayalasia airlines flight mh370 vanished over the indian ocean in march 2014. but a boeing 777 with 239 aboard disappearing was a wake-up call, prompting years of safety experts demanding change.\n\ni can find my kids by pinging their iphone. we shouldn't have aircraft that disappear anywhere in the world today, former national transportation safety board chairman debbie herman said back in 2016.\n\nto make that happen, the aireon technology is hitching a ride to space as part of the largest technology swap the universe has ever seen. iridium is replacing its existing constellation of 66 satellites and 9 spares orbiting the earth built and launched in the mid-90s.\n\nwalt everetts help designed the first generation of iridium satellites, naming two of them after his sons nicholas and andrew. he'll be in the company's command center outside washington, d.c. as his team maneuvers the new satellites into place, simultaneously powering on the new and devastating old. the legacy satellites will then be moved out of orbit where they'll burn up in the earth's atmosphere.\n\nit's kind of like changing a tire on a bus going 17,000 miles per hour, said walt everetts, vice president of satellite operations for iridium. with these new satellites that we're putting up, we have more capacity, more processing capability, more memory … so we are taking an old flip phone and upgrading it into a smartphone.\n\n\n\nwhile not fully complete, the updated network circling the globe 485 miles overhead is already tracking planes. aireon was able to instantly confirm the last known location of lion air flight 610, the boeing 737 max that crashed in the java sea last october.\n\nwith the iridium-aireon system, every airplane is in reach of an air traffic controller … so no matter what happened to that airplane we would know within seconds of where that airplane was, iridium ceo matt desch said.\n\nthe technology may also make it possible for air traffic controllers to allow more flights to be in the air at the same time on busy routes over the atlantic and pacific oceans. it could also allow for more direct flight paths, which means more flights, the potential for fewer delays, and shorter flights to places like europe.
for michelle durham it was the perfect job: a paramedic for a national ambulance service in alabama. she was 22, and her dream of a career in medicine was about to take off, or so she thought.\n\nbeing able to help people. that was my favorite part, durham said. i loved being able to help people when they needed help the most.\n\nthen, another reason to celebrate: a baby. i was only on the truck for six months before i found out i was pregnant with my son, she said. went to the doctor and had my visit, and she told me i couldn't lift more than 50 pounds. it's a normal weight restriction for women when you're pregnant.\n\nand if you can't lift 50 pounds? asked correspondent jan crawford.\n\ni couldn't even lift the stretcher. it was 100 pounds without a patient on it.\n\ndurham saw it as a temporary hurdle, assuming she could transfer to one of several open desk jobs for a few months. but her employer, rural/metro, told her they were reserved for people injured on the job.\n\nher only option? twelve weeks of unpaid medical leave that would run out before she even had her baby.\n\nit was baffling, it really was, durham said. to help so many people and then not have help from the company that was hiring you to help these people.\n\nit's a story told hundreds of thousands of times every year across america: you can get the job. just don't get pregnant\n\nhacheler cyrille was a passenger services representative at jfk airport in new york city. with a six-year-old son and another baby on the way, she was determined to keep working throughout her pregnancy. i have a son, i have to feed him when he needs something, i have bills to pay, she said.\n\nbut one day she stumbled while putting a heavy suitcase on a luggage belt, and got pulled onto it.\n\ni'm screaming, 'anybody can hear me? stop the belt!' i'm thinking about, am i gonna die? cyrille said.\n\nshe was rushed to the emergency room. she didn't lose the baby. but she said she effectively lost her job. she, too, had asked for a less physically strenuous assignment during the remainder of her pregnancy, but her employer refused to reassign her.\n\nthey're only thinking about them, cyrille said. they don't think about you as a worker, because we do the most, hardest job. they're not thinking about you.\n\naccording to gillian thomas, a senior attorney with the aclu's women's rights project, roughly a quarter of a million women a year don't get the accommodations they need to keep working.\n\nthomas said even though the pregnancy discrimination act passed in 1978, from wall street to walmart, pregnant women are still being forced to leave their jobs every day.\n\ngetting pregnant, she said, really is an economically disastrous decision for many working women.\n\nthat's because under the current federal law, while employers are prohibited from firing or refusing to hire pregnant workers, they aren't always required to make any on-the-job accommodations, such as offering more bathroom breaks or temporary desk jobs.\n\nthomas said, between 1997 and 2011, the number of pregnancy discrimination charges filed at the eeoc went up by 50%.\n\nand sometimes it leads to even more tragic consequences.\n\nsarah coogle, who earned a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and psychology, was always interested in criminal justice. and then when i found the prison system, i felt like that was a good fit.\n\ncoogle worked as a corrections officer at the california correctional institution. i wanted to do things the right way: go to school, then get the career, and then have the family. and we put things off for a while.\n\nin 2017, after three years on the job, coogle got the news that she and her husband, michael, had been waiting for: she was going to have a baby. extremely excited, yeah, but then scared, she said. 'cause then, oh my gosh, now what?\n\nshe spoke with her manager: she goes, if you bring in any note from your doctor that restricts you, you'll be unfit for duty. you cannot work.\n\nso, they were willing to make no accommodations whatsoever? asked crawford.\n\nwhatsoever.\n\nneeding to pay the bills, coogle saw no choice but to keep working. everything was fine for a while. then, in her seventh month of pregnancy, a prison alarm goes off. it's an instinctive run, she said. and the next thing i know, i'm going down. and immediately felt pain in my lower abdomen.\n\ncoogle went to the er, where doctors reassured her, thankfully, her baby was ok.\n\nnine weeks later, she went into labor: and the doctor's in there and he's lookin' for the heartbeat. and he's over here on my left side. and he says, 'there's no heartbeat.' it didn't occur to me that my baby was gone.\n\nwhen coogle fell in the prison yard, she had a placental abruption – her placenta had separated from the uterus. her baby, mackenzie, was delivered stillborn.\n\nthey wheeled in the baby, and she's wrapped in a pink blanket, and that's when i found out i had a girl, she said.\n\nthe aclu's gillian thomas said, it really is a hobson's choice that, frankly, no woman should have to be faced with. a woman who's been told by her physician, 'you have to take the following precautions at work in order to have a healthy pregnancy,' she presents those to her employer and is told, 'no. you either work at full capacity, or you go home.'\n\nthe supreme court weighed in on this issue in 2015, ruling in favor of a pregnant ups employee, peggy young, who was denied light duty during the last months of her pregnancy.\n\nbut despite that decision, two-thirds of pregnant women asking for accommodations at work have still lost in court.\n\nthomas said, i think that there is some unconscious bias there that, because pregnancy is voluntary or a chosen condition, that in some way, it's less deserving.\n\nthere's been some progress. twenty-seven states have passed laws that require employers to offer pregnant women the same accommodations they would make for workers with a disability.\n\nbut many say what's really needed is a new federal law.\n\nunder the 41-year-old law, it's very, very challenging for pregnant women to bring a claim and to prevail to get the support and relief that they need, said congresswoman suzanne bonamici, a democrat from oregon. she and congresswoman jaime herrera beutler, a republican from washington are co-sponsors of a new bill, the pregnant workers fairness act, that would make it easier for women to get temporary accommodations during their pregnancies.\n\nit's good for the health of the economy, as women make up over half the workforce, said herrera beutler. she has some firsthand experience; she's had three babies while serving in congress.\n\nwe're asking for a reasonable accommodation, which is basically the exact same standard as the americans with disability act, she said. i think most people would assume that it is required to say, 'yeah, okay, you can have an extra bathroom break here.' 'the policy is no water here, but you get to carry your water with you.' these are reasonable things. most people would expect this already in the law, i would think.\n\nand it's not, bonamici added, but we hope it is soon.\n\nbut congress has considered this bill with different sponsors before, for the past seven years. in october it finally got a hearing. but there's still a long road ahead. as rep. jahana hayes of connecticut noted, i don't think this is an equality issue; this is an equity issue, 'cause last time i checked, men couldn't get pregnant.\n\nsince our interview, sarah coogle settled with the department of corrections. she's also joined a class action lawsuit to try to change the policy on accommodations for pregnant corrections officers in california … and she's pregnant again.\n\nindicating an empty crib, she said, i look at this as hope. this is what i'm still fighting for. if there's a woman that was thinking about getting into law enforcement, i would at this point right now steer them away from the department of corrections because this is not a department for you, because they won't care. and if you don't want to accommodate me, accommodate the baby.\n\nhacheler cyrille gave birth to a healthy baby girl in october. she's filed a discrimination complaint with new york city's commission on human rights, and is still unemployed.\n\nif all of us make a voice, things can change, she said.\n\nand michelle durham sued her former employer, ambulance service rural/metro, but a judge ruled in favor of the company, saying the state law does not require an employer to provide special accommodations to its pregnant employees. her appeal will be heard this week.\n\ni know it won't change what's happened to me, she said. i know it won't change where my path is going. but it needs to be corrected for somebody else.\n\nafter having her son, aedan, in 2016, durham is now working at a pet store. she feels her dreams of a medical career are dashed.\n\ni changed my whole life path with one decision, she said.\n\nto get pregnant?\n\ni couldn't have the emt job and my son..\n\ncrawford asked, is that a decision men have to make?\n\nno.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by sari aviv.
dustin johnson is now iffy to compete in the 2017 masters. the overall favorite to win the tournament suffered a back injury after falling off some stairs at his rental home, according to his manager.\n\nat roughly 3:00 p.m. today, dustin took a serious fall on a staircase in his augusta rental home, david winkle said in a statement to golf digest. he landed very hard on his lower back and is now resting, although quite uncomfortably. he has been advised to remain immobile and begin a regimen of anti-inflammatory medication and icing, with the hope of being able to play tomorrow.\n\njohnson was listed 5/1 to win the tournament this week after winning his last three events in a row. if he is unable to go, jordan spieth would become the favorite at 13/2 with rory mcilroy not far behind at 8/1, though those odds would likely change.\n\njohnson would be just the fourth golfer to miss the masters while being ranked no. 1 in the world.\n\nworld no 1s to miss majors since inception of world ranking in '86 rory - 2015 open\n\ntiger - 08 open, 08 pga, 14 masters\n\nnorman - 88 open — justin ray (@justinraygc) april 5, 2017\n\nlast year, johnson had his best performance in seven tries at augusta, finishing tied for fourth. he is also coming off a win at the british open in 2016.\n\nthis article originally appeared on cbssports.com.
faced with at least two lawsuits accusing it of selling defective merchandise, apparel seller lularoe is making it easier for consumers to get refunds.\n\nunder what lularoe describes as its make good program consumers who bought an item between jan. 1, 2016, and april 24, 2017, and are displeased with the quality of their garments can get a full refund, credit or exchange. starting april 25, under its happiness policy, customers can get a refund, credit or exchange for up to 30 days after their purchase and may get a credit or exchange within 90 days. certain restrictions apply, and receipts are required.\n\nsome people continue to have questions specifically about the quality of lularoe leggings. we are sorry if we haven't adequately addressed their concerns. we hope these policies will, lularoe ceo mark stidham said in a statement announcing the new refund and exchange policy. we want everyone to be happy and believe they received a fair value from their lularoe clothing purchase.\n\nthe policy marks a change in tactics for the corona, california-based multilevel marketing firm, known for colorful leggings. lularoe has repeatedly said its defective merchandise rate was below average for the apparel industry and insisted that its products get multiple quality assurance checks before going on sale.\n\ndespite those assurances, many customers have complained on social media and elsewhere that its leggings are prone to rips and tears after only minimal use.\n\na private facebook group with more than 26,000 members is chock full of posts from irate lularoe customers. the two customers who started the group, julie dean of boston and suzanne jones of lafayette, california, are the lead plaintiffs in a march 23 federal lawsuit in california that accuses lularoe of knowingly selling defective merchandise. a similar case was filed april 17 in state court in oregon that accuses the company of unfair trade practices. both cases are seeking class-action status.\n\nstidham, who co-founded lularoe with his wife deanne in 2013, sounded less contrite in an interview with business insider, insisting that while he sympathized with customers who have experienced problems, he didn't think a blanket apology was necessary.\n\nchristina hinks, a former lularoe consultant who's a fierce critic of the marketer, argued on her blog that stidham appeared to be waffling about whether the company owed anyone an apology.\n\ngenerally speaking as a businessperson, it's commonplace to issue an apology to a customer or group of customers that have felt betrayed and improperly served by a company, hicks said. no, not lularoe.\n\nlularoe sales have reached $1.8 billion over the past year, making it one of the world's largest multilevel marketers, an industry that includes companies such as amway, herbalife (hlf) and pampered chef.\n\na spokesman for lularoe said neither mark nor deanne stidham were available for comment.\n\nbesides the product defect cases, lularoe also faces a lawsuit alleging that it charged customers sales tax in states that don't collect the fees on sales of clothing. lularoe also has been accused of infringing on a lion design created by a hungarian artist. the company has denied wrongdoing in both cases.\n\nanother suit, by a utah payments processor complete merchant services (cms), accuses lularoe of violating a contract that made cms the exclusive supplier of credit and debit payments to lularoe. cms provided the point-of-sale system that lularoe had blamed for wrongly collecting sales taxes in states that didn't charge it on clothing purchases.\n\ncurrent and former consultants have also accused lularoe of understating the risks and overstating the potential rewards available to consultants. to join lularoe, representatives are required to order a minimum of $5,000 worth of product, which is high for the direct-sales industry.\n\naccording to internal lularoe data provided to cbs moneywatch, more than 70 percent of lularoe representatives sold less than $5,000 worth of retail goods in february.
what are you supposed to do when you pull out plastic to buy something at a store these days? you've probably noticed that plenty of stores have terminals that obviously have a slot for inserting a chip-enabled credit card, but when you try to do that, an anxious store clerk yells something like, nope, we don't take chips yet. please swipe.\n\nback in october, a much-ballyhooed deadline marked the great switch from old-fashioned magnetic stripe cards to newer emv chip credit cards. well, that was the plan anyway. despite some slow, steady progress, most of us are still swiping our stripes instead of dipping our chips several times each week.\n\nthe dipping delay\n\ninitially, the bottleneck was thought to be caused by the large investment stores had to make in new point of sale terminals, which run about $500 for each checkout line.\n\nbut anyone who's done any shopping in the past few weeks might be left with the impression hardware isn't the problem: chip readers seem to be everywhere, but the switch hasn't been flicked yet.\n\nthe impression is accurate. according to the industry group emv migration forum, there are roughly 5 million emv-ready terminals at u.s. stores right now, but only 1 million have started accepting chips. in other words, when you see a chip reader, odds are 4 out of 5 that you won't be able to use it.\n\nwhat's the holdup? while it might seem obvious to blame stores for not enabling the devices, some merchants are blaming the banking industry, and a lawsuit filed last week in a california federal court claims that the banking industry collaborated to hand the bill for fraud to store owners.\n\nback in october, new network rules went into effect that essentially require merchants who haven't upgraded to emv terminals to cover the cost of fraudulent transactions. (prior to the shift, financial institutions generally covered the cost of fraud.)\n\nlast week, two small florida stores filed a lawsuit seeking class action status, saying their bill for fraudulent transactions has increased perhaps 20-fold since the october deadline and the emv delay -- playing out in smaller stores across the country -- is costing them big money. the lawsuit names payment networks like visa and mastercard, along with large payment processing firms. both visa and mastercard said they were reviewing the claims in the lawsuit.\n\nnot just a hardware issue\n\nit turns out that getting new hardware into stores was just the first step in the conversion process, and in many cases, the easier step. new software comes next, and that's been causing holdups, experts said.\n\njust because you see an emv slot on a terminal, doesn't mean it works, said michael moeser, director of payments at javelin strategy and research. getting the terminal to accept emv cards is a two-part process. first, the merchant either needs to load newly developed software or integrate new software from a third party into its back office systems to allow the terminal to accept emv. second, then the new terminals and the merchant need to undergo a certification process with each of the card networks, typically done in combination with its merchant acquiring bank. the certification queue is currently very long as you can imagine that there are a number of merchants seeking to roll out emv at the same time.\n\nwhile that delay is annoying to shoppers -- what do i do, swipe or insert? -- some merchants say it's killing business. according to the merchant lawsuit, milam's market and grove liquors in florida faced 88 chargebacks for fraudulent transactions totaling $9,200 from mastercard and visa since the oct. 1 liability shift, plus $5 chargeback fees for each item. during the same span last year, the firms faced only four chargebacks, the lawsuit said.\n\nthe stores say they purchased emv hardware long ago, and are simply waiting for their terminals to be certified. the lawsuit says the stores have been told the queue for certification is so long they have no idea when it might come.\n\ntellingly, nothing milam's market could have done -- short of making the business-crippling decision to stop accepting visa cards -- could have prevented this outcome, the lawsuit says. class members such as the plaintiffs here, could not timely comply with the standard, no matter what they did, because the defendants refused to, or were unable to, 'certify' the new equipment by the deadline -- or, indeed, the 'certification' process would take years after the ... liability shift was imposed.\n\nthe debit sticking point\n\nshifting the way america uses plastic was bound to encounter snafus, but randy vanderhoof, emv migration chairman, said the american payment market faced particular challenges because of the way debit cards are processed. federal law designed to promote competition in debit card processing requires that merchants have a choice of networks for processing payments, but that made writing software for emv debit cards much more complex.\n\nwe have a regulatory environment which requires that every card issued has to support at least two unrelated payment networks for processing, he said. so software and certification testing on debit was more complicated and later to arrive.\n\nsince the specifications for emv debit card processing came late in the game, some in the payment industry decided to delay their conversion work. otherwise, stores and processors would have found themselves supporting emv for credit cards, but magnetic stripes for debit cards, potentially frustrating consumers and causing two hardware and software conversions.\n\nthat is not an ideal consumer experience, vanderhoof said. you could have the same customer using debit in one transaction (and swiping) and then credit in another (and inserting a chip card). you can start to appreciate it is not a simple thing.\n\nthe merchant lawsuit makes this point too, quoting terry crowley, ceo of transend, which makes emv software. he says that writing code to make the terminals work has become infinitely more complex in recent years. according to the lawsuit:\n\ncrowley said that while software code for card-accepting devices was historically simple enough to be written on the back of a business card. 'now with emv, that same software wraps around the walls of a room three times ... hundreds of thousands of lines of code.' with the liability shift deadline having passed, crowley says, suddenly there is a 'fire drill' to replace all of this simple software, compounded by the facts that the emv code is hard to write, harder to certify and that few emv software developers understand the u.s. market.\n\nmobile in the mix\n\ncomplicating matters more, the switch to chip cards is hardly the only change happening in the way consumers pay for things at checkout. stores are trying to be ready to accept mobile payments, like apple pay or samsung pay, also.\n\na number of merchants have decided to rollout other payments technologies at the same time of an emv rollout which creates a more complex -- time consuming -- deployment, moeser said.\n\nvanderhoof is optimistic that the problem is temporary, and the payment industry will work through the backlog in fairly short order. the emv migration forum believes 50 percent of terminals will be enabled by the end of this year, and 90 percent by the end of 2017.\n\nbut for now, many merchants are blaming the banking industry -- and the florida store lawsuit accuses banks of knowingly conspiring to hand them the bill for fraud.\n\nwhat defendants knew, but milam's market, grove liquors and the rest of the class did not and could not know, was that purchasing new (point of sale) equipment and training their staff was not going to be enough, the lawsuit says. requiring working emv hardware and software by the oct. 1 deadline were conditions, it would turn out, which were impossible for the class members to meet and which the networks, the issuing banks and (industry) knew were impossible to meet.\n\nconsumers generally aren't held liable for unauthorized charges, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't monitor your financial accounts regularly for fraud. you can also monitor your credit if you have reason to believe your personal information was compromised alongside your payment information. a sudden drop in credit scores can be a sign identity theft is occurring.

house majority whip james clyburn is resisting calls from other democrats to try to impeach president trump over a phone call in which he pressured georgia's secretary of state to find enough votes to win him the state's election. clyburn said impeachment efforts so close to the end of trump's presidency would be a waste of congress' time.\n\ni would like someone to tell me how we can draw up impeachment proceedings and get all that done in 14-15 days. i don't see how that can be done, and so why waste our time dealing with something that just cannot be done? the south carolina democrat told cbsn red & blue anchor elaine quijano on tuesday.\n\ni would advise us to leave this activity because it looks as if they were violating state laws as well as federal laws, he said. that's where the investigation ought to take place.\n\nmr. trump's term ends january 20, when president-elect joe biden is sworn in. mr. trump, however, has tried to unsuccessfully fight the outcome of the election, falsely claiming there was widespread fraud. the president went as far as pressuring georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, a republican, to change the vote in his favor, which the georgia official refused.\n\nsome democrats are now calling for a criminal investigation into trump's actions. congressman ted lieu of california and congresswoman kathleen rice of new york asked the fbi to investigate the call in a letter on monday.\n\nwhile clyburn shut down the idea of impeachment, he was more open to potential charges coming from the justice department.\n\nit all depends on what the charges are, clyburn said. if you're talking about the misuse of his office as it relates to this election, the election will be over. the electoral college will have done its work and that will be behind us. but if there are other issues that come to the attention of the justice department, i think the justice department ought to do its job.\n\nthat doesn't mean that the president has to be involved in that. he would not be involved in that, clyburn added. but it does mean that any officer of the court, including the attorney general, would do what is necessary to pursue justice on behalf of the american people. and so what the justice department will do as an independent agency, it should do. that's not biden. biden would have a big enough job trying to get us beyond this pandemic and trying to get this economy back on equity footing.\n\nmr. trump was impeached in december 2019 by the democratic-controlled house. the senate, controlled by republicans, acquitted the president.
as vaccinations continue across the u.s., some companies are offering financial incentives to encourage their workers to get their shots.\n\ninstacart inc., the grocery delivery service, announced thursday that it would provide a $25 stipend for workers who get the covid-19 vaccine. it joins others, including trader joe's and dollar general, which plan to pay workers extra if they get vaccinated.\n\nour goal with the introduction of our new vaccine support stipend is to ensure that, when the time comes, instacart shoppers don't have to choose between earning income as an essential service provider or getting vaccinated, instacart ceo apoorva mehta said in a statement.\n\nsan francisco-based instacart has nearly doubled its mostly gig workforce to about 500,000 to meet a surge in demand for online grocery shopping since the pandemic erupted in the u.s. last spring.\n\ngrocery chain trader joe's, which has more than 50,000 employees, said thursday it will give its employees two hours of pay per dose for getting the vaccine. the monrovia, california-based company said it will also shift around schedules to make sure employees have time to get vaccinated.\n\ndollar general said wednesday it will give employees the equivalent of four hours of pay if they get the vaccine. the goodlettsville, tennessee-based retailer said it employs 157,000 people.\n\na vaccine advisory panel at the u.s. centers for disease control voted late last month on recommendations for vaccine distribution. the panel said grocery workers — which would include instacart and dollar general's employees — should be in the second group to receive shots after health care workers and nursing home residents.\n\nit is up to each state to decide how and when to adopt the cdc's recommendations. some states have already opened eligibility to the second group, which also includes firefighters, police, teachers, corrections workers, postal employees and people 75 and older. there are around 50 million people in that group.\n\ncompanies can mandate that workers get covid-19 vaccines as a requirement for employment, although they must make accommodations for medical or religious reasons, according to guidance from the federal equal employment opportunity commission.\n\nhowever, most companies are reluctant to impose such mandates, said sharon perley masling, a partner at the law firm morgan lewis who has been advising clients on workplace issues surrounding the covid-19 pandemic. the emergency nature of the vaccine's fda approval makes it impractical for many companies to require it, given that the shots are not available to most of the population, she said.\n\nstill, masling said the companies she works with are taking various steps to strongly encourage their workers to get vaccinated, including internal public relations campaigns showing top executives who are eligible getting the shots. other incentives include free child care, paid time off and freebies such as pizza delivery and other gifts, she said.\n\nit's good for employees, it's good for their communities and it's good for ensuring the continuation of business operations, masling said.\n\nthe push to vaccinate comes amid signs that some people — even health care workers — are reluctant to get the shots, contributing to a slower-than-hoped-for rollout of the mass vaccination effort in the u.s. masling said many companies are still trying to figure out how their staff feels about taking the shots, with some sending out internal surveys.\n\nconcerns over side effects\n\nin a survey last month by the society for human resource management, nearly two-thirds of u.s. workers said they were likely to get the vaccine when it becomes available. still, 36% said they were not likely to get vaccinated, citing as their main reason concerns about side effects. shrm surveyed workers from 529 u.s. households using the amerispeak omnibus survey, a probability-based panel developed by norc at the university of chicago.\n\nscientists say the vaccines have been rigorously tested on tens of thousands and vetted by independent experts, and there have been no signs of widespread severe side effects from the shots.\n\nnot every company is offering incentives. delivery app doordash, another big platform for gig workers, said it has asked the cdc and governors to prioritize delivery workers in vaccine distribution. but it doesn't plan to provide perks for workers who get vaccinated.\n\ntarget corp. doesn't plan to provide incentives either, but said it will make the vaccine free and accessible to its 350,000 employees. target said 1,700 of its stores have a cvs pharmacy on site that will offer the vaccine to staff when it's available.\n\nalbertsons, a grocery chain with 2,250 u.s. stores and 300,000 employees, also isn't doling out financial incentives. like doordash, it's asking state and local authorities to make sure its workers get priority for the vaccine.\n\na separate shrm survey last month found that while about two-thirds of u.s. employers planned to encourage employees to get vaccinated, only 3% have decided to require it for at least some workers. that could change, since 55% of employers said they were unsure if they would eventually require it, according to survey of 955 members of shrm, an organization of about 300,000 human resource professionals.\n\nbad press\n\nmany large companies have faced criticism over how they have treated their employees throughout the pandemic, from shoddy sick leave policies to poor working conditions. companies, ranging from meatpacking plants to amazon, have grappled with worker absences and outbreaks that have forced temporary shutdowns of their factories and warehouses. there is also a looming debate in congress over whether employers should be exempt from legal liabilities related to coronavirus exposure, as more begin to recall their employees back to offices and other work sites.\n\npublic perception provides a strong incentive for companies to get their workers vaccinated, said laura boudreau, an economics professor at columbia business school who specializes in labor rights.\n\na lot of them have had to defend their reputations in terms of how they are treating their employees throughout the pandemic, boudreau said.\n\ninstacart is among several companies that have lobbied for their workers to be prioritized for vaccines. the company also has faced criticism, and some worker unrest, over allegations that it had not done enough to protect its shoppers — gig workers who make multiple trips a day to grocery stores to shop for and deliver groceries to people who order on its app — who don't receive health insurance through the company or guaranteed paid sick leave.\n\nthe company says it has distributed 620,000 free safety kits to its workers, including face masks and hand sanitizers. it introduced a new policy in march to provide 14 days of paid

while it's essential for television news outlets to have clear, concise and accurate graphics on election nights, vote-counting has also been a time to try out new ways to present information to viewers.\n\nin 1952, cbs used one of the earliest computers to accurately predict dwight eisenhower's election victory over adlai stevenson.\n\nand on the night of barack obama's victory in 2008, cnn brought a correspondent onto its set by using hologram technology.\n\nduring this week's presidential election in south korea, one of the nation's leading television networks came up with eye-popping visuals that used pop cultural references and images to connect with election night viewers, reports cbs news correspondent don dahler.\n\nthe presidential candidates' faces were super-imposed onto characters from game of thrones or made to look as though they were jogging the streets like rocky.\n\nthis all came after a tumultuous few months in south korea's political climate. in december, then-president park gun-hey was impeached amid a corruption scandal. hundreds of thousands flooded the streets of seoul, calling for her removal.\n\nthis week's election saw near record participation fueled in large part by voters under the age of 30 seeking change.\n\nthe candidates were particularly focused on engaging young voters and they did it through music, through k-pop and popular media. it worked.\n\n\n\nif popular culture can be used to engage young people, get them excited about politics and help inform them about the issues, then what's wrong with that?
demi lovato may only be 25, but she's already overcome a lifetime of obstacles. she's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. she's beaten addiction. she's in recovery from an eating disorder. and now, she's hitting the road with a powerful new album about growing up and learning to love yourself.\n\ni would say this album is about growing up and becoming an adult, the pop star told cbs news of her new album, tell me you love me. there's songs on the album that represent past relationships that i've been through. there's some about sexuality, but also there's ones about overcoming obstacles.\n\ntake the lp's soulful fourth track, you don't do it for me anymore, for example.\n\npeople think it's a breakup song, explains lovato, but it's actually kind of a breakup song with myself and my bad habits.\n\nand the title track, with its infectious r&b hook and powerhouse vocals -- that's no simple love song either.\n\nwell, it's a song about wanting to be loved, but any time that i have a song that is meaningful to me, i try to turn it into something positive, says lovato. so, to me, it's about vulnerability and i'd also like for the message to be about learning to love yourself.\n\nand in the current social climate, that message may be more relevant than ever.\n\nthere's a lot of incredible things happening in this world with speaking up and positivity, lovato told cbs news in an interview thursday. and as hard as this world can be to live in sometimes, there's a lot of people that are doing activism work. and i think that it's important that change happens. and change can only happen when you learn to love yourself, then you realize your worth and your value. i hope people learn that as they listen to my music.\n\nlovato is also teaming up with american airlines and mastercard through their #milesmakememories program to offer fans the chance to experience her music in a more intimate setting than they may have ever seen her before.\n\ndemi lovato performs live exclusively for american airlines aadvantage mastercard cardmembers at new york city center on january 24, 2018 in new york city. cindy ord/getty images for mastercard\n\ni loved the whole thing about making new memories, says lovato. and i'm playing songs off my new album, tell me you love me, and a lot of those are more mature. so, they do well in really intimate settings.\n\nunlike the tour she's kicking off at the end of the month with dj khaled, lovato says these special cardholder shows are not huge productions, but rather showcases in smaller venues where she can be closer to her fans.\n\nthe perfect setting for them to tell her they love her.
houston - a high school student here is accused of hacking a school's computer system and changing grades, reports cbs houston affiliate khou-tv.\n\naccording to the spring branch independent school district, a sophomore at memorial high school was arrested march 31 and faces a state felony charge of breach of computer security.\n\nthe district said a stolen password was used to access the system and change grades. the student allegedly offered to change grades for classmates for a fee.\n\nso far, only one other student was found to have paid the fee for a grade change.\n\nthe investigation is ongoing
as the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus grows day by day, the virus's potentially invisible presence has led many to wonder what they should do if they believe they've been exposed.\n\nnot everyone who is exposed to the virus will catch it, and some people who are infected will have only minor or no symptoms. on average, symptoms like fever, cough, or shortness of breath tend to develop five to six days after exposure, according to dr. brian yun, an emergency physician at massachusetts general hospital. but the centers for disease control and prevention says it can take as long as 14 days for symptoms to emerge. if, after that period of time, you have not developed any of the typical covid-19 symptoms, you are likely in the clear, yun said.\n\ntime spent sitting and waiting to see if you may get ill can lead to anxiety and fear. the wait, however, is the reality of the situation.\n\ntesting for coronavirus is being reserved for people who are sick, not those who are symptom-free. if someone did not have any symptoms and got tested, the result of that test could be a false negative, according to yun. then that purportedly virus-free person could re-enter society and infect others, before later developing symptoms and testing positive for the virus.\n\neven though it may feel good (to get tested), or may lessen someone's anxiety… it's a false reassurance, yun said.\n\non top of the potential unreliability of pre-symptomatic testing, the tests themselves are scarce.\n\naccording to dr. david buchholz, a primary care physician at columbia university's irving medical center, hospitals across the country, including his own, are rationing tests for those who need them the most. those people include health care workers.\n\nhospitals are sending health care workers home at the first sign of a cold, according to buchholz, but as the number of coronavirus cases increase, the need for health care workers will only grow. so it will be important to have tests available to ensure that doctors and nurses are safe to return to work.\n\nwe may give health care workers a test to make sure they're able to come back with mild cold symptoms, buchholz explained.\n\nofficials say testing capacity across the u.s. is ramping up, but if you show up at a hospital or doctor's office without symptoms, you will most likely be denied a coronavirus test.\n\nwe unfortunately have to explain to people that we have a shortage and can't test them, buchholz said.\n\nhe recommends that people who think they were exposed to the virus contact their health care provider or a hospital in order to be evaluated by phone.\n\noftentimes, people who fear that they have been exposed to the virus don't meet the criteria for exposure, according to dr. sharon wright, senior medical director of infection control and hospital epidemiology at beth israel deaconess medical center in boston.\n\nexposure to a respiratory virus, such as the novel coronavirus, generally requires close contact — within six feet of distance — with the infected individual for at least 10 minutes, according to wright. if the individual is a family member, someone you live with, or a close coworker, the criteria could change due to the frequency with which you share common surfaces, she said.\n\naccording to the cdc, close contact can occur while caring for, living with, visiting, or sharing a health care waiting area or room with a covid-19 case, or by having direct contact with infectious secretions of a covid-19 case (e.g., being coughed on).\n\nif you have not been exposed to a confirmed case of the coronavirus but are worried about catching it, your best defense is a healthy lifestyle. getting enough sleep, eating healthy foods, washing your hands thoroughly, disinfecting commonly touched surfaces, avoiding touching your face, and practicing social distancing all help protect you from catching the virus.\n\nclaims that supplements, such as vitamin c or zinc, might help protect against the virus are not supported by research, buchholz, yun and wright all agreed.\n\nbuchholz said, don't waste your money.\n\nif you develop symptoms in line with the coronavirus, and are an otherwise healthy person, treat yourself as if you have the flu: stay home, rest, and monitor your symptoms. according to wright, most people who are otherwise healthy will improve. if you have a persistent fever over a few days, or if symptoms become more severe, contact a doctor. the cdc says people should seek immediate medical attention if they experience difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, or other emergency warning signs.\n\nwright said that above all, social distancing measures must be taken seriously to help keep the pandemic from overwhelming the health care system.\n\ni think coronavirus is going to be here with us for a while, she said. the question now is can we make sure everyone doesn't come to the hospital at the same time.
a swallowable, pill-size sensor that can sense gases as it travels through the human digestive tract may one day help doctors diagnose patients' gut conditions, such as lactose intolerance and irritable bowel syndrome, a new, small study finds.\n\nresearchers tested the electronic sensor in seven healthy people and found that the device could accurately detect the concentrations of hydrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen in real time as it passed through the body, according to the study, published online monday in the journal nature electronics.\n\nalthough the sensor's results still need to be tested in a larger group of people, including in individuals who have gut conditions, use of the sensor could one day lead to fewer invasive procedures, such as colonoscopies, the researchers said. [weight-loss superfood: 6 tips for a healthy gut]\n\nthe capsule is about the size of a large pill — just 1 inch by 0.4 inches (2.6 centimeters by 1 centimeters). from the moment it's swallowed to the time it's excreted between one and two days later, the capsule sends data about the gut's gas concentrations every 5 minutes to a handheld device outside of the body. this device, in turn, uses bluetooth to send the data to a smartphone application.\n\nsensor surprise\n\nbeyond relaying real-time data about gas concentrations throughout a person's gut, the capsule trial revealed that the human stomach has a previously unknown protection system. this system kicks into gear if foreign compounds stay in the stomach for too long, triggering the stomach to release oxidizing chemicals to break down and destroy them, the researchers found.\n\nsuch an immune mechanism has never been reported before, lead study author kourosh kalantar-zadeh, a professor in the school of engineering at the royal melbourne institute of technology, in australia, said in a statement.\n\nmoreover, the capsule showed that the colon, or large intestine, may contain oxygen, as people on a high-fiber diet had high concentrations of oxygen in their colons. this contradicts the old belief that the colon is always oxygen-free, kalantar-zadeh told live science.\n\nthis oxygen-related finding may help researchers understand how certain conditions, such as colon cancer, develop, he said.\n\nif it's approved, the capsule could revolutionize the way doctors diagnose gut disorders, and even help them assess a patient's diet, he said. that's because each disease likely has its own signature of gas concentrations, so capsule readouts would allow doctors to identify any problems a patient is having, he said.\n\na larger trial with more than 300 patients is expected to be completed in 2019, kalantar-zadeh noted. it's unclear how much the capsule will cost if it's brought to market, but the researchers hope to deliver it to patients under $200 in the first stage, he said. [body bugs: 5 surprising facts about your microbiome]\n\na better breath test\n\nthe scientists made the electronic sensor after a gastroenterologist (a doctor who specializes in the gastrointestinal tract and liver) asked whether the researchers could make diagnostic breath tests more reliable for gut conditions, as most breath tests are reliable just 60 percent to 70 percent of the time, kalantar-zadeh said. such breath tests are used to diagnose conditions such as small intestine bacterial overgrowth and irritable bowel syndrome, by measuring gas concentrations.\n\nhowever, the researchers weren't able to produce a better breath test, he said. that's because the amount and concentrations of gases produced in the gut change by the time they get to the lungs, he said.\n\nso, we started making a device, our capsule, to measure gases 'directly' where they are generated in the gut, kalantar-zadeh said.\n\noutside opinions\n\nthe capsule is a novel tool which can help us decipher the complex interactions between the host, gut bacteria and diet that ultimately determine our health or disease, said dr. premysl bercik, an associate professor in the department of medicine at mcmaster university, in canada, who was not involved with the study.\n\nit's intriguing that the capsule found high oxygen values in the colon, bercik told live science, but added that we have to be cautious when interpreting these results … more data is needed to understand the complex chemistry happening in our bowels.\n\nin the meantime, this device may be beneficial in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, said dr. priya kathpalia, an assistant professor of medicine at the university of california, san francisco's division of gastroenterology. that's because the capsule could help patients learn whether they need to make dietary changes or seek medical treatment, kathpalia told live science.\n\noriginal article on live science.
by all accounts, the whitakers were a perfect family living in a community outside of houston, texas. that was all shattered on dec. 10, 2003, when the family of four was gunned down as they entered their home. tricia whitaker, a retired teacher, and her 19-year-old son, kevin, died from their injuries. the dad, kent, survived as did their son, bart.\n\ni think, oh my god, he shot all four of us,' kent whitaker told 48 hours correspondent peter van sant.\n\nthe whitaker family, from left, kevin, trisha, bart and kent.\n\nthe investigation into the shooting revealed an intricate plot and a ruthless conspiracy to eliminate three of the four whitaker family members. the mastermind of the plot? bart, who hated his family and wanted their money. in 2007 he was tried and convicted of hiring the hit man to kill his family and hurt him, too, to cover up the crime. he was given the death penalty.\n\nthis is where most cases end; not this one. since his son was convicted, and to the disbelief of some, kent whitaker has fought to save bart from being executed.\n\nwhitaker, now remarried, made one last plea to the texas board of pardons and parole in february 2018. we're not asking them to forgive him or let him go. we just want them to let him live, whitaker said.\n\nwhitaker got some reprieve from the board, but his son's fate still rested in the hands of the governor of texas, who would have the ultimate decision.\n\nthe emotional story of murder, conspiracy and forgiveness goes all the way down to the day bart whitaker was scheduled to die. bart had a final meal. his father visited the prison for the last time before his scheduled execution.\n\nwe touched hands through the glass and said our goodbyes, whitaker said.\n\ncould bart whitaker be saved before time ran out?\n\nfour shots fired\n\njohn flores: sugar land is very middle class … upper class, white collar. it's a nice place. everything's new. you hang out with your neighbors. you hang out with your neighbors' kids.\n\nfor john flores and his best friend kevin whitaker, life was sweet in sugar land, texas.\n\njohn flores: almost anything is at your fingertips. you can do whatever you want, lot of fun.\n\nbut that all changed on the night of dec. 10, 2003, when kevin and his family were gunned down in their home.\n\ndet. marshall slot: that night, when we'd just gotten home from church, and got the call of a quadruple shooting. that just doesn't happen out here in sugar land.\n\nmarshall slot was the lead detective assigned to the case.\n\ndet. marshall slot: it looks as if it's a burglary gone wrong. the family is coming home from dinner. it's plausible that they could have surprised a burglar.\n\nbut as detective slot combed through the whitaker home, he realized things weren't adding up.\n\ndet. marshall slot: in the master bedroom, the dressers, an armoire, all had drawers open on them, but they were all open equal distance. it was very neat and orderly.\n\npeter van sant: normally a burglar would throw everything out of the drawers to see if there's any valuables in there.\n\ndet. marshall slot: yes, sir.\n\ndetective slot began to suspect the burglary had been staged.\n\ndet. marshall slot: none of the items of value inside the house had been moved around. the electronics, laptops, jewelry, none of those items that are typically taken in burglaries.\n\nand then there was the murder weapon: it was the whitakers' own gun.\n\ndet. marshall slot: the gun safe had been pried open and it was in a very isolated portion of the household. this is looking more and more like this person knew this gun was here and obtained it for a specific reason.\n\ndetective slot turned his attention to the whitaker family's history, hoping it might provide some answers. he started with kent whitaker's relationship to his wife trisha.\n\nkent whitaker: we met on a blind date. walked in her house and i didn't know what i was expecting, but she came down and i thought i've never had a blind date like this before. and we hit it off very well right from the start.\n\npeter van sant: how long after you first met trisha did you realize to yourself, i'm in love with this woman?\n\nkent whitaker: couple of months, maybe.\n\npeter van sant: really?\n\nkent whitaker: yeah.\n\npeter van sant: and did she feel the same way about you?\n\nkent whitaker: yeah. yes, she did.\n\nkevin, left, and bart whitaker kent whitaker\n\nand then came their two boys, bart and kevin.\n\nthe whitakers were doing well. kent was a successful accountant. trisha, an elementary school teacher.\n\nbarbie harrington: trisha had a great rapport with children. parents adored her. the staff adored her. she was just fun.\n\nbarbie harrington and peggy mclane, trisha's close friends and coworkers, knew her true love was being a mom.\n\npeggy mclane: they were everything. that's all she talked about. she loved those boys.\n\nbart, the eldest, did well in school and had a quirky sense of humor.\n\npeggy mclane: he was fun. he was witty. he was respectful.\n\npeter van sant: a good son?\n\npeggy mclane: a good son.\n\na son who shared a passion for biking with his dad.\n\nkent whitaker: he and i would spend hours and hours on training rides and on organized rides.\n\npeter van sant: what would you talk about on those trips?\n\nkent whitaker: everything.\n\nkevin was the sensitive one.\n\nkent whitaker: kevin was man at a young age. he would not back down from injustice. but he would be so quick to forgive.\n\npeter van sant: this was as healthy and vibrant and loving a family as you'd find, wasn't it?\n\nkent whitaker: thought so. i was very happy with my family. i loved them.\n\nthen came dec. 10, 2003.\n\npeter van sant: how did that day begin?\n\nkent whitaker: bart was supposed to be graduating from college. he called and said he was through with his finals and he wanted to go out to eat and celebrate.\n\npeggy mclane: trisha was so proud. she was telling bart she was going to jump up and down and scream, thank you, jesus.\n\nkent whitaker: we all celebrated. we laughed. we told some jokes. we -- we teased each other and took some pictures and gave bart his graduation gift, which was an expensive watch.\n\npeter van sant: what kind of watch was it?\n\nkent whitaker: it was a rolex. it was what he'd always wanted. it was just a happy night.\n\nafter dinner the whitakers headed home. then, unimaginable horror -- four shots fired.\n\nkent whitaker: i start praying and i say, father, you know, if it's my time to die, i'm ready. it's ok. but protect my family. and it just was awful.\n\ncliff stanley: i saw kent lying down. i went up to him and he was shot. he says, i'm bleeding very badly.\n\nneighbor cliff stanley, the first person on the scene then went to check on trisha.\n\ncliff stanley: she was still alive, was kind of moaning. i said, what happened? and trisha said, he shot us.\n\npeter van sant: did she say who he was?\n\ncliff stanley: no.\n\nbart was lying in the living room, wounded. as for kevin --\n\ncliff stanley: i could see kevin clearly and kevin was finished.\n\ncliff stanley: kent, trisha, and bart were rushed to the hospital, but trisha didn't survive.\n\nkent whitaker: it was horrible.\n\npeggy mclane [crying]: i lost a friend that taught me how to be a better teacher and a better mother. she was just a really good person and i miss her so much.\n\njohn flores: and i remember i walked over to my friend's mom, and i just said, was it kevin? and i felt her -- i felt her nod on my-- on my head. i just kind of shook my head and said ok.\n\nnews report: detectives spent the day searching for anything that would lead them to a killer ...\n\nby the next day, grief turned to anger.\n\ndet. marshall slot: kent, in no unclear terms, told me he wanted us to catch whoever did this. he was upset, he was hurt.\n\nand bart seemed to share that anger.\n\njohn flores: he didn't say much. but he pulled my friend matt and i to him and he said, we're going find who did it.\n\ndetective slot continued his routine questioning of the survivors. bart told slot he was about to graduate from sam houston state university. but the next day came stunning news.\n\ndet. marshall slot: the information had come into the sugar land police department from sam houston state university that bart was not enrolled as a student.\n\npeter van sant: wait a second. he was not a student?\n\ndet. marshall slot: he was a freshman on academic probation.\n\npeter van sant: a freshman?\n\ndet. marshall slot: yes, sir.\n\npeter van sant: wasn't even a senior.\n\ndet. marshall slot: correct.\n\npeter van sant: so, what do you do with this information?\n\ndet. marshall slot: bells and whistles start going off that why is this kid lying to us? … what's he got to hide?\n\nkent whitaker: what were you thinking? you lied to us about being in school? you weren't even near graduating. how could you have done that?\n\npeter van sant: did you ask bart why he had lied to you? why he had said he was a student at sam houston state?\n\ndet. marshall slot: yes, sir. he just didn't want to disappoint his family. he had needed a break; the stress of school had gotten on him.\n\nthen, just five days after the shooting, another bombshell.\n\ndet. marshall slot: it was about 11, 11:30 at night. …the sergeant on duty paged me and said, hey there's somebody here who wants to talk to you.\n\nslot met the stranger in the darkened parking lot behind the police station.\n\ndet. marshall slot: he explained to me that he felt he had information that was crucial to the investigation.\n\nthe man said that bart whitaker wanted him to help kill his family.\n\nblueprint for murder\n\nsix days after trisha and kevin whitaker were gunned down at their home more than 1,000 friends and family gathered to celebrate their lives.\n\nbrittany barnhill: so many people, it was incredible.\n\nit was a time to share fond memories.\n\nfriend of trisha [at funeral]: almost every conversation with trisha included something about kent, bart, and kevin.\n\njohn flores [in tears at funeral]: kevin was a faithful loyal friend. he never compromised anything.\n\nbrittany barnhill [in tears at funeral]: i loved kevin so much. i cried with him. i went to senior prom with him.\n\nbrittany barnhill [at funeral]: bart, i cannot tell you how much kevin looked up to you. you were his hero.\n\namid the sadness there was also anger.\n\nman at funeral: this murderer is still out there. the police needs our help. for your own families for everybody's sake, let's catch him.\n\nbut what no one here knew, among the mourners was a man police were closely watching.\n\npeter van sant: your suspicions are focusing on which person?\n\ndet. marshall slot: bart, definitely.\n\nthat stranger marshall slot had met in the police parking lot turned out to be an old friend of bart's named adam hipp. and he told the detective an extraordinary story: that bart had approached him several years earlier with a detailed plan to kill his family.\n\nthe diagram that adam hipp drew for det. slot called for hipp being the shooter, shooting the whitaker family members as they came in the residence. cbs news\n\ndet. marshall slot [at computer]: this is a diagram that adam hipp drew for me during our three-hour long conversation. it called for adam hipp being the shooter, shooting the family members as they came in the residence.\n\naccording to adam hipp, the plan even included a twist to fool police: bart wanted hipp to shoot him in the shoulder, so he'd look like a victim, not a suspect.\n\ndet. marshall slot: it was unbelievable.\n\npeter van sant: so what adam hipp was telling you was essentially the blueprint for what happened in 2003, the real shooting?\n\nmarshall slot: the exact blueprint.\n\nbut bart appeared to have nothing to hide. he agreed to help detectives by reenacting what happened the night of the shootings:\n\nbart whitaker [police video]: that's when i heard a bang. and i don't remember if, i probably would have run up this way.\n\nbut bart's behavior only heightens slot's suspicions.\n\ndet. marshall slot: everything is very vague. it could have been this, but it could have been this.\n\nmarshall slot [police video]: so that's about the distance you were from him when you got shot? bart whitaker [police video]: yeah. i guess. it might have been closer, i don't really remember.\n\ndet. marshall slot: the fact that he wasn't able to give me a lot of detail about it … it was just unusual to me.\n\npeter van sant: police had indicated to you that he was a suspect in this case.\n\nkent whitaker: yes.\n\npeter van sant: were you wondering at all in the back of your mind, maybe he had something to do with this?\n\nkent whitaker: i considered it but -- but didn't consider it seriously. he promised me that there was nothing to it, that he did not have anything to do with it, that he loved trisha and kevin and me. …it was inconceivable.\n\nbut after adam hipp's story, detective slot felt otherwise. he decided to check out two of bart whitaker's closest friends -- chris brashear and steven champagne.\n\ndet. marshall slot: let's see if he approached any of his current friends to do this.\n\nchris brashear and steven champagne worked with bart at a country club just months before the murders. slot asked them to provide what police call scent samples. using bloodhounds, he compared those samples to evidence collected at the crime scene. slot's hunch paid off when he got a match.\n\ndet. marshall slot: the dogs indicated that chris brashear's scent … was on the drawers that had been moved that night.\n\nmore importantly, brashear's scent was found on the gun used in the homicides.\n\ndet. marshall slot: bingo. we've got our next prime suspect.\n\nwhen detective slot grilled brashear, he denied any involvement in the shootings.\n\ndet. marshall slot: we told him we had a definitive link between him and the murder weapon on the night of the shooting.\n\npeter van sant: what are you seeing on brashear's face?\n\ndet. marshall slot: horror. panic. we struck a nerve with this kid.\n\nslot was now closing in on bart whitaker. then one night, seven months after the shootings, bart told his dad he was heading out to a club.\n\nkent whitaker: bart told me he would see me the next day. …well, that was the last i saw him. …he disappeared.\n\npeter van sant: just fell off the face of the earth?\n\nkent whitaker [affirms]: um, hmm.\n\ndet. marshall slot: i was angry. we'd kind of let him get away. that's what i felt like.\n\nbart's disappearance was a setback. but detective slot pressed on, focusing on the suspects still in sugar land -- especially steven champagne.\n\nmarshall slot: we stayed on him and stayed on him and stayed on him.\n\neventually, champagne cracked.\n\ndet. marshall slot: he informed me that he participated in the crime … and that chris brashear had killed the family.\n\nchampagne confessed that he was the getaway driver, chris brashear was the shooter, and that bart whitaker was the mastermind behind the plan.\n\ndet. marshall slot: this was the floodgates opening.\n\nchampagne led slot to a treasure trove of physical evidence.\n\nammunition from the gun used in the whitaker shootings sugar land police dept.\n\ndet. marshall slot: he led me to the place on the bridge over lake conroe where he and chris brashear had thrown items of evidence.\n\na chisel --\n\ndet. marshall slot: -- that chris brashear had used to break into the gun safe.\n\nammunition --\n\ndet. marshall slot: -- which happened to be the ammunition that was in the gun.\n\nand two cell phones.\n\ndet. marshall slot: bart whitaker had provided those to them to use during the course of carrying out the plot.\n\nsteven champagne, left, and chris brashear, were arrested for the murders of trisha and kevin whitaker in september 2005. sugar land police dept.\n\nin september 2005, sugar land police arrested both steven champagne and chris brashear for the murders of trisha and kevin whitaker. but they still didn't know where to find bart whitaker.\n\nbart's new life\n\nwhen bart whitaker fled sugar land, texas seven months after the shootings, he left behind a community and a father in disbelief.\n\npeter van sant: as a general rule, people don't run if they're innocent.\n\nkent whitaker: no, they don't. oh, it was horrible. it was awful. …i just sat down and i just cried.\n\nlike many a desperado before him, bart headed south into mexico. he ended up in a tiny village called cerralvo, located about forty miles from the texas border.\n\nbart started his new life in cerralvo with about $7,000 in cash, money he had stolen from his father's house. he could speak a little spanish and soon he had a small apartment in town and a job at a local furniture store. he also had something else: a new identity.\n\npeter van sant: who is this man?\n\ngabriella gutierrez [through translator]: well, i know him as rudy.\n\ngabriella gutierrez remembers her american friend named rudy rios.\n\npeter van sant: how would you describe him?\n\ngabriella gutierrez [through translator]: well, he was a friendly person. he liked to drink. he liked the beer. he liked to go with girls. he was very charming. he had a way with the ladies.\n\ncindy lou salinas [through translator]: i saw him, and i said, wow, he's gorgeous.\n\ncindy lou salinas first saw bart in church of all places.\n\ncindy lou salinas [through translator]: i don't know, i found him very interesting. the guys that i've known -- i don't know, he just had something nobody had.\n\nafter bart and cindy lou began dating, her father, omero, gave bart a job at the family's furniture store.\n\npeter van sant: what kind of a worker was he?\n\nomero salinas [through translator]: very good, very obedient. …i really liked him and held him in high esteem.\n\ncindy lou's brother, ubaldo, befriended bart and was impressed with his stories of adventure -- like the one explaining his bullet wound.\n\nubaldo salinas [through translator]: he said he got the scar in the afghanistan war. …he said there was a surprise attack on his group by the afghanis. most of those in his group were killed. he shot at one with his rifle, but there was another one who got him in the shoulder.\n\nthe entire salinas family took bart in as one of their own, and bart told them they were the family he never had.\n\ncindy lou salinas [through translator]: he used to tell me that he was an only child. that he never loved his mother because his mother never loved him either. and that his mother was a prostitute, he used to say that. …his family never gave him the love he wanted. they only gave him money. they ignored him.\n\nfor 14 months, bart lived a carefree new life as rudy rios – but it was all about to come to an end.\n\nrudy rios [phone call]: to me he seems like a cool guy, but if he did that then he needs to pay of it, you know, what i mean.\n\ndet. marshall slot [phone call] i agree.\n\nback in sugar land, detective slot got a phone call from the real rudy rios.\n\ndet. marshall slot: he called me, anonymously one day at my office and said, i know where bart whitaker is. i helped him get there.\n\nrudy rios and bart had worked together at a houston restaurant.\n\ndet. marshall slot: bart explained to him that there was pressure on him from law enforcement. rudy said, well if you ever need any help, let me know. i've got family in mexico that can help you out.\n\naccording to rudy rios, bart paid him $3,000 to escort him to cerralvo. but when word spread of a reward for bart's capture, the real rudy looked to get paid again.\n\nrudy rios [on the phone]: if there's a reward, you know, i don't care. i'll turn his ass in.\n\npeter van sant: how much?\n\ndet. marshall slot: ten thousand dollars.\n\npeter van sant: ten thousand bucks.\n\npeter van sant: so, rudy had dollar signs in his eyes when he came forward?\n\ndet. marshall slot: yes, sir.\n\nmarshall slot was there waiting when mexican authorities dumped bart back across the border.\n\ndet. marshall slot: he glanced at me and then just down to the floor. i don't know if it was a you got me look, but it was very satisfying to walk in that jail.\n\nkent whitaker: the first time i saw him when they took him back from mexico. i walk in and we're separated by the bulletproof glass. i said, well, you look like you're ok. and he says, yes, i am. and he says, dad, i'm just so sorry. i'm so sorry for all of it. it's all my fault.\n\npeter van sant: and what was the it in that sentence that he was referring to?\n\nkent whitaker: the murders. he's responsible for the murders.\n\nbart whitaker sugar land police dept.\n\nalso waiting for bart were fort bend county prosecutors jeff strange and fred felcman with an indictment for the murders of his mother and brother.\n\nprosecutor jeff strange: it is just the ultimate act of betrayal. …it doesn't get any worse than this.\n\npeter van sant: why did he have to kill them?\n\nprosecutor jeff strange: one, because that was the way he was going to inherit $1.5 million.\n\nprosecutor jeff strange: i think also to some extent deep down, bart thinks he's smarter than everybody else. and he just wanted to see if he could get away with the perfect crime.\n\nin fred felcman, bart had an adversary who is one of the toughest, no-nonsense prosecutors in texas.\n\nhow would you describe bart whitaker?\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: there is a term they use in psycho lingo, psychobabble, of sociopath. in other words, a person who knows he's doing something wrong but really doesn't care. the old time texas thing was that he's just a mean sold on of a bitch, ok?\n\nbecause this was a multiple murder, prosecutors will seek the death penalty for bart whitaker.\n\nfred felcman [in court]: four shots fired. four hits.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: it's a good strong case.\n\nin fact, it's an overwhelming case. so much so that bart's defense attorney decides on a unique strategy. he will all but concede that bart is guilty and use the trial to try and convince jurors that bart's life should be spared. and he has a man of unshakeable religious faith in his corner.\n\nkent whitaker: even knowing that he'd been guilty and responsible for this, i just can't understand why it's so necessary to put him to death.\n\nfred felcman: do you have any inkling whatsoever mr. whitaker that your son had been lying to you? kent whitaker: no, i didn't.\n\nincredibly, kent whitaker has forgiven bart.\n\nkent whitaker: the first night in the hospital … i forgave everyone who was involved in this. …it is a gift of god that allows me to do this. …i think he gave me that gift so that when i found out that it was my son, that it would be a legitimate forgiveness.\n\nthe question now is: will a jury be as forgiving?\n\na ruthless conspiracy\n\nsugar land, texas has never seen a trial like this.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: this crime affected all of sugar land.\n\na case of multiple murder where the accused is being passionately defended by one of the people he tried to kill.\n\nkent whitaker: if the state pursues the death penalty and receives it, then they will kill the last surviving member of my family.\n\nkent whitaker enters court as his son, bart, goes on trial for his role in the dec. 10, 2003 murders of his wife, tricia, and son, kevin. kent was injured in the attack. khou\n\nkent whitaker believes his son's eternal soul is at stake.\n\nkent whitaker: i believe, as a christian, that god can and does forgive and change people's hearts. if they are sorry, if they repent, if they ask his forgiveness for real, he will forgive them.\n\nbut jeff strange and fred felcman say their duty is to uphold texas law, not god's law.\n\nprosecutor jeff strange: kent whitaker's religious faith is genuine. forgiveness is a big tenet of what he believes. and i respect that and i -- i totally understand that. that's not my job though.\n\npeter van sant: does bart whitaker deserve the death penalty?\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: yes. he meets the criteria we have in the state of texas. he is a continuing threat. he intentionally caused these people's death. and there is nothing mitigating about him. he wasn't abused. he wasn't surrounded by crime. i find it hard to believe anybody wouldn't think he deserved it.\n\nthree years after trisha and kevin's murders, bart whitaker's trial gets underway. prosecutors present crime scene analysis, forensic evidence, and eyewitness accounts.\n\nsteven champagne testifies that two months before the shootings, bart whitaker offered both him and chris brashear a cut of a $1 million insurance policy to help kill the whitaker family. on the night of the attack, champagne was waiting in the getaway car.\n\nbut it's the testimony of steven champagne, one of bart's alleged accomplices, that everyone in the courtroom is waiting to hear:\n\njeff strange: what are you charged with? steven champagne: capital murder.\n\nchampagne says two months before the shootings, bart offered both him and chris brashear a cut of a million-dollar insurance policy to help kill the whitaker family:\n\nsteven champagne: the conversation was about … when the family got back from eating dinner, that chris would be in the house and shoot them.\n\non the night of the attack, champagne was waiting in the getaway car when chris brashear quickly got inside:\n\nsteven champagne: i asked him what happened. …he told me that he had shot all of them.\n\ndefense attorney randy mcdonald can do little except attack champagne for agreeing to kill for money:\n\nrandy mcdonald: and it really didn't bother you that three other human beings would be killed so you could have a better lifestyle? steven champagne: the way that i looked at it was they weren't human.\n\nas prosecutors build their case, more shocking details emerge. investigators learn the 2003 attack wasn't the first time bart had tried to kill his family. he had made at least three other attempts using other friends as recruits.\n\njeff strange: was it just a general conversation, i want to kill my family. i want you to help me? will anthony: yes, sir.\n\nin december 2000, bart approached his college roommates will anthony and justin peters:\n\nwill anthony: i was supposed to, as they enter the home, shoot the family, sir. jeff strange: will who was supposed to actually go into the house, was he going to be given anything to hide his identity? justin peters: yes. …he was given … black pants and black shirt and a ski mask. jeff strange: by who? justin peters: bart.\n\npeters and anthony actually made it to the whitaker home. as planned, will anthony went to open a back window:\n\nwill anthony: as soon as i touch it, sir, i tried to open it, an alarm went off.\n\nthe two men fled. but bart whitaker wasn't scared off. two months later he approached another friend with another plan. remember adam hipp, bart's old friend-turned police informant? under oath, hipp publicly admits that he too once agreed to help kill the whitaker family:\n\njeff strange: why did you say yes? adam hipp: you know, i don't know. i'm not proud of it, but for the simple fact i was kind of interested to see how far he would take it.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: we're going, huh? these were kind of people you would think, this is what you want your son to be, goes to college, gets a banking job, stuff like this.\n\npeter van sant: all-american boys.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: all-american boys.\n\nlike bart, all three young men came from well-to-do families.\n\nprosecutor jeff strange: clean cut, kind of all-american kids. justin peters had been a national merit scholar. …i just could not see how this could happen.\n\nbesides money, prosecutor felcman believes bart whitaker is a gifted liar and manipulator.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: he would actually seek out people, ok? …he would seek out the ones that were maybe a little weaker, that he got to know a little bit better, that had some investment in him.\n\nbart's second plan to murder his family with the aid of adam hipp never went beyond talk. but by april 2001, bart had hatched yet a third plot.\n\npeter van sant: so, bart whitaker was a determined young man?\n\nprosecutor jeff strange: absolutely.\n\nthis time, the plan unraveled after jennifer japhet, a college acquaintance of bart's, found out about it:\n\njennifer japhet: i asked bart if he was seriously going to let this happen. jeff strange: and how did he react to that? jennifer japhet: he came up to me and he gave me a hug and whispered in my ear that everything was going to be ok. jeff strange: did you called the police? jennifer japhet: i did call the police.\n\npolice, in turn, notified kent and trisha.\n\nkent whitaker: it was just the far-outest thing that you can conceive of and we immediately said, there's no way.\n\nbart told his parents it was all a misunderstanding. his parents believed him.\n\nkent whitaker: in retrospect, you say, what an idiot. how could you possibly have not seen this? but the truth is we didn't know they were lies.\n\neven after his wife and youngest son were murdered two years later, kent still refused to believe that bart was capable of such evil.\n\npeter van sant: aren't you putting two and two together here and saying maybe bart's responsible for this?\n\nkent whitaker: perhaps i should have, but i didn't.\n\npeter van sant: do you believe this crime could have been prevented if people had paid attention to the warning signs?\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: no…. look at the actions of bart whitaker. you're already caught, alright? but you still proceed to it. and you still go through it. now, you tell me where along this line would bart whitaker, do you think, is going to stop?\n\nbart whitaker's trial lasted six days. the jury deliberates just two hours, returning with a verdict everyone was expecting:\n\njudge clifford vacek (reads verdict): we, the jury, do hereby find the defendant, thomas bartlett whitaker, guilty of the offense of capital murder as charged in the indictment.\n\nbut the real drama of this case is the punishment phase. now, for the first time, bart whitaker will speak openly about his obsession with killing his family:\n\nbart whitaker [crying on the witness stand]: i feel horrible about myself, what i've done.\n\na father's plea\n\nthe punishment phase of bart whitaker's trial is underway.\n\nkent whitaker: this is daunting. our son's life is hanging in the balance.\n\nand his father kent hopes he can persuade the jury to forgive bart as he has.\n\ndefense attorney randy mcdonald: the ladies and gentlemen of the jury may not have the same faith. they may not have the same beliefs about what should happen to somebody. but is it your desire that they assess a life sentence in this case? kent whitaker: it has been from the start and it still is. randy mcdonald: would trisha feel the same way? kent whitaker: i promise you, she would have been appalled that the state chose to pursue the death penalty in this case.\n\nbut it will take more than the wishes of kent or trisha to spare their son's life.\n\nto everyone's surprise, bart decides to put his fate in his own hands and speak directly to the jury:\n\nbart whitaker takes the stand in his trial for the murders of his mother and brother khou\n\nbart whitaker: i am 100-percent guilty for this. i put the plan in motion. if i had not done so, it would not have happened. randy mcdonald: and did you realize that you robbed your mother of a full life? bart whitaker: yes. randy mcdonald: you robbed kevin of a full life. bart whitaker: yes. randy mcdonald: you actually even robbed your father of a full life. bart whitaker [whispers]: yes, sir. randy mcdonald: do you feel any remorse for this? bart whitaker: yes, sir, i do. randy mcdonald: who do you feel remorse for?\n\nbart whitaker: for everyone involved starting with my dad, my mom, and my brother. [cries, pauses.] everyone i ever met in my life, i feel sorry for having come in contact with me.\n\nbart is finally asked the question on everyone's mind:\n\nrandy mcdonald: can you answer the question why? bart whitaker: no, sir. i have come up with a lot of the reasons for how i -- how i got to where i was going, but they do not explain it. i always felt that whatever love they sent me was conditional on a standard that i just never felt i could reach.\n\npeter van sant: bart whitaker claims that he felt unloved. he felt he couldn't live up to his parents' expectations.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: yeah, i heard all that crap, too. …there's no evidence whatsoever this family ever did anything to him.they loved him unconditionally.\n\nkent whitaker: i think he came to the decision that, you know, i hate myself. i hate this life i'm in. if there's just some way i can get out of it -- maybe if my parents, maybe if my family was gone, i could be free of this and live a real life.\n\nfor bart's life to be spared, he must convince the jury he is no longer a threat to anyone in or out of prison:\n\nrandy mcdonald: do you have any designs on any conduct that would in any way, shape or form, hurt another individual? bart whitaker: no. the only people i've ever hated, and i know it was not for the right reasons, but the only people i ever hated were my parents and my brother. randy mcdonald: but the irony of it all is that your dad is actually the one that's come to your rescue and put you back on track. bart whitaker: he's become my best friend in the last year. judge clifford vacek: mr. felcman, i assume you're going to be a while. fred felcman: that's a good chance.\n\nprosecutor fred felcman has waited nearly two years for this moment:\n\nfred felcman: your mother loved you, that her whole life was you and kevin. but then you tell me you never felt loved by your parents? bart whitaker: yes, sir. fred felcman: you find anything scary about this? bart whitaker: i find something tragic about it. fred felcman: tragic, that i've got a defendant who's that out of touch with reality?\n\nfelcman wants to convince the jury that bart whitaker's disconnect with reality makes him dangerous:\n\nfred felcman: somebody interacts with bart whitaker, it can be on a totally innocent basis, and you decide to perceive it different. you could kill that person. bart whitaker: no, i could not. fred felcman: but you killed your mother and brother on totally false circumstances, right? bart whitaker: yes, sir. i was a different person then.\n\ntrisha, kevin and kent whitaker kent whitaker\n\nfelcman reminds the jury of the lives bart took:\n\nfred felcman: did you see your brother when you ran in? bart whitaker: yes, i did. fred felcman: he was gurgling in his own blood, wasn't he? bart whitaker [crying]: yeah. fred felcman: you know, i've watched this whole trial and you never cried 'til now. bart whitaker: i did earlier. fred felcman: why are you crying now? bart whitaker: horrible memory.\n\nbart tries one last time to convince felcman, and the jury, that he has changed:\n\nbart whitaker: you believe a person can't be sorry for the things he did? fred felcman: no. i think they can be sorry mr. whitaker. but i don't think you are. i think you're sorry you got caught and now you're figuring out how to get out of the death penalty.\n\nit took jurors only 10 hours to reach a verdict.\n\njudge clifford vacek [in court]: the court does at this time upon those verdicts determine to you'd be sentenced to death.\n\nbart whitaker is to die.\n\npeter van sant: what did that do to you inside?\n\nkent whitaker: the feeling was a great deal of disappointment.\n\ndespite all that he now knows, kent whitaker says he will never abandon his son.\n\nkent whitaker: i mean, trisha and kevin, i miss them. but they're in heaven and i'm going to heaven. and i have no doubts about that. i want bart up there too.\n\npeter van sant: some day in the future you're going to get a phone call from somebody to tell you that bart whitaker has been put to death?\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: yeah.\n\npeter van sant: what will that day be like for you do you think?\n\nprosecutor fred felcman: there'll be a certain sadness. but it won't be for bart whitaker. it would be for the father. it will also be a sense of satisfaction too, though. justice has been done in this case.\n\nover the next decade, kent whitaker lobbies the state tirelessly for his son's death sentence to be commuted to life. but when bart's appeals were exhausted, his execution is scheduled for 6 p.m. on feb. 22, 2018.\n\nthe week before his son is to be out to death, kent, now remarried, made one last desperate plea for mercy to the texas board of pardons and paroles.\n\n\n\nkent whitaker [to reporters]: we're not asking him to forgive him or let him go we just want them to let him blive. …bart was my the last surviving member of my natural family and no one in my family wants to see him executed.\n\njust two days before the sentence is to be carried out, the board makes what could be a life-saving recommendation for clemency.\n\nkent whitaker [to reporters, smiling] i don't think he's going to believe it. you're not going to believe it.\n\nkent whitaker [to reporters]: this is texas, this doesn't happen. i'm just so encouraged the system has worked. this was the right thing -- the right thing to do.\n\nbut the final decision has to come from the governor. and when execution day arrives, there's still no word from him. so, kent went to see his son for the last time.\n\nkent whitaker: we touched hands through the glass and said our goodbyes.\n\nbart eats his last meal. he gets ready to be strapped to the gurney. with less than 40 minutes to go, the governor finally decides:\n\nnews anchor: breaking news. less than an hour before thomas bart whitaker's 6 p.m. scheduled execution governor abbott spares his life.\n\nkent whitaker [to reporters]: we were actually standing together praying when my phone rang … and so he said that we have a commutation. at that point, i put it on speaker and let everybody hear and the whole room erupted.\n\nkent and bart whitaker\n\nbar releases a statement saying, i'm thankful for the decision not for me, but for my dad.\n\nkent whitaker: it was overpowering. i was so grateful.\n\nkent whitaker statement and tdcj response\n\nlate friday, jan. 4, 2019, 48 hours received the following statement from kent whitaker regarding his son, thomas bart whitaker:\n\nit has been 11 months since bart's sentence was commuted. the normal procedure is for tdcj [texas department of criminal justice] to reclassify him from death row solitary confinement, using the same extensive file that the pardons and parole board based their unanimous decision upon. his intake officer said he should be cleared for general population in 2-3 weeks, where he would receive phone privileges and interaction with other inmates for the first time in 11 years. eventually he could earn a contact visit with me. yet, to this day, he remains in solitary confinement with no reclassification. what is the point of commutation if his life does not improve? no one within tdcj can explain why. administrative segregation is a lingering death that defeats the purpose of commutation. life is more than drawing breath and pumping blood alone in a prison cell; it means interacting with others, such as family for whom commutation was given as much as to thomas.\n\nin response, texas department of criminal justice director of communications jeremy desel said:
one of the surf world's biggest events, the titans of mavericks surf competition, kicks off friday. but it's embroiled in controversy, with some questioning why women are missing from the lineup, reports cbs news correspondent carter evans.\n\nsurfers from around the world come to half moon bay, california, just south of san francisco, for the competition. the riders are an elite group, facing waves up to 50 feet high, and they're all invited at a moment's notice -- when the conditions are just right.\n\nbut in the 17 years since the competition was first held, only men have competed.\n\nit's not a gender thing -- it's a performance thing, said jeff clark, who was the first to surf the spot back in 1975 and went on to start the now classic competition. he says a committee and a poll of surfers determine who's invited.\n\nwe have a really good understanding of who's performing the best, who is pushing the limits, who is going to new levels of performance, clark said. women just aren't there yet.\n\nbianca valenti disagrees. she's been surfing the waves here for about eight years.\n\nthose arguments saying, 'there aren't enough women, they don't surf well enough,' they maybe used to hold true, but now, those excuses don't work anymore, valenti said.\n\nand she's not alone. keala kennelly chases big waves all over the world.\n\ni think the message is that women are completely capable and there's more than a handful now and they deserve a chance, kennelly said.\n\nthe california coastal commission -- the state agency charged with overseeing public use of the coast -- is demanding change. it recently voted to require clark and his team to come up with a plan to allow women in the competition by next year.\n\nclark's current deal blocks anyone else from using this spot for competitions during the prime five-month surfing season. but if they do not abide by the commission's order, they won't get the necessary permit required to hold the event.\n\nmy understanding of what the coastal commission wants is more women involved in mavericks, clark said. we've had women judges, we've had women in our water patrol and water rescue.\n\nmavericks invited a woman to be an alternate in its very first year and did so again this year, but critics say it's not enough.\n\nyou know, i think it was a publicity stunt, so that they could say, 'oh yeah, hey look, we always include women,' you know? it wasn't really genuine, valenti said.\n\nboth sides agree that the more women get involved in the sport, the sooner they'll get invited to contests like mavericks. they just disagree on how quickly that tide should turn.
president trump said on hannity thursday night that he doesn't think states need as many ventilators as they have requested from the federal government to deal with the coronavirus crisis. the president appeared to reference the dire request from new york governor andrew cuomo for 30,000 ventilators.\n\ni have a feeling that a lot of the numbers that are being said in some areas are just bigger than they're going to need, the president said. i don't believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators. you know, you go to major hospitals, sometimes they have two ventilators. now all of a sudden they're saying can we order 30,000 ventilators.\n\non friday, cuomo appeared to respond to the president's challenge, saying he hopes the state doesn't need 30,000 ventilators, but that he's basing the request on data being provided to him by experts.\n\nsomebody said on one of the cable news shows said: 'the ventilators that new york needed aren't even being deployed, they're in a stockpile,' cuomo said. yes, they're in a stockpile, because that's where they're supposed to be, because we don't need them yet, we need them for the apex, the apex isn't here so we're gathering them in the stockpile so when we need them they will be there.\n\nsecond point: 'well maybe you don't need 30,000.' look, i don't have a crystal ball, everybody's entitled to their own opinion, but i don't operate here on opinion. i operate on facts, and on data, and on numbers, and on projections, he said.\n\ni hope we don't need 30,000 ventilators, i hope some natural weather change happens over night kills the virus globally ... but the numbers say you might need 30,000.\n\ncuomo has said projections show the state will need the ventilators within the next two weeks, when the peak of coronavirus cases is expected to hit the state. as of wednesday, cuomo said the state has been able gather about half of the ventilators it needs, but only about 4,000 of those have come from the federal government.\n\nventilators are lifesaving devices for covid-19 patients. in severe cases, the disease can cause inflammation in the lungs, filling them with fluid and making it hard for the patient to breathe on their own. ventilators take over the body's breathing process, giving the person time to fight off the infection and recover.\n\nthe governor explained that new york — which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country — needs such a high number of ventilators because the rate of turnaround for ventilators in covid-19 patients is much slower than in typical respiratory illnesses.\n\nwhy is there such a demand on ventilators, and where did this come from? it's a respiratory illness for a large number of people, so they all need ventilators, cuomo said at his daily press conference thursday afternoon. also, non-covid patients are normally on ventilators for three to four days — covid patients are on ventilators for 11 to 21 days. ... so, you don't have the same turnaround in the number of ventilators.\n\nhe said earlier this week that the state is testing the possibility of splitting one ventilator between two patients to help the supply go further.\n\non wednesday, cuomo said meeting the 30,000 ventilator quota would be an extraordinarily difficult task, but said it's something his team is working on with the white house.\n\nthe president did not echo the same tone of urgency about ventilators when he called into sean hannity's show on fox news thursday evening.\n\nit's a highly — it's very expensive, it's a very intricate piece of equipment, you know ... heavily computerized, and you know the good ones are very, very expensive. and you know they say, uh, like governor cuomo and others, they say, 'we want 30,000 of them.' 30,000? think of this, you know you go to hospitals and they will have one in the hospital, and now all of a sudden everybody is asking for these vast numbers, mr. trump said.\n\nwe have now companies stepping up and they are building them and doing the masks. we have already delivered millions and millions of masks, but remember we are really the second line of attack. the first line of attack is supposed to be the hospitals and the local government and the states, the states themselves, the president continued.\n\nmr. trump has repeatedly said states need to take the lead on obtaining their own lifesaving medical equipment, rather than relying on the power of the federal government. he also spoke with hannity about how he hopes to soon start reducing restrictions on everyday life to get the economy moving again.\n\nso, look, it's a very bad situation, we haven't seen anything like it, but the end result is we've got to get back to work, mr. trump told hannity. and i think we can start by opening up certain parts of the country, you know the farm belt, certain parts of the midwest.
the following is a transcript of an interview with bank of america ceo brian moynihan that aired sunday, march 15, 2020, on face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: and we're back with the head of america's second largest bank, bank of america ceo brian moynihan. good to have you here.\n\nbank of america ceo brian moynihan: great to be here, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: you run one of the biggest banks in the country. you met with the president this week. this has been a swift change in americans' lives. are we on the brink of a financial crisis?\n\nmoynihan: well, i think let's step back and think about what we have here. number one, this is a healthcare crisis and a humanitarian crisis. and we can't forget that we have to take care of people and handle that first. and by the way, that's the answer to the large- larger question. and i think i'd think about three things. this is a war. we're in a war to contain this virus. the interesting thing is everybody has the same common enemy across the whole world. so the question of how we do that as employers, as private sector, public sector, everybody is key. and so we have to drive that. the second thing going to your question of banking industry is big bank industry comes in with capital liquidity that is so different than the last crisis. the question is we have to use it wisely. and we have to manage the companies well in times of stress. and this is a quick change from what was going on as a solidly growing economy. and the third thing is as a company, we have to take care of our own. so our teammates and our customers and clients, we have to continue to provide the services we do. we have 4,300 branches open every day. the markets are trading every day. the wires have trillions of dollars moving through the system every day, are going on. but at the same time as an employer, we have to take precautions to meet our part of the war, which is to get our teammates socially distanced, to go back to central operations to make sure we work. so it's those three key points. and you can't forget that this is a healthcare crisis, and we care that, the economic issues will go away quickly.\n\nmargaret brennan: and- and it's that uncertainty of not knowing when and where that is- is weighing on everyone so much. you said your bank is going to treat this like a natural disaster and help consumers. what specifically does that mean? if someone can't make their mortgage payment or pay their credit card, what are you doing for them?\n\nmoynihan: they call the number on the card and they say, i'm affected by the disease, and i can't make my payment. we defer the payment. we've done it. we did it for the employee- government employees that were shut down. we've done it for every natural disaster. but we're not alone as a company. the whole industry does this. this is what we do. and then with small businesses and others, when they have, you know, issues in terms of cash flow, they come to us and we help work through it. so the idea is you don't want people to be penalized, much like the bill in congress is trying to take care- if you think about you're in a war and you have to deal with the people who are going to fall out of that, and the question is, the people in congress, as larry was just talking about, they're trying to deal with it more systematically. healthcare or health leave benefits, unemployment benefits. we're trying to deal with the other side, which is i can't make my payment. call us, and we'll make it right.\n\nmargaret brennan: and then the consumers are the engine of this economy.\n\nmoynihan: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: people are scared.\n\nmoynihan: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: they're not just looking at the market. when they're told to go home,--\n\nmoynihan: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --when they can't get food at the grocery store, when they don't know when their next paycheck is coming, how is it that you can be confident the economy is going to come back when we don't know when this is going to end? we don't know how many jobs are going to be lost.\n\nmoynihan: well there's some interesting things to think about. one is what's really going on as of today. so we see the data of consumer spending and- on things and goods and services and we watch it every day. and the aggregate number year over year is still up 10 percent plus--\n\nmargaret brennan: now.\n\nmoynihan: today.\n\nmargaret brennan: but people are just now social distancing.\n\nmoynihan: right and so- so what you're gonna say is what happens next?\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmoynihan: and obviously travel, the cruise industry, movies, things like that are- are, you know, changing dramatically. restaurants, you're hearing the reports of that. so that- that's all in front of us. but right now, it hasn't had the impact people think. and so that's the question. but if you asked yourself, what are we trying to do? you heard dr. fauci talk about sort of flattening the curve.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmoynihan: it's the inverse of that for us as bank- the banking system, we're trying to make sure the trough stays as high as it can. that it doesn't go down as much that--\n\nmargaret brennan: but other banks are predicting a recession. that's two quarters--\n\nmoynihan: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: of decline.\n\nmoynihan: right. and i think, you know, our- our experts who are the leading research firm in the world. you know, it's basically a 1.2 for the us. now, that'll be a tale of four quarters that are different--\n\nmargaret brennan: economic growth.\n\nmoynihan: you'll have growth in the first quarter then it'll go down, you know, maybe flat. but although they've gone from 1.7 percent to 1.2 percent, so they've come down. but they're saying it recovers given the health care crisis being solved. but one- and one of the things we look at is what's happening in china. we talk to our clients in china, and we had teammates in china, in hong kong and places like that. this was an issue in january of social distancing and separation. 80 percent of employees are back to work\n\nmargaret brennan: the factories are- are- we see propaganda photos. you're saying it's real? china is going back to work?\n\nmoynihan: i- i'm talking about clients of ours who employ, have factories in china are back 60, 70, 80 percent, which is good news because the supply chain of goods is there. the question then, is will the demand--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmoynihan: --in the united states and europe be there? and that's coming down to solving the healthcare crisis.\n\nmargaret brennan: and that all matters because that's the second largest economy in the world. it is huge to how our- our global economy functions. the federal reserve, the president said yesterday he wants more action to be taken.\n\nmoynihan: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: what do you expect to happen? what needs to happen to stabilize the markets because they are--\n\nmoynihan: so, i think--\n\nmargaret brennan: --under such pressure?\n\nmoynihan: --they need to provide- provide liquidity and- and continuous liquidity, and so in these situations, that's what dries up. people back up and- and- and the liquidity dries up. so, the treasury markets, again, they've started- they've done major things there. other government guarantee markets, the money funds, potentially commercial paper. there's a lot of things that are on the table. the central banks around the world have to both provide monetary help, accommodation help, rates, they drop rates 50 basis points. the package of things to do are all known. and the question is doing it at the appropriate time, and more importantly, all the central banks around the world to have the same impact. meanwhile, we've got to solve the healthcare crisis.\n\nmargaret brennan: very, very quickly, what larry kudlow was talking about was providing help potentially to the airlines. does that need to happen? does there need to be some version of a bailout?\n\nmoynihan: i think in a time of- you know, a time of war against this virus, if industries are affected in a way that are strategic industries, we ought to help them.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. thank you very much. we'll be right back with a look at how the coronavirus is impacting the travel industry.
ahead of president obama's last state of the union address, republicans are once again blasting what the white house considers a key accomplishment of the president's foreign policy legacy: the iran nuclear deal. and this time, they're warning that the international agreement could take down the u.s. oil industry.\n\nas a consequence of president obama's nuclear agreement with iran, this state sponsor of terrorism will now be able to increase its oil exports at a moment when our moderate sunni allies, and their partners, feel increasingly threatened by iranian belligerents, sen. john hoeven, r-north dakota, said in a video released saturday. as a result, saudi arabia has opened the spigot to maintain its own level of exports.\n\nthe gop senator warned that these factors -- compounded with the threats of russia and the islamic state of iraq and syria (isis) -- are actually working to undermine our energy industry.\n\na huge part of vladimir putin's power base on the world stage is the fact that so much of europe depends on oil and gas from russia, hoeven said. and [isis] is relying on oil and gas dollars to fund its brutal terrorist activities in the middle east and beyond.\n\nthe chair of the senate committee on homeland security, hoeven added that energy security is a vitally important part of national security.\n\nhoeven proposed taking more proactive steps to growing domestic oil production. he pointed to such legislative maneuvers like congress' recent lifting of the u.s. ban on crude oil exports, which passed after gop leaders struck a spending deal with democrats that also extended renewable energy tax breaks.\n\nlow-cost energy makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board in all industry sectors, he said. you do that by building the kind of legal tax and regulatory climate that attracts investment, innovation and jobs. you do that by reforming the tax code to make it simpler, flatter and fairer so that the american people have the motivation to compete and win.\n\nin his own video, mr. obama championed initiatives that have helped prop up another industry tied heavily to u.s. oil production: america's auto manufacturers.\n\ni placed my bet on american manufacturing, mr. obama said in the saturday video. in exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. we said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. we got labor and management to settle their differences. we got the industry to retool and restructure.\n\nhe touted the fruits of the auto industry bailout, countering critics who called it a road to socialism and a disaster waiting to happen.\n\nsince our plan went into effect, our automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs, mr. obama said. we've cut the detroit-area unemployment rate by more than half. the big three automakers are raising wages.\n\ntoday, the president said, the american auto industry is back.\n\nthe president also previewed his trip to detroit later this month to visit the city's annual auto show, saying his attendance would allow him to see this progress firsthand.
what should have been toward the top of everyone's new year's resolutions? making sure their phones are secure.\n\nmillions of us walk around with vast amounts of personal data, photos, essential phone numbers and often sensitive financial information on our now-indispensable smartphones, so it's more important than ever to make sure it's all protected.\n\ncnet senior editor sharon profis shares three simple but essential tips for making your iphone more secure.\n\nlock your phone\n\ncnet\n\n\n\nif someone got ahold of your phone, you wouldn't want them to easily access your information or apps. it's important to lock your phone. and you can change the settings so your passcode is required immediately, or within a certain amount of time after you set down your phone. shorter times are more secure, since that would give a thief or a snoop less of an opportunity to access your phone's contents.\n\nhow do you change your passcode settings? within settings on your home screen, go to touch id or passcode, select passcode, then select require passcode and then choose your options for how quickly you want the passcode option to appear.\n\ndisable control center access\n\ncnet\n\n\n\nprofis warned that another security hole in people's iphones is access to their control centers. if you lose your phone, someone could prevent you from tracking it just by putting your device in airplane mode. to prevent your control center from being so easily accessible, head to settings, then control center, then access on lock screen, and toggle the slider to off.\n\nfind my iphone\n\ncnet\n\n\n\nwhat if all else fails and you ultimately lose your phone or it does get stolen? how do you retrieve it? well, luckily, find my iphone is a feature on everyone's iphones -- you just have to use it. in settings, go to icloud, scroll down to find my iphone, and toggle the slider to on. this enables you to track your phone on a map from any ios device or your computer and see where it went.

a decade ago this very month, in cairo's tahrir square, social media was being praised. its role as an organizing tool during the pro-democracy rallies had many calling the arab spring the facebook revolution instead.\n\nbut for all its glowing promise, we quickly learned social media is only as good as how it's used.\n\nthe major difference between now and then is, more than ever before, our experiences on social media are determined by hidden decisions made by the social media companies themselves, said ramesh srinivasan, who was in tahrir square back then researching how twitter and facebook were giving voice to the voiceless.\n\nit used to be something more of an open pipe, he said.\n\nsrinivasan is now an author, and a professor at ucla's department of information studies. what we are seeing when we go online is likely to be that which is most sensational or inflammatory. they're predicting whatever is most likely to grab people's attention.\n\nkeeping us engaged on social media is how big tech makes money, and the past four years have proven lies and conspiracy theories are unfortunately more engaging that the truth.\n\nand the danger in that is, what? asked correspondent lee cowan.\n\nthe danger is it's gonna present us with an extremely distorted view of reality, srinivasan replied. the fringe becomes the new normal.\n\nthat is a study in the trump presidency. his reality tv roots taught him controversy gets ratings. and he used his social media feeds in much the same way. no one has a bigger bully pulpit than the president of the united states, and no one before mr. trump used it with such abandon online.\n\nthe attack on the capitol changed all that.\n\nafter years of defending his presence on their platforms, facebook, twitter, youtube and other social media giants booted mr. trump, claiming he'd incited a riot.\n\namazon removed an entire site from its servers: parler, which had become the place favored by many conservatives.\n\nde-platformed was a word we learned a lot about this past week.\n\ni think big tech has made a terrible mistake, and very, very bad for our country, president trump said tuesday. they shouldn't be doing it. but, uhh, there's always a counter-move when they do that.\n\nwhile many applauded the move, the precedent of shutting out the leader of the free world made many people uncomfortable, too. it's a huge power to wield, one that is currently held in the hands of a very few.\n\nit's not a new argument; the ceos of the major tech companies have been called on the carpet before.\n\nwho the hell elected you, and put you in charge of what the media are allowed to report and what the american people are allowed to hear? sen. ted cruz asked tech executives during an october 2020 hearing on the communications decency act.\n\nin 2019 rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez asked facebook ceo mark zuckerberg, so, you won't take down lies or you will take down lies? i think it's just a pretty simple yes or no.\n\nbut claiming big tech is running afoul of the first amendment by de-platforming those it deems harmful may be missing the larger point.\n\ncowan asked, is kicking someone off any of these social media sites an infringement of their free speech rights?\n\nno, it isn't, replied daphne keller, who directs the program on platform regulation at stanford university's cyber policy center. they are not subject to the first amendment. they are not the government.\n\nwhen it comes to digital speech and the first amendment, she said, it gets messy pretty fast.\n\ncowan said, this isn't just a free speech argument on the part of users; it's also a free speech argument on the part of the providers as well, right?\n\npeople who want to sue platforms, and force them to carry speech they don't want to, have a double first amendment problem, keller said. first of all, those people don't have a first amendment claim against the platforms, and second of all, the platforms do have a first amendment argument against being forced to carry speech they disagree with.\n\nbut what if the argument over regulation was reframed – less about speech, and more about changing how big tech exposes us to that speech?\n\nyaël eisenstat used to work for facebook as one of the heads of election integrity, where she saw firsthand just what these companies do with all that content.\n\nthis idea that it's just this free flow of information is false. it's a curated flow of information, she said. it's a business model that is predicated on gathering as much of our human behavioral data as possible, to create these little boxes of who we are, to then target us with ads.\n\nthat's all fine if we're shopping for sneakers, she said. but those same algorithms apply to our politics, too. we'll willingly follow ideas that pop up down the rabbit hole, and those who want their messages to spread know the more controversial, the better.\n\ni don't think that mark zuckerberg set out with the idea that, 'i wanna create a platform where the most outrageous, salacious, hate-filled speech wins.' i don't think that was his goal, eisenstat said. but instead of holding the platform responsible for what somebody posts, it's the tools that i want them held responsible for, not the actual speech on the platform, except for, of course, if the speech breaks the law.\n\nbut it sounds like what you're saying, though, is that'd be changing the business model, pretty much, said cowan.\n\none hundred percent.\n\nbig tech has promised more transparency, and better enforcement of their own rules when it comes to spreading dis- and mis-information.\n\nfacebook removed more hate speech this year than ever before; twitter, the same. even tik-tok is being more proactive.\n\nbut that will likely not be enough going forward.\n\ncowan asked ramesh srinivasan, can we trust them to do this kind of regulation on their own, though?\n\nno. we should not be trusting twitter or any private company to magically serve the public interest. i think, if anything, the last four years have taught us that we can't do that.\n\na year before the end of his second term, president bill clinton talked about the challenges of regulating the internet: that's sorta like trying to nail jell-o to the wall.\n\nthat was more than two decades ago. times change, but the value of good stewardship doesn't.\n\nthis discussion is about how we wanna live, how we wanna be, as a country and as a people, said srinivasan. it's a discussion about our humanity, at the end of the day. i do believe that you can force people to tie their actions to beliefs that might be a little more virtuous than their mere bottom lines.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by john goodwin. editor: ben mccormick.
when donald trump won the new hampshire primary in 2016, he reportedly credited the opioid epidemic, calling the state a drug infested den. he effectively tied widespread opioid addiction to his signature campaign theme — the border wall he wanted to build across the u.s. southern border with mexico — saying that the drugs were coming up through mexico.\n\npresidential candidates or opioid deaths were the main recurring topics in new hampshire news that year, when 20 people were listed on the major-party primary ballots, and 437 people died of opioid overdoses. despite the attention, the number rose in 2017. and now, it still ranks among the top five states for opioid- and drug-related deaths, says cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga.\n\nnow, in 2020, white house hopefuls are accustomed to including, along with traditional retail stops, visits to rehab centers, where they unveil expensive plans to curb opioid abuse.\n\nlast year a study on mortality rates in the u.s. found new hampshire had the largest increase in the rate of deaths of people between 25 and 64. the report, published in the journal of the american medical association, showed the rate of deaths among young and middle aged people in new hampshire increased by 23% between 2010 and 2017.\n\ndespite its pervasiveness, the opioid epidemic and its many victims have garnered little attention on the democratic debate stage. that could change friday night, as the candidates take the debate stage in manchester.\n\nseven of the remaining 11 democratic contenders still in the presidential race will debate at st. anselm university. friday morning, abc news announced left-to-right podium order as follows: entrepreneur andrew yang, former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg, vermont senator bernie sanders, former vice president joe biden, massachusetts senator elizabeth warren, minnesota senator amy klobuchar and businessman tom steyer. the debate begins at 8 p.m. est.\n\nin this special debate edition of trail markers, the cbs news political unit gives a rundown of what to watch from each presidential candidate as well as other political news of the day.\n\nfrom the candidates\n\njoe biden\n\nvia cbs new campaign reporter bo erickson: five days after the iowa caucuses, both advisers and top allies of joe biden are hoping the campaign can regain its breath after their 4th-place finish, which the candidate called a gut punch. while many attendees at biden's new hampshire events this week say they are not considering iowa's results in their voting decision, several of them on tuesday told cbs news they were underwhelmed by biden's first day back in the granite state. i expected a little bit more energy, shaun mcgahey, 35, from pembroke, said standing on the rope line with her two kids in concord. it wasn't every 30 seconds you are getting interrupting to cheer for what he said.\n\nbiden and his advisers retooled his message on wednesday and threw a few punches of his own by questioning the records of rivals bernie sanders and pete buttigieg. these weren't new criticisms but, with the assistance of a teleprompter, it was the first time biden's critiques of his rivals were the main thrust of his pitch. sanders, according to biden, is too far left and will sink fellow democratic candidates nationwide with his democratic socialist label. buttigieg is too green, biden argued, stating his mayoral experience does not fit the challenges awaiting a post-maga administration.\n\non thursday, biden spent the day preparing for the debate in delaware, according to a source. when disagreements broke out on previous debate stages, biden sometimes physically stepped back from his podium — a sign that he was steering clear of dueling rivals. but does biden now feel like he needs to be in every fight? and what about elizabeth warren, who like buttigieg has previously criticized biden's long record in washington. as he did with buttigieg, will biden demand to know if warren thinks the obama administration was a failure?\n\npete buttigieg\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter jack turman: former south bend mayor pete buttigieg had a strong performance in the iowa caucuses. while the iowa democratic party has had major issues with reporting the results, buttigieg has been campaigning in new hampshire and said on tuesday, before the final returns were in, that his campaign had an astonishing victory in iowa. while cbs news has not declared a winner of the iowa caucuses, it appears that buttigieg, who has campaigned as an alternative to some of his more moderate competitors, will finish ahead of former vice president joe biden and minnesota senator amy klobuchar.\n\non friday, bernie sanders criticized buttigieg for taking money from billionaires. buttigieg has held the kind of high-dollar fundraisers that sanders and elizabeth warren have both sworn off. will sanders continue to push buttigieg on receiving money from billionaires? with buttigieg coming out of iowa ahead of biden and klobuchar, will the more moderate candidates criticize the . millennial former mayor's lack of washington experience? and with sanders and buttigieg both coming out of iowa declaring victory, how will buttigieg use the debate to continue momentum and convince undecided voters?\n\namy klobuchar\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson: whether it was complimenting stacey abrams while debating in georgia or her staying on a jobs-focused message in ohio, amy klobuchar has repeatedly connected what she says in the debates to the place in which the debate is being held. that could help her during friday's debate in new hampshire, which comes just days before the state's primary.\n\nseveral klobuchar allies told cbs news they still see the senator in introduction mode with many democratic voters. her campaign says she surged in iowa, although she landed in fifth place only a few points behind joe biden.\n\nfor almost the whole campaign klobuchar has delicately run against biden, usually only mentioning the former vice president when asked. but before the official results even began to trickle out, klobuchar's campaign manager tweeted that she beat biden in iowa.\n\nwith a little more heat, could she pick off the former vice president in new hampshire? she's made the generational argument and criticized biden's 2002 vote for the iraq war. or will she get more bang from bashing buttigieg? in previous debates, klobuchar has repeatedly discussed the mayor's limited resumé.\n\nbarring a dismal finish in new hampshire on tuesday, the minnesota senator's campaign is set to march into the new early states where they have dispatched additional staff. senior advisers say the campaign's frugalness puts them in position to compete comfortably through south carolina.\n\nbernie sanders\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter cara korte: two candidates are claiming they won the iowa caucuses, and neither will be standing center stage tonight.\n\nwhat does that mean? perhaps it means that there's going to be a lot of crossfire friday evening. who's on top? who's trying to scratch back? what we know about bernie sanders is that his campaign is in an upswing. while other candidates are cutting staff and pulling advertising in early states, sanders just doubled down with a $5.5 million ad buy in super tuesday states. his campaign also just had its strongest fundraising month to date with $25 million raised in january.\n\nsanders says he won in iowa so that naturally puts him at odds with pete buttigieg, who gave a victory speech the night of the caucuses. campaigning friday morning in new hampshire, sanders took a swing at the former mayor. i like pete buttigieg, nice guy. but we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life, said sanders.\n\nsanders criticism of buttgieg came alongside some harsh words for another former mayor, mike bloomberg. sanders also called bloomberg a nice guy but told the crowd that the new yorker is spending millions to buy the election. he added, there's something wrong with that…but we are in a moment where billionaires control not only the economic but political life of this country.\n\nat the same event friday, sanders evoked the woody guthrie song which side are you? – an old union tune. (we heard sanders make the same reference when he was in guthrie's home state of oklahoma last september at a rally with 4,000 supporters.) sanders then posed the question to the crowd in new hampshire: which side are you on? the side of the working class who have been ignored by politicians for decades? or, in sanders' telling, the side of the billionaires running corrupt industries and controlling this country?\n\nsanders is portraying himself as the standard-bearer of one side while trying to make pete buttigieg the representative of the other. will voters agree with that assessment of the race?\n\ntom steyer\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak: while most candidates headed to new hampshire early in the morning after the iowa caucus, tom steyer prepared to go to nevada. steyer's campaign has made no secret of the fact they see nevada and south carolina as the early states where he could thrive. but the billionaire candidate made it known thursday he was ready to brawl with an ad running in new hampshire that took aim at buttigieg, biden and socialists.\n\nfor steyer, a major surprise in new hampshire is unlikely. but with nevada around the corner, he could use anything even resembling an upset, and his ad strongly signals he is looking to make a case for himself over one of the major contenders on stage. if so, the only question is who—between biden, buttigieg or sanders—steyer will go after tonight.\n\nelizabeth warren\n\nvia cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak: elizabeth warren needs to turn things around after iowa, and the new hampshire debate will be a major opportunity for her to do so. the massachusetts senator has four days to shore up support in her neighboring state, where a cbs news poll a month ago and another poll thursday put her in third place.\n\nwarren's third-place finish in iowa was a hit to a campaign that had invested heavily in the state from the start. it's left her at the margins of the conversation as buttigieg, biden and sanders have taken swings at one another over the past few days. warren's campaign has touted its more than 1,000 staffers across the country as an example how they plan. but without momentum out of new hampshire, warren, who has sworn off large-dollar fundraisers, could have trouble raising money from the grassroots donors who have propelled her campaign so far.\n\nwarren has generally avoided conflict with other candidates, at least publicly, but that may change tonight. there are several contrasts she has subtly made with her fellow progressive sanders, who leads in the state. for example, has put a price tag and a payment plan on her medicare for all proposal, while he has not. the stakes haven't been higher, so will warren concentrate her fire sanders?\n\nandrew yang\n\nvia cbs news political unit associate producer ben mitchell: andrew yang has long made new hampshire the focal point of his candidacy and good reason: the state's high percentage of independents and its libertarian streak are a good match for his policies and his outsider campaign.\n\nfriday's debate, however, is likely his last chance to break out. support for yang remains mired in the low single-digits in the latest new hampshire polls while his campaign appears to be struggling everywhere else. yang invested heavily in iowa, spending 20 days in january crossing the state and holding 76 events in the run up to the caucus. despite all his time and a nearly $7 million investment in tv ads, yang placed a distant sixth and netted just 1% of sdes. now, after spending millions more than he raised in q4, yang is laying off dozens of staffers across the early states. without a strong showing tonight to boost his fundraising and an even stronger showing in tuesday's primary, yang's days could be numbered.\n\ntechnical difficulties\n\napp-rehensive\n\na spokeswoman for the nevada state democratic party said friday that no mobile apps will be involved in their upcoming caucuses, following the party's decision to scrap their reliance on a software developer at the heart of the days-long delay in iowa's results. the party says they are still testing our process before early voting is scheduled to kick off in the state next week.\n\ninternally, multiple democrats in nevada tell cbs news campaign reporter alex tin the party has floated the use of an unspecified tool to assist in reporting results on the day of the caucus, to be showcased at volunteer summits in the state this weekend. aides to multiple campaigns say they have heard few details about the tool, though the party insists they have remained in constant contact with campaigns in the state. it's disappointing that campaigns aren't being given a seat at the table to help ensure what happens in iowa doesn't repeat, said one democratic campaign on friday.\n\nin a statement to cbs news, spokesperson molly forgey said that the state party has maintained a high level of communication with the campaigns.\n\nour main objective is running the most expansive, transparent, and accessible caucus that ensures nevadans voices are heard, forgey said. we've maintained a high level of communication with campaigns at every step of the way and that will never change.\n\nmoney matters\n\non the $$$\n\ntwo of the democrats' largest super pacs, priorities usa action and senate majority pac, are teaming up to run a new multimillion dollar digital ad campaign focused on battleground senate races in arizona, maine and north carolina, following republicans' votes to acquit president trump, reports cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice. senators martha mcsally, susan collins and thom tillis all found the president not guilty on articles of obstruction of congress and abuse of power. all three also happen to be facing tough re-elections in their home states.\n\nmcsally and collins were both outraised by democratic opponents in the fourth quarter of 2019. tillis is also facing a serious challenge. just winning the white house wouldn't be enough. if we want to enact real change in this country, we need a democratic senate, said priorities usa action's executive director patrick mchugh of the partnership.\n\nby exonerating president trump without securing a fair trial, senate republicans have ignored the rule of law and the will of the american people. our new digital partnership with priorities will allow us to hold senate republicans accountable by aggressively targeting voters in battleground states that are key to flipping the senate, added senate majority pac president j.b. poersch in a statement. priorities usa action and senate majority pac's partnership to further help their opponents comes after the two pacs also ran a $30 million digital campaign across eight senate races in 2018.\n\nlife after 2020\n\njoe walsh\n\none of the republican challengers to mr. trump suspended his long-shot bid on friday ahead of new hampshire's primary, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. former congressman and radio personality joe walsh announced on twitter the suspension of his campaign. he began his bid in august but failed to gain traction in terms of polling and fundraising. he also has not qualified to be on the ballot in many states for the primaries. in his suspension announcement, he said he would stay committed to defeating mr. trump in november. former governor bill weld is now the only national challenger remaining in the gop primary.
the following is a transcript of an interview with sen. bernie sanders that aired sunday, march 1, 2020, on face the nation.\n\n\n\nmargaret brennan: we turn now to senator bernie sanders. he is on the campaign trail in norfolk, virginia. good morning to you, senator.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: is this now a two man race?\n\nsen. sanders: well, all i can say is we have won the popular vote in iowa. we won the new hampshire primary. we won the nevada caucus. we lost last night. we're looking forward to super tuesday. i think we've got a great chance to win in california, in texas, in massachusetts and a number of states around the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: south carolina is the first southern state. does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like virginia and- and north carolina? will joe biden really challenge you there?\n\nsen. sanders: well, we're going to see. i mean, i think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in virginia. i think we've got a shot in north carolina. all i can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. those are ideas, margaret, that i think are resonating all across this country. i think we have an excellent chance to do well on tuesday and to win the democratic nomination.\n\nmargaret brennan: joe biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. we know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in february. that's a significant number. what do you think that does for you going into super tuesday? what edge?\n\nsen. sanders: well, margaret, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. we don't have a super pac like joe biden. i don't go to rich people's homes like joe biden. i think joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. what we have done is received more campaign contributions from more americans than any candidate in the history of the united states, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. this is a campaign of working people and by working people. and i'm extraordinarily proud of that. but we have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.\n\nmargaret brennan: your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that michael bloomberg has offered. he said he'd extend it to any party nominee. do you really want to turn down his bankroll?\n\nsen. sanders: well, look, mr. bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his 60 billion dollars, and that's legal. all i can say is at this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. look, one of the things that upsets people--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you would accept it?\n\nsen. sanders: --whether conservative or progressive, is- i didn't say that. what i would say--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsen. sanders:-- is that he has the right to do anything he wants. right now, we are confident, margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you are a democratic socialist. you have never officially entered the democratic party. in fact, you constantly criticize democratic establishment. so how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify democrats and challenge president trump?\n\nsen. sanders: well, two points. i'm a member of the democratic leadership. i've been in the democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of vermont, where i live, i am supported by democrats and have won the democratic primary. but we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to democrats, and to more than a few republicans. look, we are living at a time when the american people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in america. all over this country, margaret, and i have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. they can't afford childcare. they can't afford healthcare. they're scared to death about their retirement. they want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. that's how you win. you put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. that is what we're doing. no campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. that's how you beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsen. sanders: we're beating them in battleground states like pennsylvania, wisconsin and michigan. we can beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: you have rallies planned out in california. there is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the west coast. is it safe for you? have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?\n\nsen. sanders: well, actually, we have. i mean, that's a very fair question. and my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. and right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in california, but in utah, minnesota and other states around the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the un says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?\n\nsen. sanders: yeah, i do. i mean, they have a lot of money. they have a lot of power. look, i'm jewish and i'm very proud of my jewish heritage. as a kid, i spent time in israel. i am not in- anti-israel. i will do everything i can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the israeli people. but what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects israel, but deals with the suffering of the palestinian people as well. you've got 70 percent youth unemployment in gaza. people can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. it is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the middle east until the united states develops an even handed policy.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsen. sanders: so, i am pro-israel. i am pro-palestinian. i want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you on foreign policy. the president just authorized a deal with the taliban. what do you think of that? because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of u.s. troops.\n\nsen. sanders: well, i don't have enough details and the- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the afghan government. we don't know what's going to happen. one of the difficulties, to be very honest, margaret, in dealing with trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in afghanistan. but it is my view that the united states and i- i speak as somebody who helped lead the opposition to getting us into the war in iraq. it is my view that we've got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in america sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care, we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. senator sanders, thank you for joining us.
as average temperatures rise across the planet, the frozen arctic is heating up faster than anywhere else.\n\nwith that warmth comes a surprising twist: unusually warm arctic winter temperatures are linked to bitter cold and snow in other parts of the northern hemisphere, such as the northeastern u.s., parts of northern europe and northern asia, according to an analysis of 66 years' worth of climate data.\n\nand the relationship between arctic warmth and severe winter weather was strongest in in the northeastern u.s. -- in fact, a temperature spike in the arctic meant that the u.s. northeast was two to four times more likely than usual to experience a bout of extreme winter weather, the scientists reported in a new study. [the 10 worst blizzards in u.s. history]\n\npast climate projections predicted that, in a warming world, winters would be the seasons to heat up the fastest -- and yet recent winters in the northern hemisphere were more severe than scientists anticipated, said judah cohen, the study's lead author and director of seasonal forecasting at atmospheric and environmental research, an organization that assesses risks from weather events and climate change.\n\nto understand what might be driving these unusual episodes, cohen and his colleagues looked at pulses of warmth in the arctic during winter months, to see how they lined up against weather anomalies elsewhere in the globe.\n\nwhen the arctic pulse is warm, you tend to get an increase in occurrences of extreme winter weather across the midlatitudes, including the eastern u.s., northern europe and northern asia, cohen told live science.\n\nthe relationship between spiking arctic warmth and pockets of cold to the south was really, really strong -- and it was strongest in the eastern u.s., cohen said.\n\nsince 1990, the eastern u.s. has been visited by winter storms so severe that they earned highly dramatic nicknames, such as snowzilla, snowmaggeddon and snowpocalypse. the increase in incidences of extreme storms with heavy snowfall corresponded with periods of excessive arctic warmth, the study authors wrote.\n\ndisruption comes in waves\n\nhow does this relationship work? as the scientists' observations reflected only the comparison of weather patterns over time -- and not what was driving them -- the researchers could not conclude that a warmer arctic was directly responsible for harsh winter storms in the u.s., they reported in the study.\n\nbut answers may lie in another atmospheric disturbance linked to a warming arctic, cohen said.\n\naccording to the study, data from past decades showed that fall snow cover in siberia increased as the arctic warmed, which cooled northeastern eurasia. meanwhile, melting sea ice fueled warmer temperatures in northwestern eurasia.\n\nthese air-temperature changes close to the surface led to similar changes higher up in the atmosphere. this, in turn, affected the jet stream -- a conveyor belt of wind that carries warm air and moisture around the globe -- by increasing its waviness, making jetstream waves dive farther south and stretch farther to the north. in turn, this extra amplification can alter the movement of cold air masses near the pole, otherwise known as the polar vortex, cohen explained.\n\nand this disturbance of the polar vortex could end up shaping conditions that worsen winter weather in the u.s.\n\nthe cold air that's normally confined to the arctic, it's kind of dammed in by the polar vortex itself -- because winds normally blow from west to east inside the polar vortex, so it acts as barrier, keeps the cold air to the north and the mild air to the south, cohen said. when it breaks down, the cold air that's penned up in the arctic spills to lower latitudes, and that's when you get those episodes of severe winter weather.\n\narctic scientists like to say that what happens in the arctic doesn't stay in the arctic, but the interconnectivity between earth's dynamic atmospheric systems is no laughing matter, cohen said. the complexity of these systems is reflected in emerging disruptions that are likely the products of climate change, though there is still much to be learned about how climate change could shape weather patterns around the world, the study authors reported.\n\ni'd argue that our expectations for climate change were overly simplistic, cohen said. it was kind of expected that if you warm the arctic, the only thing that's going to lead to is just milder temperatures everywhere -- and that's not a complete picture.\n\nthe findings were published online today (march 13) in the journal nature communications.\n\noriginal article on live science.
philadelphia -- another snowy, windy nor'easter threatened a new round of power outages wednesday, causing officials in some areas to close schools and government offices and raising concerns for utility customers still trying to bounce back from a deadly nor'easter last week. the national weather service issued a winter storm warning that stretched from eastern pennsylvania to most of new england, from late tuesday night into thursday morning. by thursday evening, it said, snow accumulations could easily surpass a foot in areas west of the i-95 corridor.\n\na wintry mix of snow and light rain started falling early wednesday in many areas, but the precipitation was expected to soon turn to all snow in most areas and then continue through the day. cbs has complete live coverage of today's winter storm all day.\n\nheavy, wet snow and gusting winds could take down trees already weakened from last week's storm and snap power lines, adding to stress for customers who've gone days without power.\n\ncbs news weather producer david parkinson notes that this type of snow is sometimes referred to as heart attacks snow, since it's so difficult to shovel.\n\nas of wednesday morning, some 104,000 homes and businesses remained in the dark from the previous storm.\n\nutility workers took advantage of milder temperatures and sunshine tuesday in their scramble to restore electricity to thousands of customers around the northeast.\n\nthe outages turned to outrage for a new jersey man whose home had been without electricity since friday. robert winter, 63, threatened to kidnap a utility company employee and blow up a substation, according to police in vernon. he was charged with making terroristic threats.\n\nmore than a foot of snow is expected for some interior areas, the weather service said. pennsylvania's poconos mountains and parts of western massachusetts could see up to 18 inches.\n\nwinter storm warnings & advisories remain in effect across much of the region. snow this morning will mix with/change to rain at times across parts of li & far se ct, especially this afternoon. elsewhere, heavy snow is expected at times from late morning through the afternoon. pic.twitter.com/5kfnjpufsn — nws new york ny (@nwsnewyorkny) march 7, 2018\n\ndamaging winds are forecast with gusts of up to 60 mph on cape cod, 45 mph at the jersey shore and 30 mph around suburban philadelphia.\n\ndepending on the storm's track, communities along the interstate 95 corridor could see heavy rain, heavy snow or a mix of both.\n\ntransportation departments in philadelphia and boston loaded up salt trucks and treated roads tuesday, and some airlines waived ticket change fees for airports in the storm's projected path, such as newark, philadelphia, boston and new york's jfk.\n\nflightaware.com said that, as of 6:20 am est, carriers had canceled 1,938 flights in the u.s. for wednesday and 187 for thursday.\n\namtrak canceled some train service wednesday, and regional rail trains in philadelphia will be operating on a weekend schedule.\n\nschool districts and municipal operations around pennsylvania and connecticut said they would close for the day. new jersey gov. phil murphy and pennsylvania gov. tom wolf declared states of emergency.\n\nthe national weather service urged people to stay off the roads to allow emergency and road crews to do their jobs. some areas will get as much as 2 to 3 inches of snow an hour. officials advised homeowners to be careful while shoveling, saying the weight of it has been known cause heart attacks.\n\na slight consolation is that the storm is not expected to bring the coastal flooding like the one last week. some new england and new jersey communities are still feeling the effects of that storm.\n\nnonetheless, flooding was a concern.
the group that manages the michigan state capitol building banned the open carry of firearms inside of the building on monday. michigan was one of just a handful of states that allowed people to openly carry guns in the state capitol.\n\nin a unanimous vote, the michigan capitol commission passed a motion that bans openly carrying weapons in the building, except for law enforcement officers, and still allows open carry on the grounds surrounding the capitol. people who have a concealed pistol license can carry concealed weapons in the building.\n\nsome of michigan's top democrats are calling for further action, but commissioners said the open carry ban was as far as they could go.\n\nwe determined that the extreme limit of our real authority to actually implement something was to implement a ban on open carry, commissioner william kandler said. we have no authority to implement the infrastructure to go beyond that at this point. we have no budget to do it. we're not experts in security.\n\na militia group with no political affiliation from michigan stands in front of the governors office after protesters occupied the state capitol building during a vote to approve the extension of governor gretchen whitmer's emergency declaration/stay-at-home order due to the coronavirus outbreak, at the state capitol in lansing, michigan, on april 30, 2020. seth herald / reuters\n\nthe commission had been studying the issue for several months. the policy change came several days after pro-trump supporters attacked the united states capitol. john trustcott, vice-chair of the michigan capitol commission, said commissioners were going to address the issue later this month, but moved it up because of what happened in washington last week. truscott added that senate majority leader mike shirkey throwing his support behind an open carry ban last week helped the commission decide to take up the issue.\n\nthe majority leader respects the decision by the capitol commission and supports the ban on open carry inside the capitol, said amber mccann, a spokeswoman for shirkey.\n\nmichigan's rules about guns in the capitol drew national attention in april when armed protesters were in the senate gallery while the legislature was considering whether to extend michigan's covid-19 restrictions.\n\naccording to the michigan advance, nine other states allow both open and concealed carry of weapons in their state capitol buildings. michigan was one of only three states that lack related security measures of any kind, such as metal detectors.\n\nnine additional states have some restrictions on weapons, most of which only allow concealed carry. thirty-one states prohibit firearms in their state capitol buildings.\n\ndespite the open carry ban, some michigan democrats said the ruling does not go far enough and called for prohibiting all firearms in the capitol. gov. gretchen whitmer said the open carry ban is a good start, but more action is needed.\n\non a normal day, hundreds of people walk through the capitol, including groups of fourth graders, teachers, and parents on school field trips to learn about state government. that's why we must take action to ban all weapons at the capitol to keep michiganders safe, whitmer said in a statement.\n\nmichigan's democratic attorney general dana nessel wrote a legal opinion in may 2020 saying he commission could ban guns at the state capitol. in a statement on monday, nessel urged commissioners or the michigan legislature to take further action.\n\nfirearms – whether explicitly visible or concealed by clothing — possess the same capability to inflict injury and harm on others and only banning open carry does little to meaningfully improve the safety and security of our capitol, nessel said.\n\nwhile shirkey supports the open carry ban, michigan's incoming house speaker, jason wentworth, said in a statement that the capitol commission does not have the authority to set policy in the capitol and will look to address that moving forward. wentworth acknowledged that the michigan state police will be enforcing the rule and urged people to respect the michigan state police and the rules they enforce.\n\nseveral incidents over the past year, including armed protests over the covid-19 restrictions and the 2020 election, have raised questions about security among some michigan lawmakers. cbs news has confirmed that the fbi sent out an alert to law enforcement across the country warning that groups are calling for the storming of government buildings in all 50 states if president trump is removed from office prior to inauguration day.\n\nin addition to the armed protesters at the michigan senate in the spring, federal and state law enforcement officials announced in october that they foiled a plot to kidnap governor gretchen whitmer and to attack the state capitol and kidnap other government officials.\n\nthe michigan capitol was closed for a few hours on january 7, the day after the assault on the u.s. capitol, due to a bomb threat. a suspect was charged friday with calling in the threat. he also made threats against a michigan democratic state lawmaker in december, according to a complaint released by the michigan attorney general's office.\n\nstate senator dayna polehanki posted the picture last april of armed men in the senate gallery. she recently tweeted a photo of a helmet, gas mask and pepper spray that she plans to keep under her desk.\n\ncommissioners said they don't have the authority to enact more strict firearm bans, but polehanki disagreed and said they should have gone further.\n\nwhat they're saying is guns are still welcome, we just don't want to see them, polehanki said. it sends a false message that you're safe here.
sanders says he'll have more than enough mon...\n\nsanders says he'll have more than enough money to beat trump\n\nsanders says he'll have more than enough money to beat trump\n\nsenator bernie sanders' campaign announced sunday it raised $46.5 million in february, the most of any democratic presidential candidate in a given month in the 2020 election cycle. the figure shatters the previous monthly record of $25 million, set by the sanders campaign in january.\n\naccording to the campaign, the cash haul came from more than 2.2 million donations, including contributions from more than 350,000 donors who were giving to the campaign for the first time. the vermont senator's fundraising efforts were fueled by victories in the early primary states of new hampshire and nevada, and a first-place finish in the popular vote in iowa.\n\nsenator elizabeth warren also announced her february fundraising numbers on sunday, saying she pulled in $29 million, a record for her campaign.\n\nsince february 2019, sanders has raised more than $167 million from 1.9 million people who made 8.7 million contributions, surpassing the total number of individual contributions given to sanders' 2016 presidential bid. about $4.5 million poured in on saturday, the final day of february, making it his single best fundraising day to date even as he came in second to joe biden in the south carolina primary.\n\nin an interview on face the nation on sunday, sanders said his fundraising prowess gives him the edge over his democratic rivals and would allow him to compete against president trump in the general election.\n\nwe have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday but to take us through the entire process, fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country, sanders said.\n\nthe campaign said 99.9% of sanders' donors have not reached the federal limit on individual contributions, meaning they can give again. the average donation in february was $21.\n\nthe senator's multigenerational, multiracial working class coalition keeps fueling his campaign for transformational change a few bucks at a time, campaign manager faiz shakir said in a statement. we're especially proud that of the more than 2 million donations we received this month, over 1.4 million were from voters in states that vote on super tuesday.\n\nalong with announcing its record cash haul, sanders' campaign also said it would begin buying television ads in nine states with primary contests on march 10 and 17, including idaho, michigan, mississippi, missouri, washington, arizona, florida, illinois and ohio.\n\naccording to kantar/campaign media analysis group, sanders is second only to michael bloomberg in spending on tv and radio ads in super tuesday states. the group has tracked more than $16 million in ad spending in those states heading into the march 3 contests. sanders' campaign said it's currently on the air in 12 out of the 14 states voting that day.\n\nwarren's campaign said it raised $2.8 million of her $29 million total on the day of warren's well-received debate performance in nevada on february 19.\n\naccording to warren campaign manager roger lau, 250,000 people donated for the first time in february, bringing the campaign's total number of donors since its launch to more than 1.25 million. the average february donation was $31.\n\nwarren's campaign also said it was increasing its super tuesday ad spending to $2.4 million. the campaign invested more than $4.1 million in media in every state that votes later in march and wisconsin, which votes april 7, as well as a $700,000 in radio, print and mail to key constituencies across march voting states.\n\nmeanwhile, joe biden's campaign said it raised $5 million on saturday as the former vice president won south carolina, eliciting contributions from tens of thousands of new supporters. biden has not yet released his fundraising numbers for the entire month.\n\npresidential candidates have a deadline of march 20 to file fundraising and spending reports with the federal election commission.
this year's april 18 deadline to file your 2016 federal tax returns is coming up fast. if you've waited until now to work on your taxes, you're probably scrambling to finish. but before you file, check this list to ensure you don't make some common mistakes.\n\nmake sure all social security numbers included on your return are correct.\n\nif your refund will be automatically deposited, double-check the bank account information (bank name, type of account, routing number and account number).\n\nif you owe tax, you can have that amount automatically debited from a bank account. in addition to double-checking the bank account information, make sure to specify a date for the debit that's no later than april 18, the last day you can pay what you owe without incurring additional interest and penalties.\n\nif you're paying a tax owed by check, don't attach it to your tax return. mail it (payable to united states treasury) in a separate envelope with a form 1040-v payment voucher and send it to the appropriate irs address. the mailed payment must be postmarked no later than april 18 to avoid any additional interest and penalties.\n\nif you've been covered by a health insurance plan for all of 2016, make sure to check the box for full-year coverage on line 61 of form 1040 (or line 38 of form 1040a and line 11 of form 1040ez.) if you don't, you'll receive a notice from the irs saying you owe a penalty of up to $695 per adult and $347.50 per child for not having health insurance as required under the affordable care act.\n\nif filing paper tax returns, you must sign and date your returns. both spouses must sign a joint return, even if only one spouse had income to report. also, use the bar-coded envelopes and labels provided by the irs.\n\nwhen you file a paper return, you'll also need to attach the irs-required copies of w-2s, 1099s, etc., which include the federal taxes withheld from the income.\n\nif you've moved since filing your last return, you must notify the irs. just using your new address on your 2016 tax return isn't enough. you should also include a completed form 8822, change of address with your 2016 return. this ensures the irs is notified to update its records for sending future notices.\n\nif you're claiming an adjustment for a contribution to an ira or a retirement plan such as a solo 401(k) plan or a sep ira, you must deposit the contribution to that account no later than the date you file your tax return.\n\neven if you're not required to file a return, there may be a good reason to do so. in certain situations -- such as if you're eligible for the earned income tax credit -- you can get a tax refund that's more than the taxes withheld from your earnings. but to claim these credits, you must file a tax return.\n\nfinally, if you don't have time to file your return by the april 18 deadline, you should file a form 4868, application for automatic extension for time to file. in a few days, i'll walk through the steps involved to do that.
moscow -- a dubai airliner with 62 people on board nosedived and exploded in a giant fireball early saturday while trying to land in strong winds in the southern russian city of rostov-on-don, killing all aboard, officials said.\n\nrussia's emergencies ministry said the boeing 737-800 operated by flydubai was carrying 55 passengers, most of them russians, and seven crew members of various nationalities. flydubai confirmed that there were no survivors and said four children were among those killed.\n\nthe powerful explosion pulverized the plane into fragments, but investigators quickly recovered both flight recorders. the cause of the crash wasn't immediately known, but officials and experts suggested a sudden gust of wind could have been a possible reason.\n\ncbs news transportation correspondent kris van cleave reports that other potential causes being looked at are pilot error and a technical failure.\n\nour primary concern is for the families of the passengers and crew who were on board. everyone at flydubai is in deep shock and our hearts go out to the families and friends of those involved, said ceo ghaith al-ghaith.\n\nemergencies ministry members search the wreckage at the crash site of flight 981, a boeing 737-800 operated by dubai-based budget carrier flydubai, at the airport of rostov-on-don, russia, march 19, 2016. reuters/stringer\n\nvasily golubev, the governor of the rostov region some 600 miles south of moscow, was quoted by russian news agencies as telling local journalists that the plane crashed about 800 feet short of the runway.\n\nthe cause of the crash was not immediately determined, but golubev said: by all appearances, the cause of the air crash was the strongly gusting wind, approaching a hurricane level.\n\nrussian investigators said they were looking into adverse weather and a possible pilot error as the most likely causes of the crash.\n\naccording to the weather data reported by russian state television, winds at the moment of the crash at an altitude of 1,640 feet and higher were around 67 miles per hour.\n\nian petchenik, a spokesman for the flight-tracking website flightradar24, told the associated press that the plane missed its approach then entered a holding pattern.\n\naccording to flightradar24, the plane circled for about two hours before making another attempt to land. it said a russian aeroflot plane scheduled to land around the same time made three landing attempts but then diverted to another airport.\n\naccording to its data, the dubai plane began climbing again after a go-around when it suddenly started to fall with vertical speed of up to 21,000 feet per minute.\n\nthe closed-circuit tv footage showed the plane going down in a steep angle and exploding in a huge fireball that lit up the night sky.\n\nsome russian aviation experts said the steep descent appeared to indicate that the crash most probably have been caused by a gust of wind.\n\nit was an uncontrollable fall, said sergei kruglikov, a veteran russian pilot, said on russian state television. he said that a sudden change in wind speed and direction could have caused the wings to abruptly lose their lifting power.\n\nseveral planes had landed in rostov-on-don shortly before the dubai airliner was scheduled to touch down, but other flights later were diverted.\n\nanother seasoned pilot, viktor zabolotsky, said a gust of wind probably caused the airliner to lose speed and crash as the pilot was making an attempt to go round.\n\npresident vladimir putin offered his condolences to the victims' families and top russian cabinet officials flew to the crash site to oversee the investigation.\n\nofficials said the plane and bodies of the victims were torn into small pieces by the powerful blast, but investigators already have found the plane's cockpit conversation recorder and another one recording parameters of the flight.\n\nit was flydubai's first crash since the budget carrier began operating in 2009. it was launched in 2008 by the government of dubai, the gulf commercial hub that is part of the seven-state united arab emirates federation. the carrier has been flying to rostov-on-don since 2013.\n\nthe airline shares a chairman with dubai's government-backed emirates, the middle east's biggest airline, though the two carriers operate independently and maintain separate operations from their bases at dubai international airport, the region's busiest airport.\n\nflydubai's fleet consisted of relatively young 737-800 aircraft, like the one that crashed. the airline says it operates more than 1,400 flights a week.\n\nthe airline has expanded rapidly in russia and other parts of the former soviet union. dubai is a popular tourist destination for russian visitors, who are attracted by its beaches, shopping malls and year-round sunshine. many russian expatriates live and work in dubai, a city where foreigners outnumber locals more than 4-to-1.\n\nflydubai has a good safety record. in january 2015, one of its planes was struck on the fuselage by what appeared to small-arms fire shortly before it landed in baghdad. that flight landed safely with no major injuries reported.
new york -- bad mortgages to buyers who couldn't afford them put the u.s. on the road to the great recession. so cbs news was curious when we saw an ad during the super bowl for an eight-minute mortgage.\n\nquicken loans' super bowl ad made a simple proposition.\n\nwhat if we did for mortgages what the internet did for buying music and plane tickets and shoes, the voice-over in the advertisement said.\n\nthat's what they're offering with rocket mortgages.\n\nbut just seven years after the housing crisis nearly took down the economy, the ad rang alarm bells.\n\nlet's do the financial crisis again, but with apps, dave weigel of the washington post tweeted.\n\nrocket mortgage: let's do the financial crisis again, but with apps! — daveweigel (@daveweigel) february 8, 2016\n\nholden lewis with bankrate.com said the median credit score of a mortgage applicant is now 753 (out of 850) the highest since 2001. rocket mortgage is just trying to streamline the application process.\n\ni know that a lot of people interpreted the commercial as saying we're going back to the days of easy money, but that's just simply not happening, said lewis. i think it's a game changer, in a sense that other mortgage companies are going to have to make it easier to put in your documentation and your paperwork.\n\non the rocket app, you enter income and bank details, which allows quicken to communicate directly with banks. it estimates an affordable home price and costs and allows customers to lock in a rate, said quicken president jay farner.\n\nif you go to rocket mortgage, you can see the interest rates, you can see the fees, he said. you can see how changing the interest rates would change your fees.\n\nso this is not about changing credit standards?\n\nno. again, quicken loans is known for having some of the highest credit standards in the country, farner said.\n\nrocket, he said, is trying to take the mystery out of the mortgage process.\n\nthe ad certainly got attention. farner said that 14,000 people visited their website in the first minute it aired.
new york - new year, same old problems for yahoo (yhoo).\n\na major shareholder in the beleaguered internet company, activist investor starboard value, is demanding that yahoo overhaul its leadership in a bid to energize growth.\n\nin a letter to yahoo's board, ceo marissa mayer and chairman maynard webb, starboard criticized the company's performance, saying that the management team hired to turn around the core business has failed to produce acceptable results.\n\nyahoo's current management has had over three years to demonstrate progress towards improving the core business, but despite these efforts, the core business continues to be plagued with deteriorating financial performance and an accelerating number of executive leadership departures, starboard managing member jeffrey smith said in the letter.\n\nmayer became ceo of yahoo in 2012 and maynard webb became chairman in 2013.\n\nstarboard said that if a change is not made, an election may be needed to replace some members of the board.\n\nstarboard said it thinks yahoo can improve the performance of the core business and separate its assets, but that it will require a change in leadership and strategy.
why did the president help incite the riot that killed five people at the capitol? it may be because, four days earlier, he failed to get the state of georgia to take away joe biden's victory. a week ago, saturday, georgia's top election official, secretary of state brad raffensperger spent an hour on the phone listening to the president lie and threaten. mr. trump spun tales of fraud and told raffensperger he needed to find 11,780 votes. one more vote than biden's winning margin in the state. raffensperger is a life-long republican, voted for mr. trump and contributed to his campaign. but facing the president's wrath he would not choose loyalty over duty.\n\nbrad raffensperger: i believe i said, well, mr. president, the challenge that you have is that you have bad data. our data shows that you did not win the race. because we have the facts, and the facts are on our side.\n\nbrad raffensperger had declined to take the president's call. the trump campaign was suing georgia officials and raffensperger felt the call was inappropriate. but the white house kept insisting.\n\nbrad raffensperger\n\nmark meadows on white house call: ok, all right. so - mr. president everybody is on the line...\n\nit was about three in the afternoon, saturday, january 2, when white house chief of staff mark meadows started the conference call introducing mr. trump's lawyers, an attorney for the state of georgia, ryan germany, and secretary of state raffensperger.\n\nscott pelley: did you know that the call was being recorded?\n\nbrad raffensperger: no.\n\nmark meadows on white house call: so, mr. president i'll turn it over to you.\n\nsomeone gave the recording to the washington post.\n\npresident trump on white house call: ok, thank you very much. hello, brad and ryan and everybody…\n\nfrom the start, the president seemed delusional.\n\npresident trump on white house call: and we won the house, but we won every single statehouse and we won congress.\n\nmr. trump repeated, 30 times, that he won the election. he said he could still win georgia if raffensperger would play along.\n\npresident trump on white house call: so, look. all i want to do is this. i just want to find 11,780 votes.\n\nscott pelley: what was the president asking you to do?\n\nbrad raffensperger: he was asking us to recalibrate or recalculate, i believe it was, recalculate-- somehow get a different answer. but i'm an engineer. and anyone that's good with numbers knows you can calculate all you want, but the numbers are the numbers.\n\npresident trump on white house call: so, what are we going to do here, folks? i only need 11,000 votes. fellas, i need 11,000 votes. give me a break.\n\nscott pelley: but the words used by the president and the president's chief of staff, give me a break, cooperate, compromise, were they asking you to join them in a conspiracy?\n\nbrad raffensperger: i guess maybe they were just trying to intimidate me and-- cajole me into something. it wasn't gonna happen.\n\nwe have learned the call on january 2, was not mr. trump's first attempt. sources tell us that, last month, the president himself phoned one of the georgia secretary of state's investigators. a person briefed on the call said mr. trump told the investigator they would be a national hero if they found evidence of fraud. but no evidence was found that would change the outcome of the election. still, on the call with the georgia secretary of state, mr. trump badgered raffensperger with fantasies of criminality.\n\npresident trump on white house call: the other thing, dead people, so dead people voted. and i think the number is close to 5,000 people.\n\nscott pelley: the president said in the call that 5,000 georgians voted in the name of dead people.\n\nbrad raffensperger: right. well, it was two. two dead--\n\nscott pelley: 2,000?\n\nbrad raffensperger: no, two. yeah.\n\nscott pelley: a total of two?\n\nbrad raffensperger: two people, right. right here, one, two. two dead people, not thousands, not hundreds. two people.\n\nscott pelley: how do you know that?\n\nbrad raffensperger: because we went back and looked at it, and we searched all the death records, and we looked at day, month, year. so we had two people that had passed away and we'll investigate and see if we can find out who those people were that fraudulently voted for those two dead people.\n\nthat is just one of dozens of investigations launched after the election by the georgia secretary of state.\n\nscott pelley: how would you describe the president's claims of vote fraud in georgia?\n\ngabriel sterling: fantastical, unreasonable. lacking in any factual reality.\n\ngabriel sterling\n\ngabriel sterling, also a republican, and a trump voter, is the chief operating officer for the secretary of state. he walked us through surveillance video that the president and his lawyer, rudy giuliani, use as their slam-dunk evidence. here, giuliani is explaining to georgia state senators his selectively edited version of the video.\n\nrudy giuliani to georgia state senators: when you look at what you saw on the video, which to me was a smoking gun, powerful smoking gun, well, i don't have to be a genius to figure out what happened. i don't have to be a genius to figure out that those votes are not legitimate votes.\n\nin national ads, the trump campaign shows just a clip of the video that reveals cases filled with ballots being removed from under a table.\n\ntrump campaign ad: america deserved an honest election. this is what they got: suitcases of ballots added in secret in georgia…\n\ngabriel sterling showed us that rudy giuliani was right, you don't have to be a genius to figure out what happened, when you look at all of the video. sterling says the election workers were told before 10 o'clock election night that they would be going home and would finish the count the next day.\n\ngabriel sterling: it's before 10:00. the observers and the press are still in the room to see all of this occur.\n\nwith republican and democratic observers visible on the video, the still uncounted ballots were placed in official boxes which were labeled, locked with tamper-proof seals and stored below the table.\n\ngabriel sterling: this is where they're packing up because they think they're going home. they're packing up to seal them so that nobody can, you know, mess with the ballots when no one's there.\n\nbut, less than an hour after the boxes were stored, sterling says the staff was told they would have to keep counting through the night. so, the ballots were pulled out and counted. sterling told us president trump's team had always had the entire, unedited, video.\n\ngabriel sterling: from my point of view, they intentionally misled the state senators, the people of georgia, and the people of the united states about this to cause this conspiracy theory to keep going and keep the disinformation going, which has caused this environment that we're seeing today.\n\nscott pelley: are you saying they lied to the--\n\ngabriel sterling: yes.\n\nscott pelley: --georgia state senate?\n\ngabriel sterling: i'm saying that rudy giuliani looked them in the eye and lied.\n\nbrad raffensperger: and rudy giuliani knows that. he also, i believe, you know, he has some ethical standards as a member of the bar. he knows that what he said was not true. but our state senate did not ask us to come in there so that we could rebut what they said. and it was actually left as the gospel truth, and it wasn't. it was fabricated.\n\nin the call, president trump slanders one of the election workers in the video, a woman named ruby freeman, who georgia officials say is not suspected of tampering with anything.\n\npresident trump on white house call: 18,000 voters having to do with ruby freeman. she's a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler, ruby freeman. that was the tape that's been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad.\n\nthe president claimed freeman put the so-called ballots hidden in suitcases through the counter three times resulting in 54,000 bogus votes.\n\npresident trump on white house call: and brad, why did they put the votes in three times? they put them in three times.\n\nbrad raffensperger on white house call: mr. president, they did not put that - we did an audit of that and we proved conclusively (that) they were not scanned three times.\n\nruby freeman is in hiding because of threats – death threats that sterling says other election workers are also receiving.\n\ngabriel sterling: and i finally saw one that s-- said the young man's name. it said, you are a traitor, may god have mercy on your soul. and it had a gif of a noose slowly swinging. at that point i snapped. i essentially lost it and said, this has gotta stop.\n\nsterling news conference: mr. president...\n\nfive weeks ago, gabriel sterling addressed this directly to the president.\n\nsterling news conference: what you don't have the ability to do, and you need to step up and say this, is stop inspiring people to commit potential acts of violence. someone's going to get hurt. someone's going to get shot. someone's going to get killed.\n\nscott pelley: now that we saw the mob attack the capitol, is that what you meant?\n\ngabriel sterling: yes. that's exactly what i meant. and continuing the disinformation and spinning up people's anger while they're emotionally raw, this is exactly what you're going to see.\n\neven raffensperger was threatened by the president who said the georgia secretary of state was culpable in the fantasy fraud.\n\npresident trump on white house call: ...it's more illegal for you than it is for them. because you know what they did and you're not reporting it. that's a criminal, that's a criminal offense. and you know you can't let that happen. that's a big risk to you and to ryan, your lawyer, and that's a big risk.\n\nbrad raffensperger: well, i think it was obviously a veiled threat, maybe a direct threat. but there was no substance to what he was saying.\n\npresident trump on white house call: so tell me, brad, what are we going to do? we won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. and it's going to be very costly in many ways.\n\nscott pelley: when you heard those words, what did you think? very costly?\n\nbrad raffensperger: i heard the threat. i don't know what that meant, exactly, but it wasn't gonna move me off center.\n\npresident trump on white house call: but i mean, all of this stuff is very dangerous stuff. when you talk about no criminality, i think it's very dangerous for you to say that.\n\nscott pelley: the president of the united states is saying, brad, this could be very dangerous for you.\n\nbrad raffensperger: well, really what it did is i think it really revealed for us was his character. and it was just a sad moment to really hear that.\n\nthe president also suggested that someone tampered with georgia's voting machines. but gabriel sterling, the secretary of state's chief operating officer, told us the state hand-counted all of the voting machine's paper ballot receipts.\n\nscott pelley: the state of georgia hand-counted how many ballots?\n\ngabriel sterling: a little over 5 million.\n\nscott pelley: and when you hand-counted the 5 million, how did that compare to what the electronic machines were saying?\n\ngabriel sterling: they came back at 0.1053% off in the total number of ballots, and 0.0099% off the margin, which is incredibly close.\n\nscott pelley: you would consider that to be virtually identical.\n\ngabriel sterling: yes.\n\nscott pelley: i wonder how it feels, trying to push back against the president of the united states, who is making all of these claims.\n\ngabriel sterling: it's like having a shovel in your hand and trying to empty the ocean.\n\nscott pelley: when the president was making his speech on wednesday, inciting that mob in washington, he complained about weak and pathetic republicans.\n\npresident trump on wednesday: no, it's amazing. the weak republicans, they're pathetic republicans…\n\nscott pelley: he was talking about you.\n\nbrad raffensperger: well, i think he was talking about others i think actually i showed that i had some courage, i had some gumption, that i actually would do my job. the ones that kowtow to him, that just bent over and did his bidding, and not looking into the facts, i think that's weakness.\n\nbrad raffensperger told us he didn't see the bloody attack on the capitol when it was happening because at that moment, he was busy sending congress a 10-page point-by-point rebuttal of the president's false claims. he learned later that the members of the house and senate were under attack.\n\nbrad raffensperger: it was surreal. we've never seen anything like that in 150 years, maybe even longer, probably 200 years. it was really an affront to the people that founded this nation. people need to go back and read their history books. you know, we had some great founders. i know they weren't perfect men, but they were great people. they were some of the most learned people we had in our society. and that's the high ideal that we all should kinda elevate ourselves to, to be noble people of high character, and patriotic, and love our country.\n\nproduced by henry

when lakisha williams learned in october that the kmart where she'd worked for four years in oxon hill, maryland, would close early in the new year, she immediately started stocking up on prescription drugs needed by her autistic son. one of the unfortunate things about losing my job is providing for his needs, said williams, whose 10-year-old son, jacquez, requires multiple visits to the doctor each year and whose drug costs aren't covered by medicaid.\n\neverything he needs i got in advance, she said of her efforts to ensure his supply of medications, which now involves pinching pennies and looking for new employment.\n\nbonuses for execs\n\nafter williams and her roughly 100 coworkers learned of their pending layoffs, she also went from working her usual 15-to-30 hours a week to as many as 50 hours, glad for the chance to earn more to prepare for what she's hoping will be a short period without a paycheck.\n\nher store's liquidation sales presented a good opportunity to set some money aside, said williams, who worked her final shift on sunday. right now i'm searching for work, and praying i get something in the next few weeks, added williams, who also has two daughters, one nine, the other 16.\n\nas a part-time worker at kmart, williams didn't expect to get any severance. but she decided to speak out after a bankruptcy court in december allowed sears to dole out $25 million in bonuses to top executives to ensure they'd stick around as the company decided how to proceed.\n\nthey don't give severance pay to people who dedicated their lives to this company, williams said. that's unfair.\n\namerica is hard\n\nsimilar sentiments were voiced by onie patrick, a mother of five children ranging in age from one to 11, who met her fiancée during her nine years of working at a kmart in rockford, illinois.\n\nwe planned on getting married, but money-wise haven't been able to afford it, said patrick, whose store closed in september.\n\namerica is hard right now. we need to change the future for retail, added patrick. she urged sears chairman eddie lampert -- a billionaire hedge fund investor who as the company's biggest shareholder led the company for more than a decade -- to address workers directly. i want to know what his thoughts are. is he struggling on a food-stamp card too?\n\nas sears and kmart were merging in 2004, lampert touted the deal by saying it would help revive the struggling retailer. at the time, sears, an iconic department store chain launched in the late 19th century, employed more than 200,000 workers, operated almost 900 stores and generated annual revenue of $31 billion. it now has some 500 stores and less than half as many workers.\n\nwilliams and patrick are part of a campaign by labor advocates aimed at shaming lampert into providing financial assistance to sears and kmart workers laid off without severance. in a similar effort, united for respect's rise up retail recently helped win some financial assistance for tens of thousands of toys r us workers after a months-long effort.\n\nlampert still hopes to complete a deal to buy sears out of bankruptcy. he and his hedge fund, esl investments, faced a wednesday deadline to submit a revised offer to a bankruptcy court in order to compete with other buyers that want to liquidate the retailer's remaining stores and assets.\n\nlampert submitted a revised roughly $5 billion takeover bid late wednesday, people familiar with the matter told the reuters news agency. that boosts the odds sears will avoid liquidation, reuters said.
washington - the supreme court appears ready to deliver a major setback to american unions as it considers scrapping a four-decade precedent that lets public sector labor organizations collect fees from workers who decline to join.\n\nduring more than an hour of oral arguments monday, the high court's conservative justices seemed likely to side with a group of california teachers who say those mandatory fees violate the free-speech rights of workers who disagree with a union's positions.\n\nlabor officials fear unions' very existence could be threatened if workers are allowed to get all the benefits of representation without at least paying fees to cover the costs of collective bargaining. the case affects more than 5 million workers in 23 states and washington, d.c.\n\nbut justice anthony kennedy rejected arguments by lawyers for the state of california and the california teachers association that the current fee system is needed to prevent non-members from becoming free riders -- workers who reap the rewards of union bargaining and grievance procedures without paying for it.\n\nthe union basically is making these teachers compelled riders for issues on which they strongly disagree, kennedy said, noting the political nature of bargaining issues like teacher salaries, merit promotions and class size.\n\neven justice antonin scalia, who in the past has expressed some sympathy for the free-rider argument, said all the items negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement are necessarily political questions.\n\narguing in support of the union, california solicitor general edward dumont said the state needs a reliable bargaining partner that is funded by all the workers it represents. he said the fees for collective bargaining typically apply to non-political issues such as mileage reimbursement, working hours and other mundane matters.\n\nchief justice john roberts dismissed that reasoning, saying even routine matters can become politically charged if they involve how the state spends money. that's always a public policy issue, roberts said.\n\nthe group of 10 teachers who filed the challenge wants the high court to overturn a 1977 case that allows public unions to collect money from members and non-members alike, as long as the funds aren't spent for political action. the court in that case, abood v. detroit board of education, said the arrangement was justified to prevent non-members from becoming free riders.\n\nthe challengers argue that public-sector unions have become more political over time. they say even a push for higher salaries and pension benefits raises political questions about the best use of tax dollars for cash-strapped localities.\n\na federal district court ruled against the teachers, saying the outcome was clear under abood. the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals affirmed.\n\nhalf the states already have right-to-work laws banning mandatory fees, but about 80 percent of workers represented by public-employee unions are in states that don't, including california, new york and illinois.\n\nunion advocates say the lawsuit is part of a conservative agenda to weaken unions, which are known for reliably supporting democratic candidates and policies. the challengers are backed by the conservative center for individual rights.\n\narguing for the group of teachers, michael carvin said mandatory fees serve to inflate the union's war chest by people who really have not made a voluntary decision to do so.\n\nsome justices were more sympathetic to the unions. elena kagan warned that the challengers come here with a heavy burden to overturn a nearly 40-year-old case on which thousands of contracts and millions of employees rely.\n\njustice stephen breyer said overturning abood would require the court to overrule several related cases in which the high court has approved mandatory payments by lawyers to bar associations and mandatory student fees at public universities, calling that quite a big deal.\n\nbut carvin said abood's rationale is inconsistent with other free-speech cases, noting that the court twice in recent years has issued 5-4 opinions questioning the rationale of that earlier case, though it has stopped short of overruling it.\n\narguing for the california teachers association, lawyer david frederick said the first amendment applies differently to public employees. he said the state has a strong interest in promoting efficiency and avoiding costly workplace disruptions by designating the union as workers' exclusive bargaining representative.\n\nthe obama administration also weighed in to support the unions. solicitor general donald verrilli told the justices that there has been no change in circumstances over the past 40 years to warrant overturning abood.\n\nfor decades, the growth of union workers in government has helped compensate for steep losses in manufacturing, construction and other private industries where unions once thrived. about half of all members are now in the public sector, which has a membership rate of 36 percent. that's more than five times the private sector, at 6.6 percent.\n\neven if the court doesn't overturn settled precedent, it could still give the challengers a partial victory. the justices are also considering whether public employees should be required to opt in to paying the political portion of union dues. currently, workers must opt out of the political fees by checking a box on a form.\n\nthe opt in requirement could lead to more workers declining to pay the political portion of union dues, though it typically is a much smaller part of the overall payment.\n\na decision in the case, friedrichs v. california teachers association, 14-915, is expected by late june.
washington — the unprecedented republican effort to overturn the presidential election has been condemned by an outpouring of current and former gop officials warning the effort to sow doubt in joe biden's win and keep president trump in office is undermining americans' faith in democracy. mr. trump has enlisted support from a dozen republican senators and up to 100 house republicans to challenge the electoral college vote when congress convenes in a joint session this week to confirm president-elect biden's 306-232 victory.\n\nwith mr. biden set to be inaugurated january 20, mr. trump is intensifying efforts to prevent the traditional transfer of power, ripping the party apart.\n\ndespite mr. trump's claims of voter fraud, state officials have insisted the elections ran smoothly and there was no evidence of fraud or other problems that would change the outcome. the states have certified their results as fair and valid. of the more than 50 lawsuits the president and his allies have filed challenging election results, nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. he's also lost twice at the u.s. supreme court.\n\non a call disclosed sunday, mr. trump can be heard pressuring georgia officials to find him more votes.\n\nbut some senior lawmakers, including prominent republicans, are pushing back.\n\nseveral senators, paul ryan, liz cheney balk\n\nthe 2020 election is over, said a statement sunday from a bipartisan group of 10 senators, including republicans susan collins of maine, lisa murkowski of alaska, bill cassidy of louisiana and mitt romney of utah.\n\nthe senators wrote that further attempts to cast doubt on the election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the american people and only serve to undermine americans' confidence in the already determined election results.\n\nrepublican governor larry hogan of maryland said, the scheme by members of congress to reject the certification of the presidential election makes a mockery of our system and who we are as americans.\n\nformer house speaker paul ryan, a republican, said in a statement that mr. biden's victory is entirely legitimate and that efforts to sow doubt about the election strike at the foundation of our republic.\n\nrepresentative liz cheney of wyoming, the third-ranking house republican, warned in a memo to colleagues that objections to the electoral college results set an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\n\none of the more outspoken conservatives in congress, arkansas republican senator tom cotton, said he will not oppose the counting of certified electoral votes on january 6. i'm grateful for what the president accomplished over the past four years, which is why i campaigned vigorously for his reelection. but objecting to certified electoral votes won't give him a second term -- it will only embolden those democrats who want to erode further our system of constitutional government.\n\ncotton said he favors further investigation of any election problems, separate from the counting of the certified electoral college results.\n\npast pentagon chiefs speak out\n\nother prominent former officials also criticized the ongoing attack on election results. in a brief op-ed in the washington post, the 10 living former defense secretaries -- half of them having served republican presidents -- called on pentagon officials to carry out the transition to the new administration fully, cooperatively and transparently. they also asserted that efforts to involve the u.s. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory.\n\nciting election results, legal challenges, state certifications and the electoral college vote, the former defense secretaries said that the time for questioning the results has passed; the time for the formal counting of the electoral college votes, as prescribed in the constitution and statute, has arrived.\n\nthe unusual challenge to the presidential election, on a scale unseen since the aftermath of the civil war, clouded the opening of the new congress and is set to consume its first days. the house and senate will meet wednesday in a joint session to accept the electoral college vote, a typically routine process that's now expected to be a prolonged fight.\n\nmr. trump is refusing to concede, and pressure is mounting on vice president pence to ensure victory while presiding in what is typically a ceremonial role over the congressional session. mr. trump is whipping up crowds for a rally in washington on wednesday.\n\nthe president tweeted sunday against the election tallies and republicans not on his side.\n\nmr. biden's transition spokesman, mike gwin, dismissed the senators' effort as a stunt that won't change the fact that mr. biden will be sworn in january 20.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi said in a letter to colleagues that while there is no doubt of mr. biden's victory, their job now is to convince more of the american people to trust in our democratic system.\n\nthe effort in the senate was being led by gop senators josh hawley of missouri and ted cruz of texas. hawley defended his actions in a lengthy email to colleagues, explaining that his missouri constituents have been loud and clear with their belief that mr. biden's defeat of mr. trump was unfair.\n\nit is my responsibility as a senator to raise their concerns, hawley wrote late saturday.\n\nhawley plans to object to the state tally from pennsylvania. but that state's republican senator, pat toomey, criticized the attack on pennsylvania's election system and said the results that named mr. biden the winner are valid.\n\ncruz's coalition of 11 republican senators vows to reject the electoral college tallies unless congress launches a commission to immediately conduct an audit of the election results. they are zeroing in on the states where mr. trump has raised unfounded claims of voter fraud. congress is unlikely to agree to their demand.\n\nthe group formed with cruz, which presented no new evidence of election problems, includes sens. ron johnson of wisconsin, james lankford of oklahoma, steve daines of montana, john kennedy of louisiana, marsha blackburn of tennessee and mike braun of indiana. new senators in the group are cynthia lummis of wyoming, roger marshall of kansas, bill hagerty of tennessee and tommy tuberville of alabama.\n\nthe convening of the joint session to count the electoral college votes has faced objections before. in 2017, several house democrats challenged mr. trump's win but mr. biden, who presided at the time as the vice president, swiftly dismissed them to assert mr. trump's victory. rarely have the protests approached this level of intensity.\n\ndefining moment for gop\n\nthe moment is a defining one for the republican party in a post-trump era. both hawley and cruz are potential 2024 presidential contenders, cementing their alignment with mr. trump's base of supporters. others are trying to forge a different path for the gop.\n\npence will be carefully watched as he presides over what is expected to be a prolonged showdown, depending on how many challenges are mounted.\n\nthe vice president welcomes the efforts of members of the house and senate to use the authority they have under the law to raise objections, pence's chief of staff, marc short, said in a statement saturday.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell has warned republicans off such challenges but said little when asked about it as at the capitol as the senate opened sunday.\n\nwe'll be dealing with all of that on wednesday, he said.\n\nbut republicans simply said they do not plan to join the effort that will fail.\n\nsenator lindsey graham of south carolina said sunday his colleagues will have an opportunity to make their case, but they must produce evidence and facts. they have a high bar to clear, he said.\n\ncongress have been loathe to interfere in state-run election systems, a longstanding protocol. states choose their own election officials and draft their election laws. during the coronavirus pandemic, many states adapted by allowing mail voting to ease health risks of voting in person. those changes and others are now being challenged by mr. trump and his allies.\n\nmr. trump, the first president to lose a reelection bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud, despite the consensus of nonpartisan election officials and even mr. trump's attorney general that there was none.\n\nthe 5th u.s. circuit court of appeals rejected the latest challenge from representative louie gohmert, a republican from texas, and a group of arizona electors, who filed suit to try to force pence to step outside mere ceremony and shape the outcome of the vote. the appellate court sided with the federal judge, a trump appointee, who dismissed the suit.
cairo -- an international team of researchers said sunday they will soon begin analyzing cosmic particles collected inside egypt's bent pyramid to search for clues as to how it was built and learn more about the 4,600-year-old structure.\n\nmehdi tayoubi, president of the heritage innovation preservation institute, said that plates planted inside the pyramid last month have collected data on radiographic particles known as muons that rain down from the earth's atmosphere.\n\nthe particles pass through empty spaces but can be absorbed or deflected by harder surfaces. by studying particle accumulations, scientists may learn more about the construction of the pyramid, built by the pharaoh snefru.\n\nfor the construction of the pyramids, there is no single theory that is 100 percent proven or checked; they are all theories and hypotheses, said hany helal, the institute's vice president.\n\nwhat we are trying to do with the new technology, we would like to either confirm or change or upgrade or modify the hypotheses that we have on how the pyramids were constructed, he said.\n\nthe bent pyramid in dahshur, just outside cairo, is distinguished by the bent slope of its sides. it is believed to have been ancient egypt's first attempt to build a smooth-sided pyramid.\n\nthe scan pyramids project, which announced in november thermal anomalies in the 4,500 year-old khufu pyramid in giza, is coupling thermal technology with muons analysis to try to unlock secrets to the construction of several ancient egyptian pyramids.\n\ntayoubi said the group plans to start preparations for muons testing in a month in khufu, the largest of the three giza pyramids, which is known internationally as cheops.\n\neven if we find one square meter void somewhere, it will bring new questions and hypotheses and maybe it will help solve the definitive questions, said tayoubi.
die-hard new york knicks fan and famed director spike lee said tuesday he's being harassed by team owner james dolan. in an interview with espn, lee said he won't be attending any more games for the remainder of the season.\n\nbefore the knicks' 125-123 win over the houston rockets on monday, a viral video showed lee arguing with security as he tried to enter madison square garden through the employee entrance. the oscar-winning director said he'd been using the entrance for 28 years and he wasn't notified of a change.\n\nlee said his ticket was scanned before he was told to leave the stadium and re-enter from another entrance. instead of going outside, lee said he was escorted to his seat.\n\ni'm being harassed by james dolan and i don't know why, lee told espn.\n\nduring the exchange, lee said he brought up an incident involving former knicks legend charles oakley, who was infamously removed from the stadium in 2017. oakley has been banned from the building ever since.\n\nspike lee gestures in a hallway on the event level at madison square garden on monday, march 2, 2020. kathy willens / ap\n\nat halftime, lee could be seen speaking with dolan at his seat. i said, 'mr. dolan, i don't wanna talk about nothing! i have been coming through this entrance for 28 years, lee recalled, adding that he had used the same entrance last week.\n\nthe knicks issued a statement tuesday, saying the idea that lee is a victim is laughable. they shared a photo of the entrance along with a distant picture of dolan and lee appearing to shake hands.\n\nit's disappointing that spike would create this false controversy to perpetuate drama, the statement said. he is welcome to come to the garden anytime via the vip or general entrance; not just throughout our employee entrance, which is what he and jim agreed to last night when they shook hands.\n\nlee, however, dismissed the knicks' version of the incident, calling it a spin.\n\nlee, who reportedly spends about $300,000 a year on his tickets at madison square garden, said he won't be present for any more games this season. i'm coming back next year, but i'm done for the season, lee told espn. i'm done.\n\nthe knicks currently sit at the bottom of the eastern conference with a record of 19-42.
a friend for life has been campaigning for years, along with others, to make a california landmark safer. john blackstone has her story:\n\non a stage in nashville, songwriter sarah lockwood barr performs songs she's written that she loves to sing ... and one that breaks her heart.\n\nthis is for casey brooks, who would have turned 27 this past may, she announced, before playing starting over:\n\nall the world's gone to sleep tonight.\n\nbut you won't wake.\n\nall the world cries for you tonight.\n\nbut you can't see.\n\nshe and casey grew up, she says, in a comfortable california town just north of san francisco. we learned to ride bikes together, lockwood barr said.\n\ncasey brooks. family photo\n\nsenior year of high school was almost over, and they were ready to go off to college. but shortly before graduating, in january 2008, casey jumped off the golden gate bridge and ended her life, lockwood barr said.\n\nand you had no idea? blackstone asked.\n\nnobody did. she was already accepted into college. she was a really talented writer. she had a good crew of friends. there was no reason, as far as we could tell.\n\nand it was really easy for her. there's a parking lot right at the base of the bridge. the guardrail's only four feet high. so you can just kind of pretend you're walking across the bridge and hop over. and it's a 220-foot fall. and that's it.\n\ncasey's father, john brooks, told blackstone, every time we drive over the bridge, every time we look at the people laughing and smiling and taking selfies of themselves and enjoying this, that's what we used to do. and then, you know, casey jumped, and it all changed.\n\nthe beautiful landmark at the entrance to san francisco bay has an ugly side. casey brooks is one of nearly 1,700 suicides on the bridge since its opening in 1938. last year, 39 people jumped from the bridge.\n\nnearly 1,700 people have taken their lives on the iconic san francisco bay span, but a new addition to the bridge may both prevent deaths and send a signal about the preciousness of life. cbs news\n\nbut that toll may be coming to an end.\n\nfor years brooks' parents, john and erika, and sarah lockwood barr have been striving with others who lost love ones on the bridge to convince the bridge board to erect a net -- a suicide barrier.\n\nso i really hope that the board puts safety ahead of inconvenience, john said at one meeting.\n\nblackstone said, a barrier on there, you say, would tell people someone cares.\n\njohn and erika brooks, with correspondent john blackstone. cbs news\n\nexactly, said erika. we care enough about you so that when you're not looking out for yourself we're letting you know we care.\n\nthat is certainly not the only place, by any means, that people can end their lives. how would a net change things?\n\njohn replied, what we've learned about suicide is that in a lot of cases, it can be very impulsive. yet, if you are prevented from acting on that impulse, the chances are very, very good that you won't have a recurrence.\n\nkevin hines is one of the few who jumped and survived. (i walked back toward the traffic railing, i ran forward and i catapulted myself over the rail, he recalled.) he's also a strong advocate for a net to prevent others from making the same bad decision.\n\nblackstone asked, when did you realize it was a mistake?\n\nthe millisecond my hands left the rail and i was in freefall, which i thought was too late, hines replied.\n\nkevin hines, who survived a suicide attempt, has advocated for a net on the golden gate bridge. cbs news\n\na study in 1978 of 515 people who attempted suicide on the golden gate bridge but were stopped found that 90 percent did not die from suicide later. but for years that wasn't enough to convince officials the bridge should get a net.\n\njohn brooks said, there were people who believed that this bridge cannot be touched. it's an iconic structure. it's sort of like the mona lisa -- you can't touch the mona lisa. so there was an aesthetic issue.\n\nwhen asked about the argument that millions of dollars would be spent on a net that would ruin an icon, lockwood barr responded, how much money would you pay for your child? what's the price tag on your husband or wife?\n\nin the nearly ten years since she joined the campaign to build the net, lockwood barr has gone through times of hope and disappointment. we had all these sort of fake-outs, she said. something would pass, and then a budget would come about. and then it would get pulled because there was a new estimate on cost. and then someone else would come in with an appeal.\n\nsarah lockwood barr has written a song in tribute to a friend who took her own life. cbs news\n\nand you know, i kind of lost hope at a point. like, it just started feeling like a slap in the face every time, you know, we'd get really excited something was happening.\n\nthis spring, their determined persistence finally paid off. the long struggle for a net ended with a ceremony at the bridge marking approval of plans for a $200 million suicide barrier, due for completion in 2021.\n\nan artist's rendition of the suicide prevention net to be added to the golden gate bridge. cbs news\n\nit'll be so healing, lockwood barr said. because it also sends a statement to the community and to the world that life is valuable and life matters. this is us saying, 'we value your life and your struggle.'\n\n(if you or someone you know is considering suicide, please call a trained counselor at national suicide prevention lifeline at 1-800-273-talk [8255].)\n\n\n\nfor more info:
juneau, alaska -- it soon could be legal to post selfies of marked ballots in alaska.\n\nthe state house on wednesday passed legislation, 32-8, that would allow voters to share photos, videos or other images of their marked ballots with the public.\n\nthey could not, however, show videos or images of their or another person's marked ballot while in a polling place or within 200 feet of one in an attempt to get someone to vote a certain way.\n\npeople have new forms of digital expression whether it's through social media, facebook and twitter or texting photos and snapchat, said rep. jonathan kreiss-tomkins, who co-sponsored the bill, cbs affiliate ktva reports. kreiss-tompkins said that the division of elections receives a multitude of phone calls after each election cycle from alaskans who fear they will be prosecuted for breaking state law because of a picture posted.\n\naccording to kreiss-tomkins, the division of elections has been supportive of the effort to update the law to reflect new, digital forms of expression.\n\nbut not all of kreiss-tomkins' house colleagues saw the same need for change.\n\ni fear that this bill will invite electronic mischief, electoral mischief — technology is ever-evolving and technology is disruptive to the traditional processes, said rep. dan saddler, floor leader for the house republican minority.\n\nin my opinion this bill trivializes the process of elections, and the terribly private process becomes a public spectacle. 'hold that thought!' saddler said as he pretended to take a selfie in the house chambers. i'm going to vote no on this, to protect the gravity and the sanctity of the ballot.\n\nthe bill next goes to the senate.\n\nexisting state law prohibits showing a marked ballot, but alaska's elections director has said there's no practical way to enforce that.\n\naccording to the national conference of state legislatures, at least 15 states this year have bills addressing ballot selfies and the secrecy of the ballot.
the kentucky derby was postponed until september on tuesday, the latest rite of spring in sports to be struck by the new coronavirus along with the masters, march madness and baseball season. the derby, america's longest continuously held sports event, had been scheduled for may 2. it will now be run september 5, kicking off labor day weekend.\n\nwe'll roll with the punches, and feel very, very good that september is the right date, bill carstanjen, ceo of churchill downs inc., said on a conference call.\n\nit's the first time the derby won't be held on its traditional first saturday in may since 1945, when it was run june 9. the federal government suspended horse racing nationwide for most of the first half of the year before world war ii ended in early may, but not in time to hold the first leg of the triple crown that month.\n\nthe date change still must be approved by the kentucky horse racing commission at its meeting thursday. still to be decided are the dates of the next two legs of horse racing's showcase series — the preakness and belmont.\n\ncarstanjen said the september date was chosen after talks with nbc sports, which televises the triple crown races, based on the limited number of sports events that weekend and hotel availability in louisville.\n\nchurchill downs clearly wasn't interested in running the 146th derby without fans in the stands, which is what other tracks have been doing, including santa anita in california, oaklawn in arkansas and the fair grounds in louisiana.\n\nwe feel confident we are going to run the kentucky derby and run it with a crowd, carstanjen said. it's a participatory event.\n\nthe race itself lasts just two minutes, but the partying and socializing goes on throughout derby week, with celebrity-stuffed charity galas and private house parties. last year's race drew 150,729 fans.\n\nthe tradition of sipping mint juleps, donning fancy hats and dress clothes, and the crowd singalong to my old kentucky home as the horses step onto the track has always made the derby more than just a sports event. people who pay little attention to horse racing the rest of the year typically watch the derby and wager on it either formally or in pools set up at parties.\n\nthe derby was first run in 1875 and has gone uninterrupted, even through the great depression and world wars i and ii.\n\nin 1943, there were travel restrictions imposed by world war ii and no out-of-town tickets were sold. still, the derby went on, with count fleet winning in front of 65,000. the colt won the triple crown that year.\n\nthe kentucky oaks, the race for filles held on derby eve, is also hugely popular, especially among louisville locals. it first began in 1875. it will be run september 4.\n\nhorses have been training and racing to earn points that translate into berths in the 20-horse derby field even as the rest of the sports world has mostly shut down because of the virus pandemic. horses have only one chance in their lives to compete in the derby, preakness and belmont stakes, which comprise the triple crown for 3-year-olds.\n\ncarstanjen said points already earned by horses would be maintained, while existing races at tracks across the country would be added to the road to the kentucky derby qualifying process.\n\nthis will be fun and give fans more time to learn about this year's crop of 3-year-olds, he said.\n\nthe derby, the first leg of the triple crown, draws strong tv ratings. by moving it to september 5, the race wouldn't conflict with notre dame football, satisfying nbc sports, which televises both. the university of louisville has an away football game that day.\n\nthe preakness is scheduled for may 16 at pimlico in baltimore, and the maryland jockey club said no decision has yet been made on the second leg of the triple crown.\n\nthe belmont is set for june 6 in new york. the new york racing association said decisions about large-scale public events must prioritize public health and safety above all else. nyra added that it will update the status of the belmont only when that process has concluded to the satisfaction of state and local health departments.\n\nfor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, with the vast majority recovering in about two weeks.\n\ncarstanjen said churchill downs alerted pimlico and belmont park as it got close to completing a new date with nbc sports.\n\nthey were receptive and had their own questions. there is time in the calendar that nbc can make available, he said. they just have to work it out together and i hope they do.\n\nnbc sports said in a statement it appreciates the traditional sequencing of the triple crown races, but these are uncharted waters and the network will work with the preakness and belmont to determine the most appropriate timing.\n\nbusinesses in the louisville area, including hotels, restaurants, gas stations, grocery and liquor stores, depend on the derby to earn a large portion of their revenue for the year. almost all such entities raise their prices significantly during the thursday, friday and saturday of derby week.\n\nthe derby has an estimated economic impact of $400 million on the louisville area.\n\nthe kentucky derby festival had already postponed some of its early events until april 5. the two weeks of events leading up to the derby, highlighted by the thunder over louisville fireworks show, have a local economic impact of $127 million.\n\nthe nba and nhl have suspended their seasons indefinitely. major league baseball has postponed the start of its season until mid-may at the earliest, and one of the biggest events to be called off was the ncaa basketball tournament known as march madness that captivates the country for three weeks. another spring fixture postponed until september was the boston marathon. colleges have canceled spring sports.
this is part of cnet's it's complicated series about the role technology plays in our relationships.\n\nif you had to explain dating in 2017 to a time traveler from the 1950s, what would you say?\n\ni would explain texting first, and how it takes five minutes now for people to decide they want to hook up, says comedian nikki glaser. i would tell women, 'buckle up, bitch, this is not going to be a fun ride.'\n\nglaser, 32, has made a professional study of dating sites like tinder and the hookup culture that experts say has reshaped many people's sex lives. it provides lots of fodder for her comedy routine.\n\nfor past generations, relationship milestones meant things like going steady. today's relationships can strike up after a few minutes of text chats.\n\nand since nearly everything is done using an app on a phone, you can have a relationship with someone and never hear their voice, glaser says.\n\nso this is dating in the modern age. having fun yet?\n\ndating apps are so ubiquitous now that swipe right, the way you show you like someone on tinder, has become part of our everyday language. swipe right now means anytime you make a good choice or approve of something, according to urban dictionary.\n\nthe internet has been transformational to the way we have relationships, says pepper schwartz, a professor of sociology at the university of washington who studies dating. she's noticed, for example, the speed at which technological trends ripple through our culture, and how quickly people become adopters.\n\nit changes us, she said. it's a very powerful presence in modern life. that's particularly true in courtship and dating, schwartz said.\n\ngo back a couple hundred years, and the world was transitioning from arranged marriages to love. (schwartz said researchers could tell because children weren't getting married in order of oldest to youngest anymore.) up until the automobile, airplane and mass education, people usually married someone nearby, such as a neighbor, a fellow churchgoer or the girl next door.\n\nbut these shifts fractured many communities. that, along with sex education, family planning and, in some places, egg freezing as a company-provided health benefit, has meant many people are waiting longer before they settle down.\n\nwho hasn't read about how millennials are less religious, have fewer kids and, despite the popularity of tinder and the less formal dating culture it's helped introduce, may even be having less sex. the term cybersex, which used to mean people describing sexual experiences to each other over chat, has morphed into sexting -- and it's a far more accepted part of life. varying sexuality and gender identity are more accepted today as well.\n\nso as time passes and people move around, the traditional pools from which you'd normally find a partner pretty much disappear, schwartz said. that leaves today's relationship seeker with few options other than to look online.\n\nit's no wonder then that over 90 percent of america's more than 54 million singles have tried online dating, according to the statistic brain research institute.\n\nover the past decade, dating services have been set up for pretty much any interest. if you wanted to date only people who like star trek, normally you'd have to weed through several p'tahks before finding someone to join your crew, as it were. now there's a site for pretty stark trek fans, as well as sites for vampire enthusiasts, gamers and even devotees to the writings of ayn rand.\n\nthere's even a site for supporters of the newly inaugurated president of the united states. it's called trumpsingles.com.\n\nrapid change\n\ntinder's simple but addicting formula of swiping right on a profile you like, and then getting an alert if that person swipes right on you, has become such a cultural sensation that glaser began doing skits about it.\n\nwatching how friends and coworkers used the app, she developed a theory that a not-small number of men would be willing to say pretty much anything in a text message conversation if they believed they might hook up.\n\nso she tested it in a segment called tinder tapout for her late night comedy central show, not safe with nikki glaser, which ran for 20 episodes last year.\n\nshe and her team created fake profiles of good-looking women, then struck up conversations with real-life men. the joke: see how long the men stick with the conversation as the fake women say increasingly crazy things.\n\nglaser started one conversation by having a fictional female celebrate that she'd just sold a stolen wheelchair. in another, she told a marine she had ptsd, party till severely dumber. he responded, what's your favorite color?\n\npeople went further than you would ever think, glaser said. her theory is that the men had so many conversations going that her character was another fish in the sea to them.\n\ntinder isn't unique, it's just one of the most well-known. other apps, such as grindr, used by the gay community, and bumble, in which women make the first move, have joined staples like okcupid, match.com and eharmony as go-to dating services on the web.\n\nnot everyone likes the seeming minefield of internet dating, though. that's when they turn to amber kelleher-andrews and her matchmaking service, kelleher international, founded by her mother jill kelleher in 1986 just outside san francisco. with prices ranging from $25,000 to $300,000, her clientele skews toward the rich and famous. but she said many people come to her after having given up on the app world.\n\nthere are people who it isn't working for, she said. the people who come to matchmakers are highly frustrated.\n\nkelleher, who met her husband in school despite her mother's attempts to match her with other men, is considering bringing a lower-priced version of her service onto the internet too. one idea she's considering is taking over the management of a person's online profile, and then helping select dates among the swipes and winks that pile up.\n\npeople are really bad at choosing by themselves, she said.\n\nthe new normal\n\nit's easy to forget modern smartphones came on the scene only a decade ago, when steve jobs unveiled the first iphone. the mobile app boom came afterward, helping make services like uber, twitter, instagram and tinder household names.\n\nwe're still feeling the effects that technological change is having on our culture and how we communicate, said nicole ellison, a professor at the university of michigan school of information.\n\nfor example, people routinely strike up a conversation about something someone said online, like if a colleague posted about his child's birthday on facebook. a few years ago, that might have been considered creepy. now it's pleasant and thoughtful.\n\nwe may reach a point where tech helps us more easily find people in our daily lives, ellison said, and not just find someone to meet up with later. imagine, for example, an app that points out a fellow game of thrones fan at a party, so you can more easily strike up a conversation.\n\nwe have more information about people than ever before, and many of us have these supercomputers in our pocket that have geolocation capabilities to see who's around us in space, she said.\n\ntogether, that information could help us more easily talk to each other and find common ground. that would be my hope, she said.\n\nin the meantime, people like glaser are asking for less ambitious technologies to fix some of the inconveniences of today's dating scene. at the top of her list is an undo button for text messages, like how google's gmail gives you 30 seconds to cancel an email after you press send.\n\nwe've all sent off things we regret, she said. it's crazy that that can make or break a relationship.\n\nthen again, maybe not. time travelers beware.\n\ncnet magazine: check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in cnet's

as a child, you were told not to speak to strangers, but as an adult, you can share almost everything with strangers: cars, homes, bicycles, movies, music, and more. it's called the sharing economy and this seemingly altruistic shift is big business.\n\nas pricewaterhousecoopers predicts in its 2015 report, companies that adhere to the sharing economy's business model of access over ownership have the potential to increase global revenues from roughly $15 billion today to about $335 billion by 2025.\n\none company that's taking the sharing economy to new heights is gwynnie bee. it's one thing to rent fancy ball gowns, but what about everyday clothes? that's just what they're doing at gwynnie bee, a subscription rental clothing service for women sizes 10 to 32.\n\nceo christine hunsicker is no stranger to the startup world: she was the coo and president of right media, an online advertising startup that sold to yahoo! for $850 million, and then became the coo of drop.io, an online file sharing service that was purchased by facebook.\n\ngwynnie bee ceo christine hunsicker cbs news\n\nfollowing that success, hunsicker decided to create her own business and take on the fashion world.\n\nit's a huge industry, hunsicker told cbs news correspondent vinita nair. it's an almost $2 trillion industry and it hasn't really been disrupted well by technology, by the internet, and it's very data-poor. so it was truly a business opportunity.\n\nin addition to the vast, untapped possibilities, hunsicker also knew that a company designed solely for women sizes 10 and up would greatly benefit a large segment of the population.\n\nevery woman -- no matter what size -- has that feeling of 'why don't things fit me?' hunsicker said. it happens to be significantly worse in the plus-size market, because there are so few options and so few brick-and-mortar stores and the industry has just systematically under-served the plus-size woman.\n\nthe plus-size market refers to women sizes 14 and up. according to industry analyst firm plunkett research, ltd., 67 percent of american women are plus size. and yet, plus size fashion makes up less than 20 percent of the women's apparel market.\n\nfounded in 2011, gwynnie bee offers customers over 4,000 styles and there are several subscription plans available. the most popular subscription plan allows members to rent three items at a time for $79 a month. similar to netflix's dvd plan, members can keep the items for as long as they want, ship them back for free, and then get another item that was in their queue. so far, gwynnie bee has shipped more than 3 million boxes of clothing across the u.s.\n\nrent the runway, known for renting high-end luxury dresses and accessories, plans to offer a subscription rental service for everyday clothes too. for $139 a month, rent the runway unlimited members can rent three designer dresses, tops, skirts, or accessories at a time and keep them for as long as they want. rent the runway unlimited, currently in beta form, is scheduled to fully launch this spring.\n\none of the benefits of gwynnie bee is the online community that has formed among members. using gwynnie bee's website, instagram page, and even creating their own fan pages on facebook, members share photos, styling tips, reviews, and more.\n\na renewed belief in the importance of community is one of the drivers of the sharing economy, or collaborative consumption, that rachel botsman, co-author of the book, what's mine is yours: the rise of collaborative consumption, discussed in her 2010 ted talk. other drivers include: an increase in peer-to-peer social networks and real-time technologies that fundamentally change the way we behave; pressing unresolved environmental concerns; and a global recession that fundamentally shocked consumer behaviors.\n\nthese four drivers are fusing together and creating the big shift--away from the 20th century, defined by hyper-consumption, towards the 21st century, defined by collaborative consumption, botsman said.\n\nthough the sharing economy has come to life in the new millennium, this is not just a young person's game. as wired editor-at-large jason tanz told cbs news, the reach of the sharing economy has extended beyond the generation of 20- and 30-year-olds.\n\ni think the sharing economy began as something that millennials did, but it's actually a big part of the economy right now, tanz said. i think you can't really just say that it belongs to one demographic. you know, airbnb is, by some measures, the world's largest hotel company and that can't be built just on the backs of millennials.\n\nas botsman pointed out in her ted talk, products-service systems like libraries and laundromats have been around for years. however, the utilization of data and technology has maximized the possibilities of what can be shared and how it can be shared. already the sharing economy has had a large fiscal impact with expectations of it greatly multiplying in the next decade. and with companies like gwynnie bee providing for those that traditional markets have forgotten, the sharing economy's effect on society could be invaluable.
the world is watching closely as china begins investing billions of dollars into a hyper-ambitious new silk road aimed at broadening the country's financial scope and enhancing global trade. the plan is called one belt, one road and is essentially a network of land and maritime routes to improve the flow of goods and access to central asia, europe and the middle east.\n\nbut many people living in the region fear that china is also attempting to gain overwhelmingly political power that could threaten their current way of life.\n\nbeijing intends to connect more than 60 countries, with a collective population of 4.4 billion people -- more than half of the world. it's expected to spend close to a trillion dollars on the initiative, primarily focused on major infrastructure development projects including thousands of miles of railroad tracks to create routes from china all the way to western europe.\n\nphotojournalist davide monteleone recently produced an essay for the new yorker in which he met with locals where the routes are being developed. it's very complicated to understand how does this actually affect people's lives in the region -- in china, in khazakstan, monteleone said in an interview with cbsn. regular people don't really understand what it is. they aren't very interested in what's going to happen on a global, geopolitical level. they are more concerned about how it's going to affect their everyday life.\n\nbut, monteleone said, geopolitics plays a huge role in why china is pushing the project. this is the thing: it looks like an economical initiative, but in fact it is probably more of a foreign policy initiative. this is leverage china will have on countries once they start economic relations.\n\nchinese officials insist the initiative is purely commercial, but foreign diplomats and political analysts also see an effort by the communist beijing government to promote its ambitions to rewrite global rules on trade and security and reduce the u.s. presence in asia.\n\ndiplomats have expressed concern that beijing is promoting a vision of trading networks centered on great powers such as china, which would erode the rules-based system under the world trade organization in which all competitors are treated equally.\n\npresident donald trump's plan to focus on domestic issues and downplay foreign affairs has given beijing an opening to try to play a bigger leadership role in trade, climate and other global issues.\n\nchina is the biggest trading partner for all of its asian neighbors and a growing investor. but some asian governments are uneasy about beijing's strategic ambitions, especially after it built artificial islands and military bases in the south china sea to enforce its claim to most of the region.\n\nmr. trump's decision to withdraw from the trans-pacific partnership, a proposed regional trade pact, has left asian governments that want to use ties with washington to offset china's growing dominance off balance.\n\nthey have the strongest leader in xi jinping they've had at least since mao [zedong], eurasia group president and cbs contributor ian bremmer said in an interview with cbs this morning last week. and because the united states is america first, it's transactional. it's unilateral. it's undermining a lot of alliances. you put those things together, and suddenly you actually have a china that is willing to engage in what is increasingly a geopolitical vacuum.\n\nbremmer added: in other words, this is the first time we've ever seen as u.s. leadership erodes, no one else has been standing up. now the leader of china is saying we're prepared to stand up whether it's on climate or the global economy, you know, regional security, you name it -- that's a big change for the world.
(cbs/ap) tokyo - fukushima prefecture (state) has opened its first beach to swimmers since last year's nuclear disaster after judging the water to be safe.\n\nabout 1,000 people on monday descended on nakoso beach, about 40 miles south of the fukushima dai-ichi nuclear plant, where three reactors melted down after the march 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami.\n\nthe opening was celebrated with beach volleyball games and hula dancers from a nearby spa.\n\niwaki city official joji kimura says negligible radiation was detected in water at the beach. airborne radiation was measured at 0.08 microsieverts per hour, far below dangerous levels.\n\nswimming had been banned at all beaches in fukushima prefecture (state) since last march's disaster.\n\nthe beach was reopened as tens of thousands of people rallied at a tokyo park monday demanding that japan abandon nuclear power as the country prepares to restart another reactor shut down after last year's tsunami caused meltdowns at the fukushima power plant.\n\njapan reactor on grid in 1st post-tsunami restart\n\njapan reactor back online, 1st since fukushima\n\njapan to switch off last nuclear reactor\n\nled by nobel-winning novelist kenzaburo oe, pop star ryuichi sakamoto and visual artist yoshitomo nara, the protesters expressed outrage over a report that blamed the fukushima disaster on japan's culture of reflexive obedience and held no individuals responsible.\n\njapan ordered all its nuclear power plants shut down for safety inspections after last year's march tsunami and earthquake set off multiple meltdowns at fukushima dai-ichi plant. some 150,000 people evacuated from a 12-mile zone around the plant because of radiation fears, and the area is deemed unsafe to live in more than a year later.\n\nthe world's second-worst nuclear accident after chernobyl has deeply divided japan, which had been previously bullish on nuclear technology.\n\nprotesters carry anti-nuclear placards during a march in tokyo, july 16, 2012. ap\n\nmonday's rally at sprawling yoyogi park was the latest and among the biggest — drawing possibly as many as 200,000 people, according to organizers — in a series of large protests that is unusual for normally reserved japanese.\n\nwe want to leave a world without nuclear power for our children, said hospital worker takeshi shinoda, wearing a no nukes t-shirt and strolling with his 3-year-old son in a long line of demonstrators.\n\nthe movement's leaders say they have collected 7.4 million signatures for a petition demanding a phase-out of nuclear power.\n\nuntil last month, when prime minister yoshihiko noda decided to restart the reactor at ohi plant in central japan, all of this nation's 50 working reactors had been offline. the second reactor at ohi is set to go online later this week.\n\nnoda has said some nuclear energy is needed to ensure an ample power supply and protect people's livelihoods. japan's economy is still struggling after last year's disaster, and the towering costs of oil imports to fuel non-nuclear power plants threaten to derail its fledgling recovery.\n\ncritics are not convinced, saying japan has done fine without atomic energy for more than a year.\n\nthe demonstrators also said they were offended by a parliamentary investigation that blamed japanese culture for the fukushima disaster.\n\nthe report, released earlier this month, said, its fundamental causes are to be found in the ingrained conventions of japanese culture — our reflexive obedience, our reluctance to question authority, our devotion to `sticking with the program,' our groupism and our insularity.\n\nmidori tanaka, a schoolteacher marching at the park, said the right people should face up to their mistakes.\n\nthings can never change if we blame culture. we need to get to the bottom of this, she said.\n\noe said blaming culture was a cop-out, adding that individuals — including the president of tokyo electric power co., the utility that operates fukushima dai-ichi — should be held responsible.\n\naddressing the rally from a stage, sakamoto said it was ridiculous to risk people's lives for electricity.\n\nlife is more important than money, he said in japanese, then added in english, keeping silent after fukushima is barbaric.
the trump administration will soon roll out a new strategy for a more aggressive space-based missile defense system to protect against existing threats from north korea and iran and counter advanced weapon systems being developed by russia and china. details about the administration's missile defense review — the first compiled since 2010 — are expected to be released during president trump's visit thursday to the pentagon with top members of his administration.\n\nsenior administration officials who briefed reporters said the new review will make the case for investment into new advancement of defense concepts and capabilities. using space technology for missile defense, they said, is very important to next-level capabilities that will help the u.s. stay ahead of the threat.\n\nsince the 2010 review, officials said the u.s. has seen a significant change to the threat environment… what the missile defense review responds to is an environment which our potential adversaries have been rapidly developing and fielding, a much more expanded range of new advance offensive missiles. some of these missiles, the officials went on to say, are capable of threatening the united states, threatening our allies, our partners.\n\nthe new review concludes that in order to adequately protect america, the pentagon must expand defense technologies in space and use those systems to more quickly detect, track and ultimately defeat incoming missiles.\n\nrecognizing the potential concerns surrounding any perceived weaponization of space, the strategy pushes for studies. but no testing is mandated, and no final decisions have been made.\n\nspecifically, the u.s. is looking at putting a layer of sensors in space to more quickly detect enemy missiles when they are launched, according to a senior administration official, who briefed reporters wednesday. the u.s. sees space as a critical area for advanced, next-generation capabilities to stay ahead of the threats, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose details of the review before it was released.\n\nthe administration also plans to study the idea of basing interceptors in space, so the u.s. can strike incoming enemy missiles during the first minutes of flight when the booster engines are still burning.\n\ncongress, which ordered this review, already has directed the pentagon to push harder on this boost-phase approach, but officials want to study the feasibility of the idea and explore ways it could be done.\n\nthe new strategy is aimed at better defending the u.s. against potential adversaries, like russia and china, who have been developing and fielding a much more expansive range of advanced offensive missiles that could threaten america and its allies. the threat is not only coming from traditional cruise and ballistic missiles, but also from hypersonic weapons.\n\nrussian president vladimir putin unveiled new strategic weapons he claims can't be intercepted. one is a hypersonic glide vehicle, which can reportedly fly 20 times faster than the speed of sound and make sharp maneuvers to avoid being detected by missile defense systems.\n\ndevelopments in hypersonic propulsion will revolutionize warfare by providing the ability to strike targets more quickly, at greater distances, and with greater firepower, lt. gen. robert ashley, director of the defense intelligence agency, told congress last year. china is also developing increasingly sophisticated ballistic missile warheads and hypersonic glide vehicles in an attempt to counter ballistic missile defense systems.\n\ncurrent u.s. missile defense weapons are based on land and aboard ships. mr. trump and vice president pence have both emphasized space-based capabilities as the next step of missile defense.\n\nsenior administration officials earlier signaled their interest in developing and deploying more effective means of detecting and tracking missiles with a constellation of satellites in space that can, for example, use advanced sensors to follow the full path of a hostile missile so that an anti-missile weapon can be directed into its flight path.\n\nany expansion of the scope and cost of missile defenses would compete with other defense priorities, including the billions of extra dollars the trump administration has committed to spending on a new generation of nuclear weapons. an expansion also would have important implications for american diplomacy, given long-standing russian hostility to even the most rudimentary u.s. missile defenses and china's worry that longer-range u.s. missile defenses in asia could undermine chinese national security.\n\nasked about the implications for mr. trump's efforts to improve relations with russia and strike better trade relations with china, an administration official said that the u.s. defense capabilities are purely defensive and that the u.s. has been very upfront with moscow and beijing about its missile defense posture.\n\nthe release of the strategy was postponed last year for unexplained reasons, though it came as mr. trump was trying to persuade north korea to give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nwhile the u.s. continues to pursue peace with north korea, pyongyang has made threats of nuclear missile attacks against the u.s. and its allies in the past and has worked to improve its ballistic missile technology. it is still considered a serious threat to america. iran, meanwhile, has continued to develop more sophisticated ballistic missiles, increasing their numbers and their capabilities.\n\nfin gomez contributed to this report.
with its upbeat theme and fresh-faced stars, the dick van dyke show might have looked at first like any other early 1960s sitcom. but mary tyler moore's laura petrie, a housewife married to dick van dyke's comedy writer rob, were actually staking out new turf.\n\nmary tyler moore, dick van dyke and larry mathews are seen here in this 1962 shot from the dick van dyke show. cbs\n\nrob and laura were a modern couple. …you know that these people have sex. … it came across as a real marriage, actor dick van dyke told cbs news. we would get into fights about who'd do the most…\n\nwith more than a few of those standoffs ending with laura's trademark refrain, oh, rob!\n\ni think by the first 'oh, rob!' i said she's found her character, said van dyke.\n\nthis was a great couple, said bill persky, who was a writer and a producer on the show.\n\nthey loved one another. they respected each other. and they got into all kinds of trouble, he told cbs news correspondent jim axelrod.\n\nof course i had a crush on her almost instantly, van dyke said. i think the greatest compliment we ever had is that most people thought we were married in real life …everyone thought we were actually married. which is, i think, is the highest compliment i ever had as an actor.\n\ncarl reiner created the series.\n\nshe was -- first of all, she was grace personified, reiner said. when she and dick did a soft-shoe to 'you wonderful you' across the stage, i melted, as audiences did all over the country. she was the essence of femininity.\n\nbut laura certainly wore the pants in that show.\n\nshe got in trouble with the capri pants with the network … and we had to sleep in twin beds and we could not say the word pregnant, van dyke said. how times have changed.\n\nwe reflected what was going on at the time but we were very conscious of raising the issues, said reiner.\n\nthey took a big risk with an episode called that's my boy??\n\nin the episode, laura has just given birth to their child, richie.\n\nthe hospital keeps confusing the petries with the peters, the couple in the next hospital room. and when the petries come home, rob is convinced they have the wrong baby.\n\nhe invites the peters over to make the switch. and when rob opens the door, an african-american couple walks in.\n\nit was the longest laugh i've ever experienced in my entire show business life. we just cut the cameras 'cause they laughed and laughed and cheered. it was amazing, van dyke recalled.\n\nbut this groundbreaking episode almost didn't happen.\n\nwhen carl brought the premise to the network, they said, 'you can't do that, persky explained. because it was right at the beginning of the civil rights movement and there was a lot of unrest. …so they weren't gonna let him do it. and carl said that he would quit the show if they didn't.\n\nmary tyler moore had created the kind of wife women across america could recognize. in a country about to undergo tumultuous change, they were seeing themselves.\n\nmy god, she was a consummate artist. she was an actress. she was a dancer. she was everything, reiner gushed. …we're gonna miss her. we're gonna miss her.
boston -- winter-weary new englanders are preparing for blizzard conditions, a foot or more of snow and high winds as the third major nor'easter in two weeks bears down on the northeast. the national weather service on monday issued a winter storm warning for much of new england and a winter weather advisory for eastern new york and pennsylvania and northern new jersey, even as residual power outages from the previous storm linger.\n\nthe storm is expected to hit about midnight and last through most of the day tuesday, with snow accumulating at a rate of 2 inches per hour during the tuesday morning commute.\n\nwhile the first two storms of the month brought coastal flooding and hundreds of thousands of power outages, this winter monster is a little bit different.\n\nthis one's main impact is going to be snow, said kim buttrick, a meteorologist with the national weather service office in taunton, massachusetts.\n\nmore power outages are possible, but they are not expected to be as widespread as last week. only minor coastal flooding is possible.\n\nwind gusts as high as 65 mph (104 kph) are forecast in coastal areas.\n\nboston and eastern massachusetts, as well as rhode island, could get a foot and a half of snow, with less to the west of the city.\n\naccording to cbs boston, people in eastern massachusetts could see blizzard conditions due to the intensity of the snow, combined with frequent winds that lower the visibility. the area could even see up to 18 inches of snow.\n\nmaine is also bracing for a hard hit. the portland international jetport has had 75.5 inches (1.9 meters) of snow, far above the normal for the date of 51.8 inches (1.3 meters) with another 12 to 18 inches is on the way, said james brown, of the national weather service.\n\nin new york, heavy, wet snow is forecast for long island, which could get 5 to 10 inches of accumulation, while 2 to 4 inches are possible in new york city.\n\nin new jersey, the storm is expected to start out as light rain in most areas, then turn to a wintry mix before changing over to all snow by early tuesday, leaving behind anywhere from 1 to 4 inches.\n\nhopefully this will be the final punch of the winter, buttrick said.\n\nblizzard conditions are likely occur at times in eastern mass. due to the intensity of the snow combined with the frequent, gusty winds lowering the visibility to near zero.\n\nwith a slightly more easterly fringe storm track, you could take 10-20 mph off the peak winds above. certainly minimizing the damage and overall impact if this were the case.\n\nmuch of central and eastern mass. will end up with over a foot of sow.\n\nin fact, we're forecasting 14-to-18 in eastern mass. at this point, if there's any change that i could see making to this map it would be to raise numbers even more.
pittsburgh -- a dozen pledges spoke with investigators about possible hazing at a university of pittsburgh sorority, prompted by a mother who noticed bruises on her daughter, police said wednesday. the university said it has placed alpha kappa alpha on interim suspension.\n\nthe mother who contacted police said she was visiting her daughter when the younger woman told her she had been involved in sorority hazing of pledges, penn hills police chief howard burton said.\n\nthe mother, her daughter and the other students met with police on monday, but burton said he has not determined whether a crime occurred or charges should be filed.\n\na message left at the sorority's national headquarters seeking their comment on the complaint was not immediately returned.\n\nburton said the girls were taken to the basement of a private home in penn hills, about 10 miles from campus. the chief told cbs pittsburgh that a mother of one of the alleged victims wanted to report the ladies being hazed by other women on feb. 21 and feb. 23, 2018.\n\nthe mother made accusations that these girls were taken to a house somewhere in penn hills and possibly smacked with paddles, something like that, said chief burton.\n\nburton added: we've got a lot of girls who don't want to talk about it. if they don't want to be victims there's not a heck of a lot we can do with that.\n\nhe said the investigation, conducted along with university police, may be delayed because many students are leaving campus as part of spring break, which officially starts sunday.\n\na university spokesman said hazing and intimidation are contrary to pitt's core values.\n\ndean of students kenyon bonner said the future of the school's fraternity and sorority life was being evaluated as a result of the incident.\n\nwe are better than this, and now is the time for you and your organizations to join me in holding yourselves and each other accountable to effect positive change, bonner wrote to the organizations wednesday.
a criminal defense attorney representing r. kelly responded thursday to sexual assault allegations against the singer that are detailed in a new documentary series. despite growing backlash, the singer was out in public wednesday night, celebrating his 52nd birthday at a club in chicago.\n\nkelly seemed unconcerned about the series surviving r. kelly, in which multiple women accused the three-time grammy winner of sexual and domestic abuse.\n\nit's a bunch of disgruntled people looking for their 15 minutes of tmz fame, attorney steve greenberg told cbs news' jericka duncan.\n\ni believe that all of these women did exactly what they wanted to do. because now there's some hashtag, that's not going to change, greenberg said, referring to the #metoo movement.\n\nright now, prosecutors from at least two counties — one in illinois, where kelly is from, and one in georgia — are asking alleged victims to come forward. in cook county, illinois, the state's attorney's office told cbs news it has received calls related to this matter.\n\ni haven't heard from a prosecutor's office. i have never heard from an attorney for a victim or an alleged victim. i haven't heard from anyone because there's no facts to back up these claims, greenberg said.\n\ngreenberg also said kelly is disappointed other musicians are now distancing themselves from him. lady gaga announced she's removing the song she performed with him from streaming platforms.\n\nmore of the conversation with greenberg can be seen in the video below:
by marilyn lewis/moneytalksnews\n\nthe approach of a milestone birthday is a reminder that, as life changes, so do your needs and circumstances. with the big five-o the question is settled: you're no longer a kid. and that's a great thing: maturity is much better than it's cracked up to be. so instead of dreading it, update your financial life by hitting these targets and embrace the coming decades:\n\n1. debt tamed\n\nmaybe it's maturity, or maybe it's the prospect of dragging debts through your so-called golden years, but you have paid off your debts or have them under control. you add new debt only when you can easily handle it. you pay credit card balances before interest is applied. your total debt follows principles outlined in the charles schwab guide to finances after 50:\n\n28 percent: an industry rule of thumb suggests that no more than 28 percent of your pretax household income should go to servicing home debt (principal, interest, taxes, and insurance).\n\n36 percent: no more than 36 percent of your pretax income should go to all debt: your home debt plus credit card debt and auto loans.\n\nnot quite there yet? learn how to tackle big debts fast. before signing up for credit cards, comparison shop for the best rates and lowest fees.\n\n2. spending: under control\n\nwith children possibly gone from the home and maybe out of school, you may have more money on hand now, and it's tempting to spend it. after all, your friends may be living it up, and you've worked hard to get here. have fun. but don't shortchange retirement goals. if you are well-employed, your 50s are a gift — probably the best earning years of your life. double down on savings, as retirement may last a long, long time.\n\nalso, start thinking about how you'll change your spending after retirement.\n\n3. retirement goals: defined\n\nset a concrete goal for your retirement savings. just do it. the kids will find a way to pay for college if it matters to them. they have years to get on their feet financially. you do not. set a retirement income goal now so that, if you're short financially, there's time to improve things.\n\nthere are a couple of approaches. one is to shoot for saving six to nine times your annual household income by your mid-50s to early 60s, says walter updegrave, at real deal retirement. example: if you earn $60,000 a year, your ira, 401(k) or other account should approach $360,000 to $540,000 as you near 60.\n\nanother is to see how far your current retirement savings will take you. this keybank calculator shows that a nest egg of $1 million will last 21 years if you withdraw $50,000 a year (assuming inflation is 2.5 percent and investments earn 3 percent after tax and inflation). only have $100,000 saved? it'll buy you two years of retirement at the same rate of spending.\n\n4. retirement contributions: inching up steadily\n\nnow that you have a goal, keep increasing the percent of each paycheck saved for retirement. make the increases so small they're hardly noticeable. if you're diverting 12 percent to savings now, bump it up to 13 percent, or 13.5 percent. six months later, give your savings another tiny raise and keep it going until you're at goal. ditto if you're saving 6 percent: inch it up to 7 percent, and then onward.\n\nsome experts recommend saving 15 percent to 20 percent or more of before-tax salary. automate the deductions, so you'll never see the money. getting a bonus? put a hefty chunk into retirement savings.\n\nthe rock-bottom line: even in the worst times, save at least enough to earn your employer's maximum matching contribution.\n\n5. social security: on track for the max\n\nyou may be pessimistic about social security's chances, and you could be right to expect cuts in payouts or a change in eligibility ages. but social security isn't going bust. before long, though, congress must either find more funding or shrink benefits.\n\nbut don't bet against this retirement lifeline. it still is likely to be one source of income in your retirement, and there are things you can do now to maximize your payout.\n\ngo to socialsecurity.gov and set up a my social security account. use it to estimate your future benefits at various retirement ages. social security benefits are based on your best 35 years of earnings, so plan to work longer if you need to boost those earning years.\n\n6. 401(k): lowest fees possible\n\nfees paid to manage retirement savings may appear low. what's 3.5 percent but a drop in the bucket? you think. wrong!\n\nmany savers unknowingly pay far too much in mutual fund fees, losing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars they could have used in retirement. this chart offers an example, from an informative video by the u.s. department of labor, showing how fees affect two accounts that started with identical balances of $25,000 -- given no additional contributions. one pays 1 percent more in fees than the other -- but the resulting difference in balance after 35 years is $64,000.\n\ncheck your plan statements to see the fees you are charged. time magazine explains:\n\n… you can minimize fees by opting for the lowest-cost funds available — typically index funds, which tend to be less expensive than actively managed funds. and if your ira is too pricey, move it elsewhere.\n\n7. your will: updated\n\nyou don't need a will. if you don't have one, a probate court will decide what to do with your assets.\n\nif you want control over what happens to your money and property, though, you'll need one. and your spouse should have a separate will.\n\na will gives voice to your decisions and requests after you're gone. use it to say what you want for your children and pets after you're gone. use it to determine what happens to possessions with financial or sentimental value. you can name an executor who will be in charge of following your directions and include provisions for your remains and a funeral, if you want one.\n\n8. you: giving back\n\ncommitting to doing good in the world is a part of maturing. with a small budget or a large one, philanthropy allows you to express your values and connects you to the world on new terms. there's the personal satisfaction, and there's also a helpful tax deduction.\n\n9. long-term care: a plan in mind\n\nby our 50th birthday, it occurs to many of us that maybe -- just maybe -- we really will get old. since many of us will end up needing skilled nursing care in old age, at least for a short time, managing your finances requires considering how to pay for it. long-term care insurance can be an excellent tool. but whether it's right for you depends on several things.\n\n10. mortgage: end in sight\n\nentering retirement with a paid-off mortgage is a smart goal. tearing up the mortgage before retirement was commonplace a couple of generations ago. not everyone can pull it off these days, but the rewards are great. you'll require less income. if your mortgage eats a quarter or a third or more of your monthly pay, you'll enjoy a raise of that much, just when your paychecks stop. what's more, it's a tax-free raise.\n\n11. insurance: reviewed and adjusted accordingly\n\nlife changes, and so should your insurance. if your children or spouse would be lost without your salary, get enough life insurance to carry them through if you die. stick with cheaper term insurance (low-fee index funds, not life insurance products, are a cheaper way to save for retirement).\n\nlikewise, if losing your salary would be financially devastating, cover the risk with disability insurance.\n\nwhen children are launched in careers and you and your spouse are nearer retirement, you may be able to drop life insurance.\n\ntake a look at your home and auto insurance limits, too. is the coverage still appropriate?\n\nas for heath insurance, enlist an insurance broker -- it should cost you nothing -- to review your health insurance needs and costs. if you have a high-deductible plan, total your most recent year's out-of-pocket expenses to make certain that you still are coming out ahead.\n\nalso from moneytalknews:\n\n• 10 things you should never buy used\n\n• 6 fabulous ways to save after you turn 50\n\n• the key lesson vanguard can teach you about getting rich
reverb is a new documentary series from cbsn originals. watch the latest episode, complicit: the amazon fires, in the video player above.\n\nafter years of criticism from environmentalists, the world's biggest investor finally embraced the challenge of battling climate change in january. that's when blackrock, with a massive $7.4 trillion in client assets, announced it would sell off $500 million in coal industry stakes and push more of the thousands of companies it invests in to make environmental sustainability a top priority.\n\nbut critics say the new york-based money manager is already showing weakness in its commitment to environmental issues. specifically, they say blackrock is being too passive in pushing for change in the agricultural and commodities industry, which many believe to be the second-largest contributor to climate change after the energy sector.\n\nunlike with coal, blackrock has not pledged to sell off its investments in companies in the industry, including companies that have been tied to fires in the amazon, such as bungee limited and archer daniels midland. it also has not mandated that companies revamp their operations.\n\ninstead, blackrock has said it is asking companies to better disclose to investors their environmental risks and the costs those may entail in the future. blackrock has not said what it would do if it turns out those costs are high — or if companies are unwilling to make those disclosures at all.\n\nthe most recent salvo between blackrock and its environmental critics started in january when co-founder larry fink published a letter to ceos calling climate change a bigger structural, long-term crisis than any he has seen in his 40-year financial career. he said blackrock would immediately begin pushing sustainability as a core goal at all of the companies it invests in.\n\nthe letter got wide attention because of fink's prediction that climate change was already having an impact on the stock market and the long-term outlook for investors, and because fink said his company was going to do something about it.\n\nanother reason for the scrutiny: fink's sobering prognosis was a surprise for a firm that in the past seemed reluctant to put its weight behind climate issues. mutual fund researcher morningstar recently ranked blackrock 46th out of 50 money management firms when it came to its record of supporting environment issues.\n\nlarry fink's letter was a sea change, said moira birss, a director at environmental group amazon watch. the follow-through remains to be seen.\n\na sustained clash\n\nblackrock has been in the crosshairs of climate change activists in the past. last year, as raging wildfires charred vast swaths of the amazon, protestors blocked the entrance to blackrock's new york headquarters. the protestors accused blackrock of funding companies responsible for the destruction of the amazon and other natural forests.\n\nfor years, blackrock basically said that, even as the largest owner of stocks in the world — investing the assets of big customers like public pension funds and corporate 401(k) plans that hold the assets of millions of workers — it had little ability to push social issues like climate change or gun regulation. that's because blackrock offers what are called passive index funds that track everything from the s&p 500 to the companies in fast-growing economies like brazil and china.\n\nblackrock runs the index funds, but separate companies like s&p global choose the companies in the index. passively managed funds, according to the rules of index investing, have to buy the shares of all the companies in the index, whether those companies are burning the amazon or not.\n\nmore recently, as the firm's profile has grown along with scrutiny of its influence, blackrock has pledged to do more to improve corporate behavior, though there hasn't been a lot of measurable follow through. two years ago, fink said executives need to put social purpose on par with profits. this year his call to action was climate change.\n\nenvironmental groups have reason to be wary. according to morningstar, blackrock was one of the least likely among mutual fund firms to support shareholder resolutions at the companies it had invested in.\n\nblackrock had supported just 3% of the shareholder proposals morningstar reviewed over the past five years. these included social and corporate governance proposals as well as environmental calls for action. on just environment-focused issues, blackrock supported 8% of the shareholder resolutions it voted on last year, compared to a 42% support rate for all large fund families.\n\nlast year, two companies in the s&p 500, fast food giant yum brands and snack maker mondelez international, faced shareholder resolutions specifically on deforestation. blackrock voted against both.\n\nif blackrock's voting record and shareholder engagement isn't strong and effective on climate change, then it wouldn't be a stretch to call fink's words empty and hypocritical, said amazon watch's birss. there is more that blackrock could and should be doing.\n\nin response to cbs moneywatch's questions, a blackrock spokesperson pointed to a report the company put out last year that said the firm had reached out to five brazil-based agribusiness companies and that each company stated their operations were not the cause of, or directly impacted by, the recent fires [in the amazon]. blackrock at the time said it will engage further as necessary to ensure the adoption of sound business and governance practices.\n\non the firm's voting record, the blackrock spokesperson said shareholder votes do not fully reflect how it engages with companies. the spokesperson said blackrock has been successfully pushing for changes on sustainability issues for several years, but the firm expects to be more proactive when it comes to shareholder votes in the future.\n\ngiven the groundwork we already laid and the growing investment risks surrounding sustainability, we will be increasingly disposed to vote against management when companies have not made sufficient progress, the spokesperson said.\n\ninvestment case study: bunge limited\n\nblackrock holds $337 million worth of shares on behalf of its clients in bunge limited, making it the third largest shareholder of the agricultural company, which is based in st. louis.\n\ntwo years ago, brazil fined bunge and other large grain buyers $29 million for contributing to deforestation in that country. bunge said at the time it believed the grain it bought had not come from a protected area.\n\namazon watch singled out bunge in a recent report on the destruction of the brazilian rainforest, saying it was among a number of the largest companies responsible for widespread deforestation in the brazilian amazon and noting the brazilian fine.\n\nmuch of blackrock's investment is through typical index funds. but at least $16 million of blackrock's bunge holdings have been made through two index funds, the ishares msci usa esg select etf and ishares msci usa esg optimized etf. blackrock's website says those funds invest in companies that have positive environmental characteristics.\n\na blackrock spokesperson said the firm is in the process of rebranding a number of its funds as environmentally and socially aware to let customers know that these funds include companies with favorable characteristics but are also optimized to offer a similar risk and return profile to broad market indices.
even though it doesn't obey any earthly speed limit and has a space-suited mannequin for a driver, elon musk's tesla roadster won't drive up his insurance rates anytime soon. researchers say the orbiting sports car won't have a really close encounter with earth until 2091 and could last millions of years before getting totaled in a planetary crackup.\n\nlaunched atop a spacex falcon heavy rocket last week, the roadster was boosted into an elliptical orbit around the sun. it will pass within about 68.7 million miles of mars on june 10 and cross the red planet's orbit in july before reaching its farthest distance from the sun -- 154.7 million miles -- on nov. 9.\n\nthe roadster and its mannequin driver -- known as starman -- then will fall back toward the inner solar system, picking up speed as they near the low point of the orbit, or perihelion, on aug. 15, 2019. perihelion in this case roughly matches the distance of earth's orbit from the sun, the tesla's starting point.\n\nthe roadster then will head back out along the same path, traveling a now-familiar route over and over again for the foreseeable future. but a variety of factors will act to change the trajectory over time.\n\nanalyzing the roadster's orbit, three astronomers who specialize in planetary motion -- hanno rein, daniel tamayo and david vokrouhlicky -- write in a paper posted at arxiv, a repository of electronic preprints of scientific papers hosted by cornell university, that the tesla will have its first close encounter with earth in 2091, possibly passing closer than the moon.\n\na tesla roadster launched by spacex's falcon heavy rocket glides out of earth's orbit on feb. 6, 2018. spacex\n\nsubsequent flybys are difficult to precisely model because of gravitational and other effects on the tesla's trajectory, but the researchers say multiple computer simulations permit a statistical analysis that indicates the odds of a collision with earth are very low over the next million years.\n\nthe bottom line is we can't predict with certainty what's going to happen after just a few hundred years, because it's a chaotic orbit and we can only draw conclusions in a statistical sense, rein said in a telephone interview from his office at the university of toronto. based on multiple simulations, roughly 50 percent are going to hit a planet in the next few tens of millions of years.\n\nasked why he and his colleagues decided to model the tesla's orbit, rein said we were very excited by the launch and ... as soon as the first orbital elements were published by (the jet propulsion laboratory) we thought, well, let's see what happens to this thing. we're fully aware this is not going to open a new field in astrophysics. this was a fun thing to do.\n\nthe tesla should enjoy a long life in space, he said. the simulations show a roughly 50 percent chance of a collision with a planet over many millions of years, but a relatively small chance of hitting earth in the next million.\n\nthe orbital evolution is initially dominated by close encounters with the earth, the authors write in the paper's abstract. the first close encounter with the earth will occur in 2091. the repeated encounters lead to a random walk that eventually causes close encounters with other terrestrial planets and the sun.\n\nlong-term integrations become highly sensitive to the initial conditions after several such close encounters, the abstract continues. by running a large ensemble of simulations with slightly perturbed initial conditions, we estimate the probability of a collision with earth and venus over the next one million years to be 6 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.\n\nwe estimate the dynamical lifetime of the tesla to be a few tens of millions of years.\n\nconstant exposure to space radiation, micrometeoroid impacts and extreme temperatures will take their toll and the roadster's resale value likely will take a beating. but that's another story.
london — two russian prank callers claim britain's prince harry told them that u.s. president donald trump had blood on his hands because of his response to climate change, according to the british tabloid newspaper the sun.\n\nalexei stolyarov and vladimir krasnov, who make up the well-known russian prank duo vovan and lexus, reportedly made two phone calls to prince harry pretending to be swedish climate change activist greta thunberg and her father, svante, the sun reported.\n\nin those purported calls, the partial audio of which was published online by the sun, prince harry allegedly said the mere fact that donald trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in america, he has blood on his hands. but trump will want to meet you to make him look better but he won't want to have a discussion about climate change with you because you will outsmart him.\n\na royal source said buckingham palace would not comment on the pranksters' call, and cbs news could not independently verify the audio or the sun's reporting.\n\nunfortunately, the world is being led by some very sick people, so people like yourselves and (the) younger generation are the ones that are going to make all the difference, harry said in the phone calls, according to the sun.\n\nquotes on #megxit\n\nharry also allegedly told the prank callers he and his wife meghan had not been stripped of their royal titles, as had been widely reported.\n\nyou mustn't believe what you read, no one has stripped us of our titles, he reportedly said.\n\nbecause of a technicality within the family, if we are earning money separately from within the family structure, then we obviously have been asked not to use our titles in order to make money, which we would never do. but the press managed to jump on that to make it look like we had been stripped.\n\nhe allegedly said he and meghan left britain because it was the best decision for their family, and that normal life was better than life as a royal.\n\nthis decision certainly wasn't the easy one but it was the right decision for our family, the right decision to be able to protect my son, and i think there's a hell of a lot of people around the world that can identify and respect us for putting our family first. but, yeah, it's a tricky one, but we will start a new life, he said, according to the sun.\n\nyou forget, i was in the military for ten years so i'm more normal than my family would like to believe, he reportedly continued.\n\nvovan and lexus have made high-level prank calls before, releasing audio of purported conversations with u.s. presidential candidate bernie sanders, as well as singer elton john.
london - tampons are the latest battleground in britain's difficult relationship with the european union.\n\nthe british government has declared victory in its bid to remove an eu-imposed sales tax on women's sanitary products. campaigners argue that tampons are an essential item and should be tax-exempt.\n\ntreasury chief george osborne says eu leaders have agreed to let britain cut the tax rate to zero, boasting: we've achieved what no british government has even tried to achieve.\n\neu opponents say the tax is a prime example of brussels meddling.\n\nvote leave spokesman robert oxley said friday that the bloc had only conceded because britain will vote in june on its eu membership. he said: do we need to have a referendum every time we need to change a tax rate?
buffalo, n.y. -- washington capitals forward devante smith-pelly is disgusted and saddened black athletes such as himself continue to be the targets of racial taunts from fans. it's sad that in 2018 we're still talking about the same thing over and over, smith-pelly said sunday, a day after he was singled out by four fans in chicago.\n\nyou'd think there would be some sort of change or progression, but we're still working toward it, i guess, and we're going to keep working toward it, he said.\n\nthe comments were smith-pelly's first a day after four fans were ejected from chicago's united center for chanting a racial taunt while he served a penalty for fighting during the capitals' 7-1 loss to the blackhawks. an off-ice official sitting next to smith-pelly notified building security, and the fans were ejected.\n\nsmith-pelly confirmed the fans were chanting basketball, basketball, basketball, and understood immediately what it meant in being directed at a black hockey player in a sport dominated by white athletes. smith-pelly said he was confronted with a similar chant during a tournament in british columbia.\n\ntwo smith-pelly gifs. first, you can see him hear someone say something to him, and he looks over at them. pic.twitter.com/lvwugfl7al — evan sporer (@ev_sporer) february 18, 2018\n\nnext, he clearly has had enough of whatever is being said, gets up to address the fans. pic.twitter.com/vlu4qhssmy — evan sporer (@ev_sporer) february 18, 2018\n\nhe said he stepped forward publicly to call out the fans for what they said because he didn't want to brush it under the rug.\n\ni guess i'm trying to get the conversation started and show whoever these people were their true colors, said smith-pelly following practice in buffalo, where the capitals will play the sabres on monday.\n\nnhl commissioner gary bettman released a statement saying the league condemns the fans' behavior and backs the blackhawks for ejecting the offenders.\n\nbettman says no one should ever have to endure such abuse at one of our games.\n\nvideo shows smith-pelly seated in looking and pointing to his left. he then gets up with his stick and gets into an exchange through the glass with a male fan seated immediately next to the penalty box.\n\nbettman said the nhl plans to remind all stakeholders they are entitled to enjoy a positive environment, free from unacceptable, inappropriate, disruptive, inconsiderate or unruly behaviors or actions and may not engage in conduct deemed detrimental to that experience.\n\nthe blackhawks issued a statement apologizing to smith-pelly and the capitals following the game, and said they are committed to providing an inclusive environment.\n\non sunday, the capitals released a statement saying they are extremely disappointed by the intolerant behavior by a select group of fans in chicago.\n\nin thanking the blackhawks and arena security for removing the fans, the capitals said: it is crucial to confront such appalling conduct.\n\nafter the game on saturday, coach barry trotz said the player was a little upset.\n\nthere's absolutely no place in the game of hockey or our country for racism. and i think it's disgusting, trotz said. it just shows ignorance.\n\nthe 25-year-old smith-pelly is in his first season with the capitals. he also has played for anaheim, montreal and new jersey.\n\nthe fans' taunts occurred during the nhl's monthlong hockey is for everyone campaign to promote the game as being inclusive for all players regardless of race, color, religion, national origin or gender. february is also black history month in the united states.\n\nthe nhl has had to previously deal with racial insults.\n\nduring the 2014 playoffs, the boston bruins denounced fans who posted racial comments on social media targeting then-montreal canadiens defenseman p.k. subban, who is black, after he scored in double overtime.\n\nin 2011, a fan was fined $200 after pleading guilty to engaging in a prohibited activity for throwing a banana on the ice at philadelphia flyers forward wayne simmonds, who is black, during an exhibition game at london, ontario.\n\ncbssports.com noted the incident comes during the nhl's hockey is for everyone month, which aims to drive social change and promote diversity and inclusiveness in the game of hockey.
when he's not on cnn giving updates on the coronavirus, sanjay gupta is at his day job, as a neurosurgeon. i've had a longstanding love affair with the brain, he said.\n\nyou're a brain surgeon — what's it like to hold it in your hands? asked cbs news chief medical correspondent dr. jon lapook.\n\nfirst time i ever operated on the brain, you know, close to 30 years ago now, it was a mystical experience, dr. gupta replied. you can't believe that those three-and-a-half pounds are everything to us — all of our pain, all of our joy, all of our memories, all of our learning, everything.\n\nand in his spare time, dr. gupta has written a book about the brain, keep sharp — specifically, how to keep it in shape. [the book is published by simon & schuster, a division of viacomcbs.]\n\nsimon & schuster\n\nfor dr. gupta, it's personal: in many ways, this story began when my grandfather developed alzheimer's. i saw that as a teenage kid and, you know, it really stuck with me. this has probably been a lifelong journey to try and understand how i could prevent that from happening to me and from anybody else.\n\nmore than five million americans have alzheimer's, the most common cause of dementia.\n\ndr. lapook said, one of the biggest fears that my patients have is developing dementia. they'll come in and say, 'you know what? i couldn't think of somebody's name. i know them so well. i was in the middle of a sentence, i lost my train of thought.' so, how can people know the difference between changes that come with normal aging, and the onset of dementia?\n\nthis is a topic of conversation #1 in our home, dr. gupta said. it used to be because my parents were always asking me this question. and now my wife and i are always asking each other this question: 'am i starting to become more forgetful?'\n\nwhen it comes to discovering if something is just normal sort of memory loss versus abnormal: people lose keys all the time. it becomes more abnormal when you don't remember exactly what those keys are for.\n\nit turns out the changes in the brain that lead to alzheimer's disease begin decades before symptoms arise.\n\nthere is some suggestion, right, that even if you're destined to develop alzheimer's in the future, that if your blood vessels in your brain are wide open, if you're doing everything you can to keep heart healthy, that it might actually push it off, it might actually delay it? asked dr. lapook.\n\ni think there's no question now that we can say — and i don't think we could've said this five, 10 years ago — but there are things we can do that involve lifestyle changes that could absolutely delay the progression of dementia, and even reverse it.\n\ndr. gupta said the key is doing activities that create cognitive reserves in the brain — areas of new nerve growth and wiring that can pick up the slack if needed.\n\nso, let's get to it. with no miracle drug on the horizon, what's the prescription for fighting off dementia?\n\nlet's start with exercise. put it this way: what's good for the heart is good for the brain.\n\nsanjay gupta, m.d., author of keep sharp: build a better brain at any age. cbs news\n\ndr. gupta said, when you move, it's almost like you're signaling to the body and to the brain, 'i wanna be here. i'm not ready to go!' what the brain specifically releases [are] these things called neurotrophins; these good chemicals are sort of nourishing the brain.\n\nin the united states, a lot of us are going 100 miles an hour, but so many of us do that while sitting down, not moving, dr. lapook said.\n\nyou know, people keep saying that 'sitting is the new smoking.' every time you're about to sit, say, 'do i need to be sitting' and then just try and moderately move throughout the day. it's so effective in terms of what it does to the brain and what we can measure it doing to the brain.\n\nand there are simple habits that you can do — for example, take the stairs rather than the elevator.\n\nit takes months, years to change the heart, dr. gupta said. the brain can change like that.\n\nhow about diet? you've heard about that, too: eat less red meat, less processed food, more vegetables and fruit – especially, dr. gupta says, one kind of fruit: they always say, jon, 'apple a day keeps the doctor away.' i think when it comes to the brain, it's berries. berries, in terms of what they can do for the brain and some of these certain chemicals that they release, are probably gonna be one of your best foods.\n\nany berries? just about any berry. ... dive into berries!\n\nhow about working directly on your thinking skills? crossword puzzles? video games? what works, if anything?\n\ndr. gupta said, i have nothing against crossword puzzles and even video games and brain-training games and things like that. i think they can be great. we do crossword puzzles, you play the piano, you do it over and over again, and practice makes perfect. that's absolutely true. but it's change that builds resiliency. you need the change.\n\nso, i wouldn't just do crossword puzzles. the way that i think about it is, if you can get outside your comfort zone in some way every day, you're probably harnessing other real estate in the brain that you don't otherwise use very often. do something that scares you every day! whatever the metaphor is, whatever works, just do something different. learn a new skill. i remember talking to these neuroscientists who said, 'eat dinner with your left hand tonight if you're right-handed.'\n\ngetting a good night's sleep is another way to stay sharp. there are so-called garbage collecting cells that help remove toxins from the brain. and while you're asleep, memories from the day are processed.\n\ndr. lapook said, our knowledge about the importance of sleep has really changed over the years. it's not just a matter of letting our batteries recharge, right?\n\nsleep is such a sophisticated activity that we spend a third of our life doing, dr. gupta replied. the brain is a remarkably complicated organ. when you go to sleep at night, it's taking the experiences you had throughout the day and consolidating them into memory. why do we even have experiences if we're not going to do the things necessary to remember them, right? we're learning that the brain is constantly sort of going through this 'rinse cycle' at night.\n\nfor one of the best ways to fight off dementia, look no further than your friends and family.\n\nwe know that that social interaction is so critically important, dr. gupta said. we are social creatures. we know that there are certain neurochemicals that are released when we actually have touch and look someone directly in the eye.\n\nthe best thing you could do overall, in terms of putting it all together for brain health, would be to take a brisk walk with a close friend and talk about your problems.\n\nwhy? with the brisk walk, you're getting the movement in. you're doing it with a friend: you're getting the social connection in. it turns into this beautiful thing for the relationship, but also for the brain.\n\nof course, the coronavirus means seeing friends up-close-and-personal is a little tough right now. but with americans starting to get vaccinated against covid, the time when we can move past the pandemic may be approaching.\n\ndr. lapook asked, what people want to know is, when do we get back, if not to normal, towards normal? what do you think?\n\ni think we will start to get back to normal a lot sooner than people realize, and i think that could be maybe mid-, end of spring, it's gonna start to feel a lot more normal, dr. gupta said. things will start to open up. people will be out and about more.\n\ni have three teenage girls. i think they're gonna be back in school next fall. i could be wrong, but that's where it seems like things are heading.\n\nso, as we look forward to coming out of isolation, here's a new year's resolution for you: think about doing something for your brain.\n\nempathy and kindness, compassion — they do a lot for everybody's brain, don't they? asked dr. lapook.\n\nthey are the ultimate sort of nourishment for the brain, dr. gupta replied. every sight you see, every sound you hear, everything you touch, feel, whatever it may be, taste — and then the feelings, the experiences that you have through empathy, through these connections with people — is all nourishing the brain as well. it's really good for the brain.\n\nit's why we live.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by alan golds. editor: ed givnish.
amherst, mass. -- amherst college trustees have voted to stop using lord jeff as the school's unofficial mascot because of its negative historical connotations.\n\nthe mascot is named for 18th-century british gen. jeffery amherst, known for suggesting a plan to deliver smallpox-infected blankets to native americans. amherst was the commander of british forces in north america during the french and indian war.\n\ntrustees chairman cullen murphy said in a statement tuesday that the mascot is driving people apart because of what it symbolizes to many in our community. he says a mascot's job is to unify.\n\nmurphy acknowledged many students and alumni are attached to the mascot. but surveys found that most faculty and students favored dropping it.\n\nhe says an alumni-student group will be assembled to come up with a new mascot.\n\ncbs affiliate wshm spoke to students over the few months who were upset about the mascot.\n\nkatie warshaw said then that the change was needed.\n\ni'm definitely pro getting rid of the lord jeff. if it makes any student feel uncomfortable, then we should get rid of it. it has a dark history and i don't think that's representative of our school, she said.\n\nthe mascot should be something that's representative of the student body and what our values are and the actions of lord jeff are something i can't condone or feel comfortable having as a symbol to rally around, said ashwin balaji, an amherst college freshman.\n\nother students like kemi okome told wshm they felt the same.\n\ni don't understand how somebody could identify with lord jeff, didn't do a lot of great things. he's just frankly a bad person, said okome.\n\na multitude of professional sports teams, colleges and even high schools have ignited national debate in recent years over their offensive nicknames and imagery.\n\nmany of these mascot controversies center around teams using caricatures or slurs that people perceive as ethnically stereotyping native americans. teams, such as the washington redskins and the florida state university seminoles, have often come under fire for their team names.
the new york state attorney general on thursday filed a lawsuit against the nypd, alleging repeated illegal and harmful conduct during racial justice protests this summer and in years prior. the lawsuit, which seeks to install a monitor to oversee police tactics at future protests, alleges that nypd officers used a litany of illegal tactics including excessive force and unlawful arrests.\n\nthe lawsuit claims that officers frequently used excessive physical force against protesters, often with pepper spray, batons and bicycles. attorney general letitia james's office said police hit protesters with blunt instruments at least 50 times, unlawfully deployed pepper spray in at least 30 instances, and used unreasonable force while pushing or striking protesters at least 75 times.\n\nas a result of these actions, protesters experienced significant physical harm, including broken bones, gashes requiring stitches and staples, concussions, and other harm, as well as extensive psychological harm, the office said in a news release announcing the lawsuit.\n\nthe lawsuit also accuses the nypd of unlawfully detaining hundreds of people, including protesters, legal observers and medics. as an example, the suit alleges that despite mayor bill de blasio exempting legal observers and medics from nightly 8 p.m. curfews, 12 legal observers and six medics were arrested at a june 4 protest in the bronx.\n\nwe need immediate change to decades-old unjust policies and practices. to restore trust and ensure that reforms are fully implemented, it is critical that real changes are made, james said thursday in a news conference.\n\nan nypd officer wrestles a protester to the ground on june 4, 2020, in new york city. scott heins / getty\n\nit also claims the nypd intentionally gathered protesters and did not allow them to disperse, and later arrested them for violating a curfew they may otherwise not have violated — a tactic known as kettling.\n\nthe lawsuit alleges that at the june 4 protest, police kettled hundreds of protesters five to ten minutes before the 8 p.m. curfew, preventing people from leaving by pushing them with their bikes. at least 249 people were arrested for violating curfew that night, the office said, although some allegedly begged officers to let them go home or leave the protest zone before the curfew set in.\n\nthe lawsuit details dozens of stories of protesters facing alleged unlawful treatment, including that of melanie ryan, who was protesting in midtown manhattan on june 3. the lawsuit alleges that as the curfew came into effect, an officer swept her feet out from under her, causing her to fall face-first to the ground, where she landed on her forehead. five officers then allegedly pinned her to the ground, and one is accused of punching her three times in the face.\n\nthe suit, filed against the city of new york, mayor de blasio, nypd commissioner dermot shea, and nypd chief of department terance monahan, seeks widespread reform and the installation of an external monitor to oversee the department's response at future protests. it warns that if the department is not stopped from continuing its alleged illegal practices, there is a real and immediate threat that the nypd will continue to chill the protected speech of new york residents in the future.\n\na man protesting police brutality and systemic racism in new york city in 2020. scott heins / getty\n\nthe police benevolent association of the city of new york, the union that represents nypd officers, blamed the clashes with protesters over the summer on a failure of new york city's leadership.\n\nwe will say it again: what we witnessed in june was a failure of new york city's leadership, union president patrick lynch said in a tweeted statement. they sent cops out to police unprecedented protests and violent riots with no plan, no strategy and no support. they should be forced to answer for the resulting chaos, instead of pointing fingers at cops on the streets and ignoring the criminals who attacked us with bricks and firebombs.\n\nthe nypd did not immediately respond to cbs news' request for comment, but tweeted that it welcomes reform and has embraced the recent suggestions by both the city's department of investigation and the city's law department.\n\nde blasio said there are pressing reforms needed for the department — but he said he did not support the appointment of an external monitor. i couldn't agree more that there are pressing reforms that must — and will — be made this year, de blasio said. a court process and the added bureaucracy of a federal monitor will not speed up this work.
when children suffer from constipation, many parents turn to over-the-counter laxatives like miralax for relief. pediatricians often recommend them. but some families are raising concerns about safety and sharing alarming accounts of apparent side effects in their kids.\n\nan ongoing study is looking into the safety of the popular medication in response to reports that a number of children developed neuropsychiatric problems after taking miralax.\n\nthe researchers from the children's hospital of philadelphia (chop) are looking specifically at polyethylene glycol 3350, or peg 3350, the active ingredient in miralax and similar generic products. medications containing peg 3350 are not labeled for use in anyone under 17, but miralax is often recommended off-label by pediatricians to treat chronic constipation in kids — sometimes for extended periods of time, even though the label advises use no more than 7 days.\n\nwhile the fda awarded a grant to chop to investigate the possible side effects in 2014, the story is once again making headlines after a report from a local philadelphia news station voicing parents' concerns.\n\nfamilies told wpvi-tv that after taking miralax their children experienced mood and behavioral changes, including depression, anger, anxiety, and mood swings.\n\nwe saw a lot of the anger, a lot of the rage, a lot of the aggression, parent mike kohler told the station.\n\njeanie ward told the station her daughter nicole exhibited near psychiatric events with paranoia, mood swings, aggression, rage.\n\nit was horrifying to see my daughter change like that and to not come completely go back to normal, ward said.\n\na private facebook page called parents against miralax currently has over 16,000 members. we are a group of parents and family members who are very suspicious of peg 3350 and are here to discuss its effects on our children, the group states. we discuss alternative options and ways to talk to doctors about our opposition to this very dangerous drug.\n\nhow great a concern are such claims, and is there proof that miralax is the cause of the problems?\n\npediatric neurologist dr. jonathan mink, md, says that while the jury is still out, there are other likely scenarios that might explain the issues these parents reported.\n\ni see an awful lot of children who have neurobehavioral syndromes like tourette syndrome, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, autism, and anxiety and constipation is a common problem in those children, he told cbs news.\n\nthough the exact connection is unclear, the nature of these disorders likely has something to do with it, as nerve cells and muscles also control bowel function, explained mink, who serves on the executive committee of the american academy of pediatrics' section on neurology and is president of the child neurology society.\n\nthat raises the possibility that problems the parents observed may have been due to an underlying condition rather than the medication itself.\n\nthe question is, then, is this a coincidence? mink said. could this be an association where there's no cause-and-effect relationship?\n\nin 2014, the fda reported 167 adverse side effects in children who had taken miralax, 37 of which included neurological or psychiatric responses.\n\nbut after reviewing these cases, the agency said there was not enough evidence to change or add any additional warnings to the drug's label.\n\nto date, the agency's reviews of adverse event reports and medical literature indicate that the approved labeling for peg 3350 products accurately conveys their risks, and additional warnings regarding neuropsychiatric issues in children are not warranted at this time, the fda said in a statement. however, because many parents and physicians rely on these products to treat serious constipation, we have decided to fund research to better determine the benefits and risks associated with the use of these products in children.\n\nmink says he believes the study will eventually help provide more concrete answers. i think it's important that the study is going on to look into this because the concern has been raised, he said.\n\nhowever, for children with chronic constipation for which alternative treatments have not worked, mink says he believes miralax is likely safe to use.\n\nit's generally my recommendation to treat symptoms that are causing problems and not symptoms that are not causing problems, he said. my personal professional opinion is that i don't think it's likely that miralax is causing these symptoms.\n\nhe notes that although miralax isn't approved by the fda for use in children, it doesn't mean it is not safe.\n\nfor pediatricians and pediatric sub-specialists, there are many treatments that we offer to children who have very serious symptoms that have not been approved by the fda for use in children. and that's not because they're not necessarily safe for use in children, it's because the studies have not been done in a way that has led to fda approval, he said.\n\nchop issued the following statement in response to wpvi-tv's report:\n\nresearchers at children's hospital of philadelphia are conducting a study commissioned by the food and drug administration on laxative-use by children. we cannot comment on studies that are incomplete, nor can we comment on a particular child's circumstances. we will submit our findings to the fda upon completion of the study.\n\ncbs news reached out to bayer, the manufacturer of miralax, which issued the following statement: miralax is a safe and effective osmotic laxative that relieves occasional constipation. it is approved and labeled for use in adults and children 17 years and older for up to 7 days, unless otherwise directed by a doctor.\n\nthe company continues: while miralax is not labeled for use in the pediatric population, there have been many clinical studies conducted with peg 3350 in pediatric populations which have demonstrated safety for short and long term use in children with a history of chronic constipation. as part of bayer's ongoing commitment to consumer well-being, we regularly track, analyze and report all adverse event data related to the use of the product. results of this ongoing monitoring support the continued safe use of miralax.
by sunday morning contributing videographer judy lehmberg.\n\nin 2008 i was lucky enough to live in an apartment overlooking the ocean in cape town, south africa. while there i visited two oceans aquarium. i stared into the eyes of a big shark and saw nothing except darkness.\n\nsharks can be difficult to relate to. maybe that is part of the whole jaws problem -- that and the whole very toothy mouth problem. many of us think of sharks as gigantic, ruthless killers. they are indeed predators, but their reputation for killing humans is greatly exaggerated.\n\nnext to the shark exhibit in cape town's aquarium, a video was playing in which a woman looked out into the ocean and screamed. other beachgoers looked out to sea and began screaming and running away from the beach. there was what appeared to be a fin sticking out of the water. but it wasn't a shark. as it got closer the viewer could see a toaster floating at an angle. a toaster? then, as scared people look out to sea, an unseen voice boomed, faulty toasters killed 791 people last year; sharks killed nine. people kill over 100 million sharks a year.\n\nsharks don't have much obvious charisma, but they are an essential part of a healthy ocean ecosystem. so why are we killing more than 100 million of them every year? the answer is mostly for shark fin soup. we all know sharks have a reputation for being cruel, heartless killers, but in this case that honor goes to the hunters who catch sharks, cut off their fins and dump them back into the ocean to die -- for soup! killing 100 million sharks a year is not sustainable.\n\nsharks are relatively slow-growing, take years to reach sexual maturity, produce low numbers of offspring, and have long gestation times. all of those characteristics result in a slow reproduction rate. also, because they are apex predators, their decline has meant an increase in their prey population, particularly rays along the u.s. atlantic coast and grouper in the caribbean. the cow-nose ray eat bay scallops, oysters, soft-shell clams and hard clams. as these bivalves decline, so does water quality because there are no longer as many filter-feeders cleaning the water. the decreased water quality thus leads to increased algal blooms and dead zones.\n\nin the caribbean, the increase in grouper numbers results in a decrease in their prey, parrot fish, which typically eat algae from coral reefs. the increased algae populations smother the coral animals.\n\nthis change in animal numbers throughout the food chain is known as a trophic cascade. as the top predators (like sharks) decline, a cascade of negative effects ripples through the entire ecosystem.\n\na nurse shark. verne lehmberg\n\nsharks are not only necessary to maintain marine ecosystems; they are also a wonder of evolution. dating back at least 425 million years, they have survived three times longer than dinosaurs and hundreds of times longer than humans. sharks are ancient, but they aren't primitive. they are superbly adapted predators.\n\nsome of their adaptations include:\n\nampullae of lorenzini - these small, jelly-filled pores on sharks faces, particularly in the snout area, are electroreceptors, giving sharks a sixth sense that enables them to detect electrical activity at the cellular level. they know when another potential prey animal is nearby, even in dark or murky water.\n\na skeleton made of cartilage, not bone - this allows them to be extremely maneuverable in water.\n\na third eyelid - this nictitating membrane is used to protect their eye as they close in on potential prey.\n\nsharks don't evoke the same warm feeling as koalas and pandas in most people, but perhaps a respect for their ecosystem roles will increase our desire to protect them.\n\nin the meantime, watch out for those toasters!\n\njudy lehmberg is a former college biology teacher who now shoots nature videos.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\nto watch extended sunday morning nature videos click here!
when the german pianist, igor levit was selected as the featured soloist of the nobel prize ceremony last month, it marked yet another grace note in a career that's quickly grown filled with awards and honors. in line for a grammy later this month, levit is 33 and already among the brightest stars in the classical music cosmos. but lately, as the pandemic mutes and muffles so much music, levit's performances have been mostly streaming over twitter from his berlin living room. as igor levit plays in a new way to a new audience, he's reached a conclusion: music is not an extravagance, but a life necessity.\n\nigor levit is, to mix musical genres, a rock star. here he is inside london's royal albert hall, for the opening at the proms in 2017, one of the oldest and most anticipated festivals on the concert calendar. a typically glowing review described the performance as fiery, magical, and elegant. take a look at how levit curls over his instrument. at odds with every piano teacher's demand for perfect posture, it's almost as if levit is physically becoming part of the music he is conjuring.\n\nigor levit\n\njon wertheim: we sometimes think of musicians as-- they don't mind the isolation. they can be disengaged. i get the feeling, you need that connection with an audience.\n\nigor levit: i couldn't live without that. since my very childhood what i care about are people--\n\njon wertheim: always.\n\nigor levit: always.\n\neven in a vast and venerable concert hall, this german musician has a way of creating an intimacy with his audience.\n\nthen in march, the pandemic hit. his tour dates cancelled, that intimacy evaporated.\n\njon wertheim: in many ways, the lockdown turned your world on its head.\n\nigor levit: it's a disaster--\n\njon wertheim: -technicians and the lighting-\n\nigor levit: a disaster. agents, managers.\n\njon wertheim: what happens?\n\nigor levit: they lose everything from one day to the other. the loss is-- by 100%. it's a total disaster.\n\nit could have been a disaster for levit, a hipster, suddenly grounded at home in an edgy pocket of berlin.\n\nigor levit: i can't just make music for myself. it's just not-- not the-- not the way i operate. i can't, emotionally. so i had this idea to bring one of the most classic ways of music making, which is the house concert, to bring it, to try to bring it into the 21st century. so how do i do it? so i invite the people into my living room in the only way possible, which is through social media.\n\nfirst, he tweeted out an invitation to his followers.\n\nnext, he rushed out to buy a cheap camera stand, hastily rigged his iphone, self-administered a tutorial in live-streaming and then, it was showtime.\n\nthe first house concert drew a virtual crowd of 350,000.\n\njon wertheim: sounds kinda liberating.\n\nigor levit: it's completely transformed me, who i am, how i see the world,\n\njon wertheim: that would seem to dramatically change the boundaries between a performer and the audience.\n\nigor levit: it-- yeah, it was just me, no hall, no questions about acoustics, no questions about an instrument, no questions about, you know, pre-printed programs, nothing. no boundaries, just-- just myself and the people.\n\nhe had his classical repertoire, but added soul and jazz and rock.\n\nlevit during one of his online concerts.\n\nfor 52 consecutive nights of live concerts, his followers joined from all over the world, unbothered by the tinny sound of his piano when it lapsed out of tune.\n\nthey kept coming; he kept playing.\n\nigor levit: because of the pandemic. and so what usually must be right was wrong, and it didn't matter. 'cause just-- just the fact that there was music, no matter how it sounded. just the fact that there was some kind of togetherness. just-- just this was enough for people to feel better. it was enough for me to feel better.\n\nso much better, he next streamed what was less a challenge to his musical talents, than to his musical stamina. the vexations is not exactly a reliable crowd-pleaser.\n\nigor levit: the vexations, which is a very odd, very weird-- kind of non-music piece. it doesn't really make sense. starts with one hand alone, and you play a weird variation. then you play it-- same thing again. one hand alone, then you play another variation.\n\nfrench surrealist composer erik satie intended this piece to be played through 840 times. the repetition can be almost hypnotic, known to cause performers to hallucinate - one complained of seeing bugs crawling between the keys. levit played this piece for 16 hours straight.\n\njon wertheim: igor, that sounds like torture, not music.\n\nigor levit: well-- vexations, right? (laugh) i rest my case. and so i thought wow, that's the perfect match for this time.\n\nigor levit: and i could focus with this performance on the emotional and mental state of mind of my world, of the performance world which is hopelessness, confusion, and give, like, a silent scream, like the end of the third part of the godfather.\n\njon wertheim: you survived?\n\nigor levit: i not only survive, i was high as a monkey afterwards. i mean, i was-- i was just flying.\n\nlevit during the vexations performance\n\nlevit took flight early, playing beethoven's sonata no. 2, winning a prestigious rubinstein prize as a teenager. he was born in nizhny novgorod, russia, that's where he played his first concert with a full orchestra when he was 8 he and his family moved to germany as jewish refugees. his mother was a piano teacher but paired her talented son with a taskmaster who demanded levit practice that same beethoven's sonata no. 2, for years on end. levit says he was an angry and unhappy adolescent, who flirted with quitting piano.\n\nigor levit: i was a 15-year-old boy. like, i-- you know, i wanted to do all kinds of things, but not play the same piece over and over and over and over and over again.\n\nso how does a burned-out piano prodigy get his mojo back? channeling eminem and his single the way i am.\n\nigor levit: i am who i am. and i am. and the way i am just-- deal with it. and sort it out for yourself. so i would listen to the song like nonstop. walkman in my hand. it was, like, in a loop the rhythmical persistence, the-- the-- the lyrical persistence. it's so-- it's so beethovian, you know, in a way.\n\njon wertheim: slim shady's helping you--\n\nigor levit: slim shady--\n\njon wertheim: --understand beethoven?\n\nigor levit: understanding myself, yeah.\n\njon wertheim: beethoven obviously means a great deal to you. you said he's-- he's around you. he's in practically everything you do.\n\nigor levit: in-- in a weird way, beethoven's music is my safe zone. it's music which gives me, which gives the audience. the feeling of participation. at some point, you-- you get this feeling like, oh, this is about me. this is about me. like you know.\n\nigor levit: right.\n\njon wertheim: that's how you feel?\n\nigor levit: this feeling of sos, help, what is happening here. both for me as a player and for the listener. so i'm not trying to explain something to you. i wanna encourage you to understand hey, whatever you feel, it's-- it's you. it's your music. it's your piece. and so-- beethoven-- beethoven's music kind of creates this link between the player, the music, the audience. this triangle is enormously intense.\n\njon wertheim: and yet, you coulda played a different piece with that same triangle and a completely different range of emotions--\n\nigor levit: completely i could, you know, anything, you know?\n\njon wertheim: what about sadness?\n\nigor levit: well, that's a wide topic. i mean, what kind of sadness?\n\njon wertheim: say, mournful sadness?\n\nin a part of the world that knows a bit about musical genius, levit may be consumed by a composer born 250 years ago; but he is also the quintessential creature of the present. levit doesn't drive, but in between lockdowns in october, we tooled around with him on one of his many bikes.\n\njon wertheim: when did you feel like a german here? you came when you were 8 years old. immediately?\n\nigor levit: when i felt like a german?\n\njon wertheim: i don't know, when did you feel--\n\nigor levit: oh wow that's-- that, mr. wertheim, is a very german question.\n\nlevit takes his citizenship seriously. at a protest against the destruction of this forest last month, levit bundled up and played in solidarity — the environment is one of his many causes. he's adamant, as he puts it, not to be the guy who just pushes piano keys.\n\nwhen, a neo-nazi carried out a deadly attack outside a synagogue in the german city of halle in 2019, levit used his appearance at germany's most prestigious music award ceremony to speak out against right-wing extremism and anti-semitism.\n\nlevit has been told to his face that he has no right to be in germany. more alarmingly, before the pandemic, he received online death threats, forcing him to take the stage under armed police guard. his activist politics have provoked attacks on multiple fronts.\n\njon wertheim: as a jew you were an outsider--\n\nigor levit: correct. i will find you on that day in wiesbaden and will kill you while you're on stage. both of them take a rubber and try to erase you from-- from mother earth, both of them. one of them intellectually, the other one physically.\n\nthe sedate cocoon of classical music isn't accustomed to death threats and talks of erasure. but then again, igor levit cuts a singular figure. and, in the days of soaring covid rates and depleting concert dates—he plays on. in munich, we caught up with him for a rare performance that wasn't cancelled. there was no hum of anticipation in the lobby, no bustling coat check and the audience: it was restricted to just 50 people.\n\nmozart was on the menu. a canopy of notes, sharply rendered, filled the air, a measure of comfort in these uncertain times.\n\nproduced by michael h. gavshon. associate producer, elizabeth germino. edited by daniel j. glucksman.
part 1 of sunday morning anchor jane pauley's two-part interview with the vice president-elect:\n\ni was raised to not hear 'no,' let me be clear about it, said vice president-elect kamala harris. so, it wasn't like, 'oh, the possibilities are immense. whatever you want to do, you can do.' no! i was raised to understand many people will tell you, 'it is impossible,' but don't listen.\n\ni mentor a lot of people, and i tell them that there will be people who will say, 'it's not your turn, it's not your time. no one like you has done it.' and i'll tell them, 'and don't you listen.'\n\nand then i will go on to tell them, 'i eat no for breakfast!' she laughed.\n\nthere have been 48 vice presidents in the history of the united states, all of them men.\n\nuntil now. in three days, harris will become the first woman vice president – also, the first black vice president, and the first of south asian ancestry.\n\nthe former prosecutor, california attorney general, u.s. senator and soon-to-be vice president talks with jane pauley about her role in this unique moment in history, and looks back at the many firsts of her career. cbs news\n\ncbs news' jane pauley asked harris, are you excited about january 20th?\n\ni'm not gonna let anyone take my excitement from me, she laughed.\n\nbut she and president-elect joe biden come into office during some of the most troubled times our nation has ever faced: the pandemic, an economic crisis, and division made violently clear in the takeover of the capitol on january 6th. biden and harris will be sworn in surrounded by unprecedented security.\n\npauley asked, what are you anticipating on january 20th when, as a news person, i'm already seeing split-screen coverage of the 50 state capitol domes, where reports are that extremists are planning to be back here in d.c.?\n\nthis will be an inaugural like no other, in large part because of covid, harris said. but we are gonna get sworn in. and we're gonna do the job we were hired to do. and that means focusing, for example, on getting people vaccinated. we want to get 100 million done in the first 100 days. it's gonna be very tough to do it. we're gonna reopen the schools in a safe way. we have to get to the job of healing america.\n\nwhen biden said, i represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me, it was a mantra for him and harris. but the challenge they face was laid bare by the attack on congress, exactly two weeks before inauguration day.\n\npauley asked harris to describe january 6, a day when something seismic happened. may i ask, was the tv on? did someone say, 'madam vice president-elect, you gotta see this, come'? how did that unfold?\n\ni was at the capitol that morning, and then i was in a meeting, and i was told that i should leave. and then i was taken to a secure location, with my husband.\n\nwe watched in horror, harris said. you are absolutely right, it was seismic. it was an inflection moment. you know, sometimes we think an inflection moment is the bringing of something that is positive. no. it was in many ways a reckoning. it was an exposure of the vulnerability of our democracy.\n\nin a senate now split 50/50 between democrats and republicans, as vice president, harris will cast tie-breaking votes. a split senate has only happened three times before. this one comes after two democratic senate victories in the georgia run-off elections, just a day before the capitol takeover.\n\nstill, the obstacles to the incoming administration's long to-do list are enormous.\n\npauley asked, how can you look at that agenda without looking at it through the veil of what we saw on january 6th, when we saw – how did walt kelly put it in 'pogo' – 'we've seen the enemy, and it is us'?\n\nyeah, and it is us.\n\nand that is true no matter which side you are on.\n\nbut jane, this is not new. it is outrageous. and we will remember it like we have remembered some of the most significant [dates]. december 7th? we will remember, january 6th, there are certain things we are always going to remember as an attack on the foundations and the fundamental principles and ideals which we hold dear. yes, i agree with you in that regard. but come on! people walking around carrying the confederate flag? this is not a new display. we've seen this. we saw this over the course of the last four years, and we've seen it in our history, and the world's history before.\n\nit might seem that kamala harris was born for this moment in history. her father, donald harris, a jamaica-born economist. her mother, shyamala gopalan, a scientist from india. they met at the university of california at berkeley. they divorced when harris was seven, leaving her and her younger sister, maya, to be raised primarily by their mother.\n\nas harris acknowledged in her acceptance speech at the democratic national convention last year, she raised us to be proud, strong black women, and she raised us to know and be proud of our indian heritage.\n\nshe emphasized your black identity? asked pauley.\n\nshe was very deliberate about it, harris replied. i mean, my mother arrived in the united states at the age of 19, because she had a dream and a goal to end cancer. she wanted to be a scientist. and automatically, in the midst of those turbulent times, became very attracted to the civil rights movement. she was very active in the civil rights movement in the '60s and beyond. and she was acutely aware that she was raising her two daughters in an america where we would very likely be treated and approached based on our race and our gender. and so, my mother raised her two daughters to be very proud black women.\n\nduring the vice presidential debate, harris noted, growing up, my sister and i had to deal with the neighbor who told us her parents [said she] couldn't play with us because we were black.\n\nharris was bussed to integrated schools in berkeley. that little girl, who was part of the second class to integrate her public school, later attended howard, a historically black university; earned a law degree at the university of california, hastings college of the law; and set off on a path to politics.\n\npauley said, you've been the first everything you've ever been -- district attorney, attorney general of california, first, first, first. now, first black woman, first south asian woman – \n\nand first woman!\n\nfirst woman, okay! with belief in the power of government. and yet, as someone who prosecuted, excuse me, sex crimes, you knew those children, those teenage victims that you defended as a prosecutor, that you really couldn't change a great deal. how much do you expect in your first four years in the biden-harris administration? is a generation gonna be enough?\n\nlet me tell you, at the risk of sounding like an idealist, harris said, i used to have this debate with my mother. i'd say, 'oh, mommy, you're a pessimist.' and she'd say, 'you're an idealist.' and then i'd say, 'no, i'm an optimist.' and she'd say, 'well, i'm a realist.' so, i exist in the spectrum between being an optimist and a realist.\n\ni've seen some of the worst in human behavior, to your point. i was a career prosecutor, for a large part of my career prosecuting child sexual assault cases. i've seen some awful stuff, and i've seen some beautiful, great things. and so that's where i exist. and i'm clear-eyed. joe is certainly clear-eyed. we've got a big job in front of us, and it is not gonna be easy.\n\nan agenda further complicated by this past week's impeachment. biden and his vice president have elected not to weigh in on the next step in that process.\n\npauley asked, in february, will we still be talking about donald trump's presidency, through the impeachment process?\n\nlisten, harris replied, let me be very clear about my position on donald trump: i strongly believe that he is incapable of being president of the united states, that he has been incompetent. and that's why i ran against him, and that's why joe ran against him. so, this is not a statement about donald trump, but the american people deserve that in their president and vice president coming into office that we address the things that are weighing on them, and implement a plan. and that's what we're gonna do. it's not to the exclusion of many other things that need to be addressed around accountability, but that's our focus.\n\nwhen kamala harris takes office on wednesday, there will be yet another first, when we meet the nation's first second gentleman.\n\nclick here for part 2 of jane pauley's interview with kamala harris and her husband, attorney douglas emhoff.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by alan golds. editor: ed givnish.
intel (intc) ceo brian krzanich's sale of company shares only three months before the chipmaker disclosed security flaws could invite scrutiny from the securities and exchange commission, according to experts.\n\nlike many fortune 500 ceos, krzanich sells restricted stock and exercises options that he earns as compensation under a preset schedule with the sec, designed to avoid the appearance that he's profiting from insider information.\n\nkrzanich's latest sale on nov. 29, however, stood out for several reasons.\n\naccording to ben silverman of insiderscore, krzanich exercised options valued at more than $28 million and unloaded about 250,000 shares of restricted stock. this was a sea change from his previous sales from 2015 to 2017 that averaged between 35,000 and 79,000 shares, which he did under prior preplanned purchases. but in june last year -- months before krzanich's latest sale -- cybersecurity experts informed intel about vulnerabilities that would enable hackers to gain access to chips made by intel and others.\n\nthose flaws were revealed to the public just last week. since then, two u.s. lawmakers -- sen. jack reed, a rhode island democrat, and sen. john kennedy, a louisiana republican -- have asked federal regulators to open an investigation into the stock sales. the two made their demand in a letter sent tuesday to the securities and exchange commission and the justice department. intel says it will cooperate with any investigation.\n\naccording to intel, krzanich continues to hold shares of the tech bellwether in line with corporate guidelines. the company also defended how it disclosed the security issue.\n\nin this case, the security researchers presented their findings in confidence, and other companies and we worked together to verify their results, develop and validate firmware and operating system updates for impacted technologies, and make them widely available as rapidly as possible, according to a company spokesperson.\n\nkrzanich's sales, however, may be problematic.\n\nthe $64,000 question is what did he know, and when did he know it, said james cox, a professor at duke law school, who specializes in securities law. he added that the sec may take a closer look at krzanich's actions. i think his goose is cooked quite frankly, given how long the information was in the organization and his proximity to the information.\n\nexecutives at major corporations like intel have their insider sales scrutinized by both internal compliance departments and often by their personal attorneys, according to jacob frenkel, a former sec enforcement attorney. a spokeswoman for the sec declined to comment for this story.\n\nintel remains in damage-control mode following last week's disclosure of two vulnerabilities, dubbed meltdown and spectre, which could allow hackers to steal data from insider the memory of computers. most intel-equipped computers sold during the past two decades could be at risk. it isn't clear how many smartphones and tablets made by apple (aapl), samsung, qualcomm (qcom) and others that run on chips based on arm technology, may be affected.\n\nkrzanich opened his keynote talk monday night at the annual ces gadget show in las vegas by addressing the hard-to-fix flaws disclosed by security researchers last week. at an event known for its technological optimism, it was an unusually sober and high-profile reminder of the information security and privacy dangers lurking beneath many of the tech industry's gee-whiz wonders.\n\nsome researchers have argued that the flaws reflect a fundamental hardware defect that can't be fixed short of a recall. but intel has pushed back against that idea, arguing that the problems can be mitigated by software or firmware upgrades. companies from microsoft to apple have announced efforts to patch the vulnerabilities.\n\nand krzanich promised fixes in the coming week to 90 percent of the processors intel has made in the past five years, consistent with an earlier statement from the company. but he also added that updates for the remainder of those recent processors should follow by the end of january. krzanich did not address the company's plans for older chips.\n\nhardware vulnerabilities have been identified and exploited in the past, but what's unique about this is the pervasiveness of the vulnerability, said charles carmakal, a vice president with the cybersecurity firm fireeye's (feye) mandiant business. nearly all modern microprocessors are vulnerable. servers, workstations, laptops, mobile devices and others.\n\nthough the financial impact on intel likely will be limited, the security flaws will be a black eye to the chipmaker, according to raymond james analyst chris caso.\n\nenterprise server and cloud customers will naturally take this issue more seriously, and we would expect them to quickly identify any applications that would suffer from performance degradation after a patch is applied, he wrote in a client note. but in such cases, the most likely remedy would be to simply buy a new server.\n\noperating systems, public cloud service providers such as amazon (amzn) web services, device manufacturers and others have issued patches. the average computer user likely won't notice any significant change in performance after installing the patches, according to intel. so far, there is no evidence that hackers have exploited the vulnerabilities.\n\nhowever, just to be clear, that doesn't mean that it hasn't been exploited, carmakal said. we just don't have evidence of it yet. it's possible that we will later learn that this had been exploited in the past. with other types of vulnerabilities, we have learned of past exploitation after vulnerabilities had been publicly disclosed.\n\nif any such evidence does surface, it will only make krzanich's seat even hotter.\n\n--with reporting by the associated press.

pittsburgh -- new york jets cornerback darrelle revis faces five pending charges, including two counts of aggravated assault, after allegedly being involved in a fight with two men last weekend.\n\naccording to a pittsburgh police statement and a court document, the 31-year-old revis also is facing charges of robbery, terroristic threats, conspiracy to commit aggravated assault after the incident sunday at 2:43 a.m.\n\nrevis' attorney, blaine jones, said in a statement thursday that revis was physically assaulted while at that location by a group of at least five people. he adds that the jets cornerback feared for his safety and sought medical attention.\n\njones told the associated press once a warrant is issued, he will arrange for revis to turn himself in.\n\none of the other guys initiated physical contact, jones said. darrelle was walking away. he was in fear for his life and fear for his safety.\n\npolice say the alleged fight started when a 22-year-old man from kittanning, pennsylvania, not identified in the statement, spotted revis walking along east carson st. after revis confirmed he was the nfl player, the man started recording the interaction. revis grabbed the phone and tried to delete the video. another 21-year-old man from ross township tried to help the other man, but revis tossed the phone into the road, the statement says.\n\nan argument ensued, ending with another man helping revis, according to the police statement. police say the 22-year-old man and the 21-year-old man claimed they were punched and knocked out. according to police, the two men regained consciousness and spoke to authorities.\n\nofficers have reportedly obtained video from a cell phone belonging to one of the victims and confirmed the man involved was darrelle revis, cbs pittsburgh reports.\n\nwitnesses told police that the two men were unconscious for about 10 minutes. the responding officers viewed the video on the phone and confirmed that the person was revis.\n\nin his statement, jones said that revis, an aliquippa native, was in the pittsburgh area to visit family and friends last weekend. during the time of the incident, jones said revis went by a location in the southside that he is in the process of developing. that is when, according to jones, revis was assaulted.\n\nthe jets said in a statement that the team is aware of the incident and has spoken to revis, but issued no further comment.\n\nrevis was a star at the university of pittsburgh and was drafted no. 14 overall by the jets in 2007. he quickly established himself as one of the top players at his position - and in franchise history - while also earning the nickname, revis island for his penchant for routinely shutting down opposing teams' top receivers.\n\nhis second tenure with new york, after stints with tampa bay and new england, might be over after two seasons. revis is scheduled to make $15 million, including a $2 million roster bonus due on march 11, next season - but that would be a lofty salary for an aging player who admittedly had a subpar year that he attributed to age and injuries.\n\nthe jets would still owe him $6 million if they cut him as part of the $39 million in guarantees in the five-year, $70 million deal he signed with new york in 2015. revis, who could perhaps agree to a pay cut, has also entertained the idea of making a position change to safety.
will lightning strike twice for activist investor starboard value, this time in its fight for control of yahoo (yhoo)? the new york-based fund replaced the entire board of darden restaurants (dri) in 2014 following a similar battle for control of olive garden's corporate parent, which gives starboard credibility with investors in its battle with yahoo.\n\nas a general rule, proxy fights don't happen too often because they're expensive to organize and hard to pull off. they require activists to convince large institutional shareholders that they can run a company better than the existing management team. companies often will acquiesce to the activist investors by offering board seats to their representatives or through shareholder-friendly moves like stock buybacks.\n\nthey happen more frequently than in the past, said charles elson, a corporate-governance expert at the university of delaware. but he noted, it's difficult to replace an entire board.\n\ngiven yahoo's rocky history, however, starboard may find sympathy for its views among ceo marissa mayer's numerous critics on wall street, who have long argued that yahoo has been eclipsed in recent years by nimbler rivals such as google (goog) and facebook (fb).\n\nin fact, eric jackson, the head of activist investor springowl asset management, which has also targeted yahoo, told the the wall street journal that he looked forward to being wooed by starboard. a spokesman for starboard couldn't immediately be reached for comment.\n\nstarboard, which owns a 1.7 percent stake in yahoo, has been agitating for change at yahoo for 18 months and has said it has repeatedly been pushed away by the company's management team and board. the board, according to starboard clearly lacks the leadership, objectivity, and perspective needed to make decisions that are in the best interests of shareholders.\n\namong the failings starboard cites are the $2.3 billion yahoo has spent on acquisitions since 2012, including its $1.1 billion purchase of the tumblr blogging platform.\n\na few weeks ago, yahoo announced that it was putting itself for sale and was laying off thousands of workers. starwood and other critics have called for mayer's resignation, arguing her turnaround strategy has failed.\n\nverizon (vz) reportedly is interested in buying yahoo to merge it with aol's content business, which it acquired for $4.4 billion last year. at&t (t) and barry diller's iac/interactive corp (iaci) are said to be interested in yahoo operations. microsoft (msft), which made an unsuccessful 2008 bid for yahoo, might provide financing for a bid, though it has yet to make a decision about whether to proceed. according to starboard, the sale process is going too slowly.\n\ndespite what appears to be strong interest from large strategic and financial buyers as referenced in the media, starboard said, nearly two months have gone by since yahoo officially publicly announced its intention to pursue strategic alternatives for the core business, and it seems little progress has been made.\n\nhowever, mary-hunter mcdonnell, a corporate governance expert at the university of pennsylvania's wharton school of business, argues that the time isn't right to replace the entire yahoo board, especially because negotiations are ongoing with potential buyers.\n\nthis is an extremely young board in terms of tenure, she said. what starwood is doing is make suitors less willing to make their bids to this board.

new research suggests that pfizer's covid-19 vaccine can protect against a mutation found in two highly contagious variants of the coronavirus that erupted in britain and south africa. those variants are causing global concern.\n\nthey share a common mutation called n501y, a slight alteration on one spot of the spike protein that coats the virus. that change is believed to be the reason they can spread so easily.\n\nmost of the covid-19 vaccines being rolled out around the world train the body to recognize that spike protein and fight it. pfizer teamed with researchers from the university of texas medical branch in galveston for laboratory tests to see if the mutation affected its vaccine's ability to do so.\n\nthey used blood samples from 20 people who received the vaccine, made by pfizer and its german partner biontech, during a large study of the shots. antibodies from those vaccine recipients successfully fended off the virus in lab dishes, according to the study posted late thursday on an online site for researchers.\n\nthe study is preliminary and hasn't been reviewed by experts yet, a key step for medical research.\n\nbut it was a very reassuring finding that at least this mutation, which was one of the ones people are most concerned about, does not seem to be a problem for the vaccine, said pfizer chief scientific officer dr. philip dormitzer.\n\nviruses constantly undergo minor changes as they spread from person to person. scientists have used these slight modifications to track how the coronavirus has moved around the globe since it was first detected in china about a year ago.\n\nbritish scientists have said the variant found in the u.k. – which has become the dominant type in parts of england -- still seemed to be susceptible to vaccines. that mutant has now been found in the u.s. and numerous other countries.\n\nbut the variant first discovered in south africa has an additional mutation that has scientists on edge, one named e484k.\n\nthe pfizer study found that the vaccine appeared to work against 15 additional possible virus mutations, but e484k wasn't among those tested. dormitzer said it's next on the list.\n\ndr. anthony fauci, the top u.s. infectious disease expert, recently said vaccines are designed to recognize multiple parts of the spike protein, making it unlikely a single mutation could be enough to block them. but scientists around the world are conducting research with different vaccines to find out.\n\ndormitzer said if the virus eventually mutates enough that the vaccine needs adjusting – much like flu shots are adjusted most years – tweaking the formulation wouldn't be difficult for his company's shot and similar ones. the vaccine is made with a piece of the virus genetic code, rdna, that's simple to switch, although it's not clear what kind of additional testing regulators would require to make such a change.\n\nfauci agreed, telling axios that since there's lots of data on rdna-based vaccines, it is likely the fda would consider it merely a strain change, which doesn't require starting from square one.\n\nhe added, you always have to take these things seriously, follow them closely, and hope there will not be a problem. but, if there is, you have to adjust to it. and now we have the technology to do that pretty easily.\n\ndormitzer said this was only the beginning of ongoing monitoring of virus changes to see if any of them might impact on vaccine coverage.
by liz weston/nerdwallet\n\nthe best financial advice tends to apply to pretty much everyone. you don't need a spreadsheet of pros and cons and complex scenarios. what you need is a rule of thumb.\n\nthere's no shame in using one-size-fits-all advice. a study of west point cadets, for example, found teaching rules of thumb was at least as effective as standard personal finance training in increasing students' knowledge and confidence as well as their willingness to take financial risks. researchers found money rules of thumb were more effective than teaching accounting principles to small-business owners in the dominican republic.\n\nhere are a dozen shamelessly simple money rules of thumb i've collected over the years to help people address how they borrow and save.\n\n1. build up emergency savings\n\nyou need to be able to get your hands on cash or credit equal to three months' worth of expenses. the classic emergency fund advice — that you need three to six months of expenses saved — is great, but it can take years to save that much and you have other more important priorities (see retirement, below). while you build up your cash stash, make sure you have a plan b for a true emergency. that could be money in a roth ira (you can pull out your contributions at any time without paying taxes or penalties), space on your credit cards or an unused home equity line of credit.\n\n2. save 15 percent for retirement…\n\nif you got a late start or want to retire early, you may need to save more. run the numbers on your retirement plan. for most people, 15 percent including any company match is a good place to start. even if you can't save as much as you should, start somewhere and kick up your savings rate regularly. retirement should be your top financial priority. you can't get back lost company matches, lost tax breaks and the lost years when your money isn't earning tax-deferred returns.\n\n3. …and don't touch that money\n\nleave retirement money for retirement. when your retirement fund is small, you may feel like spending it doesn't really matter. it does. taxes and penalties will cost you at least 25 percent and likely more of what you withdraw. plus, every $1 you take out costs you $10 to $20 in lost future retirement income. once your retirement fund is larger, it may be easy to convince yourself there are good reasons to borrow or withdraw the money. there really aren't. leave the money alone so it's there when you need it.\n\n4. save for college\n\nget in the habit of putting at least $25 a month aside for college soon as your child is born. even small contributions to a 529 college savings plan can add up over time — perhaps the difference between choosing the best school and choosing a school based on its financial aid package. (but if you have to choose, retirement saving is more important. your kids can always get student loans, but as you've probably heard, no one will lend you money for retirement.)\n\n5. plan and manage your student loans\n\nyour total borrowing shouldn't exceed what you expect to make your first year out of school. at today's interest rates, this will ensure that you can pay off what you owe within 10 years while keeping payments below 10 percent of your income, which is considered an affordable repayment rate. what if you didn't limit your borrowing and are now struggling? you have options. look into consolidating your loans or income-based repayment plans.\n\n6. cars: buy used and drive it for 10 years\n\nnew cars are lovely, but they're expensive and lose an astonishing amount of value in their first two years. let someone else pay for that depreciation and take advantage of the fact that today's better-built cars can run well for at least a decade if properly maintained. you can save hundreds of thousands of dollars over your driving lifetime this way.\n\n7. car loans: use the 20/4/10 rule\n\nideally, you wouldn't borrow money to buy an asset that loses value, but you may not always be able to pay cash for a car. if you can't, protect yourself from overspending by putting 20 percent down, limiting the loan to four years and capping your monthly payment at no more than 10 percent of your gross income. a big down payment keeps you from being underwater, or owing more on the car than it's worth, as soon as you drive off the lot. limiting the length of the loan helps you build equity faster and reduces the overall interest you pay. finally, capping the size of the payments prevents your car from eating your budget.\n\n8. make credit cards work for you\n\nif you carry a balance, look for a low-rate card so you can pay off your debt faster and don't mess with rewards cards right now. if you pay in full each month (as you should), find a rewards card that returns at least 1.5 percent of what you spend. you should regularly review your rewards programs to make sure you're getting enough value from them. the programs can change, as can your spending and the way you use rewards. (check out this article for a lazy optimizer approach to maximizing your credit-card rewards.)\n\n9. square away your insurance\n\ncover yourself for catastrophic expenses, not the stuff you can pay out of pocket. insurance should protect you against the big things — unexpected expenses that could wipe you out financially, such as your home burning down or a car accident that triggers a lawsuit. you want high limits on your policies — and high deductibles, too. small claims don't make financial sense in the long run. you may gain some small insurance payments, but you risk a rate increase that could more than cancel out your gains.\n\n10. choose a reasonable mortgage amount\n\nif you can't afford the payment on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage, you can't afford the house. you may be able to save money by using another kind of mortgage, such as a hybrid loan that offers a lower initial rate. but if you're using an alternative loan because that's the only way you can buy the home you want, you may have set your sights too high. a budget-busting mortgage puts you at risk of spiraling into ever-deeper debt, especially when you add in all the other costs of homeownership.\n\n11. choose the right mortgage rate\n\nfix the rate for at least as long as you plan to be in the home. plans can change, obviously, but you don't want a big payment jump to force you out of a home you hoped to live in for years to come. if you're pretty sure you'll be moving in five years, a five-year hybrid could be a good option. if you think you may stay for 10 years or more, though, consider opting for the certainty of a 30-year fixed rate.\n\n12. back-burner those mortgage prepayments\n\nyou have better things to do with your money than prepay a low-rate, potentially tax-deductible mortgage. shaving years off your mortgage and saving money on interest sounds great. but before you consider making extra payments to reduce your mortgage principal, make sure more important priorities are covered. you should be saving enough for retirement. you should have paid off all other debt, since most other loans have higher rates and the interest isn't deductible. it would be smart to have that emergency fund built up as well and to be adequately insured. if you've covered all of those bases and still want to pay down your mortgage, have at it.\n\nthe article your money cheat sheet originally appeared on nerdwallet.\n\nmore from nerdwallet:
millersville, pa. -- administrators at a pennsylvania university hosted an open forum to address concerns about a photo circulating of two students in blackface.\n\nlnp news reports millersville university officials on monday night fielded concerns from students and apologized for unsatisfactory responses to the feb. 1 incident. officials say two female students wearing charcoal facial masks posted a snapchat photo with a black history month filter that read young, black & proud.\n\nseveral students at the forum criticized university president john anderson for his perceived inaction. others questioned the campus' climate and ongoing problems with discrimination. anderson promised to change the culture after apologizing to students.\n\nother administrators also spoke and acknowledged the school's shortcomings.\n\ncampus officials say the students in the photo could face judicial sanctions.
findings from a new linkedin survey show americans define success as being happy at work, rather than making more money. only 4 percent of workers say scoring a corner office is a measure of success and 34 percent say they'd be willing to take a 10 percent pay cut if it meant they could design their own work schedule.\n\nas part of our series looking at issues facing the american workforce, linkedin's career expert, catherine fisher, joined cbs this morning to discuss this shifting definition of success, as well as what motivates millennials and the rise in side hustles.\n\nfor many millennials, according to fisher, the ability to travel trumps salary.\n\nso while they're still motivated to have that financial stability, they also want to take some different risks so they can do what they love, which is traveling, fisher said. they view that as being successful.\n\nanother hallmark of the millennial workforce is the side hustle, or what another generation might call moonlighting.\n\nit's another job that's not your primary source of income and it's not your 9 to 5. so if you're not getting the passion you want from your 9 to 5 -- let's say you love teaching yoga but it's not going to help you pay your bills -- you do it on the side and that's a side hustle, fisher explained.\n\nmany workers are shifting their focus from getting a title bump to increasing their skill set.\n\nso with technology changing so rapidly and the different jobs associated with that changing, there's a fear that if you're not up to date on your skills and you're not keeping yourself open to opportunities you may miss the next big thing, she said.\n\nanother change the study found was the difference in what motivates men versus women.\n\nthe men are more interested in making it home in time for dinner whereas we saw an increase with women who want that next bonus and pay raise, she said.\n\nwhat's fascinating is we spend 90,000 hours over the course of our lifetime working. so that's half of your waking hours of working. and we really wanted to understand what motivates people, what gets them up in the morning, really what are people in it for, and they -- what they told us is that success means many different things to different people.

with people who were found to have the coronavirus. some decided to confine themselves to their homes after learning that an attendee at this year's conservative political action conference was diagnosed with covid-19, while others were in contact with constituents, friends, staffers or other individuals.\n\nbut within the last 24 hours, the number of lawmakers self-quarantining has nearly doubled as lawmakers were informed of diaz-balart's and mcadams' diagnoses.\n\namong those lawmakers include republicans on the conference's vote-counting team, including minority whip steve scalise of louisiana, chief deputy whip drew ferguson of georgia, and deputy whips tom cole of oklahoma and ann wagner of missouri.\n\nother members of congress who announced overnight they will be self-quarantining include democratic representatives kathleen rice of new york, kendra horn of oklahoma, matthew cartwright of pennsylvania, joe cunningham of south carolina, frederica wilson of florida, stephanie murphy of florida and anthony brindisi of new york.\n\nsteve dickson, the head of the federal aviation administration, has also decided to self-quarantine and work from home for seven days after having a brief interaction with diaz-balart before a congressional hearing last week, the agency said.\n\nthe centers for disease control recommends those exposed to the coronavirus quarantine themselves for 14 days from the last date of exposure, leaving lawmakers away from the capitol until the end of march.\n\nthe house is in recess this week, and house majority leader steny hoyer announced thursday that in light of guidance from the cdc, the house schedule would be adjusted.\n\nit is my intention that the house will not return to session until we are in a position to vote on the third piece of emergency legislation to respond to the economic impact, he said.\n\nthe senate is in session and is working with the white house on the phase three package designed to help americans and businesses hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nthe trump administration has called for gatherings to be restricted to no more than 10 people, and members of the public have been urged to limit their social interactions to stop the number of coronavirus cases from increasing. republicans and democrats are calling for house leaders to change the rules and allow for remote voting.\n\nmore than 50 lawmakers of both parties signed on to a letter to house speaker nancy pelosi and minority leader kevin mccarthy saying the house should hold itself to the same high standard that it is asking the nation: to put public health and safety first.\n\nremote voting is a key part of maintaining continuity of operations, they wrote. adopting rules today for the house to allow remote voting, as necessary, will allow every member to continue to vote and represent the concerns of their constituents as we address this crisis.\n\nhoyer said he shares the concerns of members regarding the number of lawmakers voting on the house floor and said expects that the house will adjust our voting procedures in order to follow the cdc's recommendations.\n\nno decisions have been made on exactly what these changes will be, but we will be discussing all options, he said.\n\nin the senate, senators dick durbin of illinois and rob portman of ohio introduced a resolution thursday to change senate rules and allow senators to vote remotely for up to 30 days during a national crisis.\n\nthe proposal has the backing of minnesota senator amy klobuchar, the top democrat on the senate rules committee.\n\nthe senate must do its job to protect the american people from the health and economic impacts of this pandemic. that means we need updated emergency plans including remote senate voting to ensure that we can pass legislation during any crisis, she said. as ranking member of the rules committee, i commend senators durbin and portman for their work on this proposal, and i will continue working with them to pass their bill to ensure our continuity plans address the reality of new threats.\n\nthe u.s. capitol and surrounding house and senate office buildings, meanwhile, are closed to the public for the time being.\n\nin the u.s., there are more than 9,000 reported cases of the coronavirus, with cases in all states. the death toll from the illness stands at more than 150.
anne stallings says she has been battling severe depression for most of her life. she tried anti-depressants and even electroconvulsive therapy, but nothing worked until she went to a potomac, maryland, clinic and tried ketamine, reports cbs news correspondent paula reid.\n\n\n\nit was like the fifth treatment in and i had come home from the grocery store and i was putting away the groceries and i was like, 'wow, this is how you don't feel depressed.' it was like from turning on a black and white tv to a color tv, stallings said.\n\n\n\nketamine was approved by the fda in the 1970s to sedate patients during medical procedures. it is more commonly known as an animal tranquilizer and in powder form as special k, a club drug used to get high.\n\n\n\ntoday, ketamine is being provided legally off-label to treat depression at an estimated 250 clinics across the u.s.\n\nanne stallings cbs news\n\ndr. steve levine offers intravenous ketamine infusions at several clinics around the country as an alternative to common anti-depressants. he says he treats about 70-80 patients across all the offices on any given day.\n\neverything for the past 50 years has been based on the chemical imbalance theory of depression which has never held water, levine said. so all these medicines, while they do help a lot of people, are based upon a flawed theory. and that is probably one of the reasons why they do take so long to work. they all take weeks to months to work so here is a medicine that people can take infrequently that is based upon a theory of the brain that makes a lot more sense and it works almost immediately.\n\n\n\nstallings didn't have time to wait. she had an especially hard time over the holidays and when her father got sick, she thought about taking her own life.\n\n\n\ni actually had suicidal ideations and the one thing about ketamine was that i was able to get in here emergently because i knew what was going on and when i left here my suicidal thoughts were gone, stallings said.\n\n\n\nthat is in line with what columbia university discovered in one of the largest studies yet on ketamine. researchers found the drug was significantly more effective than a commonly used sedative in reducing suicidal thoughts in depressed patients. the effects lasted up to six weeks.\n\n\n\ntwenty-two-year-old marc nelson ditched his antidepressants for ketamine and talk therapy. he says he now feels more like himself, but it came at a cost. he has spent more than $10,000 on treatments.\n\n\n\nso many different drugs that i am now off of all of them, which you know, the side effects were just not tolerable to me. they make me a zombie. i was not happy, nelson said.\n\n\n\nbut these infusions can have their own pitfalls. ketamine can cause people to feel detached from their bodies.\n\nmarc nelson receives a ketamine treatment cbs news\n\nthe 45-minute period of very floatiness, i sometimes get nauseous, nelson said. it's a very interesting process. ... i just lost my train of thought.\n\n\n\nonce the treatment was finished, nelson said he felt clear, cognizant and definitely able to pronounce his words again.\n\n\n\nasked to address critics who say he's making money by giving people the opportunity to get high, levine said, i would say that if you ask any of our patients none of them feel that they are getting high.\n\npeople tend to focus on the party use of ketamine, because it is more exciting, it's sexier in some way. it does it a disservice because that's a very small fraction of its use, levine added. and as far as the money making aspect of this, if you were doing things in the right way you're not gonna make a lot of money.\n\nketamine has piqued the interest of some major pharmaceutical companies. there are half a dozen drugs in development that mimic the way ketamine works, with some undergoing fda clinical trials for approval as antidepressants.\n\nfor decades, dr. gerry sanacora has been studying ketamine at yale.\n\ndr. steve levine cbs news\n\nwhat we're trying to understand is what does it change in the brain that allows that sustained anti-depressant like response? sanacora said.\n\n\n\nhe says the drug is not addictive in the way opioids are, but could still be harmful in the long run.\n\n\n\nthere is at least evidence in animal models that these type of medications can actually cause some structural damage in the brain. that's usually at higher doses, that's usually at longer term exposure but we don't know where that level is, sanacora said.\n\n\n\ndr. levine said he monitors patients closely.\n\nin our population even people who have been having ketamine on a maintenance basis for up to six years now we haven't seen any sign of that, levine said.\n\nbut for anne stallings, despite the unknowns, she's content with a chance to feel normal.\n\n\n\nif i can live a quality, happy life, and be productive, be able to go to work, to be able to have my family, to enjoy life – not walk through life but enjoy life – then it's worth it.
if this winter season was not very wintery where you live, you're certainly not alone — that was the experience for most of the people in the northern hemisphere. according to noaa, the winter of 2019-2020 was the warmest on record across all continents north of the equator.\n\nwith an average temperature 4 degrees fahrenheit above the 20th century average, this winter ranks first among the warmest winters on land in the northern hemisphere, beating the very mild winter of 2015-2016.\n\nnoaa\n\nup until now the 2015-2016 winter was the clear winner for warmth, but now it must split that distinction with this season. when you factor in the ocean surface in addition to land temperatures, 2015-2016 still holds the record. that's because that winter, the earth experienced a super el niño, overheating the surface waters of the equatorial pacific and radiating heat into the atmosphere. it's years like that where record warmth is expected. but there was no el niño to be found this winter, and yet, at least over land, it impressively still managed to exceed a super el niño year.\n\nas a result of the unusually warm weather this winter, seasonal rhythms have been thrown off kilter. as cbs news reported earlier this week, in places from moscow to the u.s. bears have been seen coming out of hibernation early. connecticut's beardsley zoo says its native black bears emerged in early march — almost a month earlier than usual.\n\nin much of the eastern united states, spring leaf out — the season's first blossoming of several plant species — has sprung more than 20 days early. in parts of the southeast, this year's spring bloom is the earliest in the 39-year record, according to the national phenology network, an organization that studies the impact of climate on nature's cycles.\n\ncbs news asked dr. theresa crimmins, director of the usa national phenology network, if such a widespread early arrival of spring is unusual. yes, she replied, this year stands out, because so much of the country is showing such an early spring. huge swaths of the southeast have had the start of spring arrive 2-3 weeks and more early.\n\nand the reason behind it? climate change is certainly at play — there is a clear trend toward an earlier start to spring, crimmins said.\n\na 2015 study led by cornell university's dr. toby ault found a regional trend in earlier leaf out, indicated by the orange colors in the map below, by up to 1.6 days per decade due to a warming climate on top of natural fluctuations.\n\nault et. al,, 2015\n\nwith recent temperatures reaching in the low 70s — 25 degrees above normal — flowers are starting to appear in new york's central park weeks early.\n\ntrees blooming in new york city's central park on an unseasonably warm day in march 2020. jeff berardelli\n\nthe early spring is getting a boost from a winter with very little cold and snow in most of the country and around the world. in the u.s., the winter was nearly 4 degrees fahrenheit above the 20th century average, ranking as 6th warmest since the late 1800s. washington d.c.'s snowfall was measly — less than an inch — and boston registered its second-lowest snow total on record.\n\nin the image below, the color brown indicates places that have seen less snow than normal.\n\nwinter of 2019-20 (djf) was not much of a winter as far as snowfall across the majority of the conus. there were some exceptions, but the rule was well below normal snowfall in many areas. pic.twitter.com/fkuqdj1pgm — greg carbin (@gcarbin) march 12, 2020\n\n\n\nthe warmth has been even more astonishing in europe. according to the copernicus climate change service, europe just experienced its warmest winter on record by far — 6 degrees fahrenheit above normal — shattering the old record by 2.5 degrees fahrenheit.\n\n📢february #temperature highlights from #copernicus #c3s: 🌡️last month was the second warmest february in our record, globally and for europe\n\n🌡️this winter was by far the warmest on record for europe, 1.4°c higher than next warmest winter more detail➡️https://t.co/mnuywtxels pic.twitter.com/wicnoxe1k5 — copernicus ecmwf (@copernicusecmwf) march 4, 2020\n\nthe warmth caused difficulties for reindeer herding in northern sweden, the failure of the ice-wine harvest in germany, and forced organizers to import snow for sporting events in sweden and russia. parts of russia near moscow experienced a winter of 10 degrees fahrenheit above normal.\n\nwhen viewed over a longer period of time, europe's record warm winter stands out even more starkly. compared to normal conditions at the beginning of the industrial revolution (1850-1900), before human-caused greenhouse gases started to warm the planet, this winter was a remarkable 8 degrees fahrenheit above normal across the whole continent.\n\ncopernicus climate change service\n\nsome of the warmer weather in the mid-latitudes of the u.s. and europe can be explained by abnormally strong polar vortex winds in the arctic, which lassoed cold air, trapping it far north. these sporadic strong polar vortex patterns are most likely part of a natural cycle.\n\nhowever, the broad scale and intensity of overall warmth across the northern hemisphere cannot be explained without climate change. each year more signs emerge that human-caused climate change is playing a bigger role. a peer-reviewed paper published march 10 in the journal geophysical research letters shows the climate-warming signal is becoming more apparent, with many regions already experiencing a climate which would be 'unknown' by late 19th century standards.\n\nthe speed of climate change is accelerating says dr. peter gleick, a climate scientist and founder of the pacific institute, a sustainability nonprofit in oakland, california.\n\nsadly, it is not a surprise to most climate scientists. we've seen this coming for literally decades and now it's upon us, said gleick, i expect there will be new, hotter temperature records broken over and over again in the future along with increasingly severe droughts and floods, rising sea levels, and worsening fire risks. there's no 'normal' anymore. and still our politicians dither. it's sad and disturbing to me.
new york - sam's club is offering free shipping for premium members and simplifying its membership tiers.\n\nstarting wednesday, walmart's (wmt) warehouse club will give free shipping on online orders for plus members on 95 percent of the items it sells. most shipping costs previously were based on the item's size and weight, the shipping method and the delivery address.\n\nfree shipping and faster delivery have been key areas as retailers try to adapt to shoppers' shift online. online leader amazon (amzn) is reportedly planning a new service to pick up packages from businesses and deliver them to consumers. meanwhile, target (tgt) late last year bought grocery delivery startup shipt to speed up same-day deliveries.\n\nsam's club is also converting its three membership plans into two. sam's plus will still carry a $100 annual fee, while the business and savings plans will convert to sam's club memberships with an annual fee of $45. the company is trying to better compete with rival costco wholesale (cost) by focusing on the more affluent customer. it has added more fresh produce and other higher-quality products.\n\nwe are creating a new sam's club for our members, said ceo john furner. he said the chain is targeting suburban families with children who have annual incomes between $75,000 and $125,000 -- which closely tracks costco's core customers.\n\nlast month, sam's club started closing 63 u.s. clubs and said it would convert up to a dozen of them to e-commerce fulfillment centers so it can be faster with deliveries. the idea is to get the fulfillment centers closer to the customers' homes.\n\nmaking change at walmart, a campaign backed by the united food and commercial workers international union, estimated at the time that the closures could affect about 10,000 jobs. sam's club executives said it's too early to tell how many workers who lost their jobs at the stores will get new positions.
northern syria — u.s. intelligence has confirmed isis was responsible for a an attack at a restaurant in the city of manbij wednesday that left four americans and more than a dozen others dead. manbij had been considered a relatively safe place. now, the bombing has underlined how isis remains a lethal force with widespread reach.\n\nthe attack happened around 150 miles from where u.s. troops and their allies have isis pinned down. as far as the terror group is concerned, any street in syria is the front line.\n\neven as isis is diminished on the battlefield, sleeper cells have increased attacks away from it, morphing from a territorial force to an insurgent terror network, launching hit and run attacks. a drive-by assassination of a kurdish commander took place in broad daylight along a road miles from any front line.\n\nahmed omar, a political adviser to the kurdish government, said the decision to withdraw 2,000 u.s. forces from syria has only emboldened the terror group. isis would not be finished — instead, they would just change their strategy and tactics, he said.\n\nwhile commanders here believe the final push against isis may be over in less than two months, no one dares predict what comes after that.
a dallas-based mahjong company is receiving some of the first pushback of 2021, as its creators are being criticized of gentrifying the game of mahjong. the mahjong line markets itself as a unique '' take on mahjong tile sets that represent the founders personalities, but they've been accused of trying to change a game that wasn't theirs to begin with.\n\nmahjong is a draw and discard game that requires 144 tiles adorned with chinese characters and symbols. the game originated in china, and still maintains massive levels of importance to chinese americans.\n\naccording to an earlier version of the mahjong line's about page — which has since been changed — founder kate lagere and two other white founders wrote that traditional mahjong did not reflect the fun that was had when playing with her friends. and nothing came close to mirroring her style and personality. none of the women involved are of chinese descent.\n\nwhat's happening? colonizers annie, bianca and kate have discovered a new and improved tile game, once known as mahjong but now is a reflection of their individual style and fun. this is a textbook example of #culturalappropriation so happy 2021 everyone. pic.twitter.com/eynpwmerfr — it's allergies not covid19, dear caucasian (@mskathykhang) january 4, 2021\n\nthe mahjong line's website lists 5 sets of redesigned tiles for sale, all eschewing the traditional mahjong tile look and replacing it with western images and arabic numerals. all the tile sets retail for at least $300. the company also sells various accessories, like a folio, the 2020 national mah jongg league card and a playing mat rack and pusher.\n\nhello i have just learned some white girls are gentrifying mahjong for $425 a pop and boy do i have the time today!!!!!!!! what is this absolute nonsense!!!!!! pic.twitter.com/ztoxsq0yll — gina mei (@ginamei) january 5, 2021\n\ntweets about the company have received thousands of impressions online, with commenters focusing on the women's lack of chinese heritage and disregard for the origins of the game.\n\ntwitter user jeremy lee wrote, my culture is one of the oldest civilizations in the world. it is a product of thousands of years of tradition and history. it is not, he added some cheap coloring book that can be filled-in and be 'made pretty' by the standards of privileged teenyboppers.\n\nlol who are these white women gentrifying mahjong pic.twitter.com/clgjkptvex — chris gayomali (@chrisgayomali) january 4, 2021\n\ncleansing the timeline with my grandma's mahjong table pic.twitter.com/zloephufpe — yulin kuang (@yulinkuang) january 5, 2021\n\nfollowing tuesday's outcry, the company suspended comments on its instagram page and their website now features a reworked about us page.\n\non tuesday, the company released a statement apologizing for failing to pay homage to the game's chinese heritage. using words like 'refresh' were hurtful to many and we are deeply sorry, read the statement. it's imperative our followers know we never set out to ignore or misrepresent the origins of this game and know there are more conversations to be had and steps to take as we learn and grow.\n\nin a statement to cbs news, the founders said they are committed to working with those who can further educate us on the chinese origins of the game so that its deep-rooted traditions are not lost in the american take on it moving forward.
a powerful storm that lashed the caribbean before it barreled into florida in september prompted the national weather service to issue a warning amid false reports of a category 6 storm: keep your eyes out for fake forecasts. at least one meteorologist sought to set the record straight: there is no such thing as ... a category 6 or higher hurricane, he posted on facebook.\n\nthe saffir-simpson hurricane wind scale, which is used to estimate potential property damage, rates hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on a storm's wind speed, according to the national hurricane center. the scale tops out at category 5 for any hurricane with sustained winds of 157 mph or higher. but that september storm, hurricane irma, hit 185 mph, breaking the atlantic ocean record, and other parts of the world have seen even worse.\n\nnow, the mounting intensity and lifespan of tropical cyclones has sparked the question among climate scientists: is a new classification needed? should there actually be a category 6 storm?\n\nclimate scientists meeting in new zealand have floated the idea, the guardian reports.\n\nsince the scale is now used as much in a scientific context as it is a damage assessment context, it makes sense to introduce a category six to describe the unprecedented strength 200 mph storms we've seen over the past few years both globally [patricia] and here in the southern hemisphere [winston], said climatologist michael mann, director of penn state university's earth system science center.\n\nscientifically, [six] would be a better description of the strength of 200 mph (320km/h) storms, and it would also better communicate the well-established finding now that climate change is making the strongest storms even stronger, he said.\n\njames shaw, new zealand's climate change minister, said the only reason 2016's winston -- the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the southern hemisphere -- wasn't a category 6 was because there is no such category. but we might need one in the future, shaw said at the conference in new zealand, the guardian reported.\n\nhowever, chris brandolino, the principal scientist at the national institute of water and atmospheric research in new zealand, said, if we are seriously to consider this it requires a holistic approach, looking at the whole scale, not just adding a category.\n\nmaybe the whole scale gets rejigged to reflect the times, brandolino said.

2016, when it went to $11 an hour. the latest increase is part of a plan that phases in minimum wage hikes across new york state, with amounts and effective dates varying by region and industry. it's not just a new york phenomenon, however: minimum wages rose in 20 states with the new year, forcing businesses across the country to grapple with higher payrolls -- and compete for workers with giants like amazon that are already offering $15 an hour.\n\njon bloostein operates six new york city restaurants that employ between 50 and 110 people each. the owner of heartland brewery and houston hall, bloostein said the effect of the higher minimum wage on payroll across locations represents an immense cost to his business.\n\nwe lost control of our largest controllable expense, he told cbs moneywatch. so in order to live with that and stay in business, we're cutting hours.\n\nbloostein said he has scaled back on employee hours and no longer uses hosts and hostesses during lunch on light traffic days. customers instead are greeted with a sign that reads, kindly select a table. he also staggers employees' start times. these fewer hours add up to a lot of money in restaurants, he said.\n\nbloostein said he has increased menu prices, too. so as a result [of the minimum wage hike], it will cost more to dine out, he said. it's not great for labor, it's not great for the people who invest in or own restaurants, and it's not great for the public.\n\na new york city hospitality alliance survey of 574 restaurants showed that 75 percent of full-service restaurants reported plans to reduce employee hours this year in response to the latest mandated wage increase. another 47 percent said they would eliminate jobs in 2019. eighty-seven percent of respondents also said they would increase menu prices this year.\n\nthese types of cost-cutting moves coincide with a u.s. labor department report released last friday showing full-service restaurants in december raised prices the most since 2011, to cover soaring labor and food costs.\n\nthe money has to come from somewhere, and we found that unfortunately, as a result, businesses are making some really tough decisions which don't only impact them, but have a negative impact on their workers as well as their diners, too, said andrew rigie, executive director of the new york city hospitality alliance, which represents restaurants and nightlife venues throughout the five boroughs.\n\nbut shaving workers' hours and killing jobs limits restaurateurs' ability to offer employees opportunities for growth and development. it also can kill owners hopes of offering a fine-dining experience that delivers both good food and good service.\n\nservers also bus tables\n\n\n\nsusannah koteen, who opened lido restaurant in harlem in 2011, said she has already started combining jobs to reduce workers' hours. she relies on servers to bus their own tables, eliminating one of the lowest-paying customer-facing jobs.\n\nshe explained her rationale: a server can bus their own table, but you can't ask a busboy to open a bottle of wine and talk about what it can be paired with, she said.\n\nkoteen said she's loath to cut these kinds of positions in a community she cares about and from which she has in the past promoted low-wage workers to management positions. our current general manager started as a busser the day we opened. english is not his first language, he has his ged. he is smart, hardworking and cares about customer service.\n\nshe also worries that the wage mandate will discourage operators and change the restaurant landscape in new york city.\n\nif you make it impossible for people to operate, they have to close or take drastic measures or really cut people back. at some point people aren't going to be opening because you have to look at the bottom line, she said.\n\nstaff layoffs diminish quality\n\n\n\nsome businesses are finding other ways to trim costs while retaining their staff.\n\nmarc sherry, co-owner of the 1860s-era old homestead steakhouse in manhattan, said he never considered reducing his staff in response to the wage hike.\n\nthe increase in the minimum wage is in effect, but it was never in our business plan to lay off staff because if we lay off staff, we aren't able to maintain the quality and experience we have brought for the last 150 years, he said.\n\nthis way he avoids turnover, which can be costly to a business. employee retention helps customer retention, said holly sklar, founder and director of business for a fair minimum wage.\n\nand workers are customers too, economists point out.\n\na wage hike would help put money into the hands of people who have no choice but to spend it, said heidi shierholz of the economic policy institute.\n\ninstead of cutting jobs, sherry spending more time looking for better food prices and trimming nonfood expenses, including the restaurant's phone and electric systems.\n\nyou look at every avenue of business to save money, sherry said, but never cut staff from the kitchen, bar or front of house because that ruins the experience we have been known for.
by any measure, the 2019-2020 australian bushfire season was catastrophic — burning 46 million acres, killing more than 1 billion animals and racking up an estimated price tag in the tens of billions of dollars.\n\nit has been widely understood by the climate science community that the hotter, drier conditions linked to climate change were a driver behind the extreme fire season. now a new study released wednesday by a group of leading scientists confirms those suspicions: human-caused climate change did indeed make the fires in southeast australia worse.\n\nit is highly unlikely that an extreme fire season like this would have happened without human-caused climate change, the study's lead author, geert jan von oldenborgh, of the royal netherlands meteorological institute, said in a phone conversation with cbs news.\n\noldenborgh was one of a team of 17 climate scientists from a collaborative group called world weather attribution (wwa), which conducted the study. the wwa was founded in 2015 to perform forensic analyses on extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts and floods.\n\nyou can think of attribution as a sort of csi — climate scene investigation — in which scientists attempt to separate what's natural from what's human-caused in these extreme events. so far the collaboration has investigated 230 extreme events around the world, including 2019's tropical storm imelda in texas which dumped 43 inches of rain.\n\ncommenting on the importance of climate attribution studies, co-author dr. friederike otto, from oxford university in the u.k., said, we do not need to do an attribution study to know that climate change is happening, but to understand what climate change means where people live, we do.\n\npart of what attribution studies do is use specialized computer programs to model what would happen under different climate conditions.\n\nin the computer simulations, otto explained, we can take these greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere of our different climate models, and so we can simulate possible weather in the world that might've been. in a hypothetical example, otto said, it might be that in the world today it's a 1 in 10 year event but in a world without climate change its a 1 in 100 year event. then we can attribute this change in likelihood to climate change because that's the only thing that's different in these two worlds we look at.\n\nto examine climate change's real-world impact, this forensic analysis involved investigating the change in probability of australia's heat, drought and the fire weather index since 1900 by looking for trends in both observations and climate computer simulations. both methods must be blended together to draw robust conclusions about the impact of climate change.\n\nthe fire weather index is based on weather conditions like temperature, wind, humidity and rainfall combined with the moisture content of vegetation, or lack thereof. this numerical index is used worldwide to estimate fire danger.\n\nexamination of the trends in real-world observations revealed somewhat different results than the climate model portion of the study, but both point to a human fingerprint of varying degrees on the extreme bushfire behavior.\n\nthat human impact is piled on top of two naturally occurring patterns which made for abnormally hot and dry conditions in australia. in fact, 2019 was both the hottest and driest year for australia on record.\n\nhere are some specific results of the study:\n\nobservational analysis shows the 2019-2020 australian heat wave was 10 times more likely now than in 1900 because of greenhouse warming. in addition, statistical analysis of real-world observations indicates that the probability of a fire weather index as high as the 2019-20 bushfire season's was at least 4 times higher now than in 1900.\n\nthe climate model portion of the study was also revealing. using 11 large state-of-the-art climate models, the team calculated the current and future global heating impact.\n\nas a result of human-caused climate change, the team showed the intensity of this season's fire weather index in australia was at minimum 30% more likely than in 1900, with such an event becoming, on average, 80% more likely in the models\n\nvon oldenborgh stresses that the model results are likely an underestimate. models always underestimate the increase in chances for extreme fire risks such as australia saw in the last few months. this means we know the effect is larger than 30% increase lower bound, which is already a significant influence of global warming.\n\nrunning those models into the future — to the point when global temperatures rise to an average of 2 degrees celsius above pre-industrial times (a mark we may hit by 2050-60) — the chance of fire weather like this season's would be 4 times more likely than it is today.\n\nit is worth noting that the team did not find a significant trend in dry extremes or mean precipitation in either the observational or the model analysis. instead, most of the increase in likelihood of extreme fire weather is driven by heating. that's because more heat causes more evaporation which dries out soil and vegetation.\n\nit's breathtaking and heartbreaking the damage that's been done. … a tipping point is playing out right now, the world-renowned climate scientist dr. michael mann, from penn state university, said in an interview with an australian tv network. by chance, mann happened to be on sabbatical in australia studying bushfires during the most intense part of this fire season.\n\nin response to the results of the study, he told cbs news he agrees that the models are underestimating the trends. current-generation climate models are simply not up to the task of extreme event attribution. they are not capturing key atmospheric mechanisms behind these extremes that are almost certainly being influenced by climate change.\n\npeople ask me, is this a new normal for australia? it's worse than that, mann said. for australia, dangerous climate change is already here. it's simply a matter of how much worse we're willing to allow it to get.
the following is a transcript of an interview with former fda commissioner scott gottlieb with cbs news' margaret brennan that aired sunday, march 8, 2020, on face the nation.\n\nin his interview, gottlieb warned of the seriousness of the virus as the administration appeared lax in its characterization of the pandemic. gottlieb told cbs: this is not the flu. china didn't shut down their economy because they had a bad flu season.\n\nmargaret brennan: joining us now is former fda commissioner dr. scott gottlieb. good to have you back on the program.\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: thanks a lot.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to pick up where we just left off with the surgeon general who said right there at the end that they are switching strategies. they are no longer looking to contain the virus. they're looking to mitigate it. does that me- does that mean they're acknowledging what they've been doing is not working?\n\ndr. gottlieb: well, we have an epidemic underway here in the united states. there's a very large outbreak in seattle. that's the one we know about, probably one in santa clara or maybe other parts of the country, other cities. and so we're past the point of containment. we have to implement broad mitigation strategies. the next two weeks are really going to change the complexion in this country. we'll get through this, but it's going to be a hard period. we're looking at two months probably of difficulty. to give you a basis of comparison, two weeks ago, italy had nine cases. ninety-five percent of all their cases have been diagnosed in the last 10 days. for south korea, 85 percent of all their cases have been diagnosed in the last 10 days. we're entering that period right now of rapid acceleration. and the sooner we can implement tough mitigation steps in places we have outbreaks like seattle, the- the lower the scope of the epidemic here.\n\nmargaret brennan: let's talk about mitigation because when i asked governor inslee what he is doing and i asked him a few ways if he'd consider doing what italy just did,--\n\ndr. gottlieb: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --which is essentially trying to- i mean, they're quarantining a quarter of their population in the most economically vital part of their country. this is a massive decision for them to have made. when i asked him about doing something like that in washington state, he said, well, they're talking about more distancing and--\n\ndr. gottlieb: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: -- more measures like that. is it just that it- governors like him don't want to say out loud that we may have to do something like what italy did?\n\ndr. gottlieb: well, i think no state and no city wants to be the first to basically shut down their economy. but that's what's going to need to happen. states and cities are going to have to act in the interest of the national interest right now to prevent a broader epidemic.\n\nmargaret brennan: shut down their economy? you mean--\n\ndr. gottlieb: close businesses, close large gatherings, close theaters, cancel events. i think we need to think about how do we provide assistance to the people of these cities who are going to be hit by hardship, as well as the localities themselves to try to give them an incentive to do this. right now, if there's no economic support to do this, you don't want to be the first to go. and i think you're seeing that. this exposes one of the challenges of our federal system that we leave a lot of authority to state and local officials. and there's a good- there's good reasons why. but in a situation like this, we want them to act not just in their local interests, but the national interests, i think we need to think about both trying to coerce them. we can't force them but also try to provide some incentives in terms of support. and we're going to end up with a very big federal bailout package here for stricken businesses, individuals, cities and states. we're better off doing it upfront and giving assistance to get them to do the right things than do it on the back end after we've had a very big epidemic.\n\nmargaret brennan: are you telling the white house to do these things? you used to work in the administration.\n\ndr. gottlieb: i'm still having discussions with people in the administration. i've been saying this publicly for, you know, weeks now. i think we should try to get ahead of this right now.\n\nmargaret brennan: the president said this morning in a tweet, we have a perfectly coordinated and fine-tuned plan at the white house for our attack on the coronavirus. and he said, the news media is doing everything possible to make us look bad. i'm asking you this not because i'm a member of the media, but because we were trying to suss out what reality is, versus anxiety for the public. is this a perfectly fine-tuned plan and is what people are hearing on the news, as the president said, just to make him look bad?\n\ndr. gottlieb: we have a narrow window of opportunity to implement tough measures to try to push down the scope of the epidemic. what you want to do is you want to put- put in place mitigation steps to reduce the peak number of cases you have to get them below the point at which the health care system gets exhausted. because what happened in wuhan, china, was the health care system got exhausted and fatalities rose quickly. what we need right now in terms of a good plan is a systematic approach to what you do in terms of mitigation steps and when cities should be implementing that. when--\n\nmargaret brennan: and you don't see that happening yet?\n\ndr. gottlieb: there is no systematic plan for when a city should close schools, when they should tell businesses that they have to telework, when they should close movie theaters and cancel large gatherings. we leave these decisions to local officials, but we really should have a comprehensive plan in terms of recommendations to cities and then some support from the federal government for cities that make that step, make that leap, if you will.\n\nmargaret brennan: so- but just on the anxiety question here, the administration has compared this to the flu. is that how people should be thinking about this?\n\ndr. gottlieb: no, this is not the flu. china didn't shut down their economy because they had a bad flu season. the case fatality rate here is going to be higher all through the age ranges. this is a more severe disease. now, it's true that- that you don't see the full spectrum of disease that you see with the flu where some people get a mild disease, some people get a moderate disease, some people get more severe disease. here you're seeing a- a more binary response. some people get a mild, moderate disease and some people get very sick. but for the people who get very sick, this could be a very dangerous disease. the case fatality rate is probably going to be about 1 percent. and it's not just older americans, as tragic as that is. and we shouldn't dismiss the burden that this is going to place on older americans. if you look at 40 year-olds, the case fatality rate has been anywhere between point two and point four percent. so that means as many as one in 250 40 to 50-year-olds who get this could die from it.\n\nmargaret brennan: and this data is based on what? on china?\n\ndr. gottlieb: this data is based on reporting out of--\n\nmargaret brennan: on south korea?\n\ndr. gottlieb: -- south korea and china. remember, when you look at the south korea data, the case fatality rate in south korea right now is 0.6. but the time to death is three to six weeks. and most of the cases were diagnosed in the last 10 days. time to hospitalization is nine to twelve days. so, most of these people in south korea haven't worked through the severe stages of this- of this disease. the case fatality rate will go up. and i'll- one more point, you have to make a distinction between the case fatality rate and the infection fatality rate. we talk in medicine about the case fatality rate: how many people who get the disease will die? some people are talking about the infection fatality rate. how many people who get the infection will die? that's not what we focus on in medicine because we know that some people will get the infection but not be symptomatic. we typically don't count those. we count people who get the disease. and for that, the case fatality rate probably- it might not reach one percent in our system, but it might get close to that. it's not 0.1. and that's the seasonal flu. and it's not .05 and that's a mild flu season.\n\nmargaret brennan: and to get there, you need the adequate number of tests out there and testing to happen--\n\ndr. gottlieb: which we're getting.\n\nmargaret brennan: which we're getting there.\n\ndr. gottlieb: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. thank you very much--\n\ndr. gottlieb: thanks a lot.\n\nmargaret brennan: --for your insight. we'll be back in a moment with our political panel.
it's a tight and fluid race heading into the final week in iowa for a lot of reasons. bernie sanders is attracting 26% support, with joe biden at 25%, as the top preferences of likely caucus goers. pete buttigieg is right there within striking distance at 22%. elizabeth warren has 15% support and amy klobuchar has 7%, but because of the way caucuses work, these are critical numbers with implications for the race.\n\ncandidates receiving 1% or less support in the poll are not pictured.\n\nparty rules make 15% the typical cutoff for awarding delegates, and supporters can shift to other candidates if they don't reach this threshold. so, it's critical to look at voters' second choices and who else they're considering, too.\n\njoe biden could get a boost from his status as the second choice of those backing amy klobuchar, as well as from those polling lower. if they move to him on caucus night, he could see gains. meanwhile, warren is right on the line, and her backers' second choice is sanders, more so than biden or buttigieg. that would mean sanders could stand to pick up even more delegates if warren backers don't make the cut in some places. if warren holds at her current level or gains, this race will remain tight. all told, the caucuses look like they might very likely be decided by these kinds of local-level movements.\n\nin any case, this could amount to about the same handful of delegates being parceled out among these candidates, so the real prize out of iowa would be, as ever, attention and bragging rights.\n\nit's not just the caucus arrangement that keeps iowa a fluid race, it's the voters, too: just over a third of those expressing a candidate choice say they've definitely made up their minds. sanders has the most solidly committed supporters, and this has been true in recent weeks: 48% say they've definitely made up their minds. that's higher than biden's 27% definite supporters, which is a potential vulnerability for biden in the final stretch. another is that his supporters are relatively less enthusiastic than those of other top candidates; fewer than half are.\n\nkeeping buttigieg squarely in the mix are, in part, older democrats — among whom he is second only to biden — and would-be first-time caucus-goers, on whom he is especially dependent.\n\nbiden leads on perceived ability to protect the u.s. from terrorism, and 84% of democrats say he's prepared to be commander-in-chief – though this measure doesn't really explain the caucus vote, since even those who are not backing him overwhelmingly think he's prepared. about two-thirds of democrats say warren and sanders each are prepared. buttigieg lags all the other top-tier candidates on this preparedness measure.\n\nsanders outpaces the field on being seen as someone who fights for people like you — and warren and buttigieg both do better than biden on this metric.\n\nmost iowa democrats do not think candidates who have to be in washington for the senate impeachment trial will suffer much of an impact on their fortunes in iowa.\n\nbiden and sanders have improved on their perceived electability among iowa democrats in recent weeks. more now think each would probably win against president trump than said so earlier this month, particularly of biden. democrats are more confident (71%) now than they were in november (62%) that the party will nominate someone who can defeat the president.\n\nall of the four top candidates are seen as being able to handle political attacks from mr. trump at least somewhat well, but sanders leads on handling them potentially very well. however, elizabeth warren has dropped on this measure since october.\n\nmajorities see the leading five candidates as being consistent in what they stand for. sanders does best on this (88%), followed by buttigieg (80%), klobuchar (75%), warren (70%) and biden (66%). the sanders campaign's questions about biden's past votes seem to have resonance with sanders' own backers; democratic voters who say they have given a lot of consideration to a candidate's past votes in congress pick sanders as their first choice. but relatively few democrats (30%) make past votes a top criterion in deciding who to support.\n\namid the recent dust-up between sanders and warren about whether a woman can win, 54% of iowa democrats say it would be harder to beat mr. trump in november if the nominee is a woman. it is biden supporters who are the most likely of the top-tier candidates' backers to say it would be harder. and democratic women are more likely than men to think it would be harder for a woman to defeat trump.\n\nwhen making their decision on whom to support, iowa democrats cite policy positions as the most important factors, chief among them their health care proposals, followed by economic policy positions and their approach to climate change. foreign policy ranks lower, as does a candidate's personal qualities.\n\nacross the super tuesday states — the big delegate haul that comes after opening contests in iowa, new hampshire, nevada and south carolina — the top tier remains biden, sanders, and warren. warren currently polls better across those contests than she does in iowa, bolstered by support from college-degree-holding and post-graduate voters, and she runs even with sanders among the very liberal.\n\ncandidates receiving 1% or less support in the poll are not pictured.\n\nmichael bloomberg is advertising and campaigning in the super tuesday states, and while still trailing the top tier, bloomberg is now marginally ahead of buttigieg across these states. bloomberg is helped, in part, by doing better than buttigieg among black democrats. no one is close to biden among this group, but bloomberg is the first choice of 10% of black voters and the second choice of 12%. black voters are more likely than white voters to feel that he could handle attacks from mr. trump well. both black and hispanic democrats are more likely than whites to see bloomberg as fighting a lot for people like them.\n\nthese cbs news surveys were conducted by yougov between january 16-23, 2020. a representative sample of 2,500 registered voters in iowa was selected, including 1,401 self-identified democrats, as well as registered voters who lean democratic or plan to participate in the democratic caucus this year. a representative sample of 14,575 registered voters was selected in 14 states expected to hold primaries on super tuesday (alabama, arkansas, california, colorado, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, north carolina, oklahoma, tennessee, texas, utah, vermont, virginia). this sample includes 8,593 democrats, and registered voters who lean democratic or plan to vote in their state's democratic primary. both samples were weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based upon voter registration lists and the u.s. census current population survey, as well as 2016 presidential vote. likely voters were determined using a model that takes into account self-reported likelihood of voting, along with other individual- and aggregate-level factors. the margins of error are 3.9 points in iowa and 1.6 points in the super tuesday sample.\n\nfull results: super tuesday states\n\niowa
the climate is changing, and so are the turtles.\n\na study published monday in the journal current biology about green sea turtles that nest along island beaches near australia's great barrier reef found that turtles born in areas most heated by climate change are 99.8 percent female. turtles born farther south, along a cooler beach, are only about 65 percent female.\n\nthe result isn't surprising if you know a bit about turtle biology, but it is alarming. sea turtles, like these green sea turtles (chelonia mydas), don't have genetically determined sexes, the way mammals do. instead, the researchers wrote, in sea turtles, cooler temperatures produce more male hatchlings while warmer temperatures produce more females.\n\nan egg in hot sand is more likely to produce a female turtle, and an egg in cool sand is more likely to produce a male. [in photos: tagging baby sea turtles]\n\na photo provided by the australian government shows baby sea turtles crawling toward the surf on raine island. state of queensland\n\nthe pivot temperature where a population will turn out 50 percent females and 50 percent males is based on genetics and varies with species and even individual nesting groups, the researchers wrote. turtles seem to target their breeding periods to times when the sand is slightly warmer than their pivot temperatures, resulting in populations moderately skewed female. but shift the temperature of that period just a few degrees and the resulting baby turtles will be not just a bit female — instead, hardly a male will appear in the whole group.\n\ndue to climate change, raine island — the site of the key breeding ground in this study — has warmed significantly since the 1990s, the researchers wrote, likely accounting for the hard female skew.\n\nso, the researchers developed a new technique: studying the turtles' hormones.proving that the increasing temperatures actually changed the turtle population proved challenging, though. turtles don't wear signs of their sex as obviously as humans; researchers can't tell just by looking between their legs. and the easiest method — cutting them open — isn't really an ethical way to approach an endangered turtle population.\n\na genetic test won't offer any insight into a given turtle's sex, since sea turtles don't carry their sexes in their genetic code. but the researchers found that if they brought blood plasma samples back to their lab, they could use hormonal differences to distinguish male and female turtles.\n\nit's not clear yet, the researcher wrote, how exactly the wild female swing will impact the sea turtles' future. males breed far more often than females, but researchers don't know to what extent the handful remaining can make up for all their missing brothers. it's also possible, the researchers wrote, that females will seek out mates in cooler climates to the south.\n\nour study highlights the need for immediate management strategies aimed at lowering incubation temperatures at key rookeries, the researchers wrote, to boost the ability of local turtle populations to adapt to the changing environment and avoid a population collapse — or even extinction.\n\noriginally published on live science.
the milwaukee bucks have fired head coach jason kidd after three and a half seasons, the team announced monday. kidd recorded 139 wins and 152 loses with the bucks. assistant coach joe prunty will serve as the team's interim head coach for monday's game against the phoenix suns.\n\nthe bucks are on a four-game losing streak heading into monday's game and currently sit in eighth place in the nba's eastern conference with 23 wins and 22 loses.\n\ngeneral manager jon horst said the organization appreciates everything that kidd has done but we have decided to make a coaching change.\n\nwe believe that a fresh approach and a change in leadership are needed to continue elevating our talented team towards the next level, bringing us closer to our goal of competing for championships, horst said, acknowledging that kidd guided the team to two playoff appearances and played a role in keeping the team in milwaukee. we thank him for all of his contributions and wish him the best.\n\ngiannis antetokounmpo of the milwaukee bucks dribbles the ball against the indiana pacers on january 8, 2018 in indianapolis, indiana. andy lyons / getty\n\nthe bucks were eliminated in the first round of the nba playoffs in the 2014-15 and 2016-17 seasons.\n\nbut this year, the bucks have sky-high expectations for making a championship run due to a talented roster led by mvp candidate giannis antetokounmpo and point guard eric bledsoe, who the bucks obtained from the phoenix suns in november.\n\nciting anonymous sources, espn's adrian wojnarowski first reported news of kidd's firing before the official announcement.\n\nin a letter to fans, horst said he made the decision to fire kidd with unanimous support of the team's ownership. we believe that making this change now is important for the organization and gives our players the best chance to reach their full potential this season and beyond.\n\nkidd coached the brooklyn nets during the 2013-14 season and went 44–38.\n\nkidd is also a leading nominee for the naismith basketball hall of fame's class of 2018. kidd was a 10-time all-star and helped the dallas mavericks win the nba championship in 2011.
beijing — with just days left for the trump administration, secretary of state mike pompeo has lifted a nearly four-decade policy that unilaterally restricted official u.s. government visits to the democratic island of taiwan. pompeo faulted the policy as an attempt to appease the communist regime in beijing, adding for emphasis: no more.\n\nthe state department quickly put the policy change into practice, announcing that u.s. ambassador to the united nations kelly craft would visit taiwan this week.\n\ntoday, i am lifting all self-imposed restrictions on executive branch agencies'

freedom & democracy, wu added.\n\nthe change in u.s. government policy toward taiwan sets the stage for craft's visit — the first by a u.s. ambassador to the united nations in half a century, since taiwan was formally excluded from the u.n. in 1971. craft is scheduled to land in taiwan on wednesday.\n\nyears of shifting policy\n\nthe policy update is the latest in a string of u.s. moves that have drawn taipei closer to washington, and it comes after global recognition for the island's vibrant democracy and its success in containing the coronavirus.\n\nin august 2020, u.s. secretary of health and human services alex azar became the most senior u.s. government official in decades to visit taiwan and meet president tsai ing-wen — and to draw beijing's condemnation. he was also the highest-level u.s. cabinet official to visit the island since 1979, when washington formally cut ties with taipei via a series of agreements with beijing.\n\nin january 2017, then president-elect donald trump accepted a phone call with president tsai — a move that infuriated beijing and set the course for four years of warming u.s.-taiwan ties, and proved to be yet another point of contention in the deteriorating u.s.-beijing relationship.\n\nbiden and the road ahead\n\nvictor gao, a veteran international affairs analyst and chair professor at soochow university, called taiwan the most important and the most sensitive issue in china-u.s. relations.\n\nhe told cbs news on monday that by changing u.s. policy, pompeo was completely disregarding and distorting history and current geopolitics in claiming the previous u.s. administrations since nixon had been kowtowing to china regarding taiwan. the overwhelming majority of the countries in the world and all the international organizations acknowledge there is only one china... taiwan is not a separate and independent country, but a part of china. pompeo will not succeed in his attempt to change this reality in the world.\n\nnine days before president-elect joe biden takes over the white house, other chinese scholars in beijing were cautious about the positions he may take against china.\n\nbeijing prepares for the worst when it comes to the changing u.s. policy on taiwan and ambassador craft's looming visit, sun zhe, director of the center for u.s.-china relations at tsinghua university told cbs news.\n\nhe said that while a single visit cannot change the current cross-strait relations, he was not sure what biden will do, but he has been careful in handling the taiwan issue in the past.\n\nwhen then-president george w. bush sought to defend taiwan in 2001 against an increasingly aggressive beijing, sun noted that biden was cautious, and i think he will be more prudent.\n\ncraft's visit constitutes a major action [by the] trump administration… to erode extraordinarily [the] u.s.' one-china policy, which it has done since early 2018 and accelerated much since april 2020, professor shi yinhong, former director of the center on american studies at renmin university of china in beijing, told cbs news. the biden white house, he added might continue the process in essence, with less pace and intensity.\n\ncbs news' grace qi contributed to this report.
as the coronavirus promises to strain the nation's supply chains, top white house trade adviser peter navarro says he's delivering an executive action to president trump intended to decrease u.s. dependence on foreign pharmaceuticals and medical equipment and bring that manufacturing to the u.s.\n\nwhat i can speak to is this broader, interesting issue of how dependent the united states of america is on the global supply chain, not just for its medicines but for its medical supplies and medical equipment, navarro told cnbc's squawk box monday, as stocks plummeted amid the worsening economic impact of the virus.\n\nnavarro, in a recent interview with cbs news, said the impending executive action he has been working on would tighten domestic procurement by requiring federal agencies looking to purchase pharmaceuticals and medical equipment to buy american. the medical supply chain has been a concern — face masks and other necessary medical equipment are made in china, where this strain of coronavirus is believed to have originated. navarro is also pushing for a payroll tax cut to address the country's worsening economic outlook, an initiative that mr. trump has repeatedly called for, despite pushback from bipartisan lawmakers.\n\nthe executive action consists of a three-pronged strategy that includes the buy american piece, streamlining regulations to allow for a quicker approval process for domestic products, and incentivizing new technologies. the goal of the order is to have a robust domestic production of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment on u.s. soil, navarro said.\n\nthe best way to ensure adequate investment is to provide a stable, strong, long-term demand domestically for these products, navarro said.\n\nthe health and human services, defense and veterans affairs departments would be most affected by the possible change. navarro argues the coronavirus crisis highlights that the u.s. is dangerously dependent on numerous nations for medicines, supplies and equipment, roughly 15 to 20 countries, not just china. the top trade adviser said the previous administration wasted numerous opportunities to address this in the face of crises that underscored this dependence, such as during the h1n1, sars and mers crises.\n\nthis executive order would target essential medicines and medical countermeasures— not just pharmaceuticals, but supplies and equipment needed to deal with emerging infectious diseases, as well as medical products and the supply chains that feed into those two categories, according to navarro.\n\nessential medicines refers to the over 400 medicines the world health organization has identified as essential for any nation to have. medical countermeasures are products that the united states has identified to fight five threats: chemical, biological, radiation, nuclear, (cbrn), and emerging infectious diseases like covid-19. this includes medicines, supplies such as face masks and gloves, and medical equipment like ventilators.\n\nthe executive action is expected soon — navarro says it will be done in trump time, meaning as soon as possible.\n\nthis president wants to bring our jobs home. this is especially important when our national defense and public health are at risk, navarro said.\n\nprashant yadav, a visiting fellow at the center for global development whose expertise is in global health supply chains, said such a possible executive order comes down to how it's implemented. the pharmaceutical industry should be encouraged to increase their resilience, meaning they should be encouraged to have more bandwidth to manufacture drugs on u.s. soil.\n\nwe need to build resilience into the supply chain, undoubtedly, yadav said.\n\npharmaceutical and medical supply companies should be required to demonstrate to the food and drug administration that they're working towards building more resilience into the supply chain, he said. resilience in practical terms means ensuring companies have at least two suppliers, sourcing for instance 50% of their products from new jersey and 50% from china, he said.\n\nthe manufacturing of medicine and medical supplies is highly concentrated in china not necessarily because the cost of labor is cheaper, as many might think, but because of the availability of subsidies, the lower cost of capital, better access to utilities, and lower environmental standards, he said.\n\nit's not the cleanest manufacturing industry, yadav said, pointing to stricter environmental regulations in europe and in the u.s.\n\nnow, the greatest supply chain concern for the u.s. lies in the future: will the u.s. be able to deliver all the pharmaceutical drugs and medical equipment the u.s. will need? whatever production capacity there is now in the u.s. and in europe, yadav said he has less confidence in whether that capacity will remain available over the next few months, as workers at manufacturers may not be able to go to work.\n\nventilators in particular are a concern, since orders for them at health care facilities will increase as the coronavirus continues to spread. the trump administration has been unable to say how many ventilators it thinks the country will need in the weeks and months ahead.\n\noverall ventilator capacity and what we need in europe or the orders that will keep coming in from italy and france, orders from within the u.s. ... they will all aggregate up to quite a high number, which may be more than the current capacity of existing manufacturers, yadav said. so we might have to think about bringing on board new manufacturers who might not be certified or approved to sell medical equipment in the united states, but we might have to think about how we bring them on board.\n\nyadav said the u.s. should also consider giving companies that produce ventilators a guarantee that if they overproduce ventilators months from now, the federal government will purchase them, or purchase them and allocate them to developing countries hit by the pandemic later in the year.\n\nthat brings me to another point, which is, in such a scarce capacity scenario, we also worry about the limited supply is going to be sucked up by what we need in the u.s. and what we need in europe, and in such a scenario, what happens to a country in africa which is also ... trying to buy ventilators, yadav said.
after living on the international space station for 340 days, astronaut scott kelly says it was easier to spend nearly a year in space than to get used to gravity again back on earth.\n\nkelly is still getting used to walking on earth again. the soreness is just one of the effects of spending nearly a year in zero gravity, reports cbs news correspondent manuel bojorquez.\n\nyeah, my legs are not feeling good, kelly said. my legs are a little swollen still from the fluid that shifts up to our heads and space gets now pushed back down on my legs. \n\nbut that wasn't the toughest part of the experience.\n\ni think it's, you know for me, it's being away from your loved ones, your friends, your family, kelly said. a year is not short, but it was very rewarding, it was enjoyable, it was something that i feel privileged to having got to do.\n\nnasa is testing the effects of long duration in space travel on the human body for a future mission to mars, and kelly came with a huge bonus - an identical twin, astronaut mark kelly, who could be studied on earth to highlight how the time in space impacted scott. for example, when he landed, scott was taller than his brother.\n\nthis was his fourth time in space. kelly said he expects differences between him and his brother because this trip was much longer than his previous flight of 159 days.\n\nbut while he wasn't busy with more than 400 experiments, kelly had fun.\n\nat one point, he floated around in a gorilla costume - all, he says, for a more personal mission to inspire the next generation of space pioneers.\n\ni think it's part of our job, our responsibility to do that as the public face of nasa, kelly said. and anything we can do to get them excited about studying science, math, engineering, technology is something we should be doing.\n\nkelly posted more than 700 stunning images on social media. the view struck him too, and kelly said the year in space has impacted him beyond the physical differences.\n\ni'm normally more of like the tough fighter pilot kind of guy, but... i think i'm a little more compassionate now, kelly said. i think it does change you when you spend all this time removed and detached from earth. and you follow what's going on on earth, and mostly what the news reports is not good stuff... we should be doing better. we can do better. we've got this great planet down there. let's take care of it and let's do a better job.\n\nkelly also said the one thing he thoroughly enjoys is being able to sit down at a table to eat without worrying about his glass and fork floating away.
a historic moon mission is setting the stage for a new space race, this time between the u.s. and china.\n\nthe chinese chang'e 4 lander captured the orange-tinted landscape on the far side of the moon wednesday, becoming the first space probe to ever land there. it's a breakthrough that, as cbs news' mark strassmann reports, may intensify the u.s.-chinese rivalry.\n\nchina intends to be a space power – to walk on the moon, and eventually, establish a lunar base.\n\nwhat a change it's been from a year ago, several years ago, when the question was, can china innovate? can china keep up? and now it's more of a question of are they reaching parity and what happens next? said isaac stone fish, an expert on u.s.-china relations.\n\nall six crewed apollo flights beginning in 1969 landed on the moon's near side. twelve men, all americans, left flags and footprints. the last time was in 1972, as nasa then shifted its focus to low-earth orbit.\n\nin 2017, president trump signed space policy directive no. 1: the moon is again america's top spaceflight priority.\n\nit's time to take all of what we've learned on the international space station and go the next step for a permanent presence on and at the moon, said nasa administrator jim bridenstine.\n\n\n\nwe're the only nation that's done it. all these other nations want to do it, bridenstine said.\n\nhe believes a lunar presence is critical to deeper space exploration.\n\nso this gives us an opportunity to prove how are we going to live and work for a lengthened period of time on a world that's not our own, bridenstine said.\n\n\n\nnasa's planning for a solar-powered mini-space station to orbit the moon called the lunar gateway, the next step to a mars mission. partners will include other countries and other companies. their competition? china.\n\nwe are reaching a new era of u.s.-china relations that seems to be more defined by competition than collaboration … and a space race could certainly be a part of this future, isaac stone fish said.\n\na glimpse into that future just landed on the far side of the moon.
the following is a transcript of an interview with aarp ceo jo ann jenkins that aired sunday, january 3, 2021, on face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: we turn now to jo ann jenkins, she is the ceo of the american association of retired persons. you know it as aarp and she's at their headquarters in washington this morning. good morning to you.\n\namerican association of retired persons ceo jo ann jenkins: good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: december was a very deadly month during this pandemic, particularly for nursing home residents. the federal government plan is to have pharmacies like cvs and walgreens set up clinics to vaccinate inside of these facilities. and it started in about 36 states just this past week. is it moving fast enough?\n\njenkins: well, i think by every meas- questionable that it has not moved fast enough that, you know, 40% of the people who have died in this country live in nursing homes. and so, we see this really as an unconscionable national disaster that 350,000 people in this country have died from covid-19 and 40% of them have lived in nursing homes or work in nursing homes, and yet they only represent 1% of the population. so, no, we're not moving fast enough.\n\nmargaret brennan: i didn't hear a lot of specifics from- from the governor or from the head of operation warp speed on what they want to change. and i'm wondering from you what your view is, because we did hear earlier in the week from operation warp speed saying that some nursing homes aren't vaccinating until they have enough doses for everyone in the facility. that's a federal requirement. should the government suspend it?\n\njenkins: well, i think that, you know, if you look at the data and the fact that that's where people are dying, you have to come to the conclusion that they should be doing everything that they can to be administering this vaccine as soon as possible. i know that there are 2.2 million doses that have gone out to nursing homes, and yet only 13% of that has been administered. and so we have to find a solution and, you know, we need to stop pointing fingers and looking at who- who's to blame. and really all of us, whether it's mayors or governors or the federal or governors all across this country to really try to fix this problem.\n\nmargaret brennan: so that's a yes, they should lift that requirement?\n\njenkins: absolutely. yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: at- at the state level you- you heard a debate about whether the age qualification should be lowered more quickly, like it has been in texas and in florida. would you ask other governors to do that?\n\njenkins: well, i think if you look at the data of where people are dying and if, in fact we can stop people from dying of covid, we know that that will offer some relief to the hospitals all across this country. we have examples that we're hearing from thousands of our members, particularly like those in florida, who are standing in lines of 300, 400 of them at three and four o'clock in the morning trying to- to get that vaccination. i think that we have to really solve this issue and really come together so that there is some standard for which the states and the local nursing homes know how they're going to get this vaccine and what it is they're supposed to be doing.\n\nmargaret brennan there's confusion. i mean, i know people who- who ask, where do i find out when i qualify? what do you tell your members? do they call their doctor? do they get an email? who do they ask? their local health department?\n\njenkins: well, i think one of the things that we've tried to do at aarp is, you know, we have aarp.org/coronavirus where we're listing everything that we have from the states about what- how the vaccine, the priorities in each of the states, how they're going to be able to get their vaccinations. clearly, we're hearing directly from our members that they're confused about whether or not they should be calling their physician, whether or not someone's going to contact them, which of the vaccines should they be trying to take if they live in rural america or in an urban city, just how that's going to happen. and i think that there could be some simple clarity and transparency about what is to be expected, the time frame that individuals all across this country should be thinking about. clearly, we need to keep up the protections of wearing masks and washing our hands and doing all of those things. we shouldn't let our guard down. but there needs to be further clarity about and- and expectations set about when this- vaccines are going to be administered widely.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you think that staff in nursing homes should be mandated to take the vaccine?\n\njenkins: well, i think that the data tells us that that's where the deaths are occurring and that for patients and people who work in nursing homes, they need to be protected in a way. but clearly, it's not- it's not ours to- to mandate a vaccine--\n\nmargaret brennan: so, governors- governors would have to mandate that, right? is that what you're asking governors to do?\n\njenkins: well, i think that we're saying to the governors that- that- this is a way to bring it under control and that while we at aarp don't have the authority to- to mandate this, that this is one of the one of the only ways that we had that we know that this- this particular covid-19 disease can be brought under control.\n\nmargaret brennan: right and it may come down to employers. jo ann jenkins, thank you very much for- for sharing what you're seeing out there. we'll be right back with a look at tuesday's georgia senate race. it's an important one. don't go away.
a new book, we: a manifesto for women everywhere, presents a manual for change that questions why women today are prone to self-criticism, and looks at how the rates of depression and anxiety among women are skyrocketing.\n\nco-authored by award-winning actress gillian anderson (best known for playing fbi special agency dana scully on the x files) and journalist jennifer nadel, we (published by atria books, which is owned by cbs) can be seen as a counter to the me culture.\n\nappearing on cbs this morning, anderson said, this book is a rallying cry for women to put a different set of values at the center of our lives, values that are antithesis to that, that are based on kindness and honesty and compassion and courage -- the courage to stand up for ourselves and for our fellow human beings, so that we can build bridges instead of walls.\n\nand what is necessary to accomplish that? one of the things that we talk about in the book is really about self-care, she said. when we start getting honest with ourselves and we start making time for ourselves, it's easier for us to go out in the world and be kinder and show compassion to other people.\n\nwe, a new book by actress gillian anderson and journalist jennifer nadel, teaches how to combat a hostile culture with such attributes as honesty, courage, trust and joy. cbs news\n\nnadel added that women need to stop pretending -- to others and to themselves.\n\nso many of us put on this face as we go out, she said. we might wake up at 3:00 in the morning and think, 'what are we doing here? i can't deal with my life,' and then we put our makeup on and go into the world and start pretending. and if we talking honestly about how we really are, then we can begin to start developing the world that actually meets our real needs, not those that we're faking.\n\nthe book explores nine principles (honesty, acceptance, courage, trust, humility, peace, love, joy and kindness) that can serve as a compass for women seeking direction. without them, life can feel like a losing battle, they write. when you've learned to incorporate them into your life, you'll be able to live from a place of authenticity and love wherever you find yourself and whatever has happened in your past.\n\nof the first principle, honesty, they write:\n\nimagine what it would be like if we all told the truth about what it is to be female.\n\nif we stopped pretending when we feel fine when we felt vulnerable.\n\nif we stopped hiding our needs to appear 'likeable.'\n\nhonesty is such a huge part of the book, nadel said. of all of the principles, it is a foundation. it seems very important that we were willing to get as honest ourselves to encourage other women to get honest.\n\nthese are principles that ought to apply to men, too, said co-anchor charlie rose.\n\natria books\n\nin fact, the men who have read this book have absolutely loved it and have said, 'what about me?' to which we say, 'well, you're welcome to take them and use them,' nadel said.\n\nbut at this moment in history, you know, women are still lagging far behind men, and particularly at this moment our rights are under threat. so we've written it for women, but the principles are universal. and you're welcome to them!\n\nthe book also calls for women to read together and discuss the principles, which will accelerate the pace of change, nadel told cbs news.\n\nit creates momentum. this is about movement building, and a lot of people at the moment are saying, 'what can i do about the political situation?' and this is one thing they can do, nadel said. find other women, read the book with them, share the ideas and encourage others to do the same.\n\nanderson spoke of her experience speaking out for equal pay while starring in the x-files, one of the hottest shows on television (for which she won an emmy and a golden globe), as she was being paid less than her co-star, david duchovny.\n\nit was quite scary at the time to make that decision, anderson said. we were shown that it's not okay to speak up, as women were often silenced. there's a lot of backlash, and then there is the normalization of backlash. when i did actually speak up, the amount of responses that i got from women, ultimately empower women. and so when we can stand up and show what is unacceptable to ourselves and society, then it's a good example.\n\nit was how many years before you were able to say we should be making the same pay? asked co-anchor norah o'donnell.\n\nwell, initially when i had this fight with fox was a few years into the [series], and i finally won parity, anderson said. but then when we did the new six episodes in 2015, i was offered less than half of my co-star, which completely boggled my mind. i eventually got there, but it was really important.\n\nshe admits that she was afraid of angering the man and shaming the woman who were in charge of making that decision.\n\nanother topic of we is depression. according to the national alliance on mental health illness, women are 70 percent more likely to experience depression than men.\n\nnadel talked of one event at a time when she was living in a 'when ... then ...' way, as many of us do -- when i get the job, when i get the kids, when i get the relationship, then i'll be happy. and i had it all. and i was sitting there with my two kids throwing their pureed baby food at me and i got the call to go to downing street, which is what every journalist wants to get, and i just looked at my kids and thought, 'i can't do that, i can't go. even though this happens every day, i need to be here.'\n\nand then my life unfolded -- massive depression, burnout. and from that, great gifts.\n\nyou said the outside can look really great, but if you're not happy on the inside nothing works, said co-anchor gayle king.\n\nit's true, it's true, nadel replied. and so often we compare how we feel on the inside with how someone else looks on the outside, which just makes us feel more even more miserable and lonely.\n\nto read an excerpt from we: a manifesto for women, visit the simon & schuster website.\n\nfor more info:
whole foods market is reducing paid breaks from 15 minutes to 10 minutes for many of its more than 90,000 workers, with the policy shift coming as retail and other front-line employees contend with surging covid-19 cases in their communities.\n\nworkers at whole foods stores in southern california, the mid-atlantic, the midwest and the south who'd previously been given 15 minute breaks during their shifts will now get 10 minutes of paid down time instead.\n\na group of whole food employees called whole worker union called out the new rules on social media, saying the time now being allowed for breaks includes coming and returning from the break room.\n\n🚨 whole foods just reduced their paid break time from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. this includes the time when you are coming and returning from the break room. pic.twitter.com/oszaeidwtr — whole worker union #blacklivesmatter (@wholeworkerwfm) january 10, 2021\n\nwhole foods' workers in many states get two paid breaks during a typical eight and a half hour shift. they'll now have 10 minutes less to rest each work day.\n\nthe upscale grocery chain and amazon subsidiary confirmed the new rules, saying the goal is to make break policies uniform for all its employees at 487 stores in 12 regions. workers previously had differing break times. now, the same rest- and meal-break rules will apply to all, according to the company.\n\nmost whole food workers will benefit from the change, according to the grocery chain.\n\nthis updated policy will provide the vast majority of team members with more break time throughout their work day. it is part of our ongoing work to streamline regional policies and processes in order to create clear and uniform policies for team members across all regions, a whole foods spokesperson told cbs moneywatch in an email.\n\nthe move comes roughly eight months after whole foods cut the extra $2 an hour in hazard pay for employees coming to work during the pandemic. amazon in june announced $500 bonuses for workers, including at whole foods.\n\ngrocery store deaths\n\nthe united food and commercial workers union, which does not represent whole foods workers, on tuesday said a new surge in grocery covid outbreaks — specifically in southern california and the seattle area — have heightened the risks facing workers.\n\namong the ufcw's members, there have been at least 124 grocery worker deaths from covid-19 and at least 23,100 workers infected or exposed, the union stated in an email.\n\nlike many other companies, amazon and its subsidiary don't disclose the number of employees who've died or been infected by covid-19.\n\none former employee, katie doan, was fired from her job stocking shelves at a whole foods in tustin, california, in late may after leaving work for 45 minutes due to a panic attack. doan, who'd started tracking cases of covid at whole foods in april, told the associated press that she believes her outspokenness played a role, while whole foods said doan's leaving her post was the sole reason for her dismissal.
jackie vandagriff was found brutally murdered in a park. was the college student targeted because she resembled the killer's ex-girlfriend? cbs news chief investigative and senior national correspondent jim axelrod reports in the murder of jackie vandagriff.\n\non a september night in 2016, a young man strolls into a college bar in denton, texas, and takes a seat. he chats easily with the women around him and seems like any other carefree student out for the night.\n\nbut charles bryant is not who he seems. the 29-year-old doesn't attend the university of north texas, located just across the street. in fact, he's barred from even stepping foot on campus because his ex-girlfriend, freshman caitlin mathis, has a restraining order against him. just six days prior, he was arrested for stalking her and his night on the town is actually carefully planned to be within the conditions of his bond. as bryant flirts with women at fry street public house, no one knows his behavior is about to take a deadly turn.\n\ncaitlin mathis and charles bryant caitlin mathis\n\ncatlin mathis was 18 years old when she met bryant, a personal trainer and bartender, in june 2016.\n\nhe was definitely smooth, mathis told 48 hours. it seemed like he kind of had his life together.\n\nwith an easy-going attitude and a chiseled appearance, bryant made a great first impression on mathis, who was working as a server at buffalo wild wings in grapevine, texas, and had just graduated from high school. bryant was 11 years older than mathis.\n\nhe was very charming, mathis recalled.\n\nbut bryant's friendly façade would fade after only weeks of dating.\n\nhe was very controlling. he always had to know where i was, mathis said.\n\nduring an interview with correspondent jim axelrod, mathis said she started to recognize that bryant was a bit of a narcissist.\n\nhe needed my constant attention, mathis said.\n\nas she started the fall semester at the university of north texas in denton, mathis decided to break up with bryant. he didn't take the news well, and things escalated quickly. when bryant appeared at her dorm room the day after their breakup, mathis called university police who banned him from campus. undeterred, bryant repeatedly contacted her. but mathis was not interested in reconciling.\n\nat that point, i was scared, mathis recalled.\n\nand she had a good reason to be. on september 6 – what would have been their 3-month anniversary – bryant once again found his way to mathis' dorm room. carrying a bouquet of flowers and a two-page letter, he slipped by the security desk and knocked on mathis' door. terrified, she hid in a closet and called 911. bryant fled and was promptly arrested by campus police for a second time.\n\nafter another visit to ex-girlfriend caitlin mathis' dorm, charles bryant iwas arrested for trespassing by university of north texas campus police on september 6, 2016.\n\nmathis wouldn't see bryant again as a free man, though he didn't stray far from unt. four days after bonding out of jail on a stalking charge for continuing to harass his ex, bryant was just a half a mile away from mathis' dorm room at fry street public house.\n\nearlier in the day, he'd spoken to his attorney about the case against him and knew he was facing more time behind bars. as bryant sipped drinks and chatted up college girls, they had no idea what was going on in his head. but there is at least one man who says he does.\n\ni think he enters the bar in mission mode, said texas ranger james holland. i think he was going to kill someone that night no matter what.\n\na sought-after expert in high-profile murder cases across the country, ranger holland specializes in psychopathic and sociopathic crimes for the texas state police.\n\ntragically, a young woman named jacqueline vandagriff also walked into the bar on a mission that september night. the 24-year-old was looking for a job.\n\nvandagriff was studying nutrition at texas woman's university in denton and had no known connection to bryant. their introduction plays out on video surveillance, as jackie talks to the bartender about a possible position.\n\ncharles bryant meets jackie vandagriff. hours later, she was dead. grapevine police department\n\njust hours after meeting bryant, vandagriff was dead. her mutilated body was discovered at grapevine lake on sept. 14, 2016. but how she died, and why, were questions no one could answer — until ranger holland got the suspected killer talking.\n\nbryant was already in custody with the grapevine police department for violating the restraining order by emailing his ex-girlfriend in the days following the murder.\n\nafter grapevine police hit a wall in their interrogation, holland was brought in for his expertise. bryant, who showed no remorse and was eerily calm as police questioned him, fit the bill for extreme anti-social behavior. holland has developed his own brand of interview techniques for cold-blooded killers who normally confound investigators.\n\ni think of it almost like mind-bending. you're dealing with someone who's controlling, manipulative and is trying to almost impress their will upon you, holland said. they feel that, at the end of the day, they can change your mind. and what you're basically doing is stepping in the back door of their mind and steering them without them knowing it.\n\nafter interviewing bryant for six hours, holland theorized that bryant couldn't handle his ex-girlfriend's rejection, and that he took revenge on the next woman he could find. that woman happened to be jackie vandagriff.\n\ni think at the end of the day, she's in the wrong place at the wrong time. and she looked too much like his ex-girlfriend, holland said.\n\nmathis agrees with holland's theory, and feels lucky to be alive.\n\ni don't know if he wanted to send a message to me or just to express his anger, she said. he just took things way, way out of hand.\n\nin his 26-year career in law enforcement, holland has investigated hundreds of murders. vandagriff's case stood out to him on multiple levels. not only was it a particularly gruesome crime scene, with the body dismembered and burned, but it was also unsophisticated. the ranger said it had all the hallmarks of a serial killer's first victim.\n\noften times, if you can find the initial murder that a serial killer committed, you'll find a disheveled crime scene. they make mistakes. it's their first time, holland said.\n\nvandagriff's purse was found at bryant's house, and there was evidence that he attempted to bury her body in his backyard before moving it to grapevine lake and setting it on fire.\n\ni think that this was his disheveled murder. was he going to stop? why would he? holland said. there's no doubt in my mind that if bryant had not been arrested by the grapevine police department, he would have continued to kill. and he would have gotten better. and i think as he got better and better, it would have been almost impossible to catch him.\n\nprosecutor anna hernandez thinks holland is right and believes bryant might have been in the midst of more murderous plans when he was arrested for vandagriff's case.\n\nshe might have just been victim number one with caitlin being victim number two, hernandez said.\n\nwhile she never imagined bryant was capable of murder, mathis still struggles with the guilt that she couldn't warn vandagriff – a woman she didn't know – about bryant's troubling behavior before it was too late. and her heart breaks for the vandagriff family, whose grief is immense.\n\ni just wish i could take that pain away from them. i look back at it now, and i'm extremely thankful to be here. there's a reason i'm here, mathis said.\n\nit's why she's sharing her story today.\n\nas long as i can maybe help one other person out there, that means a lot to me, mathis said.\n\nlearn how police zeroed in on charles bryant in the murder of jackie

a canadian woman is offering to gift her $1.7 million estate to the person who writes the most compelling essay on why they'd like to live in the home.\n\nafter her home failed to sell despite five months on the market, alla wagner took a different approach to finding a owner. she's now looking for a creative type after a fall left her unable to enjoy her beloved home, which she described on facebook as a writer's or artist's paradise.\n\nlocated about 40 miles south of calgary, in millarville, alberta, wagner's abode is described in an online real estate listing as an exquisite country mansion designed in the georgian country style.\n\none view from home listed as essay prize facebook\n\ninterior of home facebook\n\nwe had to list our house because of my poor health, which has been especially bad the last 6 months or so. being confined to only one (upper) floor is becoming unbearable and it is taking a toll on my work and life in too many ways, wagner wrote in a post on her facebook page entitled write a letter, win a house.\n\nto that end, she's soliciting responses to the question: why would moving to this lakefront dream home change your life? wagner is charging $25 for each entry, with the hope of reaching 68,000 and raising the $1.7 million.\n\nshe plans to return entry fees should she not meet her goal or should her home sell before the end of the month, when the property goes off the market.\n\ninterior of home facebook\n\nin 2015, the owner of maine's 200-year-old center lovell inn gave the property away in an essay contest with a $125 fee.\n\nwagner said the incident inspired her, as did the 1996 film the spitfire grill, which featured a similar contest for a cafe.
ed privé cannot vote for congresswoman tulsi gabbard in new hampshire's primary on february 11th. a registered republican, the 69-year-old may only vote for candidates belonging to the gop in a contest president trump is all but certain to win. but that did not stop him from attending one of the hawaii congresswoman's town halls in december.\n\nhonestly, i disagreed with trump, but i voted for him, privé said. i'm here now because she makes sense. the rest of them don't.\n\nprivé, a marine corps veteran, voted twice for president obama before casting his ballot for mr. trump in 2016. he's the kind of swing-voter that democrats are desperate to win back in november. and he says gabbard is just the kind of candidate who could make that happen.\n\nlingering on the edge of the photo line, privé exhaled. she doesn't want to give away the farm, but she wants to help people.\n\nand if she were to be the nominee of the democratic party, i would have a very difficult time voting for trump, privé added.\n\ntulsi gabbard with ed privé in northfield, nh nicole sganga\n\ngabbard's long-shot campaign for the presidency is betting big on a strong performance in new hampshire, where the primary historically rewards outsiders and underdogs, on occasion. over 42% of the state's voters here are registered as undeclared, which allows them to vote in either party's primary in february. and while other candidates focus on next week's iowa caucuses, gabbard has all but moved to new hampshire, spending more days in state (a sum total of 34) than any other democratic candidate across december and january.\n\ngabbard, a 38-year-old iraqi war veteran who backed bernie sanders in the last democratic primary, fuses progressive policy stances with the kind of patriotic displays sometimes more associated with republican campaigns. before she makes her hour-long pitch to voters at rallies throughout new hampshire, her audiences are often instructed to stand for the pledge of allegiance or bow their heads for a moment of silence.\n\na recent analysis by the new york times reveals just one-fifth of obama-trump voters returned to the democratic party in the 2018 midterm elections, while three-quarters voted republican.\n\ntoby mcintire, a former army captain, says she first became aware of gabbard after spotting one of her huge billboards off of interstate 95. before long, mcintire and her wife katie duffey were hosting a house party for gabbard to introduce the congresswoman to their friends and neighbors.\n\ntulsi gabbard speaks at a rally in merrimack, nh. nicole sganga\n\nmcintire, however, is a republican who says she will vote for mr. trump if gabbard isn't the democratic nominee. i'm not going to lie. his messaging of 'make america great again' and defense of the country, from a military perspective, resonated with me.\n\nthat is the double-bind of gabbard's candidacy. she appeals to some independent voters democrats are anxious to win in the general election, but not many party stalwarts. in a boston globe/suffolk university poll released earlier this month, gabbard earned 5% support among likely new hampshire democratic primary voters. but among independents, gabbard is the first choice for a whopping 21%.\n\nroughly half of the new hampshire towns gabbard has visited backed mr. trump in 2016. her populist, anti-war message attracts fans from both ends of the political spectrum, including former trump strategist steve bannon and former democratic ohio congressman dennis kucinich. but she has struggled to attract much of any support from mainstream democratic voters who pick their party's nominee.\n\nwhile her chances of winning the primary are extraordinarily slim, national democrats are worried that gabbard could still find a way of spoiling their chances of beating mr. trump. some have even gone so far as to insinuate the combat veteran, who infamously met with syrian dictator bashir al-assad in 2017, might be the agent of a foreign power.\n\ntulsi gabbard speaks during a panel with former ohio representative dennis kucinich and stephen kinzer, and moderated by lawrence lessig in concord, nh. nicole sganga\n\nin an apparent reference to gabbard, 2016 democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton suggested late last year that the russian government is grooming a candidate for a third-party run to disrupt the 2020 election. gabbard is now suing clinton over the remark for a lump sum of $50 million.\n\nfor her part, gabbard, who is not running for re-election to the house, has repeatedly insisted that she will not run as an independent or third-party candidate in the general election. but if gabbard were to change her mind, steve bannon told cbs news, her appeal to republicans and republican-leaning voters is so intense it might actually help democrats reclaim the white house.\n\n[s]he's pulling from trump voters. it could make it even tougher for trump to win, particularly in states like michigan and new hampshire, bannon told cbs news.\n\nclinton doesn't get it — she thinks she's a russian asset or something of a spoiler for the democrats. as usual, clinton misses the point. it shows you how out of touch she is. these are trump voters going to see her. they're not democratic voters. or they're democrats who voted for trump. or independents who voted for trump.\n\nbannon, who calls gabbard beyond a rock star and a real populist-nationalist, invited the congresswoman to meet with trump officials after the 2016 election. she's one of the first people we got up there. i was just blown away by her level of sophistication on national security and her understanding of 'america first,' bannon said.\n\ndennis kucinich, who ran for the presidency twice as a stalwart progressive, is one of gabbard's left-leaning supporters. tulsi is one of the few individuals who provides a categorical challenge to u.s. foreign policy...she can appeal to both libertarians and republicans. that's a winning approach, he told cbs news.\n\nfirst, however, gabbard needs to find a way to win over democrats. the hawaii lawmaker has not qualified for the debate stage in months, and while other candidates' boast hundreds of staffers and dozens of offices in key early states, gabbard employs a team of just over a dozen paid employees nationwide, according to fec filings. the campaign opened up their very first field office earlier this month in downtown manchester, operated by a round of 50 full-time volunteers in new hampshire.\n\nto vote or not to vote for gabbard is not a question for republican brian lindsay of hudson, nh. the lifelong republican committed to casting his ballot for trump in november, but agreed to tag along with his teenage girls to the candidate's town hall.\n\nlindsay liked what he saw. hands down, she should be the democratic nominee. i think the others are a bunch of crackpots, he volunteered. she's not really one of them. a little less abrasive.\n\nhe paused. much less abrasive.
rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii, posted a video to twitter thursday apologizing for her previous remarks about lgbtq issues, as those comments have plagued her newly launched presidential candidacy.\n\nas a 21-year-old running for the hawaii state legislature in 2002, gabbard boasted about supporting her father, an anti-gay activist, in his effort to promote the constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage passed in 1998. after her election, she continued to espouse anti-gay views. in 2004, she opposed a bill legalizing civil unions.\n\nto try to act as if there is a difference between 'civil unions' and same-sex marriage is dishonest, cowardly and extremely disrespectful to the people of hawaii, gabbard said at the time, according to cnn's kfile. as democrats we should be representing the views of the people, not a small number of homosexual extremists.\n\ngabbard apologized to lgbtq activists in the state when running for congress in 2012. since entering congress, she has supported a number of bills promoting lgbtq equality. she has said that her initial views reflected her socially conservative upbringing.\n\nin my past, i said and believed things that were wrong, and worse, they were very hurtful to people in the lgbtq community and to their loved ones, gabbard said in the video posted to twitter thursday. she said that she was sincerely repeating her apology from 2012. my record in congress over the past six years reflects what is in my heart, gabbard added.\n\nmy father was very outspoken. he was an activist who was fighting against gay rights and marriage equality in hawaii – and at that time, i forcefully defended him, gabbard said. but over the years, as i grew up, i formed my own opinions, based on my life experiences.\n\ngabbard also said that she hoped her change of heart could inspire other people who may hold anti-gay views.\n\ni look forward to being able to share more of my story and experiences growing up – not as an excuse, but in the hopes that it may inspire others to truly live aloha, to love and care for others, gabbard said.
new york sen. kirsten gillibrand announced she is forming an exploratory committee to run for president, throwing her hat in the ring for the democratic nomination in an appearance on the late show with stephen colbert that aired tuesday night.\n\nyes. i'm filing an exploratory committee for president of the united states — tonight, she said.\n\ni'm going to run for president of the united states, because as a young mom, i'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as i would fight for my own, gillibrand said. she mentioned her support for universal health care, public school and job training programs.\n\nbut you are never going to accomplish any of these things if you don't take on the systems of power which make all of that impossible, she continued. which means taking on institutional racism, it's taking on the corruption and greed in washington, and taking on the special interests that write legislation in the dead of night, and i know that i have the compassion, courage, and fearless determination to get that done.\n\ntonight: @sengillibrand stops by @colbertlateshow to announce that she is forming an exploratory committee to run for president of the united states! #lssc pic.twitter.com/vpupf1gs8z — the late show (@colbertlateshow) january 15, 2019\n\ncolbert asked gillibrand to name the first thing she would do as president. she mentioned restoring american leadership in the world and addressing climate change, but first trying to reunite the country.\n\nthe first thing i would do is restore what's been lost — the integrity and the compassion of this country, gillibrand said. if you want to get things done, you have to get people together.\n\nthe late show host stephen colbert and guest sen. kirsten gillibrand seen tue., jan. 15, 2019. scott kowalchyk/cbs\n\nwhen asked how she would address a government shutdown, gillibrand reiterated she would try to find common ground between differing parties. she gave examples of her own bipartisanship, such as working on sexual harassment legislation with a republican unpopular with democrats.\n\nted cruz and i agreed on how to end sexual harassment in congress, which ultimately passed. me and ted cruz! gillibrand said. colbert quipped she cared about something so much she would talk to ted cruz.\n\ncolbert also asked more joking questions, asking her what swear word she would miss the most if she tried not to swear on the campaign trail.\n\nrhymes with 'duck,' gillibrand joked.\n\ncolbert also gave her joking campaign gifts, like a plane ticket to michigan and granite from new hampshire. he also gave her a pin saying, i announced on the 'late show with stephen colbert.'\n\ngillibrand is the second u.s. senator — and second female senator — to announce plans to begin the legal process of running for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020. the 52-year-old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of president trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017.\n\ngillibrand would join a democratic presidential field beginning to take shape. over the weekend, former housing and urban development (hud) secretary julián castro formally launched his presidential bid, while massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren launched an exploratory committee on new year's eve. rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii said over the weekend she plans to form an exploratory committee in the coming days. several other senators, current and former governors and mayors, and former vice president joe biden are still mulling potential campaigns.
president trump will sign the u.s.-mexico-canada trade agreement at the white house on wednesday, the white house confirmed. the signing will come in the middle of the senate trial determining whether to convict him on two articles of impeachment.\n\nthe u.s.m.c.a. passage in the house and senate marked a significant achievement for the trump white house, particularly during such a divisive time on capitol hill. the agreement's prospects were uncertain during the house's impeachment inquiry. mr. trump has spent the last several days tweeting and retweeting defenses of himself, as house impeachment managers argue he not only abused his power by demanding an investigation into the bidens in exchange for u.s. aid and obstructed congress, but should be removed for that conduct.\n\nhere's what the u.s.m.c.a will do:\n\npromote peaceful trade relations\n\n\n\npresident donald trump has long threatened to withdraw from the north american free trade agreement, known as nafta, if a new agreement couldn't be reached. but the usmca binds the trade partners together for at least 16 years, preventing mr. trump or future administrations from summarily ending the trade deal. it also sets up an independent panel so businesses can resolve disputes across the trade bloc.\n\nthe agreement is less important for what it does to modernize nafta than for what what it prevents: a potentially calamitous breakdown in trade between the countries, according to gregory daco, the chief economist for oxford economics.\n\nchange car industry rules\n\nthe usmca would ensure stricter rules of origin for cars made and sold in the u.s., mexico and canada, including requiring that 75% of automotive components be produced within the three-nation trading bloc for companies to sell duty-free. that's up from 62.5% under the nafta rules currently in place.\n\nthe agreement also requires that more than 40% of auto content be made by workers inside the trade bloc who earn at least $16 an hour. that's about three times the current average hourly pay for mexican workers as of 2018. labor advocates, including unions, and u.s. automakers pushed for the deal.\n\nthose higher wages means the usmca may raise some vehicle prices as car manufacturers pass on the higher production costs, some economists think. however, the alternative — a u.s. withdrawal from nafta/usmca — would be so much worse, casario said.\n\nprotect farmers\n\ncanada and mexico are the top two export markets for u.s. food and agricultural products, totaling nearly $40 billion last year and some 325,000 jobs. the usmca preserves that. for example, the agreement gives american farmers greater access to canada's dairy markets, which has long been a source of tension between the two nations.\n\nthe pact also sets rules for agricultural biotechnology, such as gene editing, and addresses labeling requirements, according to the farm bureau, a lobbying group.\n\nstrengthen labor and environmental standards\n\nthe usmca mandates inspections of factories suspected of labor violations — a key in winning the support of unions.\n\nworking people are responsible for a deal that is a vast improvement over both the original nafta and the flawed proposal brought forward in 2017, afl-cio president richard trumka said in a statement, referring to president trump's version of the deal he brought to congress for approval.\n\nset digital trade rules\n\nthe agreement adds rules for digital trade and other technologies, most of which didn't exist when nafta was signed in 1994. the usmca also requires the free flow of data among the three countries, potentially setting a precedent for u.s. pacts with other countries, the wall street journal notes.
imagine sitting in a cramped capsule packed with wires, buttons and switches, about to embark on a historic journey with legendary apollo 11 astronauts neil armstrong, buzz aldrin, and michael collins.\n\nthanks to the smithsonian's 3d digitalization program, it's now possible for space buffs and amateur astronomers to experience what it was like inside the spacecraft that landed the first men to walk on the moon.\n\ncbs news received access thursday morning to the smithsonian's developing project that uses 3d scanning and virtual reality technology to allow the general public an authentic look into the interior of apollo 11 for the first time.\n\nallan needell, space history curator at the smithsonian national air and space museum, described this project as an indescribable thrill. he says 3d video offers a unique way to provide access to the public without jeopardizing the object's sustainability.\n\nit's an icon and people want to have access to it, to stand next to the real thing, and you want to preserve it for future generations, and not to change anything about it, he said in an interview. on the other hand, this gives us an opportunity to look at an object and to connect it in detail with what it actually did, minute by minute, in one of the most historic things humans have ever attempted to do.\n\n3d scanners took approximately 6,000 images of apollo 11's interior, taking care to minimize the impact on this delicate and irreplaceable artifact. with the help of jibs and tree-trimming poles, 3d technology experts were able to scan every nook and cranny of the complex module. after acquiring the data, software condenses the information and translates it for use in 3d graphics, 3d printing, and viewing through virtual technology googles.\n\nadam metallo, a 3d program officer at the smithsonian institution, has worked on other artifacts before, but he said apollo 11 is a different animal.\n\nthe exterior is not that tricky, he told cbs news. we can do that. the interior [is complex] in terms of the geometry and obstructions insides, in terms of the diverse different material types. so you've got shiny painted surfaces. you've got absolutely complex nuance geometry and every button. to be honest, that actually terrified us. the prospect of trying to turn that around into an experience -- it's something we've never done.\n\nthough difficult, the two week scanning process proved worthwhile, revealing new details about what life was like inside apollo 11 during its historic mission. for example, instead of modern-day post-it notes, astronauts took advantage of their limited space and wrote notes on the walls, leaving behind evidence of their communication with the ground and steps and procedures essential to their mission.\n\nnot all of the writings were so technical, however; some served as friendly reminders. having to improvise because of limited space, one of the astronauts replaced a label on a compartment designated for equipment with a hand-written sign indicating it was used instead for smelly waste.\n\nlocker b2 was initially used to store astronaut's personal items. sometime during the mission, a handwritten note saying smelly waste indicates it was needed for something else. smithsonian institution\n\nneedell said candidly, they just wanted to warn themselves that this is probably a locker that they should probably leave closed until after the mission was over.\n\nhumor aside, the 3d scanning project uncovered other writings that touched upon common human tendencies -- for example, keeping track of days. the astronauts jotted down calendar notations, a routine, needell said, that is familiar to prisoners in cells without access to light.\n\nthe calendar is fascinating to me, he said. in space, you don't have sunrises or sunsets, you can't keep track of the day. you know that your family downstairs is going through the normal routine. and to sort of keep some association with normal life on earth is something i know i would want to do. so it gives you the opportunity to sort of empathize.\n\nat some point during the mission, one of the astronauts created a small calendar on a smooth wall below one of the lockers. each day of the apollo 11 mission is crossed out except for landing day. the calendar is covered with a plastic sheet held by tape. smithsonian institution\n\ntechnology expert metallo reaffirmed the importance of these small details. for me, what they speak to is a very human experience moment in time. when you see all the technical aspects -- the buttons -- it's a very cold experience. when you see pencil on the wall, you can imagine the astronaut writing in time. and there's nothing quite like that, he said.\n\nthis project not only illuminates the human experience of traveling through space, but it also helps expand its educational value, almost 50 years later.\n\ni want to see what classroom teachers do with this, metallo said. you know, you can do so many different things. you can print the entire thing in one go at a very small scale, or you can print out smaller subsets of the command module. so if you wanted to look at particular buttons and knobs, you can actually 3d print a real one in real time so that kids could actually flip these switches and know what it felt like to be an astronaut. and that's what's going to get them to start thinking about going to mars, of course.\n\naspiring astronauts won't have to wait too much longer. the smithsonian announced that the data revealing the interior view of apollo 11 will be available to the general public in the summer of 2016.
new york -- president barack obama plans to attend the tampa bay rays' exhibition game in cuba on march 22.\n\nben rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications and speechwriting, tweeted the announcement tuesday after major league baseball and the players' association announced arrangements had been finalized for the game against the cuban national team in havana.\n\nthe white house announced the president's brief visit to cuba last month. it will mark a watershed moment in relations between the u.s. and cuba, making mr. obama the first sitting u.s. president to set foot on the island in nearly seven decades.\n\nwhile in the country, president obama plans to meet with groups advocating for change in cuba, a condition the president had laid out publicly for such a trip. he will meet with president raul castro -- but not his older brother fidel, who has been a longtime adversary of the united states for decades.\n\nit adds a great dimension to the trip, and it's going to shine an even greater spotlight on the events and on major league baseball, rays president of baseball operations matt silverman said.\n\nit will be mlb's first trip to the communist island nation since the baltimore orioles played there in 1999. the game will be televised by espn and espn deportes.\n\nduring a time of historic change, we appreciate the constructive role afforded by our shared passion for the game, and we look forward to experiencing cuba's storied baseball tradition and the passion of its many loyal fans, baseball commissioner rob manfred said in a statement.\n\nmanfred drew the rays on nov. 13 from a bin of teams that wanted to make the trip. u.s. teams played spring training games in cuba before fidel castro's revolution, but none appeared there from march 1959 until the orioles faced cuba's national team in havana in march 1999.\n\nwe're extremely excited as a group to be a part of this process, rays pitcher chris archer said. in a sense, we're part of something that's extremely historic for both countries, and looking to mingle and experience the culture of a place where we haven't been able to travel freely for a while.\n\nhundreds of workers on tuesday were at the latin america stadium, built in 1946 and said to have a seating capacity of 55,000. they are fixing the roof, repairing damaged seating areas and grooming the field surface.\n\nworkers with jackhammers broke up damaged pavement outside, and painters brightened the stadium exterior.\n\nwe're excited to be part of this trip. for us, it's about spreading goodwill through baseball, silverman said on a conference call. we're excited for the opportunity and to experience firsthand the baseball culture of cuba.\n\nlogistically, there will be some challenges. but the players' association and major league baseball worked hard to minimize the disruptions. our first priority is getting ready for opening day. and we worked hard to make sure that this trip won't interfere much, if at all, with those preparations, he added.\n\nfewer than 40 players will make the trip, but the rays were yet to have in-depth discussions about the composition of the roster, silverman said.\n\nwe've been working with major league baseball and the state department to figure out the visas and the exact size. it hasn't been finalized yet, he said. it'll be a traditional traveling baseball party, and then a number of our front office will also be attending. there will be a few special guests. but the contingent won't be that large. it can't be larger than the two planes we're going to take down there.
toledo, ohio -- the ohio department of transportation is planning to require fencing at some overpass construction sites after a michigan man was killed when a sandbag was tossed onto an interstate and smashed through a car windshield. the department is drafting a new rule that would require temporary fencing when workers remove permanent barriers at overpasses that are being rebuilt.\n\nthe change comes after 22-year-old marquise byrd, of warren, michigan, died on dec. 22, three days after a car he was riding in was struck by a sandbag tossed from an overpass onto interstate 75 in toledo. authorities have charged four teenagers with throwing the sandbag and other objects at cars.\n\ntheir arrests came nearly two months after a similar incident near flint, michigan. five teens there are facing charges of second degree murder after throwing rocks off an overpass, hitting a vehicle and killing 32-year-old kenneth white.\n\nthe ohio bridge where the sandbag was dropped had fencing, but much of it was removed for a reconstruction project.\n\na year ago, the state agreed to increase the number of highway overpasses with fencing. plans called for adding permanent fencing to about 160 overpasses over five years at an estimated cost of just under $1 million per year.\n\nohio agreed to add the fencing at the urging of a man whose wife suffered brain damage when teenagers dropped a rock from an interstate overpass onto their car in central pennsylvania in july 2014. the four teenagers were sentenced to prison in the case.\n\nthe teens in ohio who are charged with murder and vehicular vandalism in the michigan man's death were in court last thursday after earlier entering pleas of denial to the charges.\n\nlillian diallo, an attorney for the victim's family, told the blade newspaper that byrd had a 2-year-old son and was planning to propose to his girlfriend.\n\nshe said the teenagers should have been home instead of out late on the night the sandbag was dropped onto the interstate.\n\nyou dropped a 30-pound sandbag over an overpass, diallo said. where is your conscience? where is your morality? how could you do that to another human being?
the democratic national committee is changing the qualifications for candidates to participate in the nevada presidential primary debate, including eliminating the unique-donor threshold, paving the way for billionaire mike bloomberg to potentially qualify for future presidential debates.\n\nto make the debate stage in las vegas on february 19, candidates need to meet either a new polling threshold or received pledged delegates. for polling, presidential hopefuls must receive either 10% in four state or national polls or 12% in two state polls out of either nevada or south carolina from a list released by the dnc. those polls must be released between february 15 and 11:59 p.m. et on february 18.\n\ncandidates can qualify based on pledged delegates. those delegates will be awarded based on the results of the iowa caucuses on february 3 as calculated and reported by the iowa democratic party or the new hampshire primary on february 11 as calculated and reported by the associated press.\n\nbased on a cbs news analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: joe biden, bernie sanders and elizabeth warren. all candidates have until february 18 to qualify.\n\nfor the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to be met by candidates trying to make it to the debate stage. this could benefit bloomberg, a multi-billionaire who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. the requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past. he hasn't yet reached the polling threshold, but his support is ticking up recent polls show.\n\nwe are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see mike bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump and bring our country together, bloomberg's campaign manager, kevin sheekey, said in a statement. mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. he is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.\n\nother campaigns however are unhappy with the decision.\n\nto now change the rules in the middle of the game to accommodate mike bloomberg, who is trying to buy his way into the democratic nomination, is wrong, said bernie sanders senior campaign adviser jeff weaver in a statement. that's the definition of a rigged system.\n\nlet's make one thing clear: changing the rules now to accommodate mike bloomberg and not changing them in the past to ensure a more diverse debate stage is just plain wrong, said candidate tom steyer. back in december, i called on the dnc to open up the debate requirements so that more candidates, including candidates of color, would be able to participate. the democratic party should be doing everything possible to ensure a diverse field of candidates. instead, they are changing the rules for a candidate who is ignoring early states voters and grassroots donors.\n\nthe ninth debate in las vegas will be hosted by nbc news and msnbc in partnership with the nevada independent newspaper.\n\nit comes after another debate in manchester, new hampshire on february 7. cbs news will also host a debate february 25 in charleston, south carolina. the qualifications of the south carolina debate have not yet been released.\n\ntim perry contributed to this report.
a white man who stabbed a black college student to death at a bus stop on the university of maryland's flagship college park campus was sentenced thursday to life in prison for what prosecutors claimed was a racially motivated hate crime. sean urbanski, 25, apologized to the parents of 23-year-old richard collins iii for the horrible pain he caused them and said he wishes he could go back and change what happened on the night in may 2017 when he killed the newly commissioned army lieutenant.\n\nthere hasn't been a day that's gone by where i haven't thought about what i've done to you, and if i could switch places with your son i would in a heartbeat, urbanski told dawn and richard collins jr. during a hearing conducted by video teleconference.\n\nprosecutors had sought the maximum sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole, but prince george's county state's attorney aisha braveboy and defense attorney william brennan said after the hearing that urbanski will be eligible for parole under the judge's sentence.\n\ncircuit court judge lawrence hill jr. dismissed a hate crime charge against urbanski before a jury convicted him of first-degree murder in december 2019. but the judge said thursday that he believes race and alcohol both were factors in the killing. hill said he doesn't believe it was a coincidence that urbanski stabbed the only black person at the bus stop that night.\n\nrace is always amongst us in the things we do and things we say, the judge said.\n\ncollins' parents said they wake up every night around the same time that their son was killed. they can't bring themselves to clean out his room.\n\nwith the passage of time, we have come to the realization that racist hate was the murderer's only motivation for killing our son, richard collins jr. said.\n\nurbanski's mother told collins' parents that the horror and devastation of knowing that her son killed their son is with her every day.\n\nyour son richard should be here, and it's my son sean's fault that he's not, elizabeth urbanski said.\n\nbefore the jury's verdict, hill ruled that prosecutors didn't meet their legal burden of showing that racial hatred motivated urbanski to stab collins, who didn't know his assailant. but he noted thursday that he made that ruling before the hate crime law was changed.\n\nearlier this year, maryland enacted legislation bearing collins' name to strengthen the state's hate crime law so prosecutors don't have to prove hate is the only motivating factor in committing a crime. the change expanded the law to apply to crimes motivated either in whole or in substantial part by race, color, religious belief, sexual orientation, gender, disability or national origin. collins' parents had lobbied for a change in the law.\n\nthe judge allowed prosecutors to present evidence that urbanski saved at least six photographs of racist memes on his cellphone and liked a facebook group called alt-reich: nation.\n\nprosecutors said alcohol and racist propaganda poisoned urbanski's mind and emboldened him to act on his hatred of black people.\n\ndefense attorneys said there was no evidence of a racial motive for the killing.\n\nrichard collins iii handout via cbs affiliate wusa-tv\n\ncollins was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the u.s. army shortly before his death. he was days from graduating from bowie state university, a historically black college, and was celebrating with a friend at bars on the night of his killing.\n\nurbanski had been enrolled at the university of maryland's college park campus. he, too, was drinking with friends at bars before the killing.\n\nabout 3:30 a.m. on may 20, 2017, urbanski approached collins while he waited at a bus stop for an uber driver with a white male friend and an asian woman whom they had just met. urbanski brandished a folding knife as he approached the friends from a wooded area, according to prosecutors.\n\nstep left, step left if you know what's best for you, urbanski told them, according to police.\n\nno, collins said before urbanski stabbed him once in his chest with a folding knife.\n\nurbanski then pocketed the knife and sat down on a bench until police arrived and arrested him at the bus stop.\n\nmy son committed the unpardonable sin of saying, 'no,' to a white man, a tearful dawn collins told the judge.\n\nshe said her son, her husband and her father-in-law all proudly served their country.\n\nnot white america. not black america. the united states of america, she added.
part 2 of sunday morning anchor jane pauley's two-part interview with the vice president-elect:\n\nand how may we address him? you can call me doug.\n\nbut of course he isn't just doug. douglas emhoff will be making history as the first husband of a u.s. vice president.\n\nfirst gentleman? asked cbs news' jane pauley.\n\nsecond gentleman! said emhoff. first second gentleman.\n\ni'm afraid for the next week or month or year of your life, you're going to be doing something like you just had to do with me.\n\nyeah, it's all good, he said.\n\nvice president-elect kamala harris said, there was a whole conversation, mostly among his friends, whether he should just be called the 'first dude'!\n\nand other names that i can't repeat on national television, emhoff added.\n\nthe two met in 2013, a blind date set up by a friend of hers.\n\npauley asked, when you first got the friend who said, 'there's a guy…' (and maybe your friends were doing this to you all the time) 'there's a guy, and he's a good one. and don't google him.' you totally googled him, didn't you?\n\nooh. this is a reveal! emhoff smiled.\n\ni've never been asked that. i did! harris laughed. oh, that's so funny you asked me that question. so, yes, my best friend set us up on a blind date. and she said, 'just trust me. just trust me. just don't …' you know, she wanted me to just kind of go into it, and she said, 'don't google him.' i did!\n\ndouglas emhoff and kamala harris married in 2018. cbs news\n\nshe found he was a los angeles lawyer. of course, he knew she was california attorney general.\n\nhe made the first move. one of my buddies was in town, and we went to a laker game. and so, you know, we [had] a couple of beers, i told him the story. i said, 'what do you think i should text her?' so, we sat there in the stands and we came up with this text, which was something like, 'hey, it's doug. awkward! i'm texting you.'\n\nharris asked, you guys composed it together?\n\nwe did. so, that's my reveal! and she, which is funny, she said something like, 'yay, lakers. go lakers.'\n\nand i'm a warriors fan.\n\nbiggest warriors fan out there, he laughed.\n\nthe next morning, early, he called: so, i left this ridiculous voicemail, which she has saved and plays back to me on our anniversary every year. i thought i'd never hear from her again, but ...\n\nbut it was just, it was adorable, she laughed. and it was just, i mean, the thing about doug is that he is exactly who he is. he's just fully authentic and clear about the things he cares about. and it's family, it's his work …\n\nyou, he added.\n\nand me! she smiled.\n\nthey married in 2014, her first. he was by her side as she was elected to the u.s. senate, where he found out what it's like to be a +1 to a powerful politician.\n\nthere were senate spouses who welcomed me, he said. and i went to some, you know, lunches and events.\n\nand plenty of misters? asked pauley.\n\namy klobuchar's husband, elizabeth warren's husband, who kinda put their, you know, arms around me to show me the ropes.\n\nharris said, there're very few husbands that are senate spouses. they do find each other.\n\nvice president-elect kamala harris and her husband, douglas emhoff. cbs news\n\nemhoff plans to teach law classes at georgetown university, much like the incoming first lady, jill biden, who plans to continue as a community college professor.\n\npauley said to emhoff, you strike me as a very centered person. and a calming presence.\n\nthank you. i understand the role she's taking, and the role that joe and jill are taking on, too, and become very close with them. so, like i support her, i support them. and that's important, 'cause what they're doing is so much. and they're walking into so many different crises. the american people hired them for change and to get us outta these things. and i'm gonna do everything i can to help them.\n\nand to relieve the stress of the washington pressure-cooker, the couple hopes to keep cooking. they are, harris confirmed, both kitchen people.\n\nyou cook? pauley asked.\n\nwell, he has learned, harris said. he's a good sous chef.\n\nnow, outta necessity during covid, he added.\n\nhow much cooking will there be in your life to come? pauley asked.\n\nwell, i am charting that course and making sure that at least for sunday family dinner, said harris. it's too much a part of our family life. and that's important to me, to keep that stability.\n\nand we had to ask about that fashion choice, surely a first for a vice president: the converse chuck taylor sneakers, a.k.a. chucks.\n\npauley said, i gotta tell you, when you walked in, i checked out, is she wearin' 'em? you're not wearin' your chucks today!\n\nno.\n\nwhat is the story?\n\nit became a story. i've always worn chucks! she laughed. it's my casual go-to. you know, grew up with chucks. i just love them. they're comfortable.\n\ni can attest. there [are] several closets full of them, emhoff laughed.\n\nhe's exaggerating!\n\nbut, this wasn't just some thing that she started doing on the campaign. when i met her, it was chucks and jeans when she met the kids.\n\nwhat did it say to you? pauley asked.\n\nshe's down-to-earth. people ask me all the time, like, 'what's she really like?' i said, she's shockingly normal. and i think that is really an extension of who she really is.\n\nharris and emhoff have blended their families together, including children ella and cole from his first marriage. their sunday evening zoom calls are a striking picture of diversity:\n\nharris said, we have family in italy. my sister-in-law married an italian, so they live there with their two children. india, we have an aunt and an uncle there. canada. brooklyn! oakland.\n\nemhoff added, my parents, they live in the desert out in california.\n\nand for the next four years, add the u.s. naval observatory in washington to the list, which will be home to the vice president and her family.\n\nit reflects america, emhoff said. and that's what it should be. it should just be about love and unity.\n\nclick here for part 1 of jane pauley's interview with kamala harris.\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by alan golds. editor: ed givnish.
alice, texas -- the price of oil rose for a change friday, closing up nine percent to over $32 a barrel.\n\ngas dropped another penny to $1.85 -- great for drivers. but the american oil patch is sliding from boom to bust.\n\ndenise walker robinson cbs news\n\nmachines that once pumped oil from the ground near alice, texas sit idle, lined up along a highway. it's a painful sight for denise walker robinson.\n\ni think that's what keeps me going, is my faith, robinson told cbs news.\n\nher company services oil rigs, but the trucks have nowhere to go. she once had 200 employees; now there are only 48.\n\nthat means that i'm struggling to keep those 48 people working, robinson said.\n\nand if oil prices don't stabilize this year?\n\nwell, we may all be done, she said.\n\ncheaper oil means it's less profitable to drill here and as projects dry up, the town has suffered. sales tax revenues plummeted more than 60 percent in one year. unemployment has nearly doubled to nine percent.\n\njesus trevino lost his job moving oil equipment six months ago, and went to a food pantry friday for help.\n\ncan't even afford to pay my bills, trevino told cbs news. you go from making a good living, you know, and all of the sudden, it's all gone.\n\nvolunteer phyllis seidel says the pantry's case load grew by 700 people last year. she's concerned the food bank won't be able to cope with demand.\n\nat this time last year, there were almost 700 rigs drilling in texas. more than half of those are now out of production.
now in an elliptical orbit around the sun, the tesla roadster launched atop a spacex falcon heavy rocket tuesday during the powerful booster's maiden flight was expected to pass beyond the moon's orbit overnight wednesday and reach the orbit of mars in july as it puts earth in its rear view mirror, analysts said. while spacex founder and chief designer elon musk has said he likes to imagine the tesla remaining in orbit for hundreds of millions of years or more, jupiter's orbit is likely to fling it back to the solar system long before then.\n\njonathan mcdowell, an astronomer at the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics and a noted space analyst, says two forces acting on the car will limit its lifetime.\n\none is jupiter. the giant planet's gravity perturbs bodies in the asteroid belt and, over time, will have an effect on the tesla's trajectory. the other effect is a subtle acceleration produced by tiny temperature-related forces over extremely long periods that also would act to change the orbit.\n\nit's tiny, but over timescales of millions of years it's enough to shrink the orbit and make the thing fall into the sun, mcdowell said. so it's a race between does that happen before some jupiter perturbation ejects it from the system.\n\non timescales of centuries, it's going to be pretty much in the orbit it's in now. on timescales of thousands of years, it's going to be in a not-horribly-different orbit, but jupiter will mess it around some. and then on timescales of millions of years, it won't be there anymore.\n\nalan fitzsimmons, an astronomer with queen's university in belfast who studies minor bodies, asteroids and comets, tweeted that his initial calculations show the chance of hitting a planet is almost zero. most near-earth asteroids end by solar vaporization or ejection from the solar system by jupiter. near earth cars should be the same.\n\ni've done a quick orbital integration for the next 10,000 years assuming a reasonable orbit, he said in an earlier tweet. basically the tesla (roadster) is ok, but the orbit slowly elongates by gravitational perturbations and starts getting kicked about by jupiter.\n\nwith a crescent earth in the rearview mirror, a tesla roadster and a space-suited mannequin known as starman head for deep space after an upper stage rocket firing late tuesday boosted the sports car into an orbit around the sun. spacex\n\nmeanwhile, musk released a spectacular final photo earlier wednesday from a camera on the rocket's second stage showing the tesla and its space-suited driver starman outbound with an increasingly distant crescent earth in the background.\n\nso where, exactly, is starman heading?\n\nabout six hours after launch, the falcon heavy's upper stage engine ignited for a third time, boosting the tesla's velocity high enough to carry it out of earth's gravitational reach.\n\nconfirming the rocket firing, spacex released initial data indicating the roadster was headed for an elliptical orbit around the sun with a high point, or aphelion, out in the asteroid belt, well beyond the orbit of mars.\n\na shot of starman at the wheel of elon musk's tesla roadster after the sports car was launched into space atop spacex's powerful new falcon heavy rocket. spacex\n\nbut experienced satellite analysts said the numbers provided by spacex didn't quite add up and on wednesday, the company provided an update that clarified the trajectory.\n\nmcdowell said the new data show the tesla is, in fact, in a solar orbit with a high point just beyond mars, as initially predicted by spacex, and not on a long drive deep into the asteroid belt.\n\nthe data show that when the tesla finally climbs out of the earth-moon gravity well, its velocity -- reflected in a number known as c3 -- will be 12 kilometers squared per second squared, which translates into a speed of about 3.5 kilometers per second, or 6,700 mph faster than earth's velocity as they both orbit the sun.\n\nthat excess velocity, provided by the upper stage's final rocket firing, is what will enable the tesla to leave earth's gravitational clutches and move out into the solar system, a point the roadster will reach sunday.\n\nit will pass within about 69 million miles of mars on june 8 and cross the red planet's orbit in july before reaching its farthest distance from the sun -- about 158 million miles -- on nov. 19.\n\nafter that, the roadster and starman will fall back toward the inner solar system, picking up speed as they near the low point of the orbit, or perihelion, on sept. 1, 2019. perihelion in this case roughly matches the distance of earth's orbit from the sun, the tesla's starting point. the roadster then will head back out along the same path, traveling a now-familiar route over and over again for the foreseeable future.
in his new book, keep sharp: build a better brain at any age (simon & schuster), neurosurgeon sanjay gupta, m.d., writes about how to keep the brain in shape as we age, to protect it from decline.\n\nread the excerpt below, and don't miss dr. jon lapook's interview with dr. gupta on cbs sunday morning january 3!\n\nsimon & schuster\n\nwhen i was in medical school in the early 1990s, conventional wisdom was that brain cells, such as neurons, were incapable of regenerating. we were born with a fixed set and that was it; throughout life, we'd slowly drain the cache (and accelerate that killing off with bad habits like drinking too much alcohol and smoking marijuana – the truth about that later). perhaps it was the eternal optimist in me, but i never believed that our brain cells simply stopped growing and regenerating. after all, we continue to have novel thoughts, deep experiences, vivid memories, and new learning throughout our lives. it seemed to me that the brain wouldn't just wither away unless it was no longer being used. by the time i finished my neurosurgery training in 2000, there was plenty of evidence that we could nurture the birth of new brain cells (called neurogenesis) and even increase the size of our brains. it was a staggeringly optimistic change in how we view the master control system of our bodies. indeed, every day of your life, you can make your brain better, faster, fitter, and, yes, sharper. i am convinced of that. (i'll get to the bad habits later; they don't necessarily kill brain cells, but when they are abused, they can alter the brain, especially its memory powers.)\n\nlet me say at the outset: i am certainly a fan of excellent education, but this is not what keep sharp is all about. this book is less about improving intelligence or iq and more about both propagating new brain cells and making the ones you have work more efficiently. this isn't so much about remembering a list of items, performing well on exams, or executing tasks adeptly (though all of those goals will be more achievable with a better brain). in keep sharp, you will learn to build a brain that connects patterns others might miss and helps you better navigate life. you will develop a brain able to toggle back and forth between short-term and long-term views of the world and, perhaps most important, a brain highly resilient in the face of life experiences that might be disabling to someone else.\n\nfrom keep sharp by sanjay gupta, m.d. copyright © 2021 by sanjay gupta, m.d. reprinted by permission of simon & schuster, inc. all rights reserved.\n\n\n\n\n\nfor more info:
chris mosier, a hall-of-fame triathlete, all-american duathlete and six-time member of team usa, has overcome many challenges — and not just in sports. mosier is also know as the first transgender man to represent the united states in international competition and is credited with prompting the international olympic committee to change its policy on transgender athletes.\n\nhowever, it was a long road to receiving that acceptance.\n\nthe athlete and advocate recently participated in a speaker series geared toward highlighting under-told stories of minority athletes. during an in-depth conversation with former nfl player dhani jones for gatorade endurance's someone like me speaker series, mosier spoke about being accepted as a transgender athlete.\n\ndoing an ironman race is nothing compared to me just existing in the world and some of the pain and the hurt that i had felt up to that point in identifying as trans and having interactions with the world, mosier told jones.\n\ni had some really heartbreaking moments... at races, specifically, but it wasn't my competitors, it was the fans and the spectators there that posed the issue, and sometimes the volunteers, he said. and sometimes it was purposeful and sometimes it was accidental\n\nmosier noted that sometimes people make hurtful comments to transgender people without even knowing, because people lack a basic knowledge and information about what it means to be transgender, about how to talk about identity.\n\nin an interview about the speaker series with cbs news, mosier said he wants to be the role model he didn't have as a child. he created transathlete.com in 2013 as a resource for students, athletes, coaches, and administrators to find information about trans inclusion in athletics at various levels of play.\n\nthe site also breaks down legislation and policies affecting trans athletes at different levels, from state to international. while progress has been made in some areas, moiser the sports world is getting worse for transgender and nonbinary athletes.\n\nstates across the country are proposing bills that would ban transgender high school student athletes from participating in sports in the gender with which they identify, mosier told cbs news. there are national sport governing bodies across the globe that are outright banning the participation of transgender athletes. and we know that just socially, there are so many barriers for our participation and acceptance.\n\naccording to transathlete.com and data from glesen, which works to end discrimination, harassment, and bullying based on sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, 16 states have friendly policies for trans, non-binary and gender non-conforming student athletes.\n\nhowever, 14 states require medical proof or invasive disclosures from student athletes, and 10 states did not issue statewide guidance on best practices.\n\neleven states have discriminatory policies that create additional barriers for trans, nonbinary and gender non-conforming student athletes.\n\nmosier has used his social media to draw attention to specific legislation, such as tennessee's house bill 1572, which would penalize schools that allow transgender athletes to play on the team that aligns with their gender identity. he has also raised awareness online about similar bills regarding transgender student athletes in other states including georgia, washington and missouri.\n\nmosier says he hopes sharing the diverse stories of athletes helps create change in society.\n\ni think that sport is a vehicle for social change and if we can make change in or sports teams, in our sports leagues, in our community sports clubs, that change can ripple out into the rest of our communities, he said.
wednesday marks the 20th anniversary of the announcement of dolly the sheep, the first mammal cloned from an adult cell. her creation left a lasting impact on both the public and the field of developmental biology, experts say.\n\nat the time, other researchers had managed to clone mammals by splitting embryos in a test tube and implanting them in adults. however, none had successfully used an adult somatic (body) cell to clone a mammal. researchers at the roslin institute in scotland were finally able to produce dolly — cloned from the udder cell of an adult sheep — after 276 attempts, according to the national human genome research institute (nhgri).\n\nfor a developmental biologist, the ability to clone an advanced mammal was thought to be impossible, lawrence brody, director of the division of genomics and society at the nhgri, told live science.\n\nalthough dolly was born in july 1996, researchers announced dolly's existence on feb. 22, 1997. the delay in the announcement was due to the time needed to amass sufficient data on the project, check the data, write and get the manuscript published, said bruce whitelaw, the head of the division of developmental biology at the roslin institute. [5 fascinating findings about stem cells]\n\nalthough british biologist john gurdon had cloned frogs from the skin cells of adult frogs in 1958, researchers after him had failed to clone mammals such as mice, rats and pigs, despite trying for decades, brody said. he added that many researchers began to feel there had to be something different about mammals in the way their genome and genetic blueprints are packaged, and that cloning them would be impossible.\n\nhowever, dolly's creation told us that was all wrong, brody said.\n\nthat breakthrough would be crucial in the years to come. it is rare that a single scientific story can have such a rapid, then sustained, impact on science, whitelaw said. dolly had a massive scientific impact, especially through driving stem cell research and therapy, whitelaw told live science.\n\nian wilmut, the scientist who led the team that created dolly, similarly told live science that research on dolly led to both unexpected and very important results. the birth of dolly and the new understanding of the opportunity to change the functioning of cells made researchers consider other possible ways of modifying cells, wilmut said. later, in 2006, researchers in japan found that introducing a set of four proteins into these skin cells led to a portion of them to become very similar to embryo stem cells, where they had the ability to then differentiate into different adult cell types, wilmut said.\n\nthe whole stem-cell investigation was really stimulated by the fact that dolly was able to be born, and stem cells still are quite promising as a means to be able to repair human tissues when they're damaged, brody said. we're obviously not there yet, but it is something that could be traced back to the success of dolly.\n\nthere is also a link between the dolly experiments and the so-called crispr technologies that allow scientists to edit genomes, brody said: both are breakthroughs of enormous magnitude, and could help researchers figure out ways to repair damaged or diseased tissues, he said. [unraveling the human genome: 6 molecular milestones]\n\nanother important result of the dolly experiments is that they put science in the spotlight. dolly captured the world's imagination and allowed the world to hear about science, brody said. it's rare that the general public gets enamored [with] science, and it was clearly enamored with dolly. the creation of dolly also brought up important conversations about the ethical limitations of manipulating human cells and embryos, laying the groundwork for similar conversations today, brody said.\n\ndolly died in february 2003, at age 6.

tesla chief executive elon musk on thursday surpassed amazon.com founder jeffrey bezos as the world's richest person. a jump in the price of tesla stock lifted the value of his wealth on paper to more than $188 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index.\n\ntesla shares rose more than 7% on thursday, helping push musk's net worth to $1.5 billion above bezos' fortune, according to bloomberg, citing data tracked by its wealth index. shares of the electric-car maker have enjoyed a spectacular run in the past year, surging almost 800% from about $92 a year ago to more than $811 in thursday's trading.\n\nresponding on twitter to an account that pointed out he was now the world's richest person, musk responded, how strange. he later added, well, back to work …\n\ntesla's stock was added to the s&p 500 last month. the company's value of $768 billion is greater than that of ford, gm, volkswagen and toyota combined.\n\nhow strange — elon musk (@elonmusk) january 7, 2021\n\nmusk's rise to the top of the rich list comes as the nation's billionaires have seen their fortunes surge by more than $1 trillion during the pandemic, thanks in part to a strong stock market fueled by investor expectations for an economic recovery in 2021. companies such as amazon have seen sales and profits spike as consumers shifted their spending patterns and changed their behaviors to adjust to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nto be sure, the change in ranking might not last given the variable nature of high-profile stocks such as amazon and tesla. and bezos would likely remain the world's richest person without his divorce in 2019, which gave his ex-wife mackenzie scott about 25% of their holdings in amazon.\n\nscott, meanwhile, is the 23rd richest person in the world, with a net worth of more than $56 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index. last month, scott said she donated more than $4.2 billion of her fortune to charities including anti-hunger groups and educational institutions.\n\namazon's stock has been no slacker, either. since last january, its shares have gained more than 66%.
in the span of a week, from late december to early january, temperatures high in the atmosphere above the arctic jumped by 100 degrees fahrenheit. while this may sound alarming, it's a natural phenomenon that happens every couple of years, but experts say human-caused climate change may be making these events more likely.\n\nthe remarkable event is called a sudden stratospheric warming (ssw), and it involves the temperatures 50,000 to 100,000 feet above the ground. it disrupts the typical winter climate pattern in the arctic stratosphere famously known as the polar vortex, and typically leads to more extreme winter weather in parts of the united states.\n\npictured is a typical stratospheric winter polar vortex where a large counter-clockwise circulation keeps cold air trapped in the arctic circle. cbs news\n\nthe polar vortex is a huge low-pressure gyre of cold winds spinning counter-clockwise, which rotate quickly around the arctic circle from west to east. but when an ssw occurs, if it is a strong enough event, winds will often reverse and become easterly, and the polar vortex will split into two or three separate vortices, which then drift southward towards the mid-latitudes carrying cold air along with them.\n\nthis is a nice way image to illustrate what is happening in the stratosphere right now. the polar vortex which typically would be near the north pole and very cold (purple) is displaced south and split as the sudden stratospheric warming occurs. more here. https://t.co/ikja3evtxp pic.twitter.com/njqtehresu — jeff berardelli (@weatherprof) january 6, 2021\n\nin most cases the ssw propagates down through the clouds to the earth's surface over the course of a few weeks. when this happens it throws the arctic upper-level wind patterns off-kilter and the domino effect leads to convoluted jet stream patterns around the world in the mid-latitudes like canada, the u.s., europe and asia. that means it will almost certainly result in some extreme winter weather, and given the expected pattern in the u.s., that will most likely happen along the east coast.\n\nthe ssw that is happening right now is in fact characterized as a major event. since late december temperatures have increased from around minus-110 degrees fahrenheit to minus-10 degrees — a jump of 100 degrees — at a height of 100,000 feet above the north pole.\n\nin the image below the purple line shows the abrupt heating this past week, compared to the much flatter black line which is the average temperature.\n\nthis is a graph of atmospheric temperatures high above the north pole. the thick black line is the average. the blue line is last winter. the purple line is this winter. over the past week the purple line spikes upward indicating rapid warming in the arctic. this is called a sudden stratospheric warming event. the scale on the left is in degrees kelvin. the purple text shows that corresponds to a jump of temperatures from -110 fahrenheit to -10 fahrenheit over one week's time. nasa\n\ncauses of sudden stratospheric warming\n\ndr. judah cohen is an expert on sudden stratospheric warming events and the connection between changes in the arctic and mid-latitude weather patterns at atmospheric and environmental research (aer), a verisk company.\n\nhe says the beginnings of the sudden warming in the stratosphere starts much closer to the ground, in a layer of the atmosphere called the troposphere. but in order for this abrupt disruption to reach upward from the troposphere into the stratosphere, you need the excess energy of an extreme weather pattern — something that has been in no short supply lately in the arctic.\n\nwhen all the numbers are crunched, 2020 will be one of the warmest if not the warmest year on record in the arctic. this is especially true in northern asia near the barents, kara, laptev and siberian seas, where parts of the region averaged a remarkable 10 degrees fahrenheit above normal.\n\nearth has a fever in more ways than one. some places averaged + 5-7 °c warmer than normal for the entire year of 2020. an enormous area of anomalous warmth plagued arctic siberia effectively all year but it was not just the arctic where we saw record shattering warmth. thread pic.twitter.com/l4bor71s8t — scott duncan (@scottduncanwx) january 4, 2021\n\neven for an arctic that is warming at three times the pace of the rest of the globe due to climate change — a phenomenon known as arctic amplification — this is an extreme departure from normal. the result was record-breaking low sea-ice extent near the siberian coast.\n\nthe persistent warmth over siberia was one of the most remarkable weather/climate events of 2020. it's no surprise that sea ice averaged the lowest on record along its coast. plenty more graphics in the coming weeks to summarize this event... pic.twitter.com/nwnhqqt6fr — zack labe (@zlabe) december 29, 2020\n\naccording to cohen's theory, the lack of sea-ice and the fact that it took a few weeks longer than typical to recover this autumn set into motion a chain of events where the typical prevailing winter jet stream pattern across asia was enhanced. that enhancement in turn helps initiate the sudden stratospheric warming.\n\nthe animation below is an idealized illustration of the effect, in which there is an enhanced heat dome (known as a ridge) over northwest russia and an enhanced dip in the jet stream (known as a trough) in eastern asia and the north pacific.\n\non average during the winter there is a typical jet stream pattern across europe and asia with a ridge to the west and a trough to the east. but because of arctic amplification from climate change this jet stream can be magnified (made more extreme) which has implications for weather around the northern hemisphere. cbs news\n\nthe jet stream is a river of fast-flowing air in the upper atmosphere which guides storms from one place to another. just like waves in the ocean, it undulates up and down, from north to south, as it flows around the earth. these undulations are known as atmospheric waves. and while most of the energy flows around the globe horizontally, some of the wave energy can move vertically, transferring energy upward or downward, especially when those waves are amplified.\n\ncohen explains that any given time the wave pattern is naturally elongated over eurasia as compared to the rest of the globe. in a typical pattern this would have no impact on the stratosphere. but when this already large wave becomes even more enhanced by arctic amplification, the energy in the wave can propagate upward into the stratosphere and cause chaos.\n\nwatch how the stratospheric polar vortex evolves from a strong symmetrical system in december to a disturbed version now as significant warming invades the arctic in a sudden stratospheric warming event. this disruption will likely have implications in the mid lats for weeks. https://t.co/8yol4gh4ij — jeff berardelli (@weatherprof) january 5, 2021\n\nthis connection between the warm arctic, low sea-ice cover and an amplified jet stream is the reason why cohen believes climate change is leading to more frequent ssws. but he acknowledges that the topic is controversial.\n\nand while the theory behind the connection makes meteorological sense and some studies do support the connection, dr. zack labe, an arctic climate scientist at colorado state university, says you can find an equal number of scientific papers finding a connection versus no connection. due to all of the chaos and noise in our atmosphere, it still remains challenging to understand connections between arctic climate change and the polar vortex, explains labe. this topic remains an active area of scientific research and debate.\n\nbut in a recent paper, labe was indeed able to find a robust connection between arctic amplification and a stronger, colder area of high pressure over eastern siberia, something that is a key to cohen's theory. labe's analysis finds that this effect will intensify if global warming gets worse.\n\ncohen theorizes that the warming process underway in the stratospheric arctic right now was initiated in october. in northwest russia and scandinavia, the warmer arctic ocean results in an enhanced heat dome which pushes the jet stream north.\n\nwith less sea-ice cover due to a warmer arctic, the overlying atmosphere absorbs more moisture from the arctic ocean and, when it is cold enough, dumps more snowfall east of the heat dome. that snow cover, cohen says, creates an extra-cold air mass over interior siberia, kazakhstan and mongolia. this colder air has the opposite effect on the jet stream in eastern siberia and the northern pacific, pushing it south.\n\nin what is not likely a coincidence, this pattern yielded two astonishing records last week. on december 28, the unofficial highest pressure ever recorded on earth happened in mongolia.\n\nlooking at 2100 utc obs in mongolia, tosontsengel is reporting 1089.5 hpa. this station is the record-holder from 2001 (1084.8 hpa). further, tsetsen uul (labelled w/ h) is reporting 1093.5 hpa (32.29). these, along with other reports, if verified, would break the world record. pic.twitter.com/jxx24w4jp5 — mike adcock (@mikeadcockwx) december 28, 2020\n\nthen just three days later the opposite occurred: the north pacific and alaska recorded their lowest pressures on record as a huge aleutian low reached a pressure as low as a category 5 hurricane.\n\na new alaska land-based low pressure record has been set! shemya, ak dropped to 924.8mb at 2159z (1259 akst) today. the previous accepted record was from a ship in dutch harbor at 925mb in 1977. pressure is now slowly rising at shemya. #akwx #hurricaneforce pic.twitter.com/1yiyopvstr — nws anchorage (@nwsanchorage) december 31, 2020\n\ni would argue that all these events are linked, says cohen, a strengthened siberian high coupled with a deep aleutian low are critical for triggering a sudden stratospheric warming. most important in my opinion is the siberian high but coupled with a deep low in the north pacific is a one-two knockout punch.\n\nin other words, processes in the atmosphere do not happen in a vacuum — everything is connected — so one extreme can sometimes help yield another. and this one-two punch was an amplified enough pattern to send energy into the stratosphere, causing the sudden warming and polar vortex disruption.\n\nextreme winter weather pattern coming up\n\ncohen says that after a stratospheric warming event, the biggest impacts typically follow in about two weeks as the atmosphere shuffles systems around and new patterns become established. the timing and degree varies from event to event.\n\nin the arctic the sudden warming in the stratosphere typically leads to blocking areas of high pressure — like a mountain of warm air — known as the negative arctic oscillation, or -ao. as it turns out, the -ao is already underway and this ssw episode should act to prolong it. this blocking pattern forces and redirects the jet stream and cold arctic air southward.\n\nfor this particular ssw event it appears the main arctic outbreak will occur first over europe and eastern asia through mid-january. but then computer models show a shift occurring, with the potential for arctic invasions in the u.s. later this month.\n\nalong with a gradual building of cold air over the coming weeks in the east, the jet stream setup will provide many opportunities for snow storms. while many will not materialize, with a prolonged pattern favorable for extreme winter weather, odds are that pieces of the puzzle will come together for a couple of memorable winter storms.\n\non average the pattern the next few weeks should feature a ridge of high pressure with warm and dry conditions in the u.s. west and a dip in the jet stream, called a trough, in the east with disturbances (areas of low pressure) rotating around the trough. any of these disturbances has the potential to turn into a winter storm. cbs news\n\ncohen warns that the chance for extreme winter weather may last for quite a while. following an ssw the period of increased risk of cold air outbreaks and snowstorms usually lasts from four to eight weeks. it is not cold and snowing continuously but rather it is episodic, he explained.\n\nafter years of studying these phenomena, cohen says a clear pattern has emerged. warm arctic conditions and a weaker stratospheric polar vortex, is linked to more cold extreme episodes in some parts of the mid-latitudes.\n\nthis is not to say that winters are getting colder in the mid-latitudes. to the contrary, overall winters are warming due to climate change, although some pockets are indeed warming more slowly because of this effect. that's because these types of mid-latitude cold air episodes are made more likely by arctic amplification, and research has found an increasing frequency in weak polar vortex states over the past four decades, linked to human-caused climate change.\n\nfor the u.s. the trends are clear: cohen's research shows a direct connection between intense warming events in the arctic and more episodes of extreme winter weather in the eastern u.s.\n\nin the below graph for the city of boston, the blue lines indicate a cold arctic, the red lines indicate a warm arctic, and the green lines represent the accumulated winter season severity index (awssi), a measure of snow and cold. cohen points out just how straightforward the trend is: as the arctic warms (red), cold and snow (green) increase in boston. this is especially true following episodes of major arctic warming, as is happening now. this is also the case for much of the eastern u.s.\n\nin the graph for the city of boston, the blue lines indicate a cold arctic, the red lines indicate a warm arctic and the green lines represent the accumulated winter season severity index (awssi), a measure of snow and cold. as the arctic warms (red), cold and snow (green) increase in boston. judah cohen\n\nin what may seem paradoxical, as global warming has intensified in recent years, the number of big northeast snowstorms has increased. in fact, many of the biggest snowstorms in new york city history, like the january blizzard of 2016, have happened in the past two decades. while some of this may be related to natural variability, cohen feels changes in the arctic clearly play a role.\n\nin the bar graph below, the northeast impact snowfall scale (nesis) is plotted for each decade from 1958 through 2018. you can clearly see the spike in activity in the last decade shown, 2008 to 2018.\n\nover the past decade major northeast snowstorms have increased. there are likely a number of reasons for this, from natural variability to a warming climate. but evidence shows that a warm arctic leads to more extreme winter weather in the eastern u.s. noaa and judah cohen\n\nit should be noted that this trend in bigger snowstorms is likely also due to other factors related to a warmer climate like warmer ocean temperatures, more available moisture and more intense storms due to extra energy in the system.\n\nthis means, for now, climate change can lead to bigger snowfalls for areas where there's more moisture and it is still cold enough to snow, like the midwest and northeast. but in areas where temperatures are warming above thresholds for snow more often, like the nation's midsection, the trend in snowfall is downward. the below image makes this trend clear.\n\nchange in annual snowfall (percent) for the 1991-2020 period compared to the 1981-2010 period. stations with ≤ 2 missing days for all months (including summer) for 22+ years in each

eastern half of the nation, prepare for real winter weather and the possibility of snow.
yosemite national park, calif. - yosemite national park is set to start showing the new names for some of park's most iconic attractions after no settlement was reached to a bitter legal dispute.\n\nas of tuesday, the historic ahwahnee hotel will become the majestic yosemite hotel and curry village campground will be named half dome village. badger pass ski resort will now be yosemite ski and snowboard area.\n\nthe park service announced last year that it would change the names of curry village, the ahwahnee hotel, badger pass ski resort and many other attractions after failing to reach agreement with the company that says it owns the trademarks to those attractions.\n\nthe company, delaware north, has served as the park's concessionaire since 1993, running numerous park operations until losing the contract to aramark, which is scheduled to take over at midnight. delaware north and the park service have been unable to agree on the value of the trademarks and the buffalo, new york-based company filed a breach-of-contract lawsuit.\n\nthe dispute prompted the park service to announce the name changes. starting at midnight, park service employees will begin placing temporary signs over road signs directing visitors to the attractions while aramark will be responsible for changing the names of the attractions.\n\npark service spokesman scott gediman said temporary signs are being used in the hope that a settlement will be reached with delaware north.\n\nan historic sign welcoming visitors to the park's ahwahnee hotel was stolen sometime saturday night or sunday morning, gediman said.\n\nit's part of the park's historic fabric, gediman said. and we are taking this seriously.\n\nthe ahwahnee hotel is to be renamed the majestic yosemite hotel.\n\ndelaware north spokesman glen white said park service officials turned down the company's offer to let the park continue using the trademark names until the legal dispute was resolved.\n\ngediman said the park service turned down the offer made friday because that would acknowledge they own the names.\n\nmark bartholomew, a university at buffalo law professor who teaches trademark law, says delaware north may also want to preserve the value of the names at issue. the iconic names will lose value if they are no longer used, he said.\n\ni think all sides will ultimately come to an agreement after some more posturing, bartholomew said.\n\ncourt filing show the park service valuing the trademarks at $3.5 million and delaware north puts their worth at $51 million.
detroit -- most of detroit's public schools were forced to close wednesday because of a massive sick-out by teachers upset over school conditions, leaving parents scrambling for child care as thousands of students remained home for another day.\n\nthe sick-out shuttered more than 85 of the financially struggling district's roughly 100 schools and was timed to coincide with a visit to the city by president obama.\n\ntemperatures in the teens appeared to have kept most students indoors, and all wednesday's protest - and one last week - did for carnisha wesley, 23, was to make her late for her own classes. wesley had to scramble to find a sitter for her 5-year-old daughter, myajai, as ann arbor trail school was closed.\n\nit's inconvenient. it makes me a little late for school when i have to find someone to watch her, said wesley, a pharmacy tech student at the everest institute's detroit campus.\n\ndisgruntled detroit educators have stepped up efforts to protest the governor's plans for the district, its ramshackle finances, their low pay, dilapidated buildings and overcrowded classrooms.\n\nseveral dozen people marched in front of detroit's convention center, with many of those chanting and carrying signs detroit public schools teachers. the protest lasted more than an hour as marchers hoped to be on hand when mr. obama's motorcade arrived to tour the north american international auto show.\n\nmr. obama's visit was to highlight progress in the city and the auto industry. it also opened up a bigger stage for teachers to get their message out, according to detroit federation of teachers spokeswoman ann mitchell.\n\npeople couldn't miss the opportunity for us to say, this is what's happening and we really need help, mitchell told the associated press. we really need someone to help focus on the schools.\n\nthe closures wednesday in the 46,000-student district come after more than 60 schools were closed jan. 11 because of an absence of teachers. other sick-outs affecting a smaller number of schools have taken place as well. in response, city officials have started inspecting schools for any code and safety violations.\n\nshanay watson-whittaker has seen fallen ceiling tiles, cold classrooms and leaking ceilings.\n\nthe teachers teach despite being in those conditions. this is appalling, she said, adding that three of her five children remained home wednesday when renaissance high school was closed.\n\nthey're home right now. they are doing homework, watson-whittaker said wednesday afternoon. they were dressed for school when we got the phone call that school was closed.\n\nmayor mike duggan has called for teachers to stop the sick-outs and return to their classrooms while state legislators work on solving the district's financial crisis, saying the frustrations are legitimate, but the solution is not to send the kids home.\n\nduggan gave white house official cecilia munoz a tour of some city neighborhoods on wednesday, after he met tuesday with detroit's delegation in the legislature to work out their strategy on trying to improve conditions. the schools, he says, are only getting worse. lansing needs to act.\n\ngov. rick snyder has pushed state lawmakers to pass bills to overhaul the school district by splitting it in two, spending more than $700 million over a decade, warning of a potential bankruptcy. already, the district is run by an emergency manager appointed by the republican governor.\n\nthe district said it has no choice but to close schools when teachers don't report to work.\n\nwatson-whittaker said her anger is not toward the teachers but with the emergency manager and how the state has run the education in the district.\n\nteacher and activist steve conn said snyder is attacking public education in detroit.\n\nthe number of schools closed wednesday indicates that more teachers are joining the sick-outs.\n\nthis movement has grown, and i think it has grown among the teachers themselves, mitchell said. we were not encouraging people to go out today, but people are feeling it's the time now to do big actions to show what they're feeling.\n\nwesley got help from her mother on wednesday to watch myajai, who is in kindergarten, but says more closings may lead her to remove her daughter from detroit schools.\n\ni can't have her out of school and not learning, wesley said.
the woman who was caught on camera allegedly tackling a black teenager in a new york hotel was arraigned over the weekend and freed on supervised release. cell phone video shows miya ponsetto accusing 14-year-old keyon harrold jr. of stealing her phone last month.\n\nponsetto later appears to tackle the teen as he tried to leave the hotel. he never had her phone, and it turned up minutes later. ponsetto is charged with attempted robbery, grand larceny, endangering the welfare of a child and attempted assault.\n\ncbs this morning co-host gayle king spoke with ponsetto and attorney sharen ghatan, before her arrest last week.\n\nwatch part of their conversation here and read more below.\n\ngayle king: you seem to have attacked this teenager about the phone. and then it turned out he didn't even have your phone. that's the thing. i mean, you're saying, look like, i'm 22 years old — you're 22 years old, but you are old enough to know better.\n\nmiya ponsetto: alright gayle, enough. the hotel did have my phone. the hotel did end up having my phone. i did get my belongings returned to me. so, maybe it wasn't him. but at the same time, how is it so that — as soon as i get asked to leave the premises — after i had accused this person of stealing my phone, how is it that all of a sudden, they just miraculously have my phone when i come back? and the two — it didn't seem as if my accusations really bothered the son and the father because they were just enjoying a nice meal right after this whole encounter. but all i'm saying —\n\nking: i don't know if you —\n\nponsetto: i want this to be over —\n\nking: miya, i don't know if you could say what —\n\nponsetto: and i'm sorry —\n\nking: whether they were bothered by your — i don't know if you —\n\nponsetto: so, i would love to make this short and sweet, gayle.\n\nking: miya, i want to go back to that day. take us back to that day. we've all seen the video.\n\nponsetto: so, i arrived back to the hotel after grabbing some starbucks. i had noticed my phone had been missing. so i just approached the hotel manager, asked him if he could kindly just check the footage. in my opinion, i was, like, okay. any person walking down could possibly be the person that might've had my phone. i wasn't racial profiling whatsoever. i'm puerto rican. i'm, like, a woman of color. i'm italian, greek, puerto rican.\n\nking: you keep saying you're puerto rican. does that mean that you can't be racist because you're saying you're a woman of color? is that what you mean?\n\nponsetto: exactly.\n\nking: well, i would disagree with that. people of color can be racist too. do you believe that you should pay a price for this?\n\nponsetto: i don't feel that my accusation is a crime.\n\nking: but it's more than the accusation. it's the way that you tackled him, it seems, on the videotape. what would you do differently? you said that you look at that tape and that's not who you are.\n\nponsetto: i think i could've just asked the hotel manager. so yes, i could've stepped aside. or the father and i, we immediately could've started just speaking at a lower tone, and probably that would have handled the whole situation a lot better.\n\nking: with all due respect, when mr. harrold was talking to you, it seemed to me that he was responding to you because you had accused his son.\n\nponsetto: i'm saying that both of us. i said both of us.\n\nghaten: bottom line is this issue is much bigger than i think miya is appreciating. and she sees it as a very simple thing.\n\nghaten sat with ponsetto through the entire interview, and wanted her client to feel empowered to tell her own story. but ghaten also felt it important to provide context on ponsetto's state of mind at the time of the incident.\n\nghaten: so let me just boil it down. she was a 22-year-old woman alone in new york. no one is with her. her entire contacts, flight arrangements, wi-fi, emails, apple pay, her funds, her money, is all on that phone. she agreed that her behavior and her actions were definitely less than elegant, shall we say, and less than graceful and less than what anyone else would do. and she agreed. and she wouldn't have repeated it.\n\nking: it's been reported that your phone was returned to you by an uber driver. is that true?\n\nponsetto: that is not true because i arrived at the hotel with my phone in my hand.\n\nking: okay. who returned your phone to you?\n\nponsetto: the hotel receptionist.\n\nking: miya, where had the phone been?\n\nponsetto: why don't we ask the hotel receptionist?\n\nking: miya, to be honest, i'm telling you, you seem to be not remorseful, to have no contrition. that you're almost a little flippant about this. you have to understand, for this teenage boy who says that he was shattered, who said that he was traumatized, this is a big deal.\n\nponsetto: i'm traumatized.\n\nking: you're traumatized too because?\n\nponsetto: yeah, and i'm sorry. i'm sorry from the bottom of my heart. he is honestly — he's 14? that's what they're claiming? yeah. i'm 22. i've lived probably just the same amount of life as him. like, honestly. i'm just as a kid at heart as he is. i feel sorry that i made the family go through, like, all of that stress. but at the same time, it wasn't just them going through that.\n\nking: i just don't think that you helped yourself by your behavior.\n\nponsetto: of course not.\n\nking: when you looked at that video, what did you think? what did you think, miya, when you looked at the video?\n\nponsetto: you already asked me that in the beginning of the interview. i'm not going over it again. i would like to have a real interview with real questions and real heart and real sincere apologies. let 2021 be the moment of healing. seriously.\n\nking: alright. what would you want an interview with real questions? i'll give you the floor. what would you like us to know, miya?\n\nponsetto: that i'm sincerely sorry to the family and the dad and the son for making them feel as if i was racist towards them when that is not my intention.\n\nghatan said she prepared ponsetto for the interview, but the 22-year-old went off script, disregarding the advice she was given. ponsetto is due back in court in march.\n\nthe parents of keyon harrold jr., jazz musician keyon harrold and kat rodriguez, also spoke with king about how their son is coping and their reaction to ponsetto's arrest.\n\nkeyon harrold: i'm happy that she's been arrested. but that's only the first step in a very big conversation that needs to happen here in america that has to do with racial profiling. if i had done that, what miya ponsetto had done to my son, i'd be in jail now. if i had hurt her in any way, i'd be in jail now. we wouldn't even be able to have this conversation. as a black man, every day i walk outside, i have to play the perfect game, almost like throwing a no-hitter, just to be believed.\n\ngayle king: the hotel has said, keyon, that they believe that it should've been handled differently.\n\nkat rodriguez: i'm so angry. i'm so angry at that hotel 'cause this could've been deescalated. this could've been deescalated a long time ago.\n\nking: we talked to miya ponsetto who says, i am puerto rican. this was not racial profiling. i just really panicked because i didn't have my phone. she says race had nothing to do with this particular incident, and certainly had nothing to do with her targeting your son. what do you think when you hear that?\n\nharrold: no one has to say the n-word for something to be an act of racism.\n\nking: keyon, you must've been stunned when you stepped off the elevator with your son.\n\nharrold: i'm still in shock, gayle. i'm still in shock at this point. i work as hard as i possibly can just to put my son in the best scenarios, to give him the chance to win, to give him a chance to be a whole young man, a whole young boy, black boy. we've been all over the world and for — to be in our beloved new york city and this happened, i'm appalled.\n\nking: i am not asking you to justify your behavior or defend yourself against her. please know that. but her version is that, you know, i was grabbed.\n\nharrold: pushing her away. to protect my son, yes. i'm a man who don't believe in hurting women, first of all. second of all, i do believe in protecting my son. so that is what i did.\n\nking: what do you all feel, or what do you make of her apology?\n\nharrold: listen, i feel like her apology was, you know, as genuine as when she shushed you. it said a lot. i have an issue with the idea of entitlement versus character.\n\nrodriguez: well said.\n\nharrold: it's all been tragically consistent. i'll just say that.\n\nrodriguez: yeah. i apologize. can we move on? those were the exact words that she used with you. does that sound like an apology? she knew she assaulted a 14-year-old boy. not a guy, not a man.\n\nkeyon jr. comes from a musical family. his mother is a singer and saxophonist for beyonce. his father is a grammy award-winning trumpeter. they say they are using music to help their son heal from this incident.\n\nthe 14-year-old wrote a song called unjustified times and recorded it with his friends while he played the drums.\n\nking: kat, i'd like to know how he's doing?\n\nrodriguez: when i went to hug him from behind, because i just, you know, we have such a great relationship. he said, mom. he tensed up. he literally tensed up. he said, mom, can i ask you not to do that? it — i can't. i can't. i can't.\n\nking: why did he ask you not to do that?\n\nrodriguez: because this young lady, which i will not say her name. she does not deserve that. this young lady blindsided him in the hotel. he keeps on asking the question, why? why me, mom? you know i wouldn't steal anything. i didn't know her. why? as a mother, to have to answer that question.\n\nharrold: it's tough to look at her being arrested more than what it is. because the person who killed trayvon martin is free. the person who blamed emmett till is still alive. things could've gone another way.\n\nking: what does justice look like for your family at this point for the both of you?\n\nharrold: justice, i think the idea of justice, just like the idea of the apology, is so much more than just saying, i'm sorry, because people can say, i'm sorry, and it's empty. justice has to do with change.
suddenly, crisis management is an urgent issue in the presidential campaign. coronavirus has infected world financial markets. and now, wall street is calculating the chances of a recession. into this, a new name will appear on primary ballots for the first time. michael bloomberg, the 78-year-old billionaire and former mayor of new york city, skipped the early contests. but he's already spent almost $500 million, much of it aimed at this week's super tuesday. we spoke to mike bloomberg saturday, and earlier in the week, about how he would lead, his reputation with women and minorities and the virus crisis.\n\nscott pelley: how do you view this emergency?\n\nmike bloomberg: i find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did [friday] night in south carolina.\n\nscott pelley: he said that the democrats making so much of it is a democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.\n\nmike bloomberg: this is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. and it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that, if it is, we have the medicines and the structure and the knowledge to deal with it.\n\ndemocratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg\n\nscott pelley: the president's proposed budget would have cut 16% from the budget of the centers for disease control, and about 8% from the national institutes of health.\n\nmike bloomberg: i would have raised it rather than cut it.\n\nscott pelley: i should say that the congress didn't allow that to happen, so the cuts didn't happen. but what do you make of the effort to cut those budgets?\n\nmike bloomberg: we have to spend money to make us safe and protect this country. it's like saying i'm not going to fund the military. i'm not gonna fund the local fire department. we're not gonna have fires. i don't believe-- fires are hoaxes. this is about the level that he's talking.\n\nspending money is what the trump administration has in mind now. it's asking for nearly $2 billion for a virus response led by the vice president. despite that, markets plummeted about 10% last week.\n\nscott pelley: what about wall street?\n\nmike bloomberg: wall street does not do well with uncertainty. and it's-- the worst thing is nobody knows how bad this is going to get. i can just tell you, in my company, we're splitting in all our big offices into two different buildings, even if it's just a temporary thing. if this flu does strike, and strikes our employees, it won't strike all of them, because we have to continue to provide a service.\n\nscott pelley: friday evening, the president announced his selection for director of national intelligence. his principal qualification for that job appears to be fierce loyalty to the president.\n\nmike bloomberg: that's all of the president's appointees, have that one characteristic.\n\nscott pelley: and i'm curious, how would you fill the top jobs in government?\n\nmike bloomberg: plain and simple: you get some experts. you put 'em in a room and say, okay, now who should we go hire to do this job? who's the best person in the world? we'll start there. asking what party they're a member of, how they voted the last time, it is so nonsensical. if you are sick, do you really wanna go to a doctor who was politically correct? or somebody that knew how to treat your disease? i'll rest my case.\n\nbloomberg is pressing his case after a late start and poor showing in his first debate last month. this past wednesday, after a better, second debate, he slept three hours before heading to his times square headquarters to phone voters. he's opened more than 200 offices with 2,400 staff.\n\nbloomberg and scott pelley outside bloomberg's childhood home.\n\nthat same morning, he met us for a flight to his boyhood home.\n\nscott pelley: you told everybody who would listen that you're not running for president.\n\nmike bloomberg: i did.\n\nscott pelley: what changed?\n\nmike bloomberg: i started watching and listening to the candidates. and they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. donald trump is gonna eat 'em for lunch.\n\nthat evening he would head to south carolina and texas. bloomberg comes to politics like the electrical engineer he is, pragmatic not charismatic.\n\n\n\nmike bloomberg: i have been training for this job for close to 20 years there is nobody else running that has any management experience whatsoever in any of these things, but you have to have somebody that's been there done that and will do it right and will guide us through the tough times particularly day one.\n\nscott pelley: what does the data today tell you about the voter that leads you to believe that you can win?\n\nmike bloomberg: a few years ago there was a revolution against the intelligentsia. people said, you know, those people, particularly on the coasts, are trying to tell us what to do. they wanted a change. that explains donald trump. now, people seem to have changed. this cycle, people want stability.\n\nbloomberg arrives on stage for the democratic presidential primary debate in charleston, south carolina. scott olson / getty images\n\nhis political career began in 2001. he won the mayor's office three times as a republican, then once as an independent. his strategy was the one he is using right now: he massively outspent his opponents in self-funded campaigns. in 12 years, bloomberg helped rebuild ground zero, helped the city survive the great recession. he banned smoking in restaurants, improved schools and balanced the budget. but there was controversy. bloomberg expanded a police tactic called stop and frisk. more than 80% of those stopped were minorities. less than 1% were carrying guns.\n\nscott pelley: you defended stop and frisk right up to the point that you announced you were going to run for president. what have you learned?\n\nmike bloomberg: we should've, in retrospect, been more careful and keep it from-- and keep the numbers from growing and we did not and for that i am very sorry.\n\nscott pelley: it was a mistake, the way that it rolled out--\n\nmike bloomberg: well, yeah, there's no argument about it. it was a mistake. i erred. it was a mistake. i've took-- i haven't walked away from my responsibility for it.\n\nbloomberg is divorced with two daughters and two grandchildren. he still owns his boyhood home in medford, massachusetts.\n\nscott pelley: your parents bought this house through an intermediary because the owner wouldn't sell to a jew.\n\nmike bloomberg: correct. 1946, and the guy who sold it to us said his sister would never forgive him.\n\nscott pelley: do you think america's ready for a jewish president?\n\nmike bloomberg: nobody's-- virtually nobody's mentioned it and i think in this day and age, yes. we've moved on. it's a better world than it was back then.\n\ncengiz yar / getty images\n\nmike bloomberg is the ninth richest person in the world, worth about $60 billion. his success began in 1981. before pc's or the internet evolved, bloomberg created a data and communications network for wall street. today, the bloomberg terminal is the central nervous system of world finance. but he told us, if he wins the presidency, he'll sell the company.\n\nscott pelley: what does a multibillionaire know about people who are living paycheck to paycheck and hoping that the car doesn't break down?\n\nmike bloomberg: when i lived in this house my father made $6,000 the best year of his life. my parents took a mortgage out on the house, i think it was $11,000, if i remember, to help my sister and i go through school. i worked as hard as anybody. not better. i wasn't any better or worse, i was luckier, i think than other people.\n\nhe has 20,000 employees. but in early years, some found the office harsh. allegations by women have challenged his political campaigns.\n\nscott pelley: in 1990, as a tongue-in-cheek gift, your employees immortalized some of your sayings, in a booklet called, the wit and wisdom of michael bloomberg.\n\nmike bloomberg: i don't think i ever saw the book, but i do remember it.\n\nscott pelley: one of them has you describing your bloomberg terminal, and the quote in the book is, quoting you, it will do everything, including give you, a euphemism for oral sex--\n\nmike bloomberg: right, okay.\n\nscott pelley: i guess that puts a lot of you girls out of business.\n\nmike bloomberg: well, i didn't write the book. so--\n\nscott pelley: did you say these things?\n\nmike bloomberg: i don't remember saying it. i can tell you that years ago on the trading room floors, things were different. i apologize for that, i'm sorry if somebody was hurt.\n\nscott pelley: you don't remember.\n\nmike bloomberg: if i annoyed somebody or hurt somebody i apologize. i can't go rewrite history. i can only tell you now it is a different world.\n\nscott pelley: it's a different world, but the question is, is it a different man?\n\nmike bloomberg: oh, i think, for sure. you evolve with times. we're all a product of the world we live in. shame on you if you don't learn and try to be better.\n\nbloomberg was named in lawsuits three times in the 1990's by female employees offended by his alleged comments. one suit was settled, two were dismissed.\n\nscott pelley: how can you be the standard-bearer for a party that claims the high ground on the rights of women and minorities?\n\nmike bloomberg: because i brought down the murder rate. i doubled the, or cut the gap between rich and poor education. i created 500,000 jobs, 175,000 units of affordable housing. we did all the things to reduce poverty that anybody could possibly do. and when i left, i think it's fair to say most people, women, minorities, they would say it was the best 12 years the city has had in modern memory.\n\nsince leaving city hall, bloomberg has been giving away his fortune. he has donated billions to reduce gun violence, smoking, and greenhouse gases. he spent more than $100 million helping democrats in 2018 when they retook the house.\n\nhe's telling voters he would expand obamacare while keeping employer-provided insurance. and provide eventual citizenship to the 11 million residents who immigrated illegally. he's for control of the borders but doesn't think a wall will do it.\n\nscott pelley: who's gonna get a tax increase--\n\nmike bloomberg: the wealthy.\n\nscott pelley: --in your administration, and who's gonna get a tax cut\n\nmike bloomberg: we're gonna have to raise taxes on me and people like me.\n\nhe means a 5% surtax on household incomes over $5 million and a roll back of president trump's 2017 cuts for the wealthy.\n\nscott pelley: you have already spent twice as much on this campaign as president trump has raised. how much are you willing to spend?\n\nmike bloomberg: well, i'm making an investment in this country. my investment is i'm going to remove president trump from 1600 pennsylvania avenue or at least try as hard as i can.\n\nscott pelley: so it's a blank check? you'd spend $1 billion?\n\nmike bloomberg: well, i don't know if it's a blank check, but, when they come to me and they wanna spend more, i've so far said yes.\n\nhe said 'yes' to starting a new company to analyze voter data for targeting ads and social media. this was president trump's big advantage in 2016 and bloomberg is spending heavily to catch up.\n\nscott pelley: if you're not the nominee, will you support the nominee of the party?\n\nmike bloomberg: it's an easy commitment for me to make because the alternative is donald trump, so yes, i would support the nominee--\n\nscott pelley: if you don't finish in the top three on super tuesday is that it for you?\n\nmike bloomberg: no, of course not.\n\nscott pelley: you'll keep going.\n\nmike bloomberg: yeah, sure. there's an election seven or so days later. there's another one 14 days later. there's a number of elections after that.\n\ndespite joe biden's win yesterday in south carolina, bloomberg believes bernie sanders is the candidate to beat. he's counting on voters to move toward a centrist who believes government should be effective and dull, not a blood sport for tv.\n\nmike bloomberg: the middle of the road doesn't want extremism. they want evolution rather than revolution. and if bernie sanders is the candidate, donald trump will win. donald trump not only will win, but the house will go back to being in republican hands, the senate will stay in republican hands. downstream, a lotta the state houses will flip back republican. and when that happens, you're gonna have gerrymandering at the local level and judicial appointments at the federal level that will last for decades. and so, what's really at stake here is the future of this country for a very long time. and that's why i'm running.\n\nproduced by maria gavrilovic. associate producer, alex ortiz. broadcast associate, ian flickinger. edited by peter m. berman and sean kelly.
can you hear that? it's the sound of an fcc plan to let airplane passengers make phone calls fizzling out.\n\non monday, fcc chairman ajit pai circulated an order that would end the agency's 2013 plan to decide whether to change its recommendation that cell phones not be used on airplanes. the plan opened the issue for public comment and possible revision.\n\nfcc commissioners must now vote on pai's order to decide whether to permanently ax the plan.\n\ni do not believe that moving forward with this plan is in the public interest, pai said in a statement. taking it off the table permanently will be a victory for americans across the country who, like me, value a moment of quiet at 30,000 feet.\n\nthis is a turnaround from former chairman tom wheeler's position. in 2013, wheeler emphasized that the ban on phone calls was based on whether cell phones would cause technical disruptions on flights.\n\nif the fcc did end up changing its rule, the final determination would have been left up to the us department of transportation -- and then to individual airlines -- on whether to allow phone calls. airlines would have needed to install special technology to give their passengers a cell signal while flying much higher than any of the planet's cell towers.\n\nthe fcc is the expert agency when it comes to technical communications issues, wheeler said in 2013. we are not the federal courtesy commission.\n\nas a commissioner in 2013, pai voted against wheeler's plan. in his dissenting opinion, pai cited emails he received from concerned airline passengers, one of whom said if the rule changed and a fellow passenger talked on the phone during a flight, i fear what i'd do with my cutlery!!!\n\nalthough i'm pretty sure that i could resist the urge to stab a fellow passenger, i understand these sentiments and share these concerns, pai wrote.\n\ntech enabled: cnet chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.\n\nspecial reports: cnet's in-depth features in one place.\n\nthis article originally appeared on cnet.
an individual's duty to retreat before using force has been eliminated in ohio under a gun rights bill signed by ohio's republican governor on monday. gov. mike dewine signed the bill despite his vocal concerns that gop lawmakers were ignoring his own legislation proposed following the 2019 mass shooting in dayton.\n\nthe measure expands the so-called stand your ground right from an individual's house and car to any place, if that person is in a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be.\n\nas recently as last month dewine hinted he might veto the bill, saying lawmakers should focus on what he sent them instead. but on monday, he signed the bill in the spirit of cooperation with the general assembly.\n\ni look forward to working with members of the legislature in the future to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and to protect the rights of citizens who follow the law, dewine said.\n\nhe said he was disappointed lawmakers didn't add the measures he sought for more than a year that would toughen background checks and boost penalties for felons committing new crimes with guns.\n\nthe governor has pushed these proposals since the aug. 4, 2019, dayton massacre that killed nine and wounded more than two dozen.\n\nnan whaley, the democratic mayor of dayton and a sometime ally of the governor, said she couldn't express my level of disappointment and accused him of giving into extremists in his own party. shortly after the dayton shooting, she and dewine pledged to work together on a bipartisan effort to change gun laws.\n\nour state needs principled leaders who will stand up for what is right - not what is politically easy, whaley tweeted.\n\nsen. kenny yuko of cleveland, the top senate democrat, called monday a sad day.\n\nthis is not what people meant when they asked us to 'do something' last year after the deadly mass shooting in dayton, yuko said in a tweet.\n\nrep. emilia sykes of akron, the top house democrat, went further, calling dewine a coward.\n\nonly cowards would pass and sign a bill that has been proven to disproportionately harm black people, added sykes, who is black.\n\nthe buckeye firearms association praised the move, saying dewine kept multiple promises, both publicly and privately with the association, to sign the bill.\n\nwe're very pleased the governor kept his promise to sign the repeal of ohio's duty to retreat law that forces victims of violent crime to retreat before they're legally able to defend themselves, said dan rieck, the group's executive director.\n\nrep. kyle koehler, a springfield republican who championed the change, also noted that dewine's action kept a promise to enact the legislation. he called the measure a simple fix of existing law that will protect law-abiding gun owners.\n\nohio becomes the 36th state with a similar measure, said two republican supporters, state sen. tim schaffer of lancaster and state sen. terry johnson of mcdermott in southern ohio.
beijing — china's economic growth hit a three-decade low in 2018, adding to pressure on beijing to beef up stimulus measures and settle a tariff war with washington.\n\ngrowth slowed to 6.6 percent from 2017's 6.9 percent as both the world's appetite for china's exports and domestic consumer spending weakened, official data showed monday.\n\nforecasters said they expect beijing to try to shore up growth by making credit cheaper, raising government spending and adopting measures to encourage sales of autos and consumer goods.\n\ncommunist leaders want to steer china toward slower, more self-sustaining growth driven by consumer spending instead of trade and investment. but the slowdown has been sharper than expected, prompting beijing to boost spending on construction of roads and bridges and to order banks to lend more, especially to the entrepreneurs who generate most of china's new jobs and wealth.\n\ndownward pressure on the economy is increasing, the commissioner of the national bureau of statistics, ning jizhe, said at a news conference. he cited import controls, volatile financial markets and declining investment spending as factors.\n\nstill, ning insisted china can resist shocks, saying the long-term trend of stability will not change.\n\nslowest growth since 1990\n\neconomic growth in 2018 was the lowest since 1990's 3.9 percent following the violent crackdown on pro-democracy protests centered on beijing's tiananmen square.\n\ngrowth in the last quarter of 2018 dipped to 6.4 percent — the lowest quarterly level since the 2008 global crisis — from the previous quarter's 6.5 percent.\n\nthe government is expected to implement more fiscal and monetary stimulus measures to support economic growth, yanjun lin of ihs markit said in a report.\n\ngrowth in investment, retail spending and factory activity all declined, though analysts pointed to a flicker of improvement in manufacturing in december. it grew by 5.7 percent over a year earlier, up 0.3 percentage points from november.\n\nproduction of plastics, metals and specialized industrial machinery accelerated, suggesting warming expectations for a pick-up in investment, chaoping zhu of j.p. morgan asset management said in a report.\n\ntrade war taking a toll\n\nthe trade dispute with the u.s. is proving costly. exports held up through most of 2018 despite president donald trump's tariff hikes on chinese imports in a fight over beijing's technology ambitions. but they contracted in december as the penalties began to depress u.s. demand.\n\nthe two sides have imposed tariff hikes of up to 25 percent on tens of billions of dollars of each other's goods in the fight over u.s. complaints that beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology. washington wants china to roll back plans for state-led industry development that its trading partners say violate its market-opening obligations.\n\nthe trade dispute, and reports of job losses and tumbling sales of autos and real estate, have unnerved chinese consumers that beijing is counting on to drive growth. as pocketbooks snap shut, the downturn could worsen.\n\nchina's top trade envoy, vice premier liu he, is due to visit washington for talks jan. 30-31.\n\nbusiness groups and economists said a decision by liu and his american counterpart, robert lighthizer, to get directly involved would suggest earlier talks by lower-level officials made progress.\n\ntrump said saturday that trade relations with china were going very well and a deal could very well happen.\n\nbeijing hits the gas\n\nforecasters expect chinese growth to bottom out this year as beijing's stimulus efforts gain traction. however, they have pushed back the time frame for that due to weakening exports.\n\npublic works spending is shaping up to be the engine for 2019, iris pang of ing said in a report. however, non-infrastructure business activities will be dismal this year. and debt will grow.\n\na meeting of communist party leaders in december promised tax cuts, better access to bank lending for entrepreneurs and other steps to help the private sector.\n\nchinese leaders have been warning that any recovery would be l-shaped, meaning that companies and investors shouldn't expect growth to rebound to the previous decade's double-digit levels.\n\nforecasters expect growth to decline further this year to 6.3 percent or lower.\n\nchina's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilizes in the second half of the year on the back of expanded policy stimulus, julian evans-pritchard of capital economics said in a report.
pope francis celebrates the solemnity of the epiphany in st. peter's basilica on january 6, 2021 in vatican city. vatican/getty\n\nrome — in the united states and in much of the western world, it's customary for women to read the gospel, serve at the altar or distribute communion during catholic mass. on monday, pope francis changed vatican law to institutionalize this practice — up until now authorized at the discretion of the local bishop — throughout the catholic church.\n\nby explicitly allowing women to serve as lecters and acolyte during liturgical celebrations, the pope has essentially eliminated an individual bishop's power to block the participation of women at the altar. francis stressed, however, that these ministries were essentially distinct from the holy orders of deacon and priest.\n\nwith his monday apostolic document, called a motu proprio, francis changed a 1972 canon law written by pope paul vi that decreed the ministries of lectern and acolyte could only be held by men, because they were considered preparatory to admission to the priesthood.\n\nfrancis underscored that the development in no way opens a door to allow women to be ordained as priests.\n\nthe church does not have the faculty in any way to confer priestly ordination on women, he said in a letter explaining the motu proprio. for non-ordained ministries it is possible, and today appears opportune, to go beyond that reservation.\n\nthis decision ensures that women have a real and effective impact on the organization, in the most important decisions, and in the leadership of communities but without ceasing to do so in the style of their feminine imprint, the pope said.\n\nthe pope said he made the changes after receiving recommendations in 2019 during a meeting of bishops from the amazonian region. they urged the pontiff to allow greater participation by lay women to help tackle the problem of a shortage of priests.\n\ni am going to take up the challenge … that you have put forward, that women be heard, francis said to the gathered bishops at the close of the meeting.\n\nthe bishops also asked francis to consider allowing married men to be priests, but he declined to make that change early in 2020.
nasa, noaa and berkeley earth all released their assessments of earth's temperature in 2020 on thursday. the conclusion: 2020 was nearly tied with 2016 for the warmest year globally on record.\n\nnoaa's data shows global temperatures were just 0.04 of a degree fahrenheit below the record high set in 2016 — making it officially the second warmest ever, but so close that it's effectively tied, according to scientists from berkeley earth.\n\nheadlines like this have become commonplace every january when the major climate monitoring agencies tally the numbers for the year before. because of human-caused climate change, the last six years have been the warmest six years in the record books, which date back into the 1800s.\n\nglobal temperature departures from average in 2020 berkeley earth\n\nnoaa concludes the united states had its fifth warmest year on record, with all five of the warmest years occurring since 2012. this warmth was boosted by severe heat waves across the southwest last summer, with much of the southwestern quarter of the nation experiencing its hottest year on record.\n\nthe u.s. climate extremes index (uscei) for 2020 was 80% above average and ranked as seventh highest in the 111-year record due to extreme heat, drought and hurricane activity.\n\naccording to berkeley earth, global mean temperature in 2020 — which includes both surface air and ocean temperatures — is estimated to have been 1.27 °c (2.29 °f) above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average. pre-industrial is the time before greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels started to impact the climate. that means the planet is only a quarter of a degree away from surpassing the paris agreement goal of staying below 1.5 °c of warming.\n\nusing extrapolation, dr, robert rohde, the author of the berkeley earth report, estimates that at the current rate we will surpass 1.5 °c of warming in just 15 years and exceed 2 °c of warming by 2065. but that pace can be slowed to some degree depending on how fast we reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nprojection of when the globe will reach temperature thresholds laid out by the paris agreement berkeley earth\n\nsince the mid 1800s levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have jumped from 280 parts per million to 415 parts per million. they are now higher than any time in the last 3 million years, if not longer. in the carbon skyscraper chart below by dr. scott kulp from climate central, you can see just how abrupt the change in carbon dioxide has been in the past century compared to the previous 800,000 years.\n\ncarbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere over the past 800,000 years. the spike at the end is mainly the last 100 years, when humans have increased atmospheric concentrations by 50%. climate central\n\nas a result, earth's temperature is changing at a rate 100 times faster than what happened in the last ice age.\n\nscientists from nasa and noaa held a briefing thursday afternoon to discuss the latest findings about earth's escalating fever.\n\nbecause each agency uses slightly different data and different methods to analyze that data, the assessments differ slightly, but all fall within a few hundredths of a degree of each other.\n\nnasa's gis dataset shows 2020 as the warmest year, but only by a minuscule margin, whereas the noaa and berkeley earth data show 2020 a hair behind 2016 for the warmest year globally on record. just last week the european climate agency copernicus showed 2020 tied with 2016.\n\ncomparison of various datasets on global temperatures berkeley earth\n\nalthough we have come to expect each new year to be one of the warmest on record, 2020 should not have been able to reach such heights. that's because this fall a la niña event developed, which cooled the overall global surface temperature by two-tenths of a degree, according to berkeley earth.\n\nla niña and el niño are semi-annual natural oscillations in the tropical pacific ocean. la niña is characterized by cool surface waters in the eastern tropical pacific, while el niño is the opposite, characterized by warmer than normal surface waters. because they cover a vast area in a very heat-rich part of the world, they have the ability to affect global temperatures.\n\nin 2016 there was a super el niño — one of the strongest on record. the event released vast amounts of heat which easily propelled 2016 to the warmest year globally on record. this year, despite the cool la niña event in the pacific, 2020 still managed to tie 2016. without the la niña cooling, 2020 would have been solidly in the no. 1 position. this illustrates just how powerful human-caused warming has become.\n\nif you take the oceans out of the equation, on land 2020 was far and away the warmest year on record, having warmed almost 2 °c above pre-industrial levels. this warming dries out vegetation and soil, expands deserts and inflames wildfires like those that tore through the western u.s. in recent months.\n\nland and ocean temperatures departure from average berkeley earth\n\n2020's global temperature was especially enhanced by astonishing warmth in the arctic and russia. because of arctic amplification, a phenomenon where decreased ice and snow leads to a warming feedback, the arctic is warming at three times the pace of the global average.\n\nin siberia, temperatures were off the charts in 2020, finishing the year a remarkable 5 °c (9 °f) above normal. the graph below shows just how abnormal the heat in siberia was in 2020.\n\nsiberia temperature departure from average berkeley earth\n\nthe warmth wasn't just confined to siberia. rohde from berkeley earth says 87% of the earth was significantly above normal in 2020 and 10% saw record average annual warmth. no region experienced a record cold annual average.\n\ntemperature rankings berkeley earth\n\nwhile earth's surface temperature is at the mercy of fluctuations on natural climate cycles, which is why temperatures go up and down year to year, the ocean is a lot more stable. as a result the oceans have been warming at a more steady rate.\n\nin a separate report released on wednesday, 20 scientists from 13 institutions from around the world reported that 2020 had the highest upper ocean temperatures on record. the study focused on the upper 2,000 meters of the world's oceans. the oceans act like a bank account accumulating interest — more than 90% of excess heat from climate change is stored in the oceans.\n\nall in all, the various reports lead to the same conclusion: earth's temperature continues to march upwards due to continued greenhouse gas emissions. the good news, scientists say, is that if society chooses to reduce emissions to near zero in the coming decades, the global warming trend could be stopped rather quickly, lessening the most severe impacts of climate change.
a 48 hours investigation has uncovered new details in a former priest's 57-year journey from murder to justice. father john feit was shielded by church officials from prosecution in the 1960 murder of a former texas beauty queen, and allowed to rise to a position of authority overseeing troubled priests, according to dozens of interviews and hundreds of pages of public records and documents obtained by 48 hours.\n\nby 48 hours producer josh gaynor, with additional reporting by producer lourdes aguiar and field producer alicia tejada\n\non a late thursday afternoon on feb. 9, 2016, 83-year-old former catholic priest john bernard feit was escorted into a holding room at the maricopa county sheriff's office in phoenix.\n\njoining him were two out-of-state investigators, rolando villarreal with the texas rangers and frank trevino with the mcallen, texas, police department.\n\nafter reading feit his miranda rights, investigator trevino presented him with an arrest warrant for a murder in hidalgo county, texas.\n\ni've been questioned extensively about this dating back to 1960, feit said, according to a transcript of the interview read in court. so i'm disappointed but not surprised.\n\nit was the beginning of the end of a cold case that hung like a cloud over the rio grande valley in south texas for nearly 60 years.\n\nless than two years after that february 2016 day, feit was in an edinburg, texas, courtroom convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 1960 murder of a 25-year-old school teacher and former beauty queen named irene garza.\n\nprosecutors say the case, profiled in the 48 hours broadcast sins of the father, was not one of just murder.\n\nassistant district attorney mike garza -- no relation to the victim irene garza -- said during trial that a deal was struck following the murder between local law enforcement at the time and officials with the catholic church to protect john feit from prosecution and allow the church hierarchy to discipline the priest under its own terms.\n\njohn feit corbis/cbs news\n\nthe institution who is in the business of seeking salvation for others was complicit in covering up this murder, garza said in court.\n\nso what happened to father john feit in the nearly six decades between the murder and his conviction for the crime?\n\na 48 hours investigation tracked feit's path from that april day in 1960 when irene garza was found floating in a texas canal, to the february afternoon nearly 56 years later when feit was presented with a warrant for his arrest.\n\nfeit, convicted for attacking one young woman and suspected of killing another was shuttled across the country, shielded from justice, and allowed to rise to a position of authority, overseeing troubled priests who were released to the general public, including one of the worst sexual offenders in the modern history of the catholic church.\n\nthis account is based on dozens of interviews and hundreds of pages of public records and documents obtained by 48 hours.\n\nthe letter\n\non the evening of april 16, 1960, john feit, a young visiting priest from chicago, took irene garza's confession at the rectory of the sacred heart church in mcallen, texas.\n\nit was a busy holy saturday ahead of easter.\n\ngarza was never seen alive again.\n\nfather feit was immediately a person of interest.\n\nat that time he was also the primary suspect in another case.\n\na 20-year-old woman, maria america guerra, was violently attacked from behind in a neighboring church just weeks earlier.\n\nirene garza lynda de la viña\n\nshe would soon identify father feit as the perpetrator.\n\nthe heat on feit was intense, and it appears officials with the church felt it was time to get him out of texas.\n\nin the lead-up to his 2017 trial for the murder of irene garza, prosecutors subpoenaed records from feit's former religious order, the missionary oblates of mary immaculate (o.m.i.).\n\nincluded in that file was a typed letter from father j.f. pawlicki to the head of the southern region of the o.m.i.'s, father lawrence j. seidel.\n\nit was dated aug. 1, 1960, just over three months after irene's body was found.\n\nin the letter, never mentioning feit by name, father pawlicki wrote of advice he received from the sheriff. the letter states, in part:\n\nthe prosecution must be made to see just how weak their case is, lest they go off half-cocked, and set the wheels into motion that would bring this out in public print, and give the opponents of the church a field day. …after three or four months, or even less if possible, have this young man transferred to another part of the country, as a normal obedience. he feels that everyone knows that priests are always being transferred around so this would not be strange. after some time in his new place, a year or two, then have him sent out to a foreign mission. the reason for the first move is to get him out of the area of suspicion. if something happens, the officers of the area will always be suspicious of him. the sheriff conlcudes (sic) that the longer time we have, the weaker the case gets…he has much experience in such things and i believe this is extremely wise. he also is a catholic, and he also stands to lose materially by such a scandal here, in such a non catholic area.\n\nfeit's defense attorney rene flores believes the letter does not imply any guilt on the part of his client.\n\nthe letter was clear that law enforcement, at the time -- did not believe they had a strong case, he said in an interview with 48 hours correspondent richard schlesinger. i think the letter was also clear-- in showing that the church had every intention of fighting the charges.\n\nthomas doyle has a different interpretation. in my experience in the thousands of documents i've studied, it's the first time i've seen any organized plan of obfuscation, collusion, and cover-up played out step by step in coordination with the civilian law enforcement.\n\nordained as a catholic priest in 1970, doyle has served as an expert witness in clergy abuse cases around the world, including for the prosecution in feit's case.\n\nduring feit's trial, doyle testified: if it became known that this priest had murdered someone, it would be bad publicity for the church. where in fact the true scandal, in my professional estimation, is engineering the cover-up, or not allowing or permitting or insisting that this man follow the course of justice. that's the scandal.\n\nthe letter, doyle said in an interview with 48 hours, is also notable for what it's missing: there's no mention of irene garza, her family, in this letter or any documentation i saw. all they were concerned about was covering it up.\n\nregardless of which interpretation is to be believed, feit was soon on the move and out of texas.\n\nthe transfers\n\nto understand the meaning behind feit's subsequent movements through the church, it's important to understand how the catholic church bureaucracy works.\n\nwhen a priest gets into trouble then the moving begins, said terry mckiernan, the founder of bishop accountability, an archive and research organization specializing in monitoring abuse within the catholic church. some people call it the 'geographic solution,' it was for many years the standard way for abuse allegations to be handled.\n\nas a priest, you don't just show up somewhere, said patrick j. wall, a former priest and victim advocate. the only way to survive as a young priest or monk is to follow up with what your directions are.\n\nthe catholic church, renowned for its meticulous record keeping, would have a paper trail for every step of the way.\n\nmaria america guerra corbis\n\nthe catholic church is a highly organized, regularized institution, mckiernan said. every time a priest is moved there is not only a letter informing of his reassignment, but usually a letter responding back acknowledging he received that letter.\n\non aug. 6, 1960, less than a week after the letter from father pawlicki was written, investigators in texas issued a warrant for feit's arrest in connection with the attack of maria america guerra.\n\nbut they had one problem -- they couldn't find him.\n\nfeit surrendered a week later.\n\nat the time, he said in a statement, i am innocent of the charge for which i have been indicted … i am not a fugitive, nor have i been a fugitive. i am hiding from nobody … because i have nothing to hide.\n\nfeit said he simply checked into an out-of-state hospital because his nervous system was affected by the stress surrounding his legal troubles. i wanted to try and get some rest and peace of mind. i felt that i could not take anymore.\n\nfeit would later tell police he also developed a fear of women around that time.\n\nchurch records show father john feit spent approximately two weeks in a church-run medical center in st. louis in august 1960 called the alexian brothers hospital & dispensary.\n\nin that era, from the '60s and even before that into the '70s and '80s, when bishops had bad actors among the priests, including sexual abuse, they would send priests to specialized healthcare facilities, said thomas doyle, in this case alexian brothers. they took in priests and promised anonymity.\n\napparently, the hospital stay did not cure his troubles.\n\nthere was soon a request by the church to send feit back to alexian brothers once again.\n\nin a sept. 15, 1960 letter, an o.m.i. official, the very rev. john a. hakey, wrote, we are sincerely grateful for your past gracious handling of our good fr. feit, and we assure you that taking him in on the same conditions as previously will in no way jeopardize the good name of your institution or bring it any detrimental publicity.\n\none year later, father feit was back in a texas courtroom to stand trial for the assault and attempted rape of maria america guerra.\n\nthe trial would end in a hung jury.\n\nthe alexian brothers health system did not respond to a 48 hours request for comment.\n\nthe monasteries\n\nin early february 1962, five months after the maria america guerra trial and less than two years after irene garza's murder, father john feit was dispatched to wintery dubuque, iowa, and the new melleray abbey, a monastery for trappist monks.\n\nin a feb. 8, 1962 letter from feit to father seidel, his provincial superior with the o.m.i.'s, he wrote, i am happy to be here, and know in my heart that the atmosphere of peace and quiet will be most conducive to both spititual (sic) growth and rest.\n\nat new melleray, peace and quiet would be in ample supply. the life of a trappist monk is one of simplicity, devotion, and discipline.\n\nmostly isolated, the monks at new melleray wake long before dawn, eat twice a day, and spend little time speaking.\n\na perfect place to hide, thomas doyle said, with little chance for gossip to spread.\n\nhe would be there, have no access to the outside world, doyle said. they're like maximum security monasteries, and it was not uncommon if a priest was going to be punished they'd send them there.\n\nthe other monks would likely have no idea what past issues feit may have brought with him.\n\nin march 1962, a month after his arrival at new melleray, feit made a trip back to hidalgo county, texas, and the same courtroom where decades later he would be convicted for the murder or irene garza.\n\nthe 1961 trial for the attack on maria america guerra ended in a hung jury. now, prosecutors offered feit a deal.\n\non march 28 1962, dressed in his black priest habit, feit pleaded nolo contendere to a reduced charge of aggravated assault.\n\nthe punishment? a $500 fine.\n\nfeit's defense team at the time stressed that deal, in essence a no contest plea, was not an admission of guilt.\n\nbut the plea is considered a conviction.\n\ndarrell davis was a young tv reporter at the time covering the maria america guerra case for local channel five news.\n\ndavis says he, along with some other journalists, was called to an off-the-record meeting with then district attorney robert lattimore.\n\naccording to davis' testimony in court, lattimore said prosecutors and church officials knew father feit killed irene garza, but in exchange for a plea in the maria america guerra case, he would not be prosecuted for irene's murder.\n\nhe said verbatim, 'we know that father feit killed irene garza and the church knows that he killed irene garza so we have made some arrangements,' davis said in an interview with 48 hours. he said the church is going to put him in a monastery…and he will be kept there for the rest of his life.\n\nafter the plea, john feit returned to the monastery in iowa.\n\nthe rev. stephen verbest, the vocation director at new melleray, has been at the monastery for more than 60 years. he told 48 hours he had no memory of feit being there or records reflecting his stay.\n\nverbest said visiting priests around that time with troubles like alcoholism would sometimes stay for extended periods at the monastery guesthouse where, he said, no records would be kept.\n\nit's unclear exactly how long feit remained at new melleray, but his writings suggest he was still in iowa in june of 1962, four months after his arrival.\n\nfather mark a. scott, the current abbot at new melleray, said in an interview with 48 hours a stay that long for a visiting priest would be out of the ordinary. usually guests stayed for a week, he said. as for the assertion that troubled priests during that time would be placed at monasteries like new melleray to avoid prosecution, scott said i can't speak to that. that was before my era.\n\nin a letter typed on new melleray letterhead on june 19, 1962, feit reflected on that tumultuous period in his life: the time has come to make some definite decisions, enabling me to begin a regular and ordered life, with definite goals and a definite aim in life.\n\nby the beginning of 1963, the church moved father feit again, this time to another trappist monastery, the assumption abbey in ava, missouri.\n\nthe key element between new melleray and assumption is there's no school attached, so no minors, wall said. the second most important element about trappist monasteries, its geographic isolation, especially at that time.\n\nit was at assumption where feit would meet dale tacheny, the man who decades later would play a definitive role in his conviction for the murder of irene garza.\n\ntacheny was a young monk serving as novice master at the monastery, training new prospective monks.\n\ntacheny says his superior at assumption told him to counsel feit, he said that father feit had murdered a young woman, there were no other details given, according to a transcript of a 2002 interview with police.\n\ntacheny says he counseled feit for more than six months.\n\nduring that time he says feit admitted to attacking a young woman following her confession, keeping her captive overnight, and leaving her to suffocate. feit, he said, told him the woman was eventually dumped in a canal. tacheny says he never pushed to get the young woman's name.\n\nhe says feit also spoke of a proclivity for wanting to attack women from behind, triggered by the sound of their high heels clicking on solid ground.\n\ntacheny would not share his story with police for almost 40 years.\n\nwhile i knew that father feit had committed the murder, tacheny said in the 2002 police interview, i felt that my primary function with father feit was to see if perhaps, he ultimately might not have a vocation to become a monk in the monastery.\n\na representative for assumption abbey had no comment.\n\ntacheny says he finally came forward in 2002 in part to help bring closure to irene garza's family.\n\nbut the local prosecutor in hidalgo county at the time did not think tacheny was a reliable witness.\n\nat feit's trial, his defense attorney, rene flores, painted tacheny as a liar who was fed facts by investigators to try and close the case.\n\nin an interview with 48 hours flores said, to sit and believe that dale tacheny received this information from john at the time and according to his testimony was not moved in one way or another because he, quote, 'was not there to judge,' to believe that and, then, fast-forward 40-some odd years when he came up and says, 'i was moved because i wanted to bring closure to the family,' we got a word for that in texas … bulls---.\n\ntacheny later acknowledged some of the details he presented as fact were actually assumptions based off what he says feit told him.\n\nbut prosecutors didn't think the problems tacheny had with details made him unreliable.\n\ni found him to be truthful, and i saw the different types of evidence that suggested that what he was saying did in fact happen, said prosecutor mike garza. i thought when he looked, would look at a jury in the eye that they would be able to tell he was telling the truth, and i had the backup to corroborate it.\n\nhigher learning\n\nthe monastic life, it turned out, was not suited to father john feit.\n\nby late 1963, tacheny said he and his superior at the assumption abbey determined it was safe for father feit to go back into the world.\n\nfeit, already convicted for assaulting maria america guerra, suspected of murdering irene garza, and allegedly expressing urges to attack young women, was moved again.\n\nthis time to a college campus.\n\nhe was enrolled as a graduate student in philosophy at loyola college, a jesuit school in his hometown of chicago.\n\nit's pretty common, you can't put him back in a parish, so they stuck him in a school, said the former priest patrick j. wall.\n\nfeit attended loyola for only one semester, from september 1963 into january of 1964, according to a spokesperson with the school.\n\nthat semester, a seismic event shook the nation and apparently john feit to his core.\n\non nov. 22, 1963, the country's most famous catholic, president john f. kennedy, was assassinated.\n\nfather john feit left school soon after. he never finished his degree.\n\nroad to heaven\n\nby the end of 1964, more than four years after irene garza's murder, father john feit made what was perhaps his most consequential move since leaving texas.\n\nhe headed west to jemez springs, new mexico, to a facility run by a roman catholic religious order called the servants of the paraclete.\n\nfounded in 1947 by father gerald fitzgerald, it was a monastery for troubled priests.\n\nfather fitzgerald's early visitors came with a variety of issues, from substance abuse to sexual abuse.\n\nsoon after, he was overloaded with priests who had sexual problems, said a.w. richard sipe, a former benedictine monk and priest and an expert in the sexual abuse behavior of priests, little by little it bubbled up that children were involved.\n\nsipe also testified for the prosecution in feit's case.\n\nin a 1965 interview with pulitzer prize-winning reporter sanche de gramont for the saturday evening post, father fitzgerald said of the paracletes, we're shepherding the shepherds, we gather up the fragments. our cure is simple, it's based on the sovereignty of love.\n\npatrick j. wall describes the facility at jemez springs during that time differently. he says it was a place of last resort for some of the church's most troubled priests, sometimes i refer to it as a supermax because there's really nowhere else to go if you want to stay in the church.\n\njohn feit spent seven years at jemez springs and eventually joined the servants of the paraclete.\n\nhe operated out of the main house at the facility called via coeli -- a latin phrase meaning road or way to heaven\n\nby late 1968, feit had risen to a position of superior at via coeli, supervising around that time more than 80 priests.\n\none of those was a young priest from massachusetts named james porter.\n\nporter arrived at jemez springs in 1967 following multiple complaints of abuse of children in massachusetts.\n\nporter was one of the most dangerous and depraved sexually offensive priests ever, said mike reck, an attorney representing more than a dozen of porter's victims and a colleague of patrick j. wall.\n\nconvicted former catholic priest james porter ap photo/keith nordstrom, pool\n\nthe reality that fr. feit, himself a criminal, was placed in a position of power, supervision and direction of other criminal priests is a public safety nightmare, said reck.\n\nfeit says he worked with porter for a year and half, sometimes releasing him on temporary assignments to churches in need of staffing, including to at least four locations around new mexico as well as in texas.\n\nhe has been a very active young priest, feit wrote in an aug. 6, 1969, letter updating porter's home diocese in fall river, mass., of his progress. we receive a large number of requests for supply work during the summer, and i have not hesitated to call upon fr. porter in each of these instances.\n\nfeit also dispatched porter to a paraclete facility in nevis, minnesota, where he worked at a neighboring parish: he is a willing worker, and gets along well with pastors and people wherever he goes. thus far there has been no occurrence of the problem which plagued fr. porter in the past, feit wrote.\n\nby that time the paracletes had mental health professionals working with some of the priests.\n\nfeit would go on to write: i wish that all of these favorable circumstances could give me leave to write porter off as 'cured,' but that is the domain of the professional, not myself.\n\nfeit later claimed he was unaware of porter's abuse of children until porter already was gone from jemez springs.\n\nit's certainly not believable, thomas doyle said, feit was a superior there, as a superior there he was responsible for where porter was going. he would have been responsible for knowing what progress porter made if any.\n\nporter was accused of abusing children on his temporary assignments from via coeli and continued his abuse until his arrest more than 20 years later.\n\nporter would plead guilty to molesting 28 children, once telling a reporter he had abused upwards of a 100.\n\nhis case and subsequent others garnered national headlines.\n\ninvestigations, including those by the spotlight team at the boston globe exposed widespread sexual abuse within the catholic church.\n\nin 1993, porter was sentenced to 18-20 years in a maximum security prison. he died in 2005.\n\nif fr. feit had been a moral and ethical human he could have advised the public of fr. porter's danger, prevented him from being unleashed on an unsuspecting public, or done anything to curtail fr. porter's access to children, mike reck said.\n\nthe extent of the damage inflicted by james porter may never be fully known.\n\nmitchell garabedian, portrayed by actor stanley tucci in the film spotlight, has represented james porter victims in the past.\n\nhe now represents four more individuals who have come forward within the last 18 months with allegations of sexual abuse by porter in massachusetts between 1958 and 1966, a period before porter was sent to the servants of the paraclete facility in jemez springs, new mexico.\n\none of those alleged victims says he was a 15-year-old altar boy when he met porter.\n\nhe says he was sexually abused more than 100 times.\n\nyou're dealing with an entity that is self-governing when it comes to disciplining its' own pedophile priests, garabedian said. if the catholic church was interested in the health, safety and welfare of children they would have dealt with these pedophile priests properly.\n\nthe servants of the paraclete still maintain a facility in new mexico as well as in st. louis, missouri.\n\naccording to their website, they also have locations in vietnam, the philippines, ghana and italy.\n\nwhen contacted by 48 hours, the very rev. david t. fitzgerald, servant general with the servants of the paraclete had no comment.\n\nthe layman\n\nin 1971, more than eleven years after irene garza's murder, father feit requested laicization and dispensation from his obligations as a priest and a member of the servants of the paraclete.\n\nby 1972 he was former priest john bernard feit.\n\nhe married a young woman he met in new mexico and started a family.\n\nhe then proceeded on a path through multiple jobs including as an insurance salesman.\n\nhe moved to several cities in the midwest before settling in the phoenix area in 1979 where his older brother matthias was living and working as a priest.\n\nfor more than 20 years, john feit lived in arizona, raised his family and became a grandfather.\n\nhe found work at the st. vincent de paul catholic food bank.\n\nhe was extraordinarily kind, caring, compassionate, the agency's executive director stephen zabilski told 48 hours in a 2016 interview, he was viewed as really someone who had a genuine love, a great love for those less fortunate, the poor in our community.\n\nit was not until 2002, 42 years after irene garza's murder, that then ex-monk dale tacheny came forward to police with the information he says feit told him so many years earlier.\n\nit took another 14 years, in 2016, before john bernard feit walked into the maricopa county sheriff's office to sit alongside texas ranger villarreal and investigator trevino.\n\nfinal chapter\n\ninside a south texas courtroom on dec. 8, 2017, former priest john bernard feit was sentenced to life in prison for the murder of irene garza.\n\nhe is now an inmate at the texas department of criminal justice prison for men in huntsville, texas.\n\nfeit is eligible for parole in 2028 at the age of 95.\n\nhis defense attorney rene flores is appealing the conviction.\n\nnone of feit's family attended his trial.\n\nhis wife declined to provide comment when contacted by 48 hours.\n\nin a brief telephone interview following john feit's conviction, his 94-year-old brother, father matthias feit said, just picture your brother in jail and you'd know how i feel before hanging up.\n\n48 hours contacted the oblates of mary immaculate seeking response to the allegations of a cover-up, details of father john feit's movement through the church following irene garza's murder, any specific changes made or internal reviews conducted regarding oversight of o.m.i members, or any message to the garza family.\n\nthe rev. thomas coughlin, o.m.i. assistant to the provincial superior, said in a written statement: the oblates of mary immaculate respect the judicial process, with which we have fully cooperated. we continue to pray for irene garza and her family and for john feit and his family.\n\nbeyond prayers, beyond words, it is the structure of the church that must change to keep the troubled history of men like john feit and james porter from repeating itself according to the former monk and priest a.w. richard sipe.\n\nhypocrisy is the greatest religious sin, it can cover up all sorts of things he said, to be religious is to be truthful. any church who cannot be truthful about themselves have nothing to say.
manhattan, kan. -- a mason working on a kansas university building has found an 88-year-old handwritten note that gives a glimpse into the lives of laborers in 1928.\n\nthe manhattan mercury reports that the mason found the note in a tobacco can he encountered in december while restoring and replacing stones at kansas state university's east memorial stadium in manhattan, nearly 60 miles west of topeka.\n\na facebook post from the kansas state historical preservation office says the five authors dated the note feb. 2, 1928, and wrote that they hope the letter is found someday in the future, perhaps after they've died.\n\none of the masons currently working on kansas state university's east memorial stadium found this letter inside an old... posted by kshpo - kansas state historic preservation office on thursday, january 28, 2016\n\naccording to the facebook post, the letter reads: dear folks, will place a not[e] in wall as it may some day be found and perhaps the men that built it will be dead and forgotten. we are having nice weather was 18 above zero this morning. hope when this is opened things will be better for the working man than [now?]. mason got $10 per day and labor $3.20 there will have to be a change soon or the labor will be out of luck. please print this if found signed ck bell, geo h bell, w. sowell, jim kelley, ray [disney?] good luck.\n\nuniversity archivist cliff hight says the document will be sent to a conservator for cleaning and protective covering. hight says there aren't plans to display the document currently.
georgetown, texas - plans for a costume ball to benefit a texas museum featuring a civil war exhibit have drawn criticism and comparisons to a slaver's plantation party.\n\nabout 50 residents signed a petition asking the nonprofit williamson museum to reconsider the theme of the old south ball, the austin american-statesman reported sunday.\n\nthe ball is scheduled saturday, jan. 30, at the williamson county courthouse in georgetown.\n\nwe are not promoting slavery. we are not even promoting war, said mickie ross, museum executive director. we are just telling the story of the people who lived here during the civil war. this is not a tara 'gone with the wind' event; it's a very simple dance.\n\na group called positive change for georgetown sponsored the petition to change the theme.\n\na grand southern ball with uniformed soldiers and ladies in grand antebellum dresses does not in any way accurately reflect the period or time in williamson county, the petition says. back in the 1860s, a party would more likely have been a small dance in day clothes at someone's house. what is being created is a slaver's plantation ball with all the finery and trimmings and glory of the deep south.\n\ntickets for the ball are $25 per person, or $40 per couple.
facebook (fb) ceo mark zuckerberg's 2018 new year's resolution for the ubiquitous social network was to fix it. in a candid admission that his company is falling short in some critical areas, he said: we currently make too many errors enforcing our policies and preventing misuse of our tools.\n\nunfortunately for zuckerberg, even though facebook's fourth-quarter 2017 earnings handily exceeded expectations, investors are focusing more on the potential negative effects of some of the fixes facebook is making.\n\nthe menlo park, california-based company said it earned $4.27 billion in the quarter, giving it a profit of $1.44 per share. adjusted for pretax expenses, earnings came to $2.20 per share. the results surpassed wall street forecasts. the average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by zacks investment research was for earnings of $1.96 per share.\n\nthe social media company posted revenue of $12.97 billion in the period, also exceeding analyst forecasts. twelve analysts surveyed by zacks expected $12.58 billion.\n\nhowever, the report also contained an explicit warning from zuckerberg.\n\nin total, we made changes that reduced time spent on facebook by roughly 50 million hours every day, he said in a statement. by focusing on meaningful connections, our community and business will be stronger over the long term.\n\ninvestors' immediate reaction to that news was to sell. the shares sank around 5 percent, or $9.40, to $177.56 in after-hours trading following wednesday's regular trading close at $186.89.\n\nnot long after zuckerberg's vow for fixing things in 2018 came one of facebook's biggest -- and riskiest – adjustments: changing what goes into users' news feeds. the company decided to give more weight to user-generated content over articles distributed by news sites, brand advertisers and video producers in order to create what the ceo described as a more meaningful experience.\n\nthat move didn't go over well with publishers, which feared losing the traffic they've come to rely on from those news feeds. investors also reacted negatively when this news came barely three weeks ago, knocking the stock price down from $188 to $179 the next day. that followed zuckerberg's initial warning the changes could trim the amount of time users spend on the social network, which would also be likely to trim its revenues.\n\nthe financial impact of the revamped news feed won't be reflected until facebook's next earnings report, for first-quarter 2018. but it won't be the only change that could have some effect in that regard.\n\njust yesterday, facebook announced that it's banning ads for bitcoin, initial coin offerings and others related to cryptocurrencies, whose meteoric rise last year caught many investors and the financial industry by surprise.\n\nhowever, it's more likely that the impact of this change will be felt far more by cryptocurrency-related companies than by facebook.
tampa, fla. -- oscar ray bolin was first found guilty of murdering three women nearly 30 years ago. in the decades since, every one of the verdicts delivered by juries in three separate trials was reversed at least twice by appeals courts, although ultimately he was convicted again in each case: 10 times by 10 juries, to be exact.\n\nit now appears bolin's legal pleas are coming to an end.\n\nunless an appeals court or the u.s. supreme court steps in, bolin, 53, will be executed thursday at 6 p.m. in florida state prison for the 1986 slaying of teri lynn matthews.\n\nfor matthews' family and relatives of the two other victims, it's about time.\n\nit will be in a sense, a closure, said matthews' mother, kathleen reeves. it's been so long. the pain doesn't change. it's just time for it. it's due. it's past due.\n\nbolin's trials received widespread publicity in the tampa bay area - but not just because of the seemingly endless legal processes or the brutal nature of the killings.\n\nwhile on trial, bolin and a woman on his defense team fell in love. rosalie martinez had been a paralegal at the hillsborough public defender's office who was married to a prominent tampa attorney. martinez divorced him and married bolin, on live tv, in 1996 - 10 years after the slayings.\n\nrosalie bolin says her husband is innocent in matthews' killing, and she has become one of the state's most outspoken death penalty opponents since her marriage to oscar ray bolin.\n\npolice said bolin's first florida victim was 25-year-old natalie holley, who was abducted after she left work at a tampa fast food restaurant in january of 1986. in october of that same year, 17-year-old stephanie collins disappeared from a shopping center parking lot in tampa. two months later, matthews was abducted from a post office in pasco county, just north of tampa. all three were fatally stabbed.\n\nthe cases went unsolved until someone called an anonymous tip line in 1990, when bolin was already serving a 22- to 75-year prison sentence in ohio for kidnapping and raping a 20-year-old waitress outside toledo in 1987.\n\nauthorities later discovered it was the new husband of bolin's ex-wife who called in the tip; the ex-wife said bolin had told her about the killings in 1986. during the trial, bolin's younger half brother said he watched bolin beat matthews and try to drown her with a garden hose. the half brother later recanted his story, then reversed his position again.\n\nall of bolin's convictions were reversed at least twice due to legal errors, but new juries found him guilty again in all three cases. he once again received the death penalty in the matthews' and collins' killings, but a new jury in the holley slaying found bolin guilty of second-degree murder, converting his previous death sentence to a sentence of life in prison.\n\nreeves said it doesn't matter that bolin is not awaiting execution in all three cases because he only dies once.\n\nhe dies for all of our girls.\n\nthe mothers of the three victims attended many of the trials together. holley's mother died in 2012.\n\nin motions for a stay of execution filed with a district court and the florida supreme court, bolin contends that an ohio inmate confessed to matthews' murder. the inmate committed suicide in late 2014, however. both courts denied the stay.\n\nbolin's attorney, bjorn brunvand of clearwater, said he filed another motion to stay with the district court and with the 11th circuit court of appeals. the appeals court denied the motion monday. if all appeals are denied, brunvand said he will file a motion to stay with the u.s. supreme court.\n\ni think that he should get a new trial because another individual has confessed to that murder, brunvand said.\n\nbrunvand is also arguing that bolin should get a new trial in the matthews case because the technique of an fbi hair analyst who produced evidence against him was later discredited.\n\nrosalie bolin has declined to speak about her husband's pending execution. but she wrote in an email that the state is about to execute an innocent man based on perjury, police misconduct, tainted fbi evidence ... confessions of other perps ... prosecutorial conduct.\n\nthe victims' families say that they've been put through hell by the endless appeals, and put some of the blame on bolin's wife.\n\nhe'd go on forever, he and rosalie, reeves said.\n\nin an interview with abc's 20/20 in august, bolin said he wished the families were aware of evidence that he said would help exonerate him.\n\nthey hear what the state wants them to hear and what the prosecution wants them to hear, bolin said. but all the other evidence that's been suppressed, i know about it and my attorneys know about it. they don't.\n\nreeves said she's prepared to consider forgiveness, if bolin admits to his guilt in the moments before his execution.\n\nif he even just hinted, or said, 'i'm really sorry,' i think we could think about forgiving him, she said. if he doesn't do that, there is no forgiveness.
baton rouge, la. -- a grand jury has indicted four people on charges in the death of a louisiana state university student whose blood-alcohol content was more than six times the legal limit for driving.\n\nthe state grand jury issued the indictments thursday, six months after 18-year-old maxwell gruver's death. the freshman from roswell, georgia, died at a hospital sept. 14 after phi delta theta members found him lying on a couch at the fraternity house and couldn't tell if he was breathing.\n\nthe jury indicted 20-year-old matthew alexander naquin of boerne, texas, on a charge of felony negligent homicide, and three others -- patrick forde, sean paul gott, and ryan isto-- on a misdemeanor charge of hazing. the felony charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. the misdemeanor is punishable by up to a maximum of 30 days in jail.\n\npolice reports suggest gruver was forced to drink to excess during a game or initiation ritual called bible study on the night before his death. pledges were forced to drink if they incorrectly answered questions about the fraternity, according to arrest warrants filed by the east baton rouge parish sheriff's office.\n\npledges told investigators the main members doing the hazing were naquin, gott and isto, and most people interviewed said naquin was the most aggressive, according to the warrant. one member said naquin was yelling and forcing the pledges to drink diesel by taking pulls.\n\na pledge who was next to gruver during the hazing said gruver was made to take at least 10 to 12 pulls of diesel, the warrant says, while other pledges said they took three to four at most. another pledge told investigators he believed naquin and gott were singling out gruver more than the others because gruver was frequently late for events.\n\na witness told police that gruver was highly intoxicated when fraternity members laid him on the couch and left the house sometime early that morning. the next day, he was dead.\n\na coroner said hospital tests found a highly elevated blood-alcohol level in gruver's body. the cause of death was listed as acute alcohol intoxication with aspiration.\n\nthe death was ruled an accident.\n\nthe fraternity's national office said it closed the chapter after gruver's death. lsu president f. king alexander said in a statement released to cbs affiliate wafb that the university is taking steps to change the culture on campus and is beginning to issue decisions following an internal student code of conduct investigation.\n\nour thoughts continue to be with the gruver family during this difficult time. as i've said previously, the ramifications of hazing are devastating, alexander said. today's decision by the grand jury furthers the fact that behaviors that threaten the safety of our students will not be tolerated. hazing is dangerous and unacceptable.
when matthew deremer posted an inspiring facebook message on new year's eve that anything can happen in just 1 day, he didn't know that day would be his last.\n\nthe 31-year-old iraq war veteran was hit and killed on his motorcycle by an alleged drunk driver hours later in largo, florida, reports cbs affiliate wtsp.\n\nhe basically wrote [his] own obituary, one facebook user commented on deremer's dec. 31 post, which has since gone viral with more than 11,000 shares.\n\nphoto shows marine corps veteran matthew deremer. wtsp-cbs\n\nin the post, deremer writes about the challenges he faced over the year.\n\nthere has been many times where i've been found on my knees in prayer for hours (relentless) and other times leading a group of people in prayer, my faith (that i love to share) is an everyday awakening (to me) that people, lives, and circumstances can change for the better over time, he wrote. i look back at 2015's huge challenges that i've overcome, shared with others, and have once again found myself...\n\ndespite the countless obstacles he was forced to overcome, deremer said he was thankful and to bring on 2016.\n\ni really don't know where i'll end up tonight but i do know where i windup is where i'm meant to be, he finished his paragraph-long message.\n\nwhile the post seems eerie to some, it's bringing comfort to deremer's friends and family -- even strangers.\n\nhis last sentence has me speechless, one facebook user commented. what a beautiful soul.\n\nthe words from this post should be a example for all of us to go by, a man replied.\n\nsteven clarke, 59, arrested on dui-manslaughter charges. pinellas county sheriff's office\n\nthe seminole, florida resident touched a lot of people's lives, his friend wayne gutierrez told wtsp at deremer's memorial service on sunday. sometimes those are the ones that get chosen first.\n\nsteven clarke, the 59-year-old driver allegedly responsible for the crash, was arrested and held in pinellas county jail on dui-manslaughter charges.\n\nclarke's bond was set at $20,000; he was released on bail a day after the arrest, according to court records.
hartville, ohio -- an ohio man who told authorities that his wife died on a trip to elvis presley's graceland and he turned her body over to emergency responders, now says he put her body in the tennessee river after she died of natural causes, police said monday.\n\npolice in hartville, about 20 miles southeast of akron, said 72-year-old philip snider had previously told them that roberta snider was ill and died in a hotel parking lot in memphis in early january and he flagged down an ambulance. he told authorities that he didn't know where they took her body, and he came back to ohio, police said.\n\nroberta snider wkyc-tv\n\ncbs affiliate wkyc-tv writes that snider wrapped his wife's body in garbage bags and threw her into the river off of u.s. 40 in beonton county. hartville police chief larry dordea told a local newspaper that roberta died of natural causes and philip wanted to put her back with nature.\n\ndordea said the man's story began to change after authorities could not find any evidence that roberta snider had checked into any hotels on the trip. authorities have said that philip snider did check into a hotel in the graceland area in early january.\n\nauthorities in benton county, tennessee, are helping in the search for the missing 70-year-old woman, according to dordea.\n\nwkyc-tv reports that snider submitted to an fbi polygraph test. the results are still pending.\n\nno charges have been filed at this point.\n\na recording at a phone number for snider said the number was no longer in service.\n\na message seeking additional comment from dordea was left at the police department monday night.
new york - with new options and conveniences, there's never been a better time for shoppers. as for workers ... well, not always.\n\nthe retail industry is being radically reshaped by technology, and nobody feels that disruption more starkly than 16 million american shelf stockers, salespeople, cashiers and others. the shifts are driven, like much in retail, by the amazon (amzn) effect -- the explosion of online shopping and the related changes in consumer behavior and preferences.\n\nas mundane tasks like checkout and inventory are automated, employees are trying to deliver the kind of customer service the internet can't match.\n\nso a best buy (bby) employee who used to sell electronics in the store is dispatched to customers' homes to help them choose just the right products. a walmart (wmt) worker dashes in and out of the grocery aisles, hand-picks products for online shoppers and brings them to people's cars.\n\nyet even as responsibilities change -- and in many cases, expand -- the average growth in pay for retail workers isn't keeping pace with the rest of the economy. some companies say in the long run the transformation could mean fewer retail workers, though they may be better paid. but while some workers feel more satisfied, others find their jobs are just a lot less fun.\n\nbloomingdale's (m) saleswoman brenda moses remembers the pre-internet era, when the upscale store was regularly filled with customers ready to buy. these days, department stores are less crowded, and the customers who do come in can make price comparisons on their phones at the same time as they pepper staff with questions.\n\nyou tell them everything, and then they look at you and say, 'you know what? i think i will get it online,' she said.\n\nmoses has seen her commission rate rise to 6 percent from a half a percent, but her hourly wage dropped from $19 as low as $10 before it came back up to $14. depending more on commissions means her income fluctuates, and she's competing with her colleagues for each sale.\n\nnow, moses said, you have to fight to make your money.\n\nthe same could be said for the retailing industry, overall. in 2017, 66,500 u.s. retail jobs disappeared (not taking into account jobs added in areas like distribution and call centers). in the past decade, about one out of every seven jobs have vanished in the hardest-hit sectors like clothing and consumer electronics, says frank badillo, director of research at macrosavvy. though department stores have suffered the most, smaller businesses also have struggled to compete with online sellers.\n\nmany of the survivors are rushing to adapt. of the retail jobs that remain, over the next decade as many as 60 percent will either be new kinds of roles or will involve revised duties, says craig rowley, senior client partner at korn ferry hay group, a human resources advisory firm. he estimates the number is about 10 percent now.\n\nhow fast retail jobs will change and what they'll look like depends on three factors, rowley said: the pace at which online shopping advances; the speed at which robotics and other technology progress; and shifts in the minimum hourly pay.\n\njobs for workers will get more interesting and be more impactful on the company's business, rowley said. but the negative side is that there will be fewer entry-level jobs, and there will be more pressure to perform.\n\nsome retail workers at the vanguard of the changes -- like laila ummelaila, a personal grocery shopper at a walmart in old bridge, new jersey -- speak glowingly of their new responsibilities.\n\nwalmart, the nation's largest private employer, has scrutinized every job in its stores as it looks to leverage its more than 4,000 u.s. locations against amazon's internet dominance.\n\nthe company now has 18,000 personal shoppers who fill online orders from store shelves, and 17,000 check-out hosts whose responsibilities are more extensive than the greeters of old, including keeping the area clean and making sure registers move efficiently.\n\nthe company has also shifted workers from back-room clerical jobs and eliminated some overnight stocker positions in favor of more daytime sales help. the customers like the changes, company officials say, pointing to more than three years of sales growth at its established u.s. stores -- a contrast with other, suffering retailers.\n\nummelaila became a personal shopper after joining the company three years ago. to meet her store's goals, she must pick one item per 30 seconds. if she can't find something, she has to quickly get a substitute that's as good or better.\n\nyou start to get to know the customers, you know what they like, she said, how they like their meat ... and how long they keep milk in the fridge.\n\nbest buy has begun a free service in key markets using salespeople to sit with customers in their own homes and make recommendations on setting up a home office to designing a home theater system. best buy said shoppers spend more with a home visit than they do at the stores. the project follows amazon, which reportedly has been testing a program that sends employees to shoppers' houses for free smart home recommendations.\n\nat steve frederick's townhouse in chicago, billy schuler offered advice about speakers that can be adjusted from a smartphone. schuler, who had previously worked at best buy for 14 years, returned to the company to take on the new role.\n\ncustomers are more relaxed when they're in their home, he said. we can do a walkthrough of the house and see their needs. he likes to break the ice by calling the person and chatting a day or two before the visit.\n\nfrederick, who's spending close to $20,000 on the equipment, describes himself as old-school and said he needed a lot of help. he thinks it was worthwhile.\n\nwhen you're spending that kind of money, you want to have someone come in and explain it, he said.\n\nschuler declined to give specifics but says he is well compensated. ummelaila says her pay went up to nearly $12 per hour from $10 when she became a personal shopper.\n\ntarget (tgt) credits its strategy of assigning dedicated sales staff in areas such as clothing, consumer electronics and beauty for helping increase sales, and said having visual merchandisers create vignettes like shoppers would see in specialty stores inspires people to buy. you're making an outfit and telling a story on each rack, said crystal lawrence, who works at a target store in brooklyn, new york. she likes the variety in her new job, and target said it plans to keep paying higher wages for those specialized roles.\n\nbut a survey of nearly 300 retail workers -- conducted by the center for frontline retail and community development project at the urban justice center -- found that of those workers whose job responsibilities have changed, more than 40 percent said they hadn't received pay increases to reflect that.\n\nwages for hourly retail workers have risen less than 9 percent since 1990, compared with 18 percent for overall workers in the private sector. they've made some progress recently, with some of the biggest retailers, like walmart and target moving to increase pay in the face of low unemployment and competition for workers.\n\nfor a long period, these retail jobs were just terrible on average, said michael mandel, chief economic strategist at the progressive policy institute. retail stores have been following one strategy: high turnover, low wages. that strategy is no longer viable.\n\nmandel sees hope in technology, which he said has historically created more and better-paying jobs than it has eliminated.\n\nthe national retail federation trade group points to government data showing that even in large supermarket chains where self-checkout has become standard, the number of employees per store has held steady over the 15 years through 2014. and the demand for grocery cashiers increased in the past few years, said burning glass technologies, a company that analyzes labor market data.\n\nmcdonald's (mcd) said the self-serve kiosks it has been rolling out won't result in mass layoffs, but it will mean some cashiers shift roles to accommodate changes like offering table service.\n\nhowever, a report prepared by cornerstone capital group for the investor responsibility research center institute predicted that more than 7.5 million retail jobs are at risk of being eliminated by automation over the next several years.\n\namazon is testing a grocery store in seattle without cashiers, using cameras and shelf sensors to keep track of the items that shoppers grab and charge them. eatsa, an automat-style restaurant in san francisco, lacks cashiers as well -- diners order at kiosks, and workers prepare the food behind an opaque wall, with virtually no interaction between them.\n\na labor group representing 1.3 million grocery and food workers is trying to combat automation by highlighting that workers' specialized skills -- like the care they take in icing a rose on a wedding cake, or arranging flowers, or the ability of human workers to recognize spoiled food -- provide a benefit to shoppers.\n\nseparating progress for the consumer, for the worker, for the economy versus the stockholders ... those are completely different things, said erikka knuti, a spokeswoman for the united food and commercial workers international union.\n\nothers said automation and happy workers are not necessarily incompatible.\n\nwalmart ceo doug mcmillon foresees fewer sales associates at his stores, but they'll be better paid and better trained. walmart has trained 225,000 supervisors and managers on topics like new apps and better customer service. it said managers who go through the academies have better retention rates than those who do not. workers who report to those managers stay longer. and entry-level workers who complete a new training program are more likely to remain.\n\nit's a shift retailers may have to speed up. government figures show the rate of retail workers quitting their jobs in 2016 was at its highest since 2007.\n\nalfredo duran, who started as a sales associate at gap (gps) and worked at six retailers over 15 years, left the industry two years ago. as a manager at clothing chain mango, he was making $75,000 a year. but once the store closed, he had trouble finding another job in retail because no one wanted to pay him for his experience.\n\nit has gone down. one person is doing three jobs. and you can't move up, said duran, 38, of queens, new york.\n\nhe's now a concierge at a manhattan hotel, making half of what he used to earn -- but happy he left retail.
los angeles — the star of abc's the bachelor knows he's catching a lot of flack, but he says he's willing to take the heat for dumping becca kufrin to find true love with runner-up lauren burnham. race car driver arie luyendyk jr. knows that he has to prove himself to burnham after rejecting her once.\n\nwould i do it all again and face this scrutiny to be with her? absolutely, luyendyk said wednesday during a teleconference with reporters.\n\nhis decision to break up with kufrin during monday's season finale after he'd proposed drew headlines including the words horror, ″brutal and gut-wrenching.\n\nluyendyk defended the spectacle of ending their engagement on network tv.\n\ni wanted everyone to know that the breakup was on me and that i made a mistake, he said, adding that the relationship started on camera and it was appropriate to end it there.\n\nhe speculated his ex might even be thankful for it.\n\nalthough she handled it graciously for the show, kufrin unloaded afterward about having her romantic dreams publicly crushed.\n\nit was like a slap in the face, she told people magazine. but she defended luyendyk, sort of, saying she didn't think he threw her over for burnham to maliciously to break my heart.\n\nshe got a boost from billboards reportedly put up by fans in her native state: becca, you'll always have a rose from minnesota, one digital message proclaimed. rep. drew christensen of minnesota even authored a bill proposing to ban luyendyk from the state.\n\nkufrin, whose consolation prize is starring in the next season of the bachelorette, was to have joined in the abc conference call but dropped out for scheduling reasons, the network said.\n\nthat left burnham to defend her man, who'd proposed to her on tuesday's the bachelor: after the final rose after reaching out to her behind the scenes while engaged to kufrin.\n\nburnham called luyendyk her soulmate but admitted some hesitancy in accepting his change of heart.\n\nit did take some reassurance, but the fact he was willing to take that risk meant a lot to me, she said. she's moving from texas to arizona to be with luyendyk as they plan their wedding.\n\nshe said she feels for kufrin and is eager to see her as the next bachelorette.\n\nluyendyk said he stands by the outcome and his happiness.\n\ni could have done things in a different way, for sure. but ultimately i needed to do what was best for me.
kansas city, mo. -- police in kansas city, mo. say they're searching for a 20-year-old college student who vanished after she was pulled over around 4 a.m. monday.\n\ntoni anderson had just left her job as a server at chrome, a kansas city strip club, and was heading to meet friends when a north kansas city officer pulled her over for an improper lane change, reports the kansas city star. anderson reportedly told the officer she was almost out of gas. the officer gave anderson a warning and watched as she drove to a nearby gas station, a north kansas city police spokesman told the paper.\n\nduring the traffic stop, she texted a friend that she was getting pulled over again. the friend, roxy townsend,told the wichita eagle anderson frequently gets pulled over.\n\nanderson never showed up to meet her friends after work, and she was reported missing. investigators are reportedly using license plate readers and video surveillance and tracking her cellphone in an effort to locate her.\n\nfamily tells cbs affiliate kctv anderson attends the university of missouri-kansas city and is studying interpersonal communications.\n\nwe are desperately trying to find out exactly what happened, kansas city police spokeswoman sgt. kari thompson told the station.\n\nshe urged anyone with information to come forward.
when the mercury's rising in your thermometer, it may also be rising in the ocean.\n\naccording to a new study published feb. 5 in the journal geophysical research letters, there may be more than 15 million gallons (58 million liters) of mercury buried in the permafrost of the northern hemisphere — roughly twice as much mercury as can be found in the rest of earth's soils, ocean and atmosphere combined. and if global temperatures continue to rise, all that mercury could come pouring out.\n\nin geology, permafrost is defined as any soil that has been frozen for more than two years. in the northern hemisphere, permafrost accounts for about 8.8 million square miles (22.79 million square kilometers) of land — or roughly 24 percent of exposed earth, according to the national snow and ice data center. over time, naturally occurring compounds in the atmosphere, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, can bind with organic material in the soil and be frozen into permafrost, potentially remaining trapped underground for thousands of years before it thaws, the new paper said. [5 deadly diseases emerging from global warming]\n\nin the study, researchers drilled 13 permafrost soil cores from various sites in alaska between 2004 and 2012. then, they measured the total amounts of mercury and carbon in each sample, which proved consistent with thousands of other soil cores taken from other sites around the world, the paper said. using the mercury contents of their 13 cores as a springboard, the researchers estimated the total amount of mercury sealed away below north american permafrost to be roughly 793 gigagrams — or more than 15 million gallons.\n\nthere would be no environmental problem if everything remained frozen, but we know the earth is getting warmer, study author paul schuster, a hydrologist at the u.s. geological survey in boulder, colorado, said in a statement. this discovery is a game-changer.\n\nresearchers have already observed climate-change-induced permafrost thawing, and there is likely more on the way: according to a 2013 study, the northern hemisphere will lose anywhere from 30 to 99 percent of its permafrost by 2100, assuming current human greenhouse-gas emissions continue unabated.\n\nprevious studies have attempted to account for the billions of tons of carbon dioxide, methane and even zombie pathogens that could be loosed into the air and the oceans by melting permafrost. the environmental impact of a large-scale mercury leak, however, remains an unpredictable problem.\n\none major concern is that this trapped mercury could seep into nearby waterways and transform into methylmercury, a toxin that can cause motor impairment and birth defects in animals, edda mutter, science director for the yukon river inter-tribal watershed council, said in a statement. such contamination could travel swiftly up the food chain from microorganisms to humans, said mutter, who was not involved in the new study.\n\nrural communities in alaska and other northern areas have a subsistence lifestyle, making them vulnerable to methylmercury contaminating their food supply, mutter added.\n\nthe researchers are currently working on a follow-up study modeling the release of permafrost due to climate change, according to the statement.\n\noriginally published on live science.
the anti-vaccination movement made the list of the world health organization's top threats to global health in 2019. the organization said some people's reluctance or refusal to vaccinate threatens to reverse progress made against a host of preventable diseases.\n\nvaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease — it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved, who said in a statement.\n\nthe effects of what who called vaccine hesitancy are already significant. for example, cases of measles have surged 30 percent worldwide in recent years, despite an effective vaccine that can prevent it. who noted that some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.\n\nthe reasons why some people choose not to vaccinate are complex, who said, citing complacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines, and lack of confidence as the main factors. even though decades of medical research has proven vaccines are both safe and effective, skeptics continue to spread misinformation online.\n\nin the united states, approximately 100,000 young children have not been vaccinated against any of the 14 potentially serious diseases for which vaccines are recommended, according to a report released last year by the centers for disease control and prevention. while most american children are routinely vaccinated, the number who have received no vaccines by the age of 2 is slowly creeping up.\n\nworldwide, who plans to ramp up its work in 2019 to eliminate cervical cancer by increasing use of the hpv vaccine. the organization also hopes this is the year the transmission of poliovirus is finally stopped in its last two holdouts, afghanistan and pakistan. last year, fewer than 30 cases of polio were reported in both countries.\n\nwho also warns of the dangers of influenza — a century after the 1918 flu pandemic killed millions of people around the globe. the world will face another influenza pandemic — the only thing we don't know is when it will hit and how severe it will be, the report states. the authors stress the importance of getting a flu shot each year for the best protection against the virus.\n\nanother disease that made who's list of global health threats is ebola, which caused two separate outbreaks in the democratic republic of the congo in 2018.\n\nwhile much of who's list focused on infectious disease, it also included the increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. these types of conditions, linked to lifestyle factors like obesity, alcohol and tobacco use, are collectively responsible for over 70% of all deaths worldwide, or 41 million people, the report said.\n\nclimate change, pollution and health\n\na different type of health threat is posed by climate change and air pollution, which also made the list of biggest concerns.\n\nglobally, nine out of 10 people breathe polluted air every day. pollutants in the air can penetrate respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging the lungs, heart and brain and causing an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year from diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart and lung disease.\n\nadditionally, who predicts that between 2030 and 2050 climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.\n\nthe report warns that even if all the commitments made by countries for the paris agreement are met, the world is still on a course to warm by more than 3°c this century. even half that amount of warming would be more than enough to cause widespread risks to health, livelihoods, and food security, according to u.n. climate experts.
intelligence matters -\n\ninterview with david cohen; avril haines\n\ncorrespondent: michael morell\n\nproducer: olivia gazis\n\nmichael morell:\n\navril, david, welcome. it is great to have you both here. there has to be some joke about three deputy directors of the cia walking into a bar, maybe in moscow. but it's great to have you guys on the show.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright.\n\navril haines:\n\nthank you for having us.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nthank you.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni want to let our listeners know that today's show is going to be a little bit different. usually, i only ask questions. but today, i'm actually going to participate in the discussion as well, answering some of the questions. so i think what that means for you guys is that it's fair game for you guys to ask questions as well.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ngreat.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso we'll just take this kind of wherever it goes. okay, let's jump right in. david, i want to start with you. and i know that every day it is different, but what does a typical day look like for the deputy director of the cia?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nwell, for me-- and i think it's probably different for each of you-- for me it began with reading the pdb, the president's daily brief, on the way into work. and then when i got there-- it took me about 25 minutes or so to get into the work in the morning-- i'd get there and i--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyou read it in the car on the way?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni read it in the car on the way in. i would sometimes try and work out ahead of time. so that was a typical day. i would get up way too early and try to work out so i didn't turn into a big, fat mess. and then i would meet with my staff. i had some executive assistants. and i would meet with them and talk to them about what was in the pdb. and i had a briefer who could come and join in that conversation. i usually made it through the pdb, so i didn't get brief--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthe briefer is not in a car with you?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nbriefer is not in the car. and then the typical day would unfold with preparations for deputy's committee meetings, preparations for meetings with others in the intelligence community, and a fair amount of work inside the building. there was a lot of-- in fact, it's really important-- meeting with folks in the building who are working on various projects, whether it's analytics, or operators, or people in support, the s&t, or in the science and technology operation, or in the new digital innovation directorate to understand what they're doing, provide some direction, try and help them understand what director brennan, who was the director when i was there -- and you guys as well -- was hoping to accomplish.\n\nmichael morell:\n\navril, what was yours? what would you add to that?\n\navril haines:\n\nthat's not dissimilar from mine. i would really work hard to try to build in a starbucks break at some point during the day. i know that will come as a huge surprise to the two of you, but--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nmultiple -- multiple starbucks--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nmultiple starbucks breaks. no. but truly--\n\nmichael morell:\n\npeople should know that there is a starbucks in cia.\n\navril haines:\n\nthere is.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand it is one of the highest grossing--\n\navril haines:\n\nit's-- (laugh)\n\nmichael morell:\n\n--starbucks in the nation.\n\navril haines:\n\nit was one of the reasons that i knew the cia was the right place for me. i just want to make that clear. but i wonder, was it different for you, michael? was it?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nno, it wasn't. i think people should appreciate, you know, david's point about preparing for meetings downtown. there's the preparation, which usually takes a good hour in your office talking to folks and thinking about what you want to say. and then going to that meeting, which takes 15 to 20 minutes to get there. and then in the meeting at the white house, a couple of hours at a time, maybe multiple sessions, maybe multiple deputy's committee meetings.\n\nmaybe going to the hill. and then coming back to the agency, driving all the way back to the agency, and then doing a debrief, right? so that is a huge amount of time. as important as the internal stuff is, the external stuff pulls you away from the internal stuff, i think. right?\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah, i agree. i remember i used to get a card every day that would have my schedule on it so that i could keep track of what was going on. the question for me was always, what font is the card on? (laughter) if it's 10 point, like, how much scarier that is. how many things you could pack in during a day and how you felt as if every moment had to count. it's true. one of the things i learned from the job was how to prepare and how to read while you're in the car, and make calls, and make every moment but it's productive in that way.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nyeah. i thought one of the difficult things about the job, although it was exhilarating, was that virtually every minute was scheduled; you had something to do. there were few occasions where i sat at my desk and thought, i've got a half hour of unscheduled time here where i can read the newspaper or even catch up on this stack of briefings that had been accumulating. it was great. it was a constant flow of really interesting stuff, but it was unrelenting.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah, i had this habit of, if there was too much scheduled, i would say, there's too much on the schedule. if there were any empty spots, i would say, how come there's empty spots on the schedule? i do think it was important to get out and walk around not only to the people who work directly for us, the heads of the directorates, the executive director, but actually just walk through the building, and pop into an office and see what people are doing, and show your face a little bit. i think that's really important. i assume that you both loved the job. we've talked about this before.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni'd really love to know why you think you loved it. what did you love most about it? avril, let's start with you this time.\n\navril haines:\n\ni love the people. honestly, i loved constantly feeling as if i was learning new things. it's when i feel most alive in any job. i loved the fact that when i came to work, no matter how long the day was, no matter how late it was, i felt as if i was contributing to something that mattered, in a sense. the comradery within the agency is really something quite special.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso it's a family.\n\navril haines:\n\ntotally. it's a remarkable experience.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhich i think flows in part from the fact that it's a secret intelligence organization and you can't go home and tell your family about what you're doing. you tend to group, right?\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah, i think that's true. but i also think it attracts people who are not interested in fame and glory, because you're clearly not going to get it at the cia, right?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright.\n\navril haines:\n\nyou're really interested in doing something that you think is worthwhile for the country. i think that there's a self-selecting mechanism there, in a way, and it brings people together. as you say, you can't talk to a lot of people about your job. you end up feeling as if you can share really only to people who understand it within the agency. that also creates a culture that's-- that's a strength and a weakness, in some respects, i think.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ndavid?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni wholeheartedly agree with everything avril said. just to put a twist on it: i used to, when i would talk to people in the agency, and now and they would ask me, you know, what did you enjoy about the agency? the thing that i found sort of exhilarating was the honest dedication of the people working there. i had this experience multiple times when i was there, which i thought, i wish people could see what was going on in this meeting, or could see how these people are going about mapping out this open they're going to undertake and the care with which it was done, the fidelity to law with which it was done.\n\nfor someone like me -- and i think avril similarly had the opportunity to parachute into the agency after spending many, many years doing other things -- to see this veneer of mythology, both good and bad, sort of stripped away and the way that the people in the agency approach their job was i thought really affirming.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah, i had that same thought a lot sitting in meetings. i would think there needs to be a mythbusters, right, that comes in and takes one of these meetings, because there are so many myths out there about cia being rogue and not being competent. it would just blow all those away. i loved the job too. there wasn't a single day i didn't want to go to work in 33 years, for all the reasons that you guys said. i loved my daily intelligence briefing. i thought that was the most special hour where you can really dig into the substance--\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah, exactly.\n\nmichael morell:\n\n--and ask questions to somebody who's really studied it, and do taskings, and get follow ups. i loved that. i loved traveling overseas to visit our officers. i loved sitting with first tour case officers and listening to them talk about the cases they were running. i thought that was all extraordinarily special. was this the best job you ever had in government?\n\navril haines:\n\nyou go first. yeah.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nso i had thought that my job at treasury was the best job in government, and it's a fantastic job, until i showed up at the agency. absolutely. the things about it that really were great is -- a little bit picking up on what avril said -- it was an opportunity at age 52, whatever i was when i started, to learn an enormous amount about the world, about our government, but even more importantly about how the world operates and how we operate in the world.\n\nthat was an opportunity that i think few people have. i felt extraordinarily privileged just to have the opportunity to learn that. i think it's a great job if you can constantly be learning. it was consequential. what makes a job enjoyable is that you wake up in the morning and you think i'm going to do something today that makes a difference, hopefully for the good. i did think that in that job you had the opportunity to do good and you had that almost unique opportunity to do good every day.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand you had deputy national security advisor, deputy director of the cia.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah. i would take deputy director of the cia pretty much any day over deputy national security advisor in some respects. they're very different. the reason i say that is not-- i loved being deputy national security advisor, too. when you're in the agencies, you actually feel as if you have the capacity to get things done. that's a heady feeling in some respects. you actually are taking policy and you're watching it be implemented, in a sense. you're taking action to try to--\n\nmichael morell:\n\ndo something.\n\navril haines:\n\nexactly. in the interest of the united states government. you see how that translates, in a sense. when you're in the national security advisor position, in a way you're a glorified staffer for the president, which is a remarkable thing. one of the most incredible things about that job is that you get to be there for all of these incredibly important meetings with the president, and leaders, and kinds of things, and watch his decision-making process in a very intimate way.\n\nyou get to cheer the deputies and facilitate that policy making process in a way. it's a very different job. in some respects, being a staffer is more suited to my personality. i'm a bit of an introvert, and i'm not somebody who's very comfortable being out there constantly. at the agency, you're a leader of the agency. you need to be out there. you need to do things like ribbon cuttings and talking to the workforce and so on. that pushed me out of my comfort zone, but it was also--\n\nmichael morell:\n\ngood for you.\n\navril haines:\n\n--a growing experience. yes, i know.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ngood for you. (laugh)\n\navril haines:\n\nboth of you.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso let's shift to a discussion a bit about the agency's performance. i want to give our listeners a sense of how the agency's doing and serving the american people and serving the president. as you guys think about that, i'd love to hear about your prescription of the agency's performance before you got to the agency. you were at the white house, avril, as a legal advisor at the nsc. david, you were at treasury as an undersecretary. you saw the agency; used the agency's product, and then you went to the agency. how do you think about the agency's performance in general and then in that context? david, you're up.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nshould i go first? okay. when i was at treasury, we were heavily dependent on the intelligence community to provide us information to fuel the sanctions programs that i helped to oversee. i had a very good impression, i thought, of the agency as the lead analytic core of the u.s. government in terms of giving us the information we needed for our sanctions programs to work. what i did not appreciate, and soon came to learn as soon as i got to the agency, was how little i knew about the agency and what the agency did from my perspective at the treasury department.\n\nwhich i thought it was a very healthy relationship. i got out to the agency and realized there was a vast amount of additional understanding, analysis, operational activity going on than i had appreciated when i was at treasury. i think the agency by and large -- and we can get into more detail on this -- does a spectacular job in the areas where there is a focus in investment and policy interest. i had the privilege when i was at treasury to be in one of those areas.\n\nmichael morell:\n\navril?\n\navril haines:\n\njust building on what david was saying: i-- and i'm really interested in your perspective on this, michael, too. if you think the way i do, at least, watching policy makers at the national security council trying to absorb a huge range of issues. it's impossible for any one person to be an expert in all of these different issues. not only are they expected to cover this huge range of issues, but they're also expected to do it at sort of a rapid-fire pace and to be making decisions about, frankly, what should they even spend their time on.\n\nwhich of these things are real crises? which are not real crises? how should we prioritize these issues? then what should we do about them? you recognize the premium that's put-on information, on information that both is accurate, that gives you a sense of what's actually happening in the moment, but also provides context for what's occurring. the one place that you can get that kind of information where you don't have an agency generally that's trying to spin you on essentially the policy outcome that they're interested in or the particular decision that they're interested in making, is from the intelligence community.\n\nwhat i saw, both as a lawyer but then ultimately from the deputy national security advisor position, is just how critical that was at so many different moments to provide context to be able to make the kinds of decisions that you need to make at the national security council. i think it's more important now than ever, in a sense, in that context.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni think all of that is right. i do think in terms of collection that our-- this is five years ago. i don't know what's happening today. in terms of collection, i think the record is mixed. i think there are issues where we knocked the ball out of the park.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nif we could tell americans, here's what we know about x, y, or z, they would say, oh my gosh. you guys are doing a fantastic job. then i think there are some areas where there are some significant gaps.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nbecause the job is hard. because we don't have all the resources we need. because there's only 24 hours in the day. but there are some areas where, if i could tell the american people, you know, we don't have access to this, this, or this, they'd say, wow. you're not doing your job. i do think on the collection side it's mixed. i'm not sure there's a lot that can be done about it.\n\navril haines:\n\ndid that change a lot over the period that you were in the agency?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nno, i don't. i think during the existence of the soviet union during the cold war, that's where the focus was. we were very good on that, and we were less good on other things. then after 9/11 we were--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright.\n\nmichael morell:\n\n--very good on ct. there were some holes in other places. tom donilan said once to me -- we were talking about a particular issue that was very, very important to him and very, very important to the president. he said, the analysts have taken this as far as they can take it without new information, new clandestine information. he was both giving me a compliment but also saying, hey, there's more you need to do here. i think that's a pretty good way of looking at it.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni think -- just to sort of build on that a little bit -- coming from treasury and having the opportunity to sit with economic policy makers, i think that point that the agency is very good in areas where it is invested and has a long-term investment but not so good in areas where, frankly, it's hard and we haven't invested describes economic analysis quite well. we do not do a great job, by and large, not in the sort of microeconomic, following the money. the agency and the intel community is pretty good at that. understanding broader trends in economics in a way that is useful to economic policy makers i think that's an area where i think, both as a matter of collection analysis, the agency could do better.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso what do you guys think is the greatest strength and the greatest weakness of the place? and maybe i'll go first here. i happen to believe that people and organizations' weaknesses flow from their strengths. it's actually a great way to think about people, right? i am a horrible listener. i'm in part a horrible listener because when i ask somebody a question, my mind is so analytic that i'm thinking about what the answer is, rather than listening to them.\n\nthat's a weakness that flows from a strength. i think the agency's great strength and great weakness is the same. i think its focus on mission: it's a great strength for the obvious reason. it's a weakness because we really don't want to talk about or do anything unless it has to do with mission. trying to get somebody to go to a leadership training course, for example, or focus on anything like that is really, really hard at the agency because people are saying, don't take me away from the job. don't take me away from the mission. that's the way i think about it.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah. it's interesting, because i started off as a lawyer in the government. it's the same issue in legal offices, generally. you get promoted because you're a really great lawyer, not because you're a good manager. there was never an effort to really promote leadership and management in the office. i saw a version of that i think at the agency. i agree, that's an issue.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand every director has tried to tackle that. every director has--\n\navril haines:\n\ni know.\n\nmichael morell:\n\n--some leadership initiative.\n\navril haines:\n\nit's a perennial--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nit's a perennial problem.\n\navril haines:\n\n--issue. exactly. you really have to change the culture--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyes.\n\navril haines:\n\n--of the place in order to actually have an impact--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyes.\n\navril haines:\n\n--on that. i think that's true of a few things like that. and i agree, it's also strength. it is true. david sort of alluded to this in his initial talk about the agency. it is also really impressive how focused people are on mission and how effective we are at being able to get things, like in a crisis, get out the door in an innovative, creative way to actually do something about the challenge.\n\ni also think in many respects the value that i put on the table earlier of being an institution that's capable of providing analysis without having a dog in the policy fight is another great strength that the agency brings to the table that you just don't see from other places in the government and that i think is critical.\n\ni also think -- in your sort of strengths are also weaknesses -- i think there's a weakness that comes with that, which is, in a sense, because there's so much value put on being objective and trying to provide that analysis without having a spin on it, in a sense, you also find that the agency can be isolated in ways that is not always healthy and integrating the agency's work, for example, into things below the deputy's level is a challenge. i think also the agency's ability to pull from other agencies, essentially the economic piece that david mentioned but also other places--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthe tendency toward insularity.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah, exactly. it isn't always a useful thing for the analysis, in a sense.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ndavid? quick thought?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nyeah. just sort of on the same theme of strengths and weaknesses. i think the agency is very, very good at providing both collection and analysis on the critical issues of the day. where i think the agency could do better -- and i think this is also a perennial that both i think directors and folks at the nsc have pressed the agency to do -- is to look over the horizon to understand challenges, really significant challenges that are coming but that have not yet fully ripened into a crisis to alert policy makers to that at a time when there can be policy changes that can avert a big problem down the road. which is not to say the agency doesn't do any of that, but because of the intense focus on mission, and on the crisis of the day, and on providing--\n\nmichael morell:\n\non the inbox. yeah.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nthe inbox. right. providing policy makers what they need to deal with a current crisis, that sometimes gets left behind.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah, agreed.\n\nmichael morell:\n\navril, david, let's shift to talk about some of the important issues of the day. a place i'd like to start is the challenge that director haspel faces in a very dangerous world with a lot of threats and a lot of challenges, so a tremendous amount of work to do. operating in a political environment here in washington that is probably the toughest that i've ever seen. how do you think about the challenges she is facing, how she's doing, david?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni think she has an extraordinarily hard job, in part -- i think there's no reason to sugarcoat this -- in part, because the president is not a serious consumer of intelligence, if he consumes it at all. the agency is geared to providing its analysis to the first customer, to the president, and having the president at least understand it and then make judgment. i think none of us are obviously inside right now, but all of the reporting -- and there's no reason to doubt this -- is that the president does not pay a great deal of attention to what the agency is producing.\n\ni think that makes her job hard. i think she's done well -- i think we saw this recently in the context of the analysis regarding the murder of jamal khashoggi -- where she went up to the hill, quite clearly delivered what was the cia's analytic line to congress when, frankly, former director pompeo and secretary of defense mattis didn't. i think that--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nshe wavered initially on that. she--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nwell, she didn't go--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nshe didn't go initially.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nyeah, it was--\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni was a little worried--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\n--unclear why.\n\nmichael morell:\n\n--about that moment. but she did go and she did, evidently, say exactly what the agency thought.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni thought that was an important moment in her directorship and to plant the agency's flag that she is able to present the truth to power in that fashion.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nshe seems to have made a decision to stay out of the public eye in a way that previous directors were trending to do more and more of. how do we think about that?\n\navril haines:\n\ni suspect that doesn't surprise any of us, knowing her. she's not somebody who i think relishes the spotlight in that kind of way. i'm very sympathetic to that because i feel the same way. i think that's probably a good choice for her right now. although, she did just give a recent speech. i think it would be great to see more of those, because i think she is really a terrific face of the agency. i think she's somebody who can talk to folks around the country and explain what it is that the intelligence community does and the value that it brings and explain things that are not obvious to many people i think in this country.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni think it, not being out there, fits her personality. i'm not surprised from that perspective. and i'm also not surprised from a political perspective. if you're the director of the cia and you go out there and you get asked, is iran living up to its commitments under the nuclear agreement? the answer to that question is, yes. right?\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah, exactly.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyour boss doesn't want to hear that. if you lean towards your boss and raise some questions about whether the iranians are doing that, you put yourself at odds with your building. if you lean towards your building, you put yourself at odds with your boss. it's very dangerous to be out there. i think it probably makes sense for her to be a little quiet. it doesn't bring back a little myth of the nation's spymaster, too, i think a little bit.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni think that's right. i think she's in a terribly difficult spot because of the fact that the policy direction is, on a whole range of issues, obviously contrary to what the analytic line of the agency is. i do think it's important-- and granted, this is not director haspel's comfort zone-- it is important for the director of the cia to make an effort to be out in public and talk about what the agency does.\n\nthat doesn't mean that he or she needs to get deep into the analysis on particular issues; but talking about how this secret intelligence service goes about doing its work i think is one of the key requirements of a leader in the intelligence community.\n\nmichael morell:\n\navril, a special question for you about women at cia.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyou were the first female deputy director. gina's the first female director. gina just appointed the first female head of operations. tell people why that's important; why that matters.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah. i will, but i want to say one thing about the two of you. michael, i credit you with convincing me that i would be good for the agency coming into the job at the deputy director.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nhaving coffee at 5:30 in the morning.\n\navril haines:\n\nindeed. (laughter) exactly. at starbucks. yes. i credit both of you as being men that i've had the great, honestly, joy to serve with who make a special effort, frankly, to think about diversity in the context of your work and promoting people and trying to change the culture in a way that's productive for women. that's something i can't tell you how much it means to so many people around us that have benefited from that.\n\nbecause i look at my own career. and honestly, i have so many women who went before me to thank but also a lot of men that made space for that in that context. anyway, i think it's critically important in ways that i didn't recognize, frankly, at the beginning of my career. which is to say that i think i undervalued the degree to which seeing women in a variety of different styles and approaches to leadership meant to younger women who were coming up through the ranks and who can say to themselves, that's somebody-- i could be that. i can be the director of the cia. i can do that.\n\nand moreover, to see that whatever their particular style is is represented in leadership in some way. it has an impact. it has more an impact on me emotionally than i even give it credit for at times. just watching gina go through that process and take the mantle of being the director of the cia; seeing beth be promoted in that way. i recognize the value that that has for women. one of the moments i had, similar to david's description of i wish somebody could be in this meeting and watching this, the absolutely astoundingly talented young women in the agency is just on a daily basis is just remarkable. you watch these-- right?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah.\n\navril haines:\n\ni know you've all seen it.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nabsolutely. i agree with you 100%. but i think before you, and gina, and now beth, they always wondered whether they could get to the top. and now they know they can. i think that must be terribly, terribly motivating for them.\n\navril haines:\n\ni hope so.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ndavid, let me ask you a special question, which is about the modernization of the agency that director brennan put in place. tell us what that was and tell us how well you thought it was working and how much of a difference you thought it was making when you left the building in january of 2017.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nit was, in concept, actually quite simple. the idea was we have an agency with capability in a variety of different areas, whether it's in collection, in analysis, in support, in science and technology, and that the agency would do better, be more effective if we found a way to not operate in silos but to operate collaboratively. the idea was essentially to reorganize the agency so that the different capabilities, collection, analysis, support, technology, were combined and focused on particular mission sets, whether parts of the world or specific subject matters. it was controversial because it--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand there was-- just to let people know-- a couple of places where that was the case--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nexactly.\n\nmichael morell:\n\n--before modernization. counterterrorism being one. and those tended, in my view, to be the most effective organizations.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso--\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright. it was building on that. the counterterrorism center combined all of these elements. that was the germ from which the modernization grew. it was disruptive. we were talking before about how the agency is very mission focused and doesn't like to do things other than put their head down and charge ahead. it required people to lift their head up and think about working at the agency in a different way.\n\nbut i think by and large -- obviously not uniformly -- people understood that collaborating, combining the capabilities of the agency in this way would make the agency more effective, both in terms of the core mission of what we're doing as well as helping to integrate with the rest of the intelligence community and the rest of the policy community. i think we had two years to put this in place. it was starting to gel. i'm happy to say that director pompeo, although i think was initially skeptical, by and large kept in place modernization. and director haspel has as well. can i say one other thing about modernization to--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nsure.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\n--pick up on your question, avril, on women in the agency. one of the key elements beyond the reorganization was an emphasis on diversity and on insuring that the agency identified, and promoted, and invested in officers from very, very diverse backgrounds, both because it was effective for the agency-- we need officers who can operate anywhere in the world in various cultures with various languages; and the more that we have officers that come from diverse backgrounds, the better able we are to do that-- but also because it was the right thing to do.\n\ni give enormous credit to director brennan for being very courageous and forthright in pressing diversity to a point where there were people who were uncomfortable with the extent to which he was doing it. but it was absolutely the right thing to do for the agency.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyou're at the nsc as the deputy national security advisor as they're digging into modernization. are you seeing an impact into what they're bringing to the table?\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah. while i was there, we did the review that basically pulled together what it was that would be the plan for modernization, essentially.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright.\n\navril haines:\n\nand so i obviously knew what was happening and had seen the beginnings of it moving through. before getting there at the nsc, another aspect of what i saw at least was when agency officers would go into conflict zones or into areas like that where you saw a microcosm of this conflation of the different, essentially, directorates that david mentioned, you'd see that extraordinary value of basically the interaction between the different places.\n\nit really was-- you could see the younger generation getting very excited at the prospect of actually trying to bring that into headquarters and make that work in a way that was effective. when it came to being then, at nsc and watching this happen, one of the most obvious places from the nsc perspective of what was happening -- and sort of the impact of modernization -- was that you had somebody sitting at the table in the deputy's discussions sometimes when the deputy wasn't available, who actually could represent all of the different parts of the agency.\n\nbecause what would happen previously when the deputy wasn't available, you'd have the lead of a directorate usually there, either analysis, or operations, instead of having somebody who actually represented all of these different directorates. and that really made an enormous difference because they could bring to bear, essentially, the expertise and the knowledge of all the different pieces of the agency when providing the perspective of the agency.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso my take -- and john talked to me before he did this. i was supportive. everybody now knows that out there. i do think it is extraordinarily important to mitigate the downsides of any organizational structure. i think the downsides of this organizational structure are the tradecraft of the work, both operational and analytic. it doesn't mean that it has to suffer. it means you simply need to pay a lot more attention to it.\n\nyou didn't have to do that before because there was one person in charge of analysis and one person in charge of operations, and they could set a standard, and they could hold everybody to it. and now there's 10, 11, 12 people doing that. there is a risk to that, and you just have to mitigate it.\n\ni want talk about john brennan. we all worked for him. we all admire him greatly. we all know his record of public service. we all know that there are americans -- this is literally -- there are americans who are alive today who wouldn't be without john's work. john, since leaving government, has chosen to challenge the president quite directly. i just want to know how you guys think about that, a former senior intelligence official, career intelligent official really stepping -- i know he doesn't think about it this way. he doesn't think about it being political. but really stepping into the political arena. how do you think about that?\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah. from my perspective, i'm very supportive of him speaking out on these issues. here's sort of my thinking on this: i think he sees the current situation as an aberration and really is deeply concerned about what's happening right now; concerned about some of the approaches that president trump has taken and how it's affecting, among other things, the intelligence community and our national security. when it comes to--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand very concerned about where all of this is going.\n\navril haines:\n\nexactly.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nnot just where we are.\n\navril haines:\n\nright. exactly. and how this will affect the country's ability to survive in the future in a way that he imagines it can. i think in a moment such as that, it's hard to imagine anybody not wanting people with the experience that john brennan has had speaking up. in other words, this is somebody who has spent decades in national security and intelligence, who has served multiple presidents of different parties, who's seen so many things that the average person has not seen, and he can provide context, and he has credibility, and he has the ability to analyze and tell you when something's wrong.\n\ni want that voice in the public discourse. i want to hear what he has to say. i don't think that everybody has to agree with him. i certainly think you can judge for yourself whether or not what he has to say is something that you want to take onboard, but i would not want to silence that voice.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ndo you think, david, there's a cost to the agency at all?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\ni think that is a concern of people who are really close to the agency. but i think as a general matter, there is not a cost to the agency. he's a former director. he's a private citizen. as avril said, he's someone who has spent a career in intelligence and national security and has a perspective and a special authority from his service that i think is valuable for him to bring into the public space.\n\nit's not just that john has a minor policy difference with what the administration is doing from what a prior administration is doing. i think what john is doing is sounding the alarm that we are being governed today by a president, by an administration that is several deviations away from the norm; that there is a president who lacks the intellect, the ethics, the capability to run a country in a way that protects the country going forward.\n\nand he has seen others in other countries behaving in this fashion and sees where that leads. i think it's important to recognize that it's not just john. you have former agency seniors, like john mclaughlin or mike hayden, who are also publicly critical of the direction that the administration has taken. again, not because it's minor policy differences but because of a real, serious concern. you have former senior military officers, stan mcchrystal, bill mcraven, people who have spent their life defending this country, who are deeply alarmed at what's happening. i think they have every right, and i would say an obligation, to speak out.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni agree with all of that. i agree with all of that. where i end up is, i wonder how many minds are being changed, because people are so firmly pro-president or firmly anti-president. and boy, it's hard to move a person from one box to the other. there aren't a lot of people in between, right?\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nright.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni just wonder -- i don't disagree with what john's doing -- how many minds end up being changed at the end of the day.\n\navril haines:\n\nbut should that be the reason not to talk?\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni don't know. i don't know. i don't know.\n\navril haines:\n\ni mean i don't--\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni don't know.\n\navril haines:\n\n'cause part of what i think is--\n\nmichael morell:\n\njust an observation.\n\navril haines:\n\nyeah. look, part of what david's saying too, which i subscribe to as well, is that all of these people that david mentioned are folks who are geared not to engage in political discussion or to criticize the president, frankly. just by the virtue of their professional experience and the culture within which they grew up, and yet they're speaking out. i think it may not change people's minds who are core supporters of one side or the other, but i do think over time there's a moment at which people start to recognize, gee, something's different here. this is really kind of extraordinary. they may not listen at the moment that it's said, but there may come a tipping point at which those voices are—\n\nmichael morell:\n\nbecomes more significant.\n\navril haines:\n\ni also think when those people speak up, it gives people the space within which to begin to have that discussion in a way that they haven't before. one of the key challenges i think we're facing right now is the country is so extraordinarily divided on so many issues. politics is a clear one, but there are a lot of different divisions that we're dealing with. i believe, as i know you two do as well, that we are going to be stronger if we're united.\n\nwe're going to be more capable of promoting the interests of the united states and its citizens if we're united. i think that's something that if we can actually engage in a public discourse where we disagree and where we have views to express and so on that actually promotes being united, that's what we're trying to move for. these are the kind of people who can do that, who recognize both sides of arguments, who see the value in having different politics and different views, but nevertheless recognize once you've gotten to the aberration, essentially, that david described.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyou guys, our time's up. you guys have been terrific. thank you so much for joining us on the show.\n\navril haines:\n\nthank you.\n\ndavid cohen:\n\nthank you.\n\n* * *end of transcript* * *
paris — mayor anne hidalgo has confirmed that ambitious plans to transform paris' champs-élysées, the iconic avenue in the heart of the french capital, are still on the table. her initiative will see the avenue with fewer car lanes, more room for pedestrians and much more greenery.\n\noften dubbed the most beautiful avenue in the world, the champs-élysées has gone three decades without a major overhaul, and many parisians believe it looks tired and a lot less sophisticated than it used to.\n\nan artist's impression of the redesigned arc de triomphe, at the end of paris' iconic champs-élysées avenue, prepared by architects pca-stream under commission by the paris mayor's office. pca-stream\n\nonce home to swish car showrooms and top fashion houses, the avenue is now lined with expensive cafes, big chain stores and a lot of fast food restaurants. locals complain about noise and pollution from the relentless traffic, as the eight-lane, 1.2 mile avenue remains a major artery through the city. even the gardens at the end, near the place de la concorde, look underused and uninviting.\n\nthe champs-élysées committee of local business leaders has been pushing for a revamp for several years. in 2018, the committee tasked architects pca-stream with coming up with plans for the avenue and the surrounding areas, including the arc de triomphe and place de la concorde, at each end. hidalgo agreed to include the plans in her re-election manifesto last year.\n\nthe redesigned champs-élysées extends (top right) from the arc de triomphe in paris, as envisioned by architects at pca-stream. pca-stream\n\nshe confirmed that a facelift for the avenue was still very much in her planning for the coming years in a wide-ranging interview with french newspaper, le journal du dimanche, on sunday. the committee responded quickly, welcoming the news.\n\nin a statement, the committee noted that the avenue had lost its splendor over the past 30 years… it has been progressively abandoned by parisians and has suffered several crises: the yellow vest [demonstrations], strikes, the pandemic, economic crisis etc.\n\nthe budget for the total project is a whopping $305 million, but the dramatic change won't happen right away. hidalgo said the revamp of the place de la concorde will go ahead in the next few years, but the champs-élysées makeover will have to wait until 2025.\n\nthat's partly because paris first must complete the ambitious program already underway to ready the city to host the 2024 olympic games.\n\nan artist's impression from architects pca-stream shows the plan to remake paris' central champs-élysées avenue as a pedestrian friendly green space, with far less traffic than the current eight-lane layout. pca-stream\n\nwhile those plans will be scaled back because of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, the city is already renovating, rebuilding and restructuring not just its sports facilities, but also its roads and transport systems, and its links with the near suburbs of la défense to the west, and saint-denis to the north, which is to be headquarters for all administrative operations for the games.\n\nwe will redo the place de la concorde before the olympic games, then the full length of the avenue afterwards; it will be [another] extraordinary garden, hidalgo told the newspaper over the weekend.

the 116th congress was sworn into office this past week, even as the government remained in a partial shutdown. a record number of women have been elected to the house of representatives. so far, one newcomer is getting most of the attention, from both the left and from the right. congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez is 29 years old. she'd never run for elective office before and was working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her campaign. she unseated one of the most powerful democrats in the house in the primary.\n\nlike sen. bernie sanders, ocasio-cortez is a democratic socialist. she believes in universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. she's been described as both an inspiring and idealistic insurgent, and as a naïve and ill-informed newcomer — as the future of the democratic party, and as a potential obstacle to its success. few rookie members of congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in.\n\nanderson cooper: there are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: mm-hmm.\n\nanderson cooper: do you?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: i think it's really great for people to keep thinking that. (laughter)\n\nanderson cooper: you want folks to underestimate you?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: absolutely. that's how i won my primary. (laughter)\n\nwinning that primary shocked the democratic establishment, and in november, alexandria ocasio-cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to congress.\n\njust a few days later, as soon as she got to washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader nancy pelosi's office. she was the only newly elected member of congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nanderson cooper: nancy pelosi is incredibly powerful.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: she absolutely is. and—\n\nanderson cooper: and you're occupying her office.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: oh my goodness, i could have thrown up that morning. (laugh) i was so nervous. but— i kept kind of just coming back to the idea that what they're fighting for wasn't wrong. and i— i had also sat down with— with leader pelosi beforehand and she told me her story. she came from activism. and i knew that she would absolutely understand how advocacy can change the needle on really important issues.\n\nocasio-cortez and her allies managed to get more than 40 members of congress to support the climate committee.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what ocasio-cortez had in mind. pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry.\n\ni think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country.\n\nfor ocasio-cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. and another one came when she defied pelosi and voted against the speaker's new house rules, but was not joined by many other progressive democrats. ocasio-cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a green new deal — a highly ambitious, some would say unrealistic, proposal that would convert the entire u.s. economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every american a job at a fair wage.\n\nanderson cooper: you're talking about zero carbon emissions— no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: that is the goal. it's ambitious. and...\n\nanderson cooper: how is that possible? are you talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: it's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now. what is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?\n\nanderson cooper: this would require, though, raising taxes.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: there's an element where— yeah. there— people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.\n\nanderson cooper: do you have a specific on the tax rate?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: you know, it— you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system. your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. but once you get to, like, the tippy tops— on your 10 millionth dollar— sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. that doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.\n\nanderson cooper: what you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda — compared to the way politics is done right now.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: well, i think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. abraham lincoln made the radical decision to sign the emancipation proclamation. franklin delano roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like social security.\n\nanderson cooper: do you call yourself a radical?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah. you know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.\n\nshe doesn't seem to be viewed as a radical by her constituents in new york 14 – the racially diverse, liberal, and reliably democratic congressional district that includes parts of queens and the bronx. ocasio-cortez was born in the bronx. her parents had met in puerto rico. her father owned a small architectural business. her mother cleaned houses to help make ends meet. by the time she was ready for preschool, her parents had made a downpayment on a small house in the westchester suburbs. it was 30 miles and a world away from her extended family still living in the bronx.\n\nanderson cooper: what was it that— that brought your parents here?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: schools. yeah. my—my mom wanted to make sure that i had— a solid chance and a solid education.\n\nanderson cooper: did you feel like you were living in two different worlds? 'cause you were spending a lot of time in the bronx with your family—\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah.\n\nanderson cooper: —and also here.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah. and just growing up that way and with my cousins, who were all my age too, feeling like we all had kind of different opportunities, depending on where we were physically located.\n\nshe did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended boston university. but in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: we were really working on the classic american dream. and overnight it was all taken away. my mom was back to cleaning homes and driving school buses to keep a roof over our heads.\n\nshe moved back to the bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. in may of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for congress. she was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: i really understood the frustration that working people had across the political spectrum. when anybody is saying, the economy is going great. we are at record levels. there's a frustration that says, well, the economy's good for who?\n\nanderson cooper: i mean unemployment is at record lows.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: i don't think that that tells the whole story. when you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. when you can't have healthcare. that is not — that is not dignified.\n\nocasio-cortez is sworn in as a u.s. congresswoman\n\na group of bernie sanders supporters who now call themselves justice democrats encouraged ocasio-cortez to run for office and gave her training and support. she built a grass-roots coalition that took on the democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in washington.\n\nher victory made national news, and she soon had a higher media profile than many veteran lawmakers. some saw in her primary victory a craving for change within the democratic party. house democratic leader nancy pelosi drew a more limited conclusion:\n\nnancy pelosi at press conference: they made a choice in one district, so let's not get yourself carried away\n\nbut president trump rarely missed a chance to suggest that all democrats were socialists who'd lead the country to ruin.\n\npresident trump at rally in nevada: venezuela, venezuela how does that sound? you like venezuela?\n\nanderson cooper: when people hear the word socialism, they think soviet union, cuba, venezuela. is that what you have in mind?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: of course (laugh) not. what we have in mind— and what of my— and my policies most closely re— resemble what we see in the u.k., in norway, in finland, in sweden.\n\nanderson cooper: how are you going to pay for all of this?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: no one asks how we're gonna pay for this space force. no one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. we only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. how do we pay for it? with the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this space force. for all of these— ambitious policies.\n\nanderson cooper: there are democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. democratic senator chris coons, said about left-leaning democrats, if the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: what makes it unrealistic?\n\nanderson cooper: how to pay for it.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: we pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. and so for me, what's unrealistic is— is what we're living in right now.\n\nsince the election, some conservative media outlets have focused on ocasio-cortez with an intensity unusual for a rookie member of congress.\n\nthe president certainly didn't invent racism. but he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.\n\nshe's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. she's also been criticized for making factual mistakes.\n\nanderson cooper: one of the criticisms of you is that— that your math is fuzzy. the washington post recently awarded you four pinocchios—\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: oh my goodness—\n\nanderson cooper: —for misstating some statistics about pentagon spending?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: if people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, i would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. i think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.\n\nanderson cooper: but being factually correct is important—\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: it's absolutely important. and whenever i make a mistake. i say, okay, this was clumsy. and then i restate what my point was. but it's— it's not the same thing as— as the president lying about immigrants. it's not the same thing, at all.\n\nanderson cooper: you don't talk about president trump very much.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: no.\n\nanderson cooper: why?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: no. because i think he's a symptom of a problem.\n\nanderson cooper: what do you mean?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: the president certainly didn't invent racism. but he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.\n\nanderson cooper: do you believe president trump is a racist?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah. yeah. no question.\n\nanderson cooper: how can you say that?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: (chuckle) when you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. when you look at how he reacted to the charlottesville incident, where neo-nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's— it's night and day.\n\nin response, the deputy white house press secretary said, cong. ocasio-cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that president trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform… and ... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.\n\none of the few things ocasio-cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. when a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, that jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles, she called him out for what she said was misogyny.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: would you be taking a creep shot of steny hoyer's behind and sharing it around? why is there more comfort in doing that to me than there is in doing it to— any other member of congress?\n\neliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of ocasio-cortez's signature issues. most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. she did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. she's angered some of her colleagues in the house by encouraging primary challenges of democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies.\n\nanderson cooper: these are politically dangerous tactics that you're using...\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah—\n\nanderson cooper: you've heard that?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah.\n\nanderson cooper: do you believe it?\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez: it's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we— we know so much of— of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either.\n\nproduced by andy court and evie salomon
an iowa poll, long considered the most credible in the state and closely watched by political campaigns, will not be released saturday night as planned. the poll from the des moines register, cnn and selzer & co was set to be one of the final iowa polls ahead of the state's caucus on monday.\n\ntoday, a respondent raised an issue with the way the survey was administered, which could have compromised the results of the poll. it appears a candidate's name was omitted in at least one interview in which the respondent was asked to name their preferred candidate, des moines register executive editor carol hunter said in a statement.\n\nhunter said the incident appears to be isolated to just one surveyor but could not confirm with certainty and therefore the partners made the difficult decision to not to move forward with releasing the iowa poll.\n\nthe new york times first reported the poll was being pulled minutes before the results were scheduled to be announced. the times reported it was buttigieg's name that was left off.\n\nlis smith, a senior adviser to pete buttigieg's campaign, confirmed saturday night on twitter that the campaign had received a report from a recipient of the poll that not every candidate was named. the campaign shared this information with the organizers of the poll, who she said conducted an internal investigation and determined not to release it.\n\nwe applaud cnn and the des moines register for their integrity, smith said.\n\nwe shared this with the organizations behind the poll, who conducted an internal investigation and determined not to release it. we applaud cnn and the des moines register for their integrity. (2/2) — lis smith (@lis_smith) february 2, 2020\n\nthe des moines register reported interviewers conducting the poll would read from a list of candidates' names and that the order of names would randomly change. one interviewer had increased the font on their screen, which cut off buttigieg's name, the register said, citing a cnn internal investigation. the investigation could not determine how many times it happened or whether other candidates were affected.\n\nthe decision was to protect the integrity of the poll, and so it is the right one, selzer & co. president j. ann selzer said in a statement to cbs news.\n\nthe poll's results were supposed to be released live on cnn live from des moines. cnn's vice president of political coverage and political director david chalian said the release was canceled out of an abundance of caution.\n\nit was brought to cnn's attention earlier this evening that somebody who was questioned for the survey raised an issue with the way that their interview was conducted, chalian said on the network when it was announced the results would not be released. that means the results of the poll could have been compromised. we weren't able to determine exactly what happened during this person's interview and we don't know if it was an isolated incident.\n\nthe last poll from the des moines register, released on january 10, showed senator bernie sanders leading the race with 20% support among likely caucus-goers. sanders was followed by senator elizabeth warren at 17%, buttigieg at 16%, and former vice president joe biden at 15%. all four of those candidates have led the poll at various points this cycle.\n\nthe race in iowa remains fluid with two days until iowans head to caucus sites to officially begin the 2020 democratic presidential nominating process. a cbs news battleground tracker poll last weekend also found a close race with sanders at 26%, biden at 25%, buttigieg at 22%, and warren at 15%.
at 8:07 saturday morning, more than one million cellphones in hawaii began buzzing with a warning about an imminent missile attack, saying, seek immediate shelter -- this is not a drill.\n\nstate officials canceled the alert at 8:13, six minutes later. but they didn't send a new cellphone message for another half hour, at 8:45. during that time, people flooded the streets in fear across the state, searching for cover under threat of a nuclear attack. honolulu's 911 system received 5,500 calls.\n\nhawaii officials face widespread criticism over that false alarm. the head of the fcc, which is investigating, calls the error absolutely unacceptable.\n\nthe false alert was accidentally sent out from hawaii's emergency operations center. it was human error, made during a routine test of the emergency warning system. those tests have now been suspended while they do a top-to-bottom review.\n\ncorrespondent david begnaud at the emergency management agency command center in hawaii, from where the false missile alert was broadcast. cbs news\n\nit's embarrassing, but again, it's a mistake, said hawaii emergency management administrator vern miyagi, who reported one of his employees clicked the wrong button twice.\n\nhawaii emergency management administrator vern miyagi. cbs news\n\nhe was supposed to select the option for a drill. instead, he chose the real thing\n\nan alert heard by people across the island chain said: a missile may impact on land or sea within minutes. this is not a drill.\n\nbegnaud asked, with all due respect, are you sure this was an accident?\n\nyes, miyagi said. i know the individual. this was an accident. not intentional at all.\n\nbut why did he hit 'yes' twice?\n\nthat's being talked about and being investigated right now.\n\nthe man who's been working for the agency for about 10 years, who pushed the wrong button, realized within the first two to three minutes that he had made a mistake.\n\nbut it took nearly 38 minutes to get another text message alert out saying false alarm.\n\nit is an epic failure of leadership -- 38 minutes of terror for the people of hawaii before this message went out saying, 'sorry, false alarm, said hawaii congresswoman tulsi gabbard, who was one of the first to address the error.\n\ni don't usually panic, said noah tom, who was far from his wife and children when the alert was first issued. i thought i could do something, yet i felt totally helpless at the same time. so i'm sitting there just kind of bawling my eyes out in the car.\n\nin the aftermath, people across hawaii were confronted with the question: what would you do if this were the real thing?\n\nit's a wakeup call to say, 'hey, wait a minute, i don't know what to do,' miyagi said. our opportunity right now is to reach out and get that information to the people.\n\nmiyagi says cellphone users weren't told about the error sooner because his agency didn't have procedures for issuing corrections. that's no longer the case.\n\nanother change: two people will now be needed to send out alerts in the future.
london - singapore remains the world's most expensive city to live in, a study showed on tuesday, with two japanese cities -- tokyo and osaka -- returning to the top 10 thanks to the strengthening of the yen.\n\nalmaty in kazakhstan was the least expensive, followed by lagos in recession-hit nigeria.\n\nonly one u.s. city, new york, made the top 10 in the economist intelligence unit's twice-yearly worldwide cost of living survey. it came in ninth, dropping two places on a slightly weaker dollar but still far higher than its no. 46 slot just five years ago.\n\nlos angeles, in 11th place, just missed the top tier.\n\neurope was represented in the top 10 by four cities -- zurich at three, geneva and paris tied at seventh, and copenhagen tied with new york at nine.\n\nthe study bases its calculation on the price of at least 160 products and services including food, drink, clothing, household supplies and personal care items among others, converted to u.s. dollars.\n\nso a one-kilo loaf of bread costs $3.55 u.s. in singapore and a bottle of table wine $23.68. in paris, they were $6.81 and $10.35, respectively.\n\nin almaty, it was 90 cents for the bread and $5.15 for the wine.\n\ncheap but not always cheerful, the survey said of some of least expensive cities, which also included bangalore in india, karachi in pakistan, and algeria's algiers.\n\nnight view of the supertrees grove at gardens by the bay in central singapore, adjacent to the marina reservoir. getty images\n\nthe survey said the trend in the latest report was for a resurgence of asian cities.\n\nwith singapore on top, hong kong (second), tokyo (fourth), osaka (fifth) and seoul (sixth) in south korea also making it, the top 10 was 50 percent asian.\n\nbut the steady devaluation of the renminbi, or yuan, resulted in china's urban centers moving down the ranking by between five and 16 places each, it said.\n\na view of osaka castle in front of the city's business park. the original castle dates from 1583 and was most recently rebuilt in 1995. getty images\n\nthe survey warned that numerous difficulties faced the world economy in the year ahead and that made it difficult to predict how its findings would change.\n\non the economic front, shifts in the price of oil and other commodities were likely to impact prices, but also could trigger further austerity, causing a slow down in consumer spending in some places.\n\nequally, big political unknowns such as britain leaving the european union and u.s. president donald trump's america first policies could weigh.\n\nthe capacity for economic shocks and currency swings can make a location very expensive or very cheap very quickly, it concluded.\n\nthe list follows.\n\nmost expensive cities\n\n1) singapore\n\n2) hong kong\n\n3) zurich\n\n4) tokyo\n\n5) osaka\n\n6) seoul\n\n7) geneva\n\n7) paris\n\n9) new york\n\n9) copenhagen\n\nleast expensive cities\n\n124) new delhi\n\n124) bucharest\n\n124) kiev\n\n127) mumbai\n\n127) chennai\n\n127) algiers\n\n130) karachi\n\n131) bangalore (bengalaru)\n\n132) lagos\n\n133) almaty
pluto has long been viewed as a distant, cold and mostly dead world, but the first spacecraft to pass by it last year revealed many surprises about this distant dwarf planet.\n\ndata from the new horizons flyby finished downloading to earth in october, and while it will take many years for scientists to complete their inventory and model the results, early studies offer intriguing hints of its complex chemistry, perhaps even some form of pre-biological processes below pluto's surface. complex layers of organic haze; water ice mountains from some unknown geologic process; possible organics on the surface; and a liquid water ocean underneath -- all of these features point to a world with much more vibrancy than scientists have long presumed.\n\nanother surprise from the new horizons mission was finding water ice mountains on pluto, that quite possibly are floating on a subsurface ocean of liquid water. nasa/jhuapl/swri\n\nthe connection with astrobiology is immediate -- it's right there in front of your face. you see organic materials, water and energy, said michael summers, a planetary scientist on the new horizons team who specializes in the structure and evolution of planetary atmospheres.\n\nsummers has co-authored two research papers on the topic, with the first, the photochemistry of pluto's atmosphere as illuminated by new horizons, published in the journal icarus in september. the second paper, constraints on the microphysics of pluto's photochemical haze from new horizons observations is in press at the same journal.\n\nsticky haze\n\nin first looking at the images of pluto, summers was reminded of a world he has studied for decades while working at george mason university. titan, an icy orange colored moon of saturn, is the only moon in the solar system with a substantial atmosphere and a liquid (methane) hydrological cycle. it has hydrocarbon chemistry, including ethane and methane lakes that have compounds that may be precursors to the chemistry required for life.\n\nunlike titan, pluto's atmosphere is thin and sparse, with haze reaching out at least 125 miles above the surface, at least ten times higher than scientists expected. but above 19 miles pluto displays a similar paradox to titan with condensation happening in a region that's too warm in temperature for haze particles to occur.\n\nrelated: pluto's haze varies in brightness\n\nnasa's cassini spacecraft saw the same oddity in the highest reaches of titan's atmosphere (the ionosphere) at about 500 to 600 kilometers above the surface (roughly 310 or 370 miles). through modeling, scientists determined that the condensation is partially the result of titan's photochemistry, whereby ultraviolet sunlight breaks down methane, triggering the formation of hydrocarbons.\n\nthis haze formation is initiated in the ionosphere, where there are electrically charged particles (electrons and ions), summers said. the electrons attach to the hydrocarbons and make them stick together. they become very stable, and as they fall through the atmosphere they grow by other particles sticking to them. the bigger they are, the faster they fall. on titan, as you go down in the atmosphere the haze particles get more numerous and much larger than on pluto.\n\nin retrospect, summers said it shouldn't have been too much of a surprise that pluto likely has the same process. like titan, it has a nitrogen atmosphere with methane as a minor component. the main difference, however, is pluto's atmosphere is just 10 millibars at the surface, compared to titan's 1.5 bar. (a bar is a metric unit of pressure, with 1 bar equal to 10,000 pascal units, or slightly less than the average atmospheric pressure on earth at sea level.) the atmospheric pressure difference of the two bodies also affects the shape of the haze particles as titan's particles taking much longer to fall to the surface and ultimately become spherical, while pluto's haze particles fall more rapidly and grow into fractals.\n\nrelated: new horizons finds blue skies and water ice on pluto\n\ncomplex molecules\n\nwith the possible production of hydrocarbons and nitriles (another organic molecule) on pluto, even more interesting pre- chemistry for life could take place, summers said. you can start building complex pre-biotic molecules, he said. an example is hydrogen cyanide, possibly a key molecule leading to prebiotic chemistry.\n\nreddish hues on pluto could indicate tholins, a type of complex organic compound that may be a precursor to the chemistry of life. nasa/jhuapl/swri\n\nwhat's also abundant on titan are tholins, complex organic compounds created when the sun's ultraviolet light strikes the haze particles. it's rare on earth, but common on titan and may have contributed to its orange color. there is also a reddish hue on parts of pluto's surface, which could be from a layer of tholins, summers said.\n\nrelated: haze layers above pluto\n\nhis quick calculation estimates these tholins could be 10 to 30 meters thick, providing more organic material per square meter than a forest on earth. this material may also change its chemical composition as cosmic rays (high-energy radiation particles) strike the surface.\n\nintriguingly, reddish material was also spotted near pluto's ice volcanoes, or calderas. it's possible that the dwarf planet could have a subsurface ocean similar to that suspected on titan, saturn's enceladus and jupiter's europa. these moons, however, have a tidal source of energy within, created by orbiting their huge central planets and interacting gravitationally with other moons. pluto is bereft of such heating, but it's possible that radioactivity in its interior could be keeping the inside liquid, summers said.\n\nthese are the things you need for life: organics, raw material and energy, summers said.\n\nwhile it's a stretch right now to say pluto is hospitable for life, summers said he is looking forward to doing more modeling. i've been studying pluto all my life, and never expected to talk about these things being there.\n\noriginally published on space.com\n\neditor's recommendations
on havana's main concourse outside the newly-established u.s. embassy, three djs made history and put on a show. it seemed like every young person in havana was there to witness it, reports cbs this morning co-host charlie rose, who was there.\n\nthis wasn't the music of their parents -- it was theirs.\n\nthe music speaks for itself, diplo said. they don't know who we are. it's just the sound, the music.\n\nthey are major lazer, a trio dj's known by their stage names walshy fire, jillionaire and diplo, the group's founding member. in a free kick off concert for a musicabana festival, major lazer became the first major american group to perform in cuba since the u.s. eased relations with the caribbean's largest island.\n\nu.s. electronic music group major lazer performs at the anti-imperialist park in front of the u.s. embassy in havana, cuba, sunday, march 6, 2016. ramon espinosa/ap\n\nyou have said though this is the most important show you have ever done, rose said to diplo.\n\ni think the pressure is on us to do something, you know, it's kind of an amazing opportunity, diplo said.\n\ni also think it's very important to create something new, that's why i first started to make music you know, he added. we first started to rent old vfw halls in philly or whatever, we rented kegs and did parties and played our own music. we had to find a way to do it because nobody else was helping us, and i think now it's important to keep those dialogues happening, those parties happening. that's what we are doing here in havana.\n\ndiplo cbs news\n\ndiplo became a sought after producer by creating beats for artists like m.i.a. and new sounds for pop stars like justin bieber. this past year he and major lazer created the hit lean on, which spotify says was the most streamed song of all time.\n\ni think that that particular song, it speaks volumes because it's very worldwide. even in america, we're not a huge act by any means, major lazer, diplo said. but everywhere else in the world from turkey to china to india, that song hit people in the right way. ... south korea, jamaica, trinidad, mexico, brazil, every where we go, it was a huge hit. it just has a sound it incorporates everything for reggae to pop music...so the whole song is a bit of everything.\n\ndiplo said to get people's attention these days on the radio, you have to have a revolutionary sound.\n\npeople are culturally aware. they've heard a lot of music. the fans are out there and they are ready for something brand new, they're ready for something chaotic and exciting, diplo said.\n\non a drive down the very street that became his stage, we found out why diplo may be dance music's busiest man.\n\nabout a week ago, we came from india to pakistan, he said.\n\nhe plays more than 300 shows a year across the globe, striving to constantly push electronic dance music forward.\n\ni think it's important to play in places like this where the music is still brand new. these are the guys who are going to change it, diplo said. the kids in havana, the kids in pakistan, the kids in india -- they're the ones who are going to bring it to a new level.\n\nare they playlists? or is it spontaneous? rose asked about the spin sessions.\n\nsometimes. depends. our show when we have the lighting cues, we have to keep it formatted to a set list, but lots of times we just go off on a tangent, diplo explained. if the crowd wants this, i'll go that way, if they want this, i'll go that way. i'll try and push it as far as i can.\n\nand you can feel them, rose said.\n\nthat's the whole job of a dj. you have to feel that rhythm, diplo said.\n\nto feel the crowd, rose said.\n\nexactly, diplo responded.\n\nand does it differ when you go from country to country? rose asked.\n\na hundred percent, diplo said.\n\ndiplo with cbs this morning co-host charlie rose riding around cuba cbs news\n\nthere was certainly rhythm on hand in havana, with little talk of politics. it was, after all, a government-approved concert.\n\nbut in place of diplomacy, there was melody.\n\neveryone says they want to see cuba before it changes, but if this weekend was any indication -- the change is underway.\n\nthere is a sense that somehow this is an important time for these young cubans for them to feel connected to the world, not isolated, rose said.\n\nit's the first time they are getting connected, diplo said. i was surprised by how much they knew. how culturally aware the kids are considering there is kind of a blockade of culture reaching cuba ... and i think it's going to change a lot, because when information starts to come you can't stop that flow.
the wounded warrior project is working to rebuild trust with its donors and veterans.\n\nthe veterans charity group fired ceo steven nardizzi and coo al giordano late last week, following a january cbs news investigation that reported on dozens of former employees who described lavish spending on conferences, meetings and parties.\n\nafter subsequently conducting its own review and speaking with former and current employees, chairman anthony odierno said the board felt it was best for the organization to make a change in the leadership.\n\nodierno, who has been on the board of directors since 2009 and serving as chairman since 2014, is now leading the search for a permanent chief executive.\n\nit opened opportunities for us to strengthen some policies, to strengthen some controls around expenses so we will do that, odierno said on cbs this morning monday. and we also felt that there were certain judgment decisions that could've been made better, which is why we ultimately decided that a change should be made.\n\nfrom public records, cbs news found that the charity spent only 60 percent of donations on vets. odierno disputed the figure, claiming the organization spends about 80 percent. but that number includes expenses spent on promotional items, direct response advertising and postage costs, which charity watch groups do not consider programming.\n\nodierno defended the spending, saying, raising awareness is a very important part of our mission and it's always been an important part of our our mission and i think that's what connects the american people with our service men and women who are coming back.\n\nsince its initial investigation, cbs news' investigative producers have now spoken with nearly 100 former wounded warriors project employees. many expressed fear of speaking out about lavish spending and a toxic culture, and several say they were fired for doing so. odierno admitted that the workplace culture was a factor in the board's decision for a new leadership.\n\nodierno, a retired u.s. army captain himself, received help from the wounded warriors project when he was injured in 2004. as it had done for him, he said the charity group was now getting its focus solely back on serving our wounded warriors, their caregivers and their families.\n\nodierno has put together a committee to conduct the search for a new chief executive.\n\nwe're going to consider any and all candidates that we think is the best fit for this organization and will keep this organization forward and serving the needs to come because the thing about those who have been wounded is they're going to be living, in many cases, with these injuries for 10, 20 and 30 years, and wounded warrior project needs to be there to serve them, odierno said.
it's time for plastic surgery enthusiasts to come out of the closet. at least, according to iggy azalea.\n\ni think, in 2016, people should be more accepting of the fact that both famous and non-famous women are having cosmetic procedures, she told elle canada during an interview. that's just the reality. and i think more people need to admit that s--t so it doesn't have to be so taboo -- because we're all doing it anyway.\n\nat least she practices what she preaches. the australian rapper is now more than happy to discuss the work she has had done to her own nose.\n\ni wanted to change my nose because i didn't grow up with a bump on it--that happened when i got smashed in the face with a soccer ball when i was 16, she said. now i feel like my nose looks the way it's supposed to look.
president trump sent a tweet wednesday morning announcing that he has ordered the federal emergency management agency not to send funding to california to assist in the aftermath of deadly wildfires.\n\nbillions of dollars are sent to the state of california for forest fires that, with proper forest management, would never happen, mr. trump wrote. unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, i have ordered fema to send no more money. it is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\n\nmr. trump has long claimed that the wildfires which have plagued california were a result of forest mismanagement, instead of the scientifically accepted theory that climate change is impacting the acceleration of forest fires in the state. he has also said that the finnish president told him that finland did not have forest fires because its citizens spent time raking the forest floor, although the finnish president denied ever talking to mr. trump about raking.\n\ncalifornia faced its deadliest wildfire season this past year, with the camp fire and the woolsey fire destroying thousands of homes and burning through hundreds of thousands of acres. mr. trump visited california in november to tour the devastation with then-gov. jerry brown and gov.-elect gavin newsom, during which he promised that the federal government would continue to support the state in the face of these deadly wildfires.\n\nhowever, newsom has been harshly critical of mr. trump since taking office this week. he signed two executive orders related to wildfire management, and joined a partnership with the governors of oregon and washington asking for double the current federal funding to manage forestlands in their states.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi, who represents a district in california, condemned mr. trump's tweet wednesday, calling it a threat insults the memory of scores of americans who perished in wildfires last year & thousands more who lost their homes. she called on house minority leader kevin mccarthy, also of california, to join her to condemn & call on potus to reassure millions in ca that our govt will be there for them in their time of need.\n\nmccarthy has not yet responded to mr. trump's tweet.
cbs news is recognizing people who are trying to right injustices and bring communities together in a new series, unifying america. cbs evening news got a look at the museum of the courageous, a nonprofit that honors those who stand up to hate.\n\nyears ago, a class of fifth-grade students marched into california's state capitol to testify and rewrite their history books. now, as we honor the memory of martin luther king jr., those students are receiving a special award for taking dr. king's message of racial justice to heart.\n\nnow 16, nicole sandavol was one of the fifth-graders fighting to have their textbooks tell the missing story of the mass deportations of mexican americans in the 1930s. she and her fellow students are among the first nine honorees of the museum of the courageous — a new, online nonprofit that highlights those who stand up to hate.\n\nas fifth graders, the students testified about their history books. cbs news\n\nwhat we're trying to do is build a group of people compelled and inspired and ready to stand up to hate, said teresa vazquez, the museum's executive director and founding trustee.\n\nthe story of the courageous class really offers us inspiration and a pathway forward, vazquez added.\n\nother members of the courageous class include vernon dahmer, a mississippi civil rights leader who was murdered by the kkk as he fought for black citizens to freely vote; and pauli murray, a priest and pioneer for gender and racial equality.\n\nwhen asked how she hopes her story will inspire unity in the nation, sandavol said that i think that everyone in this country should feel that they belong, that they matter, and that their voice is valued.
apple (aapl) has sold a lot of iphones since introducing the novel smartphone to the u.s. market in 2007. but after eight generations and about 900 million sold, could it be that demand is finally flaming out? apple's latest earnings report certainly has people talking that way.\n\ndespite concerns about slowing demand, the iphone remains as popular as ever. according to a reuters/ipsos poll, 86 percent of iphone owners were somewhat or very likely to buy another one. of those likely to buy a phone, 15 percent are currently looking to upgrade, and 17 percent will do so when the next iphone is released, according to the january poll.\n\nif you're weighing an upgrade, you may be wondering which iphone to choose or whether to wait for the iphone 7, rumored to debut in september.\n\nit's, as they say, complicated.\n\ncurrently, apple sells four iphone models: the iphone 5s (introduced in 2013); the iphone 6 and larger 6 plus (2014); and the 6s and 6s plus, which went on sale last fall. the newest models, of course, offer the latest features (and cost the most), but you may not need all the bells and whistles that come with the latest models.\n\nso, comparing features may help you save money. for example, the cheapest version of the recently introduced iphone 6s costs $649. compared to the older iphone 5s, which despite being out for more than two years remains competitive, the 6s has a more powerful processor, a better camera lens and 3d touch, which senses the amount of pressure applied to the display. but if you can live without those features, you'll save $199.\n\nadding to consumer confusion is speculation that apple will soon roll out an updated version of the iphone 5s -- the iphone 5se -- that would sell for less than the top-of-the-line 6s model. the 5se, which includes many updates over the 5s, reportedly is aimed at the millions of 5s users who haven't upgraded to newer models, in part because they like the smaller size of the 5s.\n\naccording to the rumors, the 5se will keep the same 4-inch screen of the 5s and maintain other similarities that would possibly allow 5s users, for example, to keep their current protective case. that would remove one impediment to getting consumers to upgrade -- the cost of new accessories, which can easily boost the price of new phone by $40, $50 or much more.\n\nalso weighing on consumers' minds are any changes apple may be planning that could alter the way users charge or connect to other devices. many iphone fans expressed outrage after apple switched to its new lightning dock connector in 2012 with the iphone 5. the new connector replaced a 30-pin connector that had been used for nine years. the new, much smaller plug allowed apple to build thinner iphones and was easier to use, apple explained.\n\nbut some consumers saw it as a conspiracy, suggesting apple made the switch to boost sales of pricey adapters that consumers would need to use older accessories. fortunately for iphone fans who may be considering upgrading soon, there's no indication that apple plans any similar change.\n\nof course, it's the hefty cost of the phone itself that has many consumers weighing whether to upgrade. that wasn't always case. until recently, all the major carriers subsidized the cost of a new phone as long as you were willing to sign -- in most cases -- a two-year contract. for iphone buyers, that meant you could get the latest iphone for as little as $199 (plus taxes and fees).\n\nbut verizon (vz), sprint (s) and others have abandoned the subsidized-phone model, leaving iphone fans to foot the full bill should they choose to upgrade (though monthly payment plans are available). at&t (t) remains the only major carrier with a subsidy program.\n\nwhether to upgrade your iphone ultimately is a personal choice that's often driven by other than pragmatic considerations -- not unlike buying a new car. chances are, however, if you own an iphone 5s or 6, you can probably wait to upgrade. then again, if you're a follower of fashion, don't overlook that new rose gold color iphone. wouldn't that just look sweet on your nightstand?
how secure is the data you share over your home wi-fi connection? not as secure as you might think, according to experts. software bugs in ubiquitous devices like internet routers can leave your personal information at risk to hackers. as we continue to move into an ever-more-connected age, everything from smartphones to web-connected printers could expose personal data in ways you might not realize.\n\nsix years ago, for the first time ever, the number of internet-connected devices surpassed the number of people in the world, according to a 2015 report from the federal trade commission. by 2020, there will be an estimated 50 billion connected devices, and by that same year, 90 percent of consumer cars will be connected to the internet. the ftc warned that while so many companies are creating products for the internet of things -- everything from smart kitchen appliances to children's toys -- they may not have experience dealing with security.\n\nthe wall street journal recently commissioned a cybersecurity expert to test 20 new home internet routers and found half had outdated firmware (the program that runs the device) with security flaws, including several with known problems that had not been patched.\n\nin one example cited by the journal, in 2014 engineers at software company allegro software development corp. discovered that router manufacturers had been churning out devices for years using old allegro software instead of a newer version that was updated to fix a security bug. without the security update, the routers put millions of consumers' internet connections at risk of being hacked.\n\ndevices that contain software that is not up to date to plug known security flaws is an all-too-common problem.\n\nthis kind of thing is not new at all, peter tran, gm and senior director at the network security company rsa, told cbs news. but he says it's becoming an increasingly serious concern as more people work remotely and share data over wi-fi.\n\ntran said that out of the roughly 4.6 billion workers in the world, 20 percent telecommute at least part-time. that means there are a lot of people going online in their living rooms, not to mention opening their laptops in coffee shops or airports, sharing data over wi-fi connections that could be compromised. even password-protected home connections can be vulnerable if they're not kept up to date with security patches.\n\nis this a concern that a lot of people should have? yes. is it a concern that a lot of people actually have? no, tran said.\n\nit's easy to get in that mentality. the verizon cable person sets you up and they will do everything for you and all they care about is getting you on the web as fast as possible. the average consumer has their network's broadcast id and access point easily accessible. all the settings are on the router, they could configure their own firewall, they could do what they need to secure themselves, but that isn't something they realize, he said.\n\nwhether the circuit board of your router is outdated is dependent on the manufacturer and the overall consumer supply chain that churns out these devices. the wall street journal notes that manufacturers don't have much motivation to keep sending updates for older routers.\n\nnow that we live in an era of the smart home, with hybrid routers that accommodate television, phone, personal internet access, and other connected devices, tran stressed that it's important that the average consumer remain vigilant.\n\nanything that needs a connection to an internet, anything that is 'smart,' is natively unsecure by default. there's going to be a risk, no matter where you are, tran explained. the way we deliver data now -- through the cloud, for instance -- needs greater and greater access points wherever you go. other than your laptop and your device, the huge risk as far as being able to access the core of where your data is residing is the internet access point. the bigger threat, to me, is how we as individual users are becoming the hub with spokes for would-be cyber criminals to traverse across a multitude of access points.\n\nso, what can people do to protect themselves and their private data? tran said that there are some good internet hygiene practices to keep in mind. first, you should ask your service provider whether the firmware, the permanent software programmed into your router's read-only memory, is up to date. the second is to check out what wireless encryption your provider is using. thirdly, you should restrict your internet access point from being discovered outside. for instance, you don't want john doe's internet to be broadcast widely for all to see.\n\ntran said one basic step that most people neglect to take is to set up a complex password that will be tough for hackers to crack. instead of something easy like jon123, make sure your password is more involved, and be sure to change it every 90 days, which he stressed decreases the risk that your connection will become compromised.\n\nwhen going online, make sure your device is communicating directly with your router. tran says you want to make sure you're using your own internet access and not going through someone else's connection by mistake.\n\nhe also offered this food for thought: more and more the problem is the printed circuit board industry itself. roughly 88 percent of all circuit board manufacturers, those that make routers, for instance, are in asia. they are in china, japan, south korea, and taiwan. now, 42 percent of those are all manufactured in mainland china, tran said. there's a lot of debate right now about the source of state-sponsored cyber attacks, corporate espionage.\n\ntran said that while many people worry about where their food is sourced, they take their electronics for granted.\n\npeople look for non-gmo, fair-trade-and-sourced food products, he said. they should do the same thing with the tools they use for their internet connections.
los angeles -- the most famous party house in the world -- the playboy mansion -- is said to be going up for sale. the asking price? a hef-ty sum.\n\nfrom the sky, or on the grounds, the playboy mansion is the picture of elegance. but for decades, the insides were less than stately.\n\nhugh hefner bought the playboy mansion in 1971 for $1.1 million. now, playboy enterprises is said to be looking for nearly 200 times that much.\n\ni think that is a stretch, but this street certainly supports $50 million, maybe $60 million, said greg harris who specializes in los angeles's luxury real estate.\n\nharris said the house appraises for about $35 million. but he acknowledges there is added historical value to the 22,000 square foot holmby hills home, like graceland, or michael jackson's neverland.\n\nbut there is a catch: the buyer has to agree to a roommate, hefner himself.\n\nhefner would be able to stay in the house until he dies, said harris. we haven't seen it at that price point ever happen before. it happens from time to time.\n\nwith that kind of asking price, harris said a corporation or international investor would be the next likely owner.\n\nit's pools, it's grottos. its'a a pretty big property, a lot to maintain, said harris. it's an entertainer's home.\n\nso while the names of the mansion's title may change, its reputation for excess could likely live on, which might be exactly what certain buyers are looking for.
global stock markets were falling fast after the federal reserve cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero sunday evening to help blunt the economic damage from the fast-spreading novel coronavirus. fed chairman jerome powell called the actions strong measures but the emergency rate cut — the second in two weeks and an unusually large one-percentage-point cut, at that — seemed to unnerve investors.\n\nstock-market futures indicated the dow jones industrial average and the s&p 500 would be sharply lower when stocks begin trading in the u.s. on monday morning. those futures began dropping almost immediately after the fed announced the rate cut on sunday. the central bank also said it was upping what's known as purchases of treasuries and other bonds by $700 billion, a policy known as quantitative easing, to encourage lending by financial institutions.\n\nthe fed's latest move does not change our expectation that the economy will slow dramatically in the near term, rubeela farooqi, chief u.s. economist with high frequency economics, told investors in a report after the fed's rate cut.\n\nstocks cratered in europe, with shares in paris plummeting 9%, spain 8.7%, frankfurt 7.8 percent and london and milan 7.6%, according to agence france-presse.\n\non asian markets, shares in hong kong were down more than 4%, china's mainland shanghai exchange index lost 3.4% and japan's nikkei index was 2.5 lower in tokyo, despite moves by the central bank there to prop up the economy, afp said.\n\nstocks in australia nosedived 9.7%, indicating investors there are concerned the coronavirus will continue to slow economic activity in china as well as throughout the region.\n\nsome wall street economists were optimistic that the fed's emergency moves could save the economy from sinking into a prolonged recession, and even spur a market rebound later this year.\n\nbroad fiscal spending and rate cuts are blunt instruments for dealing with the short-term economic impact of the virus, but should provide investors with some confidence that growth can be strong once the recovery gets underway, mark haefele, a chief investment officer at ubs's wealth management division, said. we expect the market to end the year at much higher levels than today.\n\nbut that optimism was not widely shared. bank of america's top u.s. economist, michelle meyer, predicted sunday that the fed's moves would be not be enough to arrest an economic slide driven by restrictions on public activity.\n\nbusinesses are shutting doors globally and households are moving into quarantine, meyer wrote in a note to clients on sunday night. we are already forecasting negative gdp growth in the second quarter but the risk is that it proves to be a much deeper and more prolonged contraction in economic activity.
sen. elizabeth warren, one of the many democrats running for president in 2020, spoke at the alejandro tapia y rivera theater in san juan, puerto rico, tuesday evening, bringing her populist economic message the embattled american territory. warren addressed the hardships puerto rico has endured in the past two years, particularly its debt crisis and the recovery in the aftermath of hurricane maria.\n\npuerto rico has not been treated with respect, warren said. around 3,000 people died in the aftermath of maria, and the federal government's response to hurricanes harvey and irma on the mainland was faster and more generous — in terms of resources and funds — than its assistance to puerto rico before and in the aftermath of hurricane maría, according to a newly released study. she called for the resignation or firing of fema administrator brock long.\n\nwarren also addressed reports that president trump is mulling calling a national emergency and using disaster funding to pay for a border wall.\n\nback when he was running for office, donald trump promised that mexico would pay for this wall. now he thinks that the people of puerto rico who are struggling to get back on their feet should get stuck with the bill instead, warren said, calling the wall dumb. puerto rico has suffered enough. we will not allow anyone to sabotage your recovery – not even the president of the united states.\n\nshe also said that she supports the creation of a commission to look at the federal government's response to maria.\n\ni've called for an independent, 9/11-style commission to understand how and why washington's response to these hurricanes was so inadequate—and to make sure nothing like this ever, ever happens again, she said.\n\nwarren also discussed puerto rico's $70 billion in federal debt and $50 billion in pension obligations. if puerto rico were a corporation or an american city, she said, it would be able to file for bankruptcy. however, an unelected oversight board was put in place by the puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act in 2016. this year, the board proposed cuts to almost one-third of the government budget in six years, which would affect subsidies to municipal governments and university tuition.\n\nin response, warren has proposed a territorial relief act for puerto rico, and said she would support marshall plan-style investment in puerto rico and the virgin islands.\n\nwarren argued that puerto rico has not received enough respect, and that respect begins with allowing the territory to decide upon its relationship to the united states.\n\nrespect for puerto rico means that you have the right to determine the nature of your association with the united states. puerto rico deserves self-determination on this question, and i will support the decision of the people of puerto rico, warren said.\n\nshe also argued that her anti-corruption act would clean up washington, and by extension help puerto rico.\n\nwashington works great for the wall street bankers who want bailouts, tax cuts, and no regulations, but not for the people right here in puerto rico, she said.\n\nwe believe that when we come together, we can build a government that reflects our best values, warren said at the end of her speech. one based on respect. one where we dream big and fight hard. and when we do that, i know that we can make real change.
washington — more descriptions of the heated exchanges between president trump and congressional democratic leaders during their two-hour meeting friday are emerging — and the partial government shutdown wasn't the only topic on mr. trump's mind. though the president later described the meetings over border security as productive, democratic leaders told reporters afterward that the discussions had been contentious.\n\naccording to a source familiar with the meeting, mr. trump initiated the talks – held for the second time this week in the white house situation room – by lambasting the shutdown impasse and again demanding $5.6 billion for border security, which he declared to be the minimum figure he needed to build the southern border wall he has been promising since his presidential campaign.\n\nbut democratic leaders, house speaker nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer, again refused to consider that number. the president then told them he was willing to continue to the shutdown for months or even years unless the democrats agreed to what he says is crucial funding for the southern border.\n\ni did say that. absolutely, i said that, mr, trump later confirmed at a press conference, when cbs news' major garrett asked him if he had in fact told them that he'd keep the government shut for years.\n\nduring the meeting, mr. trump also brought up the topic of impeachment, railing against calls by some democrats to impeach him, according to a source familiar with the exchange.\n\nwhy does everyone want to impeach me, nancy? mr. trump asked.\n\nno one wants to impeach you, pelosi told the president and tried to move the focus of the meeting back to border security. although one freshman democrat, rashida tlaib, had said of the president to a group of progressives this week, we're going to impeach the motherf*****.\n\nmr. trump also tried unsuccessfully to appeal to pelosi's roman catholic faith in arguing for wall funding.\n\nthe vatican has walls. the vatican has walls surrounding the city, mr. trump said, according to the source. you like the vatican, nancy?\n\nlet's change the subject, sir, pelosi replied.\n\nit was not the first time the president has brought up the vatican walls as a comparison in their discussions, administration sources said. the president mentioned the vatican during their meeting earlier in the week, too.\n\na source familiar with the exchange said the president respects pelosi and was just kidding with her to make a point. but she seemed to take the comment not well.\n\npelosi and homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen also had a contentious interaction over the border security facts that nielsen presented during the meeting, an administration official confirmed. as she did during an earlier meeting in the week, pelosi interrupted nielsen's presentation and challenged facts she cited about the southwest border.\n\nthese aren't my facts, nielsen replied. they are just facts.\n\nstaff-level negotiations involving vice president mike pence are expected to continue through the weekend as the partial government shutdown enters its third week.\n\nrebecca kaplan and nancy cordes contributed to this report.
los angeles -- training athletes used to be pretty simple. all you really needed was a stopwatch, a whistle and a clipboard. nowadays, the nfl is blurring the lines between men and machine.\n\nted rath is the conditioning coach for the l.a. rams.\n\nwe look at how much mileage you've put in the car, he said. we all know that after certain mileage, we've got to make an oil change.\n\nbecause of that, the rams rely on the same technology that tracks shipments and targets shoplifters. a microchip the size of a nickel is now embedded in every game ball, as well as in the shoulder pads of 300-pound linemen.\n\nmicrochips are being used to track football players' movements cbs news\n\njohn pollard, the vice president of zebra technologies, which is the company that produces the tracking chips, showed us how the technology works. every movement is tracked, and plotted, as is each player's precise position. when the pros suit up and the virtual becomes real, more than a third of the league's teams are using the technology.\n\nrath told us the chips show how high quarterbacks throw and how fast players are running.\n\nwe can say he's fatigued, he said. alright, why is he fatigued? within this data, this can tell me when he hits that fatigued state, when he recovers from it and how hard he's able to work so we can push him right to that level so we can actually make him a better-conditioned athlete.\n\ncarter evans tries out new technology that tracks football players, with john pollard cbs news\n\nrath says a good example this season is todd gurley. while most players tire as the season wears on, the data showed the running back got faster.\n\nrath showed us footage of gurley on a touchdown run.\n\nthis was actually the very play where he hit 21.1 miles an hour on that specific play, he explains.\n\nit seems like you could really geek out on all these numbers, we told rath.\n\nno question, he responded. prove us right, prove us wrong, shock us. sometimes the data shocks you.\n\none thing the chips do not yet measure is the impact of a collision between players. that technology exists, and it can be put in a helmet. but the nfl has not requested that data. the league has already faced a major class action lawsuit over concussions.
americans will spend nearly $20 billion this valentine's day and millennials are shelling out the most. on average, they will spend about $200 on cards, gifts, and other celebrations. with many of that generation growing tired of impersonal text messages and social media posts, greeting card companies are seeing an opportunity, reports cbs news' meg oliver.\n\nwe should throw a party…but let's not invite anyone else, reads one card. i love that one little thing you do…you know, existing, reads another. easy, tiger's cards aren't exactly your grandmother's greeting card. no flowery designs and sappy messages that have long been a staple of card aisles.\n\nmike sayre and melanie bridges started their company, easy, tiger, in 2013. they wanted to strike a more casual and ironic tone with a new kind of card.\n\nsell greeting cards to people who weren't looking to buy greeting cards, bridges said.\n\nbut how does that work?\n\nif we can inspire the people to send a card….when they don't have to the relationship gets stronger, people value it more. and so we had to change a lot of things in order to do it. and so part of that was vending machines, sayre explained.\n\nhe said the idea was about bringing the product to where the people were – like coffee shops.\n\nat quay coffee in kansas city, missouri, they tucked their first bright green vending machine into the corner.\n\nbought off craigslist, sayre and bridges refurbished and repurposed vintage snack machines to sell their cards around town.\n\nwe want them to feel real conversational. so i like to observe people, sayre said. observe the way that they say things and put little twists on it.\n\n\n\ngone are the holiday-specific captions. bridges is in charge of the artistic vision while sayre writes the messages.\n\n\n\nactually, our best-selling card today is: 'help me understand. how are we so much better than everyone else?' and so people love to have that experience of together we're awesome, sayre said.\n\nmike sayre and melanie bridges cbs news\n\na sentiment they believe appeals to a younger generation.\n\ni feel like it's part of that kind of casual, ironic kind of sense of humor that a lot of millennials have, sayre said.\n\npeter doherty, who leads the industry's trade organization, said companies like easy, tiger have absolutely filled a void.\n\nthe way that the cards speak to you have changed. the snarky movement is connected in many ways to millennials, he said. the bigger companies, they have seen what the millennials are doing and what smaller companies are doing in general and they are learning from that.\n\nmore than 6.5 billion greeting cards are still sold a year, but the industry's revenue is declining.\n\nlindsey roy is hallmark's chief marketing officer. she says, in terms of card spending, millennials are the fastest growing group because when they buy cards, they spend more money on them.\n\nwe've seen that millennials are really growing into that magic life stage for card sending, roy said. maybe you're setting up households or having kids or doing the kinds of things that really just expand your relationships.\n\nalthough you won't see it anywhere on their cards, easy, tiger is fully funded by hallmark, launched out of a project to target millennials.\n\nemily mcdowell reads her first attempt at creating an authentic greeting card. cbs news\n\nmillennials as a group are seeking cards that speak to them in a more authentic way, said emily mcdowell, an independent card company founder.\n\nher first attempt at an authentic greeting card read more like an awkward text message.\n\nit read: i know we're not, like, together or anything but it felt weird to just not say anything so i got you this card. it's not a big deal. it doesn't really mean anything. there isn't even a heart on it. so basically it's a card saying hi. forget it.\n\n\n\nnow her biggest customers, women 25 to 34, can buy cards that feel and sound more like them.\n\ni think millennials are revitalizing the industry, she said. we want a card to be kind of a stand in for what the best version of our self would say, and so i think that you know the more that we can speak to millennials, the more they'll buy them.\n\nit might also surprise you millennials are not just buying cards at a record pace. even in this digital age, 80 percent of millennials are holding onto their cards as keepsakes.\n\ncbs news' meg oliver reported live from papyrus in manhattan.
gay talese made his name as a leader of the new journalism movement, in which the boundaries of traditional reporting were broken with vivid, novelistic accounts of the reporters' subjects.\n\nbloomsbury\n\none of the most acclaimed examples of this style was talese's april 1966 esquire article, frank sinatra has a cold, a deeply-revealing profile of the singer, made even more remarkable in that sinatra would not grant talese an interview.\n\ninstead, the writer sought out dozens of people who knew the superstar best, making for a revealing and artfully-written portrait of a cultural icon.\n\nwhat follows is an excerpt from frank sinatra has a cold, just one of the pieces collected in a new anthology, high notes: selected writings of gay talese, published by bloomsbury press.\n\n\n\n\n\ndon't miss rita braver's interview with gay talese on cbs' sunday morning february 19!\n\n\n\nfrank sinatra, holding a glass of bourbon in one hand and a cigarette in the other, stood in a dark corner of the bar between two attractive but fading blondes who sat waiting for him to say something. but he said nothing; he had been silent during much of the evening, except now in this private club in beverly hills he seemed even more distant, staring out through the smoke and semidarkness into a large room beyond the bar where dozens of young couples sat huddled around small tables or twisted in the center of the floor to the clamorous clang of folk-rock music blaring from the stereo. the two blondes knew, as did sinatra's four male friends who stood nearby, that it was a bad idea to force conversation upon him when he was in this mood of sullen silence, a mood that had hardly been uncommon during this first week of november, a month before his fiftieth birthday.\n\nsinatra had been working in a film that he now disliked, could not wait to finish; he was tired of all the publicity attached to his dating the twenty-year-old mia farrow, who was not in sight tonight; he was angry that a cbs television documentary of his life, to be shown in two weeks, was reportedly prying into his privacy, even speculating on his possible friendship with mafia leaders; he was worried about his starring role in an hour-long nbc show entitled sinatra -- a man and his music, which would require that he sing eighteen songs with a voice that at this particular moment, just a few nights before the taping was to begin, was weak and sore and uncertain. sinatra was ill. he was the victim of an ailment so common that most people would consider it trivial. but when it gets to sinatra it can plunge him into a state of anguish, deep depression, panic, even rage. frank sinatra had a cold.\n\nsinatra with a cold is picasso without paint, ferrari without fuel -- only worse. for the common cold robs sinatra of that uninsurable jewel, his voice, cutting into the core of his confidence, and it affects not only his own psyche but also seems to cause a kind of psychosomatic nasal drip within dozens of people who work for him, drink with him, love him, depend on him for their own welfare and stability. a sinatra with a cold can, in a small way, send vibrations through the entertainment industry and beyond as surely as a president of the united states, suddenly sick, can shake the national economy.\n\nfor frank sinatra was now involved with many things involving many people -- his own film company, his record company, his private airline, his missile-parts firm, his real-estate holdings across the nation, his personal staff of seventy-five -- which are only a portion of the power he is and has come to represent. he seemed now to be also the embodiment of the fully emancipated male, perhaps the only one in america, the man who can do anything he wants, anything, can do it because he has money, the energy, and no apparent guilt. in an age when the very young seem to be taking over, protesting and picketing and demanding change, frank sinatra survives as a national phenomenon, one of the few prewar products to withstand the test of time. he is the champ who made the big comeback, the man who had everything, lost it, then got it back, letting nothing stand in his way, doing what few men can do: he uprooted his life, left his family, broke with everything that was familiar, learning in the process that one way to hold a woman is not to hold her. now he has the affection of nancy and ava and mia, the fine female produce of three generations, and still has the adoration of his children, the freedom of a bachelor, he does not feel old, he makes old men feel young, makes them think that if frank sinatra can do it, it can be done; not that they could do it, but it is still nice for other men to know, at fifty, that it can be done.\n\nfrom high notes: selected writings of gay talese. copyright (c) 2016 by gay talese. reproduced by permission of bloomsbury press. all rights reserved.\n\n\n\nfor more info:
ellen degeneres and alicia keys are standing behind a black teenager from texas who was told that he would not walk at graduation this spring if he doesn't cut his dreadlocks.\n\ndeandre arnold, an 18-year-old student at barber hills high school in mont belvieu, was told he won't be able to participate in his graduation ceremony unless he cuts his dreadlocks, which fall past his shoulders.\n\nthe school's policy states that male students' hair must not extend below the top of a t-shirt collar, below the eyebrows, or below the ear lobes when let down.\n\nafter the policy controversy gained steam across the country, arnold was invited to appear on the ellen show on wednesday.\n\ni'm here for you, degeneres said.\n\nyou get good grades. you've never been in trouble, ever, degeneres said. this is the first time anything has come up. and now, you haven't been in school for weeks because of this situation.\n\ndegeneres then asked arnold if there were girls at his school with long hair.\n\nthere's plenty of girls with long hair at my school, he responded. if girls can have long hair, why can't i have long hair?\n\ndegeneres said that was the point of her question and that she did not think the policy was fair.\n\ni just personally think you should be able to wear your hair however you want, especially if there's girls with long hair, she said. what's the difference if girls have long hair and if guys have long hair?\n\narnold, who has worn dreadlocks since he was in seventh grade, said he styles his hair this way because of his father's culture.\n\nit's really important to me because my dad is from trinidad, it's part of our culture and heritage. i really wish the school would kind of be open to other cultures and just, at least let us try to tell you some things. don't just shut us out.\n\narnold's mom thinks it's an issue of race.\n\nthere's no people of color on the school board, she told cbs this morning earlier this month. they don't understand about his hair.\n\nhowever, superintendent gregory poole said the decision is not about race or the style of his hair, it's just about the length and abiding by a 30-year rule.\n\nwe'd love to see deandre back in class, and there's no way we would inhibit him from graduating. but we are gonna be fair to the 6,200 other kids that have to comply by the same policy, poole told cbs this morning.\n\ndeandre arnold\n\narnold told degeneres that if he goes back to school, he faces in-school suspension or alternative school, where students who misbehave are sent.\n\ni've worked for this all my life, he told degeneres. i deserve this moment to walk across stage.\n\ndegeneres then called alicia keys on to the set to surprise the aspiring veterinarian with a check for $20,000 to go toward his college education. the audience erupted in cheers and applause.\n\ni want to tell you that, i couldn't believe the story when i heard it, keys told arnold. i'm super proud of you for standing up for what you know is right. and i know that the school needs to do the right thing.\n\ndegeneres then faced the camera to plead with officials to change their minds.\n\ni am begging you. this kid is a good kid. he deserves to graduate, to walk with all the other kids, she said. he's a good guy. i just am urging you to do the right thing. please, change your mind.
in this episode of intelligence matters, retired admiral sandy winnefeld speaks with retired general philip breedlove, former nato supreme allied commander, europe and commander of u.s. european command, about the trajectories of the united states' relationships with north korea, china, russia, europe, and other adversaries and partners. breedlove addresses the leadership characteristics and regional objectives of each nation and assesses u.s. engagement to date. he and winnefeld also discuss the u.s. military's capabilities and readiness for potential confrontation with key adversaries. breedlove reflects on his career at all levels of the u.s. air force.\n\ndownload, rate and subscribe here: itunes, spotify and stitcher.\n\nhighlights:\n\nu.s. engagement with north korea: it remains problematic. we have had people tell us for a long time that the hermit kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. and i guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, 'how's that working out for us?' the north continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. and they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with south korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations.\n\nit remains problematic. we have had people tell us for a long time that the hermit kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. and i guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, 'how's that working out for us?' the north continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. and they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with south korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations. russia and putin: i think mr. putin is a man who has grown up a proud russian. he grew up in the kgb. he did not like the way the cold war ended. he felt like that russia was not at the table when the post-cold war order was sort of set. and he felt like russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. and he's determined to get russia back at the table on determining the path of europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in syria and in north africa. [...]. mr. putin has never been paid officially more than an army or air force lieutenant colonel. he's been a public servant all his life. and yet he's one of the richest men in the world. this is a kleptocrat who has been extracting wealth from that nation and he doesn't want to lose that wealth stream. so i think you've got on one side, a proud russian that believes russia was snubbed and should be a major power. and on the other side, there's a man that really likes the stream of money that comes from his position.\n\ni think mr. putin is a man who has grown up a proud russian. he grew up in the kgb. he did not like the way the cold war ended. he felt like that russia was not at the table when the post-cold war order was sort of set. and he felt like russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. and he's determined to get russia back at the table on determining the path of europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in syria and in north africa.

[...]. we have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. and so i do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. we need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it.\n\ndownload, rate and subscribe here: itunes, spotify and stitcher.\n\nintelligence matters – gen. philip breedlove\n\ncorrespondent: amd. sandy winnefeld\n\nproducer: olivia gazis, jamie benson\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwelcome to intelligence matters with michael morell. i'm retired admiral sandy winnefeld, filling in for michael while he's on travel. our guest today is retired air force general phil breedlove, who served as the 17th supreme allied commander of europe and as the commander of u.s.-european command.\n\nborn in georgia, he attended georgia tech and was commissioned through their rotc program. he flew f-16s in both europe and asia and also served as the vice chief of staff of the air force. my close association with and deep admiration for phil began when we were fraternity brothers at georgia tech.\n\ni'm fond of saying that, at the time, people expected phil to succeed. phil is recognized as being one of our most effective, if not our most effective, supreme allied commanders of nato and has done a lot in his public and private life to point out the danger represented by vladimir putin and the russian federation. since he retired he's assumed a variety of roles in business and has also taught at the sam nunn school of international affairs at his alma mater. phil, welcome to intelligence matters.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nsandy, it's great to be here with you. and i look forward to our conversation.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwell, we have a lot to cover today. before we get into talking a bit about europe and asia, the title of this program is, of course, intelligence matters. can you give me a sense, as a long-serving air force officer, former four-star general in several key positions, of how you interacted with and depended on the world of intelligence?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nwell, as you know, having also been a pilot in your career, in the early more tactical part of my career, it was all about, how was i going to prepare for my mission? what was the intelligence required to get to a target, deliver a weapon, etcetera? a very tactical look.\n\nand that obviously, through the years, changed. as the vice chief of staff of the air force, begin to look at what intelligence told me about the requirements that we had to make to shape our air force. and then finally, i don't have to tell you that in my role as the saceur and as the commander of u.s.-european command, and trying to shape policy and the reactions of 28 nations in nato, intelligence was key. and having not only an understanding of what u.s. intelligence was, but what the intelligence that was agreed to by all 28 nations, what that was, and the problems and opportunities it generated.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nphil, let's talk a little bit about asia, starting with the korean peninsula. you did three tours on the peninsula, including commanding a fighter wing at kunsan air base in 2001. a lot has happened since then. how do you look at the current situation on the peninsula and the way ahead?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nit remains problematic. we have had people tell us for a long time that the hermit kingdom is going to implode and why are we worried about it. and i guess in a glib way, we should ask ourselves, how's that working out for us? the north continues to pose a threat, not only in a conventional way, but now in a more growing nuclear way. and they're determined to use those advantages to try to build a political situation with south korea and the rest of the world that would advantage them in their day-to-day operations.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwe have gone from yelling about little rocket man to hugs at the demilitarized zone. how do you feel about president trump's overtures to kim jong-un? have they been productive? do you agree with them? and do you think the north koreans will ever give up their nuclear weapons?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, sandy, i think that we want to talk to them. we don't want to fight them. we're sort of playing poker with someone else's chips. it would be the south korean people that would really pay if we were to begin a conflict on that peninsula. and so i would applaud any president -- i don't want to zero in on what's going on now -- but any president that began a real conversation.\n\ni think we have to understand that this is a nation and a set of leadership that is just going to be really hard to deal with. and they really haven't lived up to a lot of their promises in the past, so i think we all need to have a sober judgment of what we might accomplish.\n\nbut i would say it's better to try than not to try. and so i applaud any president that tries it. as far as giving up their nuclear weapons, i don't think so. the agreed framework in the early '90s under the clinton years, we gave them tons of money, tons of fuel, tons of food, and we got, really, nothing in return for it. unless we get persistent, pervasive inspection that allows us to completely understand what north korea is actually doing, we're going to be at risk in any agreement i think we make with them.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwell, and it also seems that we have to be careful about mirror imaging on north korea. you know, kim jong-un has to worry about both external threats, but also internal threats to the—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nabsolutely.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--regime. our relationship with south korea has, like many of our allies, become a little more transactional lately. we're starting to ask the south koreans to pay a little bit more for our presence there. have you got any thoughts for us on u.s. basing of forces in south korea?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso it's not going to surprise you, having served almost half of my military career oversees, that i am a proponent for our military being engaged overseas. i think that that ounce of provision is worth a whole lot more than the cure if we let the peninsula go. the investment that we make by having a fairly modest force forward to keep peace on the peninsula is absolutely worth it. and you're going to hear this again as we talk about forces in other places around the world.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nnow this is going to be a tough fight, if it ever actually happens, a conventional fight on a peninsula. we have the tyranny of distance. yes, we have sort of 'fight tonight' ethos on the peninsula. but how do you see this unfolding? are we going to be able to stop the north korean hoards with seoul right on the border of—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, it's a great question. and really, some of those dynamics haven't changed for 20-plus years. the fact that north korea can range the capital in that incredibly dense population, in the general seoul area, can range it with dumb conventional firepower from the back side of the kaesong heights, at any moment's notice, it's a tough problem.\n\nand how do you shut that down as a force in the south? this will be a fight that the world hasn't seen in a long time. and the loss of life, both civilian and conventional military on the ground, we are not ready for that, i think, in this world.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nyes, it's going to be tough to get our forces there in time to make a difference. it's—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nabsolutely.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--going to be something that nobody can really accurately predict.\n\nphil, we were just talking about korea and kim jong-un and nuclear weapons. what do you think is the greatest impediment to him actually giving up those weapons?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, sandy, i think it doesn't take a lot of looking into history to see what has happened to every despotic leader that has given up or had his nuclear weapons taken from them, to realize that the leaders in the north see this as their guarantee.\n\nand i think one of the toughest things in my tour as the saceur, is what happened in ukraine. here, ukraine in the early '90s had an agreement with four signatory nations, that if they gave up their nuclear weapons that their territorial integrity and sovereignty would be guaranteed by those nations. and so they gave up their nuclear weapons.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nand look—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nand what happened?\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--what happened.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\none of the signatories invaded them. and two of the other signatories did nothing about it.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwell, and that's to say nothing of libya and, of course, iraq. phil, speaking of asia, many view china as our most capable potential adversary. they've been closing previously existing gaps in conventional capability and opening new ones in asymmetrical capability.\n\nthis is making life very difficult for the pacific command commander, as you might imagine. do you think we can keep pace with the chinese through only improvements in our capability? and if so, where do you see that heading? what kind of capabilities do we need in order to keep an advantage out there?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nactually, i don't think that's the right way to go. i've heard you talk about this. and i happen to agree with some of the thoughts you have about, we get locked into certain things. the ends aren't changing, so we have ways and means. we typically focus on those means because they are what we do as an industrial nation here in america.\n\nand i think that changing the ways may be the end tack we have to take. the bottom line is, china is very good at setting goals and sticking to those goals, investing. and they're really pushing ahead in some of these critical technologies that are going to challenge us.\n\nand if all we are going to do is just buy more of the same to try to address it, i think we're going to be on the losing end of that cost curve. just like we applied that to russia in its past, i think china's putting us on the wrong side of that cost curve now.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso you, i think, have a clear feel that just buying more stuff is not going to do the trick. there's sort of an intermediate step, maybe, between having to rethink the whole strategic challenge out there. and that is better stuff. is there anything out there, any kind of breakthrough that could give us an advantage?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nyes, let me back up just a tiny bit. so we do have to fix readiness. the force needs to fix readiness. and some of that fixing readiness is investing in some of those capabilities that we need. so, i don't want to say we don't need to buy anything and we need to flip this, because we do.\n\nwe've got to recapitalize some fleets that have been rode hard and put up wet in all of our services. but in the meantime, i think that if all our imagination is captured in doing more of the same, we will lose in this proposition against china.\n\nwe have to think about changing the cost curve in more than money, imposing on them issues and problems that they have to deal with like they're imposing on us. and so i do believe that we need to be thinking about new technologies of defense. we need to be thinking about the kind of technology that allows us to strike with precision at range and not cost us an arm and a leg to do it.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso phil, let's drill in a little bit more, beyond now the capacity piece and the technical capability piece.\n\nif we actually bump up against the wall here and we have to think of a whole new strategic concept for china, do you have a sense for what that might look like? is it about changing our ends and lowering our ambition in the western pacific? or it's some different thing we can do that would present china with the dilemmas we've talked about?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, i don't know that it's all that easy to just change our ends. our world and our societies expect certain things-- free passageway in the commons, free trade, etcetera, etcetera. and so i'm not sure that we are capable as a nation of really drastically changing the ends.\n\nand as i said before, if all we're going to do is look at means, i think that we are going to be in-- on the back side of a real problem here. so, i do believe we have to look at different ways. and i think that they are at risk in-- if we do-- if we hold them at risk inside their mainland.\n\nright now we are not thinking about attacking the mainland, because this is a nuclear power. and frankly, they have done a pretty good job at holding us at bay and putting us at risk. but if we make them understand, through our investments and our new types of thinking about how to address this problem, that they are at risk in their homeland, i think it will change the calculus a bit.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso let's turn to your most recent work, where you served last in the military. and you're we'll known for your views on vladimir putin and russia. you've been very outspoken on that. what do you think is motivating the russian leader? and what do you see as the trajectory of our relationship with russia, phil?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, none of this will be terribly now because my views haven't changed. but let's just recoup. so, first of all, i think mr. putin is a man who has grown up a proud russian. he grew up in the kgb. he did not like the way the cold war ended. he felt like that russia was not at the table when the post-cold war order was sort of set.\n\nand he felt like russia was snubbed and should've been at the table. and he's determined to get russia back at the table on determining the path of europe as well as other parts of the world, as we see now in syria and in north africa. and frankly, it's a bit tough to say.\n\nbut remember, this is a kleptocrat. you know, mr. putin has never been paid officially more than an army or air force lieutenant colonel. he's been a public servant all his life. and yet he's one of the richest men in the world. this is a kleptocrat who has been extracting wealth from that nation and he doesn't want to lose that wealth stream. so i think you've got on one side, a proud russian that believes russia was snubbed and should be a major power. and on the other side, there's a man that really likes the stream of money that comes from his position.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nphil, to continue our discussion, i asked you about the trajectory of our relationship with russia. where do you see that heading?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nit's not good. if i was to imagine being in the room, having a cognac with mr. putin at this point, i would think he would be a very happy man. what he wants when he looks to his west is an e.u. that is fractured and disorganized, a nato that is fractured and disorganized.\n\nhe wants to deal with individual nations, individually, on individual security and business matters. and i think that right now he's succeeding. let's just look at the state of conversation in nato. let's look at the state of conversation in brexit and e.u., etcetera, etcetera. and so i think that right now what we see from mr. putin is unlikely to change, because in his mind, i believe, he sees his path as working.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwell, and that's to say nothing of his interference in our elections. and it seems to me that he's not necessarily favoring a single candidate. he just wants to see chaos his way.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nexactly. and i think that's a point that this particular city we're sitting in, seems to gloss over. everybody wants to make this an election issue on one side or the other. and i couldn't agree with you more. what he wants is chaos. he wants to drag western democracy down to the level of russian democracy. and, of course, in some ways, he's having some success there.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nyes, which helps him set the expectations of his own people. now phil, you had a russian counterpart, a very interesting guy, valery gerasimov, who's the chief of the general staff of the russian armed forces. he's very active, to say the least, and has very strongly-held views on the competition between russia and nato. can you tell us a bit about your relationship with him and how you perceive his views?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nlet me just first start with, this is an intelligent man, a thinking man. and i believe he does a lot of his own writing-- maybe not the final products, but you can see what he thinks reflected in his speeches and his writing. so this is a learning, adaptive leader. and i think we need to respect him for that.\n\ni started off trying to build a relationship with him. and he and i began meeting on a series of video teleconferences and so forth. but sadly, i won't argue with why, but sadly when the russians invaded crimea and then when they went in and invaded donbass and set up the radicals there, the saceur, first, was told, no longer to speak to mr. gerasimov. and then the u.s. european command commander was also told to stop conversations with mr. gerasimov.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nand i'd draw a contrast there, not to interrupt, that when russia invaded georgia, the only contact between our two governments was between the chief of the general staff, makarov, and admiral mike mullen.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\ni must tell you that --it's-- you're right, and that was right, in my opinion. i believe when conflict is happening, you step up your conversation. you don't shut it off. and i had offered my opinion about what we should do, but i was given direction from my leadership. and i followed that direction.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwell, and look what's happened. so, now looking at the big picture, end of the cold war, the declaration of a peace dividend, do you think we went too far in drawing down from europe? how do you feel about the ability now of the alliance to respond to russian aggression? and let's start with how it might actually start and how you see it playing out and our ability to carry the day?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, i do believe we overcorrected. all of us, all the nations of nato and our partner nations as well, we all took big peace dividends. and we in the u.s. removed so much capability from europe. we don't have time to describe how big we were when captain phil breedlove was in 2nd brigade 3rd infantry division, standing with the army as a tacp or an alo in the early '80s.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nthat's an air liaison officer for—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nthe early--\n\n(overtalk)\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--the un-anointed.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nyes, so a forward air controller, army associated. and so i think we have overreacted. and now we are having to sort of rethink about how we can do that. but again, not only did we withdraw our troops from europe, but we downsized all of our militaries.\n\nand probably more damaging-- you could speak better to the navy-- but probably more damaging, we have put such a strain on the military that we have, that our readiness is well below where it was when we faced the soviet union across the border. so i do believe that we have correction that needs to be made.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso let's drill a little bit more deeply into that. what do you see as the advantages, operational military advantages that russia has if they decide to get a little feisty vis-à-vis the nato alliance?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso the nato alliance is on their backdoor. and it's a whole other subject to talk about the encroachment. but some of the nations that used to be warsaw pact are now nato alliance members. and so if you remember jomini, that great thinker, he talked about interior lines.\n\nrussia has the ability to quickly move and mass their forces, where nato has to respond to the area. and i know you understand this better than most because of your naval background, but in the cold war we almost took-- we fought to maintain the lines of contact with the east coast of america and europe.\n\nduring the post-cold war days, we have all but stopped worrying about fighting our way across the atlantic. in fact, we assume safe passage across the atlantic. and that's not the case anymore. and so russia enjoys that ability to rapidly bring forces together. and if you've ever looked at moscow and the spider network of roads and railroads from there, you understand how quickly they can do this. and then you have to look at what nato has to do to respond. it's a physics problem.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nand that's not to mention a singularity of command and control—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nabsolutely.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--twenty-eight nations having to decide versus one, and some of the advantages they have in artillery and tactical air defenses and the like. so do you see the need, as we talked about with china, for a new way? or is it just sort of, get the stuff back over there so that we can be more prepared?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nthe answer is yes. it's a little bit of all of that. so i think that we, again, have to address our readiness. we and our -- primarily or as well our allies -- need to bring forces to capability and readiness. and yes, we need to look a little bit about, do we have the appropriate forces over there?\n\nfrankly, i don't believe we'll ever permanently move another force to europe. but we need to settle ourselves in a way with prepositioning and other tactics, to be able to rapidly reinforce. and then, as you know, we're-- with the 2nd fleet, we're starting to now rethink how we defend our sea lines of contact with america. but as we talked about with china, we've got to think about different ways. it just can't be means anymore. we've got to change the paradigm a little bit in europe.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nas one of the most important organizations that was put into place in the wake of world war ii, with the intent of preventing such large wars from ever happening again, was nato. and our relationship with nato has always been up and down. where do you see it now? how do you see president trump's influence on—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nuh-huh (affirm).\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--that relationship? how do you feel about your old buddies back in europe?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, it's an interesting story. and as people sort of pick at me about this, i remind them that we were thrown out of a nato country once, literally thrown out. and so yes, we've had some peaks and valleys in our relationship with nato. i would tell you that i have watched every one of the last three presidents try to get nato to invest more in itself. and while you and i may not agree with the tactics, techniques and procedures used, we actually now have nato allies reinvesting in themselves. it's been a bit of a rocky road. and we'll just leave it at that.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso it may be that we don't necessarily like the tone, but the result seems to be maybe in a direction we want.\n\nphil, much has been made of the fact that the strategic arms reduction treaty, or start, expires in 2021. the u.s. withdrew from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty in august 2019 because russia failed to return to full and verified compliance through the destruction of its non-compliant missile system. was pulling out of that treaty the right thing to do?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso this is now just my opinion. you got it right. we were the only one in the treaty. it's kind of hard to have a treaty with yourself. russia had abrogated the treaty. so the question is, how do you move forward? how do you try to re-engage russia?\n\nthe choice was to back out of the inf. if it had been me making that decision, i think i'd have done it differently. i would've tried to build from an existing treaty. i just think it's easier to do that than to renegotiate entirely a new treaty.\n\nbut let me throw one more curve ball into this calculus. and that is that we really need to have a treaty with more than just russia. and it would be incredibly hard, but to get china into a treaty as well, because they are going to be an issue. and frankly, right now, i think russia has more issues with china's capabilities than with ours, because we really don't have any in europe right now.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nit could be one of the reasons why they violated the treaty, right, because they're more worried—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nabsolutely.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--about china.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nwe have to be intellectually honest.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nhow do you feel about the russian assertion that the missile defense system that's in romania, which is a aegis system that not only can carry the sm-3 missile that's a ballistic missile defense thing, but could also theoretically carry the tomahawk missile and therefore we were also in violation of the inf treaty. what's your take on that?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\ni think that's a convenient excuse for the russian federation to offer. i think it's hogwash.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso, the russians have been developing some pretty exotic new strategic weapons, right? nuclear cruise missiles, hypersonic weapons and even big transoceanic nuclear torpedoes, as we saw the strategic glance over vladimir putin's soldier looking-- or shoulder looking at a power point slide. but they've also talked about extending the start treaty. that almost seems to be at odds with each other. what do you see the trajectory of strategic arms control agreements with russia?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\ni will offer you my hope. i think we need to stay in the start. i think we need to grow from that to a new round of understandings. i think we need to wrap china into these conversations and try to bring that dynamic in. and i think we need to back in now and get a new inf-like treaty, even if it's only with russia, but it would hopefully be with china. and i think that we want to do everything we can to slow this race to expanding the nuclear countries of the world.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso, one of the things that's always been a thorn in russia's side in terms of arms control agreements, is ballistic missile defense. they firmly believe that our development-- or at least they say they believe that our development of ballistic missile defense was designed to negate their ability to respond to an attack, and therefore we would-- it would create strategic instability. phil, do you think that they actually believe this? or do you think they're using it as a convenient foil to try to just get us to get rid of ballistic missile defense?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\ni think it's the latter. we all know that russia has the ability to overwhelm our defenses. the only thing that a small defense that we have, if it's credible-- and i think ours is-- and gets more credible every day, the only thing that does is sort of take away the coercive value of small attacks to be-- to force us to think differently as we talk and negotiate with russia.\n\nbut we can't build enough missiles to stop their attack. and frankly, i think they're more worried about our decapitation of their ability to launch an attack than they are about our missile defense. i think it's, again, a sort of convenient tool to try to shape us at the negotiating table.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nnow phil, the realization that i came to in the last couple years i was on active-duty, that our space command and control capability was a bit weak, was a very unforgettable moment for me. that's getting a lot better. the department has tried to reorganize itself for space. as a career air force officer, can you give me a sense for what your thoughts are on the new space force? getting beyond the grief, they've taken over logos and uniforms—\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nright, right.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\n--and the like. do you think that the department's headed down a wise path here?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\ni think we're on a path. and we're going to make it as wise as we can. i love the way that our current chief of staff sort of said it a few years ago. he said, we are currently an air and space force. in 40 years, we're going to be a space and air force.\n\nwe in this service, absolutely accept and acknowledge that that transition's going to happen. the real key here then is, how fast does that happen? it matters not now. the decision was to move out. and so i think you're going to see everybody that wears a blue uniform embrace that and move out.\n\nand i'm actually happy about that. what i think we need to understand is, that since we have done this so abruptly and so suddenly, we've got some problems to take care of. and one of them starts with people, or in the commercial world the h.r. business, of the air force.\n\nhow do we manage these people that were formerly air force and dutifully became missileers because we told them they had to be missileers to get promoted. and now we've got this mixture of people that aren't purely space, some of them missileers. how do we not damage those highly-valued members of our services as we do this really abruptly into the future?\n\nand so i embrace and am proud for the fact that we're going to create a space force. i don't want to leave dead and broken bodies along the way as we do that. and so we need to do it quickly. i believe in star wars. there are going to be x-wing fighters. i hope my grandchildren are flying them sometime in the future.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nthat sounds like fun. maybe we were born too early.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nthat's right.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nso phil, you-- i have just a little bit of time left. i've known you a long, long time.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nyes.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nyou've had a fantastic career. you're one of the most highly regarded officers, let alone air force officers, that i know. can you give me a sense for what the most valuable or the most rewarding part of your career was, whether it's nato or your time in a blue uniform? what was the best part for you?\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nso, it changed, sandy. i think you and i both agree, when we were ensigns and lieutenants and captains and majors and commanders, all i wanted to do is fly that f-16. i wanted to be the most effective, efficient killing machine out there. i wanted to be right for my nation.\n\nand then along the way, i was asked to command. i commanded at a very small level in the army. i commanded a squadron, a group, three fighter wings, a numbered air force, a majcom and an alliance. and i will tell you that the most rewarding part of my career was working with the soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines that i got to command along the way. it is absolutely incredibly -- it is our number one resource -- are those soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. and i would just tell you that even though i loved flying the f-16, being able to lead troops was a big deal to me.\n\nsandy winnefeld:\n\nwell, and that's a great way to end. you have been listening to intelligence matters, hosted by michael morell. i'm your guest host, sandy winnefeld. and our guest has been general phil breedlove, former nato supreme allied commander of europe. phil, thanks so much for spending time with our listeners today. it's been a great discussion.\n\ngen. phil breedlove:\n\nthanks, sandy.\n\n* * *end of transcript* * *
london — as reports of rape made to police in england and wales have increased exponentially, rape charges, prosecutions, and convictions have all fallen to their lowest levels since record keeping began, according to government statistics. women's groups allege this is due, in part, to a shift in prosecutorial policy, and they are seeking to take government prosecutors to court over it.\n\ncbs news reviewed data from britain's crown prosecution service's (cps) annual violence against women and girls reports, as well as from its office of national statistics, which show that, since 2007, there has been a 363% rise in rape allegations made to the police in england and wales. in the same period, the number of rape charges against suspects has fallen by 15.5%.\n\nbritain's crown prosecution service inspectorate (hmcpsi) — an official government watchdog — said in a report released late last year that the wide gap in the statistics is a matter of serious concern, and is due to a criminal justice system that is close to breaking point.\n\na graph shows the number of reports received by police in england and wales of alleged rapes over about 10 years, in blue, compared to the number of rape charges filed against suspects during the same period, in red, according to official data.\n\nthe watchdog group's report was part of a wide-ranging and ongoing government inquiry into how rape cases are handled across the criminal justice system in england and wales, the rest of which is expected to be released this summer. it blamed a lack of resources at the crown prosecution service (cps) and problems with processing digital evidence, among other things, for the startling numbers.\n\nbut the u.k.'s centre for women's justice (cwj) and the end violence against women coalition (evaw) allege the severe drop in charging and prosecution rates over the last two years is due to a covert, discriminatory and illegal shift in prosecutorial protocol, and they have requested a judicial review into the cps.\n\nnational emergency\n\ni was told by the police that i had a really strong case – my rapist was known to them, and unknown to me ,he had a history of violence against previous partners, plus i had evidence of the attack, rebecca, whose name has been changed to protect her identity, said according to a statement put out by evaw announcing its request for a judicial review.\n\nrebecca said she was held prisoner for two days by her then-boyfriend, during which time she was raped at knifepoint. after the attack, she continued speaking with him, both in person and via text message. when police were called by a friend to her residence, she turned them away. she was later told by authorities that, because of her behavior, her case would not be taken to trial.\n\na judgment was made about my physical reaction to being raped not being the right one, and the cps dropped my case. i was denied my day in court and this man was able to walk free and not answer for what he did to me, she said.\n\nif another kind of crime that serious was so unlikely to be prosecuted and punished, there would be a national uproar and it would be a national emergency, katie russell, national spokesperson for rape crisis england & wales, told cbs news. so why not for this? why is it not being treated as the priority it should be?\n\ndecision to prosecute\n\nfor almost a decade in england and wales, prosecutors were instructed to take a merits-based approach in deciding whether to pursue a rape case. that meant lawyers were told to consider the laws on rape — including whether consent was given and whether the victim was in a state where they could give consent at the time — rather than what a real world jury, made up of people who could be influenced by stereotypes about rape, might think.\n\nthe reason for this merits-based approach was to prevent prosecutors from rejecting cases which, while they might have the law on their side, could fail to convince members of a jury.\n\nover the last three years, the merits-based approach has been largely erased from cps guidelines for prosecuting rape cases, according to evaw. now those guidelines require that prosecutors believe there to be a realistic prospect of conviction before moving forward with a case. in that same timeframe, reports of rape have continued to increase, but prosecutions have fallen to their lowest levels since current record keeping began.\n\nit's our position that the unlawful removal of this approach meant that cps prosecutors took a more risk-averse attitude towards prosecuting rape and were charging only the strong cases and not charging the so-called weaker ones, rebecca hitchens, campaign manager at evaw, told cbs news.\n\nwhat's being taught or told to perpetrators of sexual violence is: you can get away with it.\n\nthe crown prosecution service denies that there has been a change in protocol, and says it removed the merits-based approached from its guidelines because it was causing confusion.\n\nevery decision is, and always has been, taken in the same way, following the code for crown prosecutors. no individual charging decision is influenced by any factor other than the merits of the case, a cps spokesperson told cbs news.\n\nthe growing gap between the number of rapes recorded, and the number of cases going to court is a cause of concern for all of us. we will implement any improvements suggested as part of the ongoing, cross-justice system rape review, the spokesperson said.\n\nmaddie richards contributed to this report.
fluctuations in personal income will likely harm your financial well-being, but more surprisingly, unpredictable changes in income are also bad for your physical health, a new study shows.\n\nlong-term income volatility — a sudden and usually negative change in one's income over time — was shown to carry a nearly two-fold risk of cardiovascular disease and death, according an article based on the study, coronary artery risk development in young adults published in the american heart association's journal circulation.\n\nresearchers observed nearly 4,000 individuals ages 23-35 across four different american cities, assessing participants' income over a period of 15 years from 1990 to 2005. they subsequently followed the cohort for 10 years to assess cardiovascular incidents and mortality based on medical records and death certificates, tali elfassy, one of the study's lead authors, told cbs moneywatch.\n\nthe findings, which were adjusted to account for health factors such as subjects' body mass indexes and cholesterol levels, reinforce the urgency and growing public health threat associated with income volatility in the united states, the study said.\n\nstrong association\n\n\n\nits findings show a tight connection between fluctuating incomes and negative health outcomes. for example, the mortality rate was 5.28 per 1,000 patients for individuals with higher income volatility, compared to 2.12 per 1,000 patients with low income volatility.\n\nwe were surprised by the strength of the association between income volatility and an increase in cardiovascular and premature mortality, elfassy said.\n\nfluctuating incomes are on the rise in the u.s., where one-third of americans weather large swings in income, according to research from the pew charitable trusts.\n\nthe pervasiveness of income volatility is a pressing threat to public health, according to the study's authors. income volatility is very common, and it's something that needs to be considered in terms of cardiovascular disease risk since we are finding it is an independent contributor, elfassy said.\n\neven financial gains can be negative, as changes in a family's income can hamstring their ability to plan financially.\n\nmore commonly, drops in income can lead to stress and affect patients' ability to manage their own care, leading to lapses in treatment or medication. for example, low-income patients with chronic diseases may give up medications and medical visits to cope with unexpected financial instability, resulting in increased risk of disease, including heart attack and stroke, according to the study.\n\nmultiple mechanisms\n\n\n\nelfassy said a number of criteria likely factor into the association.\n\nmy hunch is that i don't think there is going to be just one particular biological or behavioral mechanism that will account for the entire association, but perhaps a number of them altogether will account for it, she said. each contributing factor may partially explain what we are seeing.\n\nunpredictable drops in income are also associated with all causes of mortality, according to the study. however, elfassy noted that because the study's sample size was small and its participants were young, few mortalities were observed.\n\nas far as possible remedies go, elfassy suggested policies and programs to help individuals who experience traumatic financial events. we should seek help and social coping mechanisms that deal with the implications of losing a substantial amount of income, she said.
the initial push to distribute covid-19 vaccines around the u.s. has been sluggish, reflecting many of the same problems that has allowed the disease to rampage across the country. government efforts lack coordination, as a patchwork of federal, state and local authorities struggle to implement dozens of disparate plans. millions of people are wary of being inoculated, polls suggest, just as millions still resist wearing masks despite the nearly 370,000 deaths from the disease. vaccine misinformation and conspiracy theories are rife.\n\ndespite such hurdles, public health experts express optimism that the vaccination campaign will soon pick up speed. economists also predict a swift recovery in activity by consumers and businesses as infections slow and the country nears herd immunity later this year. here's a look at why the rollout is lagging and when most americans can expect to get vaccinated.\n\nwhy isn't the u.s. moving faster to vaccinate people?\n\nas of january 11, 25 million doses of a coronavirus vaccine have been shipped to hospitals and specialty pharmacies nationwide, according to the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. although the pace of distribution has been picking up, less than 9 million doses — or about a third —have been administered since vaccines began shipping on december 13. at that pace, it would take more than three years for the entire u.s. population to be vaccinated.\n\na range of factors are holding up vaccinations. the biggest problem, experts say: there is no overarching federal plan to inoculate americans nationwide. the trump administration has mostly left it up to the states to decide how to distribute and administer the vaccine. what's more, the federal government was slow to approve funding that the states said they needed to administer the vaccine.\n\nit's federalism at its worst, said l.j tan, a vaccine expert and chief strategy officer for the immunization action coalition, an advocacy group.\n\na number of states also appear to have had experienced major snafus in commencing vaccinations. in arizona, a problem with a scheduling software left two of the five vaccinations locations in maricopa county, which is the state's most populated area, empty for days at the beginning of the vaccine roll out. the problem has been fixed, and arizona's governor has announced changes to address the delays. but distribution in the state remains sluggish. through january 11, more than 75% of the doses that have been shipped to arizona have yet to be administered.\n\nanother possible factor: many people are refusing to be vaccinated. in early january, the governor of ohio said that as many as 60% of nurses in the state were opting out. dr. david basel, vice president of sioux falls, south dakota-based avera health said the vaccine refusal rate he has seen is more like 25%, and is most common a concern among pregnant women.\n\nwho is getting the first vaccine doses?\n\nvaccines aren't being offered on a first-come, first-served basis. when you will get the vaccine depends on your age and what you do for a living. it also might matter where you live.\n\noriginally, the federal government and states said that the first doses would go to hospital workers as well as nursing home residents and staff. but in the past week several states, including new york, have reversed that stance and are now offering the vaccine to older people, as well as teachers, firefighters and other first responders. those groups account for about 50 million americans.\n\nwho comes after health and safety workers?\n\nto speed up distribution, the federal government on tuesday gave states permission to vaccinate anyone over the age of 65, as well people over 16 with a prior health condition, such as asthma or diabetes, that would make them more likely to get severely ill if they contracted covid-19.\n\nultimately, however, it is states that make the final decision on how to distribute vaccines. a number of states have started to distribute doses beyond medical workers, but it's unclear how many will begin providing it to all older americans.\n\nthe federal government has said essential workers should be next in line. but who exactly is defined as an essential worker remains unclear.\n\nthe problem: some 204 million americans fall into of these categories — essential worker, at greater risk of a severe covid-19 case or over 65. that's far more than the amount of vaccine that the u.s. currently has on hand.\n\nwhen will vaccines be more widely available? will there be enough to go around?\n\nthe u.s. has ordered as much as 1.2 billion doses of various coronavirus vaccines. that's more than enough to inoculate the entire american population.\n\nbut that tally includes orders for some vaccines that have not yet been approved. some, like the 500,000 doses of the oxford university-astrazeneca vaccine that the u.s. has ordered, are likely to be delivered. less certain is the 100,000 doses ordered from drugmakers glaxosmithkline and sanofi. the testing of that vaccine was suspended in december because of its low efficacy rate and hasn't been resumed.\n\neven the 400 million doses the government has purchased of the pfizer-biontech and moderna vaccines, which are the only two approved for use in the u.s., aren't entirely available yet. the two companies have delivered 45 million doses in total so far.\n\nanother 75 million doses of the pfizer vaccine are expected to be delivered by the end of march, with another 75 million doses to follow over the next three months.\n\nas for moderna, the company has agreed to deliver 180 million doses on a rolling basis, with the last shipments arriving by the end of june. that translates to about 30 million doses a month starting in january.\n\nbecause 400 million doses of the two-dose vaccines will only be enough to vaccinate 200 million people, covid-19 vaccines will likely not be available for everyone in the u.s. until the oxford-astrazeneca vaccine is approved for use in the u.s., possibly this spring. the government has not released a timetable for when the 500,000 doses it has ordered of the two-dose vaccine will be delivered.\n\nwhat can be done to speed up vaccinations?\n\nvaccine distribution has picked up recently, with about 700,000 doses a day being administered in the second weekend of january. still, experts say that upwards of 2 million americans need to be inoculated per day in order to reach herd immunity by spring — achieved either through vaccination or people being exposed to the virus. for now, that target seems optimistic.\n\nthe u.s. distributes about 80 million doses a month of the annual flu vaccine each fall. tan of the immunization action coalition thinks covid-19 distribution could reach nearly the same pace. given that the vaccines all require two doses, roughly 40 million americans a month could be vaccinated.\n\nat that pace it would take nearly seven months before 80% of americans were vaccinated, the threshold the cdc estimates would be needed for life to return more or less to normal in the u.s. it also suggests that most people won't get their shots until at least the second half of the year.\n\nin early january a number of officials, including u.s. surgeon general jerome adams, encouraged states to start distributing vaccines more widely, instead of reserving the majority of doses for health care workers or those most at risk.\n\nbut it's not clear opening up vaccine eligibility to the general public would pick up the pace of distribution. florida, for instance, has allowed anyone 65 and older to sign up for the vaccine. the result has been long lines, and not much more success at distributing the vaccine.\n\nas of january 11, according to cdc data, florida had distributed less than 40% of the vaccine it had received from the federal government in the past month. that puts it on par with other states, like new york, which until recently had been giving the vaccine only to health care workers.\n\nif you are going to open it up to everyone, then you need to make sure you have vaccination access points, tan said. they were not ready for it, and that's what is happening in florida.\n\ndo i have a choice of which vaccine to take?\n\nfor now, most americans will have to take whatever vaccine they are offered. that may change in the second half of 2021 as more vaccines are available, but it could require going to the back of the line if you are eligible to get vaccinated and the vaccine available at the time is not the one you want.\n\nthe good news is that there appears to be little difference between the two currently available vaccines. both are over 90% effective, require two shots and have been shown to produce only mild side effects — including fevers, headaches and arm soreness — in about 20% of all patients.\n\nas of yet, neither vaccine has been approved for kids or teens. the pfizer-biontech vaccine has been cleared for people 16-years-old and up. the moderna vaccine has been authorized for people 18 and older.\n\na big change could come if johnson & johnson's vaccine, which only requires one shot, is approved. but that won't happen in the u.s. until the spring at the earliest, observers said, and even then there will only be 100,000 doses of that vaccine — targeted at poorer nations — available for americans.
julián castro spoke with face the nation moderator margaret brennan from san antonio, texas, for the jan. 13, 2019 broadcast.\n\nread more interviews of 2020 candidates on face the nation here.\n\nmargaret brennan: with dozens of democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on saturday the former mayor of san antonio, julián castro, became the latest candidate. castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 democratic convention and he was also secretary of housing and urban development during the obama administration. the grandson of a mexican immigrant, julian castro has already been endorsed by a democratic member of congress, his twin brother, joaquin. and julian castro joins us from the site of his announcement. welcome to face the nation.\n\njulián castro: thanks a lot. great to be with you, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: the president visited your home state of texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?\n\ncastro: what i believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. this policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that customs and border protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. that's a real tragedy. and, you know, the folks down on the border know - and many of them have said - in fact, i just saw one border resident the other day on camera that said that a wall is not the answer. that we can have strong border security with personnel, with technology, but that the wall is not the answer. so the president may have his rhetoric but everybody else has the facts right that a wall isn't the answer.\n\nmargaret brennan: well that family separation policy has been paused at least. but there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. so what would you do? would you extend the amount of time that families can be held together in detention?\n\ncastro: i don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country. and we- we have developed some ways to do that but that we don't detain them the way that we have been. so no, i don't agree with that. the other thing i'll say margaret, and this is very important is, i hope that folks remember that the president said that he wanted to do this family separation policy because it would deter more families coming from these countries. and actually the exact opposite happened. and so he's failed. he's a failed leader on this issue and now he's just trying to stoke his political base by bringing up the wall all the time. and it's just a failure of leadership all around. i would end this kind of family detention. i would make sure that we invest in sensible, smart and effective border security that includes personnel, that includes the smart use of technology, and that does not scapegoat these immigrants but tries to look for a way that we can get to comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've been calling immigration system broken for some time and you were critical even under the obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. so what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?\n\ncastro: well, what i believe we could do and what the obama administration did do i believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country and ensure that they report back when they need to and that they are part of, you know, legal proceedings. but we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. and the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. i would change that. i would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that- that they can get an earned path to citizenship. i still believe that that should be part of the answer.\n\nmargaret brennan: you announced your candidacy today and almost immediately the rnc issued a statement. i want to read it here to you. it says, julián castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president. he was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being hud secretary. this is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. these are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. how do you respond and- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be commander in chief?\n\ncastro: well first of all, i think they could just dust off those same words, you know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single democrat that decides to run for president. i wouldn't put too much stock in that. i would just say to the american people directly, i've had executive experience. i've led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. i've led a federal agency at hud and- and done some great work to expand opportunity. i know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. i also have a life experience that i think resonates with a lot of americans. you know i'm here in my neighborhood that i grew up in. grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in san antonio. was able to go to college and law school and to reach my american dream. and i am motivated to make sure that every american can reach their dreams. and then, i have a strong vision for the country's future. i want to make sure that in this century, this 21st century, that we are the smartest, the healthiest, the fairest and the most prosperous nation on earth.\n\nmargaret brennan: you're going to have a- a lot of competition for the democratic nomination. it looks to be a very crowded field. how are you going to distinguish yourself?\n\ncastro: i'm going to articulate a very strong positive vision for the country's future. i'm going to get out there and work hard. i'm gonna make sure that i let people know what i've actually accomplished in the executive experience that i have. and i think that right now people are looking for a leader that can show they can get things done. being a mayor is all about getting things done. and when i was cabinet secretary i got things done. they want government that functions well now and somebody that's trying to bring people together instead of tear them apart. so i'm going to go out there and make my case. and you know i'm under no illusion right now that- that i'm in the poll position or anything. i'm not a front runner but nobody who grew up here in these neighborhoods, including myself, has ever been a front runner. and i think in this country right now, that there are a lot of people who don't feel like front runners. and i'm going to go speak to them in this campaign.\n\nmargaret brennan: well some of the things you outlined as part of your platform today, medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a green new deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the democratic party. so one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the president but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?\n\ncastro: what i hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. there are a lot of people- even people that call themselves centrists that think of themselves as- as not necessarily- you know they wouldn't call themselves liberal. but a lot of people are ready for universal health care. i mean look at the polls. when- when it's polled you know it gets over 60, 70 percent of support--\n\nmargaret brennan: medicare for all you mean.\n\ncastro: and so i think- that's right. and i believe that this country is ready for that. now you bring up the issue or one- one issue people bring up is ok well you know- of course, you know we're going to put forward a plan. and i'm sure people have other- have their own plans of how we would accomplish that. and i'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like medicare for all would be easy. but i do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it. and so i believe it is worth it, that that fight is worth it. and whether people call themselves liberal or centrists or conservative, what they want right now is they want to know that- that you're coming at them straight and that you're being honest with them. and i'm going to be honest with folks.\n\nmargaret brennan: so what is that going to cost taxpayers? because bernie sanders, when he ran in the last campaign, had a universal health care call and estimates showed it costing one point four trillion dollars a year. you gotta make some real changes there to be able to pay for it.\n\ncastro: no, you do. there's no question that it's going to take several things. i think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share--\n\nmargaret brennan: what does that mean?\n\ncastro: --we've had basically the- the last 40 years. well, i mean i think we've had the last 40 years essentially of- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. same thing goes for corporations. we have corporations - multinational corporations - that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes.\n\nmargaret brennan: you want to increase the corporate tax rate?\n\ncastro: --we need to ask them to pay their fair share. i think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from the wealthiest corporations. i also think it's interesting, margaret, you know, that i'm here in a neighborhood that was built up like a not- a lot of neighborhoods by small businesses. little convenience stores, little restaurants, little dry cleaners. and at the same time, that a company like amazon, that is one of the biggest companies in the world, can get huge tax- tax breaks, huge abatements, and also only begrudgingly end up paying their- their employees 15 dollars an hour.\n\nmargaret brennan: well how would you- how would you ask--\n\ncastro: we need to change that in this country.\n\nmargaret brennan: how would you ask those same people to pay for the green new deal you're calling for? are you going to put a tax on gases and fossil fuels? how are you going to pay for that?\n\ncastro: yeah, so i look forward during the course of- of this campaign to putting forward proposals on each of these things. and- and i think that- that a vast majority of the american people are ready for that.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. we will be tracking you and your campaign and more details as you promise them there. thank you so much for joining us.\n\ncastro: thank you.
washington — the white house is preparing for some republican senators to join democrats in voting to call witnesses in president trump's impeachment trial, which could get underway in the coming days.\n\nsenior white house officials tell cbs news they increasingly believe that at least four republicans, and likely more, will vote to call witnesses. in addition to senators lisa murkowski of alaska, susan collins of maine, mitt romney of utah and possibly cory gardner of colorado, the white house also views rand paul of kentucky as a wild card and senator lamar alexander of tennessee as an institutionalist who might vote to call witnesses, as one official put it.\n\nlast week, collins said she was working with a fairly small group of gop senators to allow new testimony, adding that her colleagues should be completely open to calling witnesses. romney has expressed an interest in hearing from former national security adviser john bolton, who has said he would testify under subpoena. murkowski said last week that the senate should proceed as it did during the 1999 clinton impeachment trial.\n\ngardner and alexander have both said the senate trial should be fair and impartial. paul has said the president should be able to call his own witnesses, including the whistleblower whose complaint about ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry in the first place.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said the question of whether to call new witnesses in the trial would be decided by the full senate after the trial gets underway. a simple majority of 51 votes will be needed to approve motions to call witnesses, meaning democrats would need to convince four out of the 53 republicans in the senate to vote with them to compel testimony.\n\nthe house is expected to vote this week on a resolution to name impeachment managers and transmit the two articles to the senate, a necessary step before the trial can begin. democrats had previously demanded mcconnell agree to allow testimony from witnesses, including four administration officials, before transmitting the articles.\n\nthe white house officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, reiterated the president's intention to claim executive privilege if necessary to block bolton from testifying. mr. trump told fox news last week that he would likely do so to protect the office. while bolton could testify about some events that would fall outside the scope of executive privilege, the white house would fight to prevent bolton from discussing direct conversations with the president.\n\none senior official said the white house's impeachment team and counsel's office do not expect a quick dismissal of the impeachment articles in the senate, despite the president's weekend tweet in which he said republicans should vote to throw the articles out. some republican senators have introduced a proposal to change senate rules and simply dismiss the articles.\n\nmany believe that by the senate giving credence to a trial based on the no evidence, no crime, read the transcripts, 'no pressure' impeachment hoax, rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan democrat witch hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have. i agree! the president tweeted sunday.\n\nwhite house officials said the optics of a vote to dismiss would be tough for republicans, but white house lawyers do expect the question of acquittal to come up immediately following opening arguments and periods for written questions submitted by senators.\n\nthe president has offered various opinions about how he would like a senate trial to proceed, while at the same time nodding and deferring to the senate. he has also said he would like to hear from the whistleblower, along with house intelligence chairman adam schiff and joe and hunter biden. however, motions to call them as witnesses are unlikely to succeed, even though republicans hold the majority in the upper chamber.
catholic bishops from across the u.s. are gathering wednesday for a weeklong retreat on the clergy sex abuse crisis at a seminary near chicago. organizers said the retreat, which was requested by pope francis, will focus on prayer and spiritual reflection and not policy-making.\n\n\n\nthe gathering comes as cbs news has also learned of several cases involving nuns accused of sexual misconduct. the survivors network of those abused by priests – or snap – said it doesn't keep count of sexual abuse allegations, but cbs news' nikki battiste has spoken with several women who recently reported misconduct, ranging from forceful kissing to molestation, all carried out by nuns.\n\nwhen trish cahill was 15 years old she said she confided in sister eileen shaw at a convent in new jersey. cahill said she told shaw things she'd never revealed to anyone about her now-deceased uncle – a priest – whom she claims sexually abused her, starting at age five.\n\ni would have done anything for her. i would have died for her, cahill said. she gave me everything that was lacking that i didn't even know i was lacking. i was so broken. she filled in all those pieces.\n\nshe now describes that process as grooming, saying shaw plied her with drugs and alcohol while teaching her how to have sex with a woman.\n\n\n\ni'm with my friends during the day. and i'm with this pedophile nun on the evenings and on the weekends, and in the summer, cahill said.\n\nthe catholic church has been plagued with high-profile abuse scandals but pedophile nun is a phrase many people have probably never heard before.\n\nthat's really a shame. because there's a lot of them out there … it's the secret not yet told, cahill said.\n\nsister eileen shaw, the women trish cahill says abused her. cbs news\n\nmary dispenza is trying to change that.\n\nthe demands of chastity and celibacy are unrealistic demands for many of us, dispenza said.\n\ndispenza, a former nun from another congregation, remembers what happened when a superior summoned her to her room.\n\ni knelt down right next to her and she kissed me all over softly, my face … and i want to say, 'oh but it wasn't bad,' but it was. and i've carried it with me until today, dispenza said.\n\nthrough her work with snap she said she would occasionally hear about abuse or cover-ups by nuns but since the publication of a grand jury report identified hundreds of pedophile priests in pennsylvania, at least 18 people have contacted her to share stories of abuse by religious sisters.\n\nasked why we haven't heard much about abuse by nuns until recently, dispenza said, a lot has to do with the culture of nuns which are, they are very, very private by nature.\n\ncahill reported her abuse to the sisters of charity of st. elizabeth in 1994. the congregation paid her a $70,000 out-of-court settlement.\n\nthey had canon lawyers on retainer just for people like me. shut her up, pacify her, tell her you love her and you'll pray for her, and send her on her way, cahill said.\n\nin a statement, the congregation told cbs news, the case was investigated immediately when it was reported in 1994 and a settlement was reached that was mutually agreed on by all parties. we believe that the sisters of charity acted in a responsible manner.\n\nwe reached out to sister eileen shaw who cahill said she continued to see for years as an adult. she hung up on battiste.\n\nthe sisters of charity removed her from her role as a grade school principal but reports she remains a nun. they're providing her with food and housing while restricting her from outside ministry. in the meantime, cahill said the settlement she signed wasn't enough to help her deal with a lifetime of trauma. but she hopes that her voice can help prevent this from happening again.\n\nthat this is the beginning of many, many times more that i get to speak and i get to educate, and i get to, possibly, prevent this from happening to anyone ever again, cahill said.\n\ncahill said she believes other nuns had to have known what was going on with her. she's struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder, along with alcohol and drug addiction that she said began with her abuse. the sisters of charity said they're willing to meet with her to address her continuing concerns.
the united states will evacuate some americans in wuhan on a flight out of the quarantined city wednesday morning as concern over the spread of the coronavirus continues. but, there are roughly 1,000 americans in the city and space is limited.\n\nsam roth, a wisconsin father, is doing everything he can to help get his family get out of wuhan. his wife, daisy, and two young children, adalynn and abagail, flew to china last week to visit daisy's family for the lunar new year holiday.\n\nfrom the moment they stepped foot on wuhan, they were told, 'stay inside. don't get in big gatherings,' and then the city went on lockdown, roth told cbs news correspondent ramy inocencio.\n\nat least 106 people have died in china after getting the virus. priority for the state department's chartered flight out of wuhan will be given to those at greatest risk, the government said.\n\nwe've got a 10-month-old, we've got a 5-year-old. they're susceptible, and they should be prioritized, roth said.\n\nu.s. health officials said the virus is not spreading widely in america and that danger to the public is low, but there are five confirmed cases and more than 100 people being tested across 26 states.\n\nthe american public should not be fearful about this, but you really need to take it very seriously because as things evolve, our recommendations and our policy will change to be in accordance with what the evidence is, said dr. anthony fauci, head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases.\n\nin wuhan, the city is racing to complete two hospitals that will be used to treat thousands of infected patients. the city's mayor offered to resign because of what he called an unsatisfactory response to the illness, saying about five million people left the city before it shut its borders.\n\nthe u.s. flight out of wuhan is scheduled to touch down in ontario, california, just east of los angeles.
tokyo - yahoo japan said wednesday it's strengthening its policing of illegal ivory on its online commerce site as criticism grows it is supporting a trade that fuels the slaughter of wild elephants.\n\na spokeswoman for the company said it prohibits sales of raw ivory and ivory products that breach a 1989 treaty largely banning the trade. enforcement a challenge because japan allows the sale of old ivory such as ornaments that were produced before the treaty came into effect.\n\nsince there is a chance some sales may be illegal, we are strengthening our policies. if we find a sale was illegal, we cancel it straight away, takako kaminaga of yahoo japan's public relations office said. we 'patrol' 24 hours a day.\n\nshe said yahoo japan, which is part owned by yahoo (yhoo) and softbank, does not restrict sales of ivory that doesn't violate the law.\n\nnearly 1.1 million people have endorsed an online petition by environmental groups aimed at pushing yahoo japan to stop its sales of ivory products.\n\nvarious other online commerce sites, such as amazon (amzn), say they've already stopped such sales or advertising.\n\nraw ivory is sought after for making ornate traditional seals and other decorative items. poachers kill tens of thousands of elephants a year to meet demand for the material, despite the trade ban, according to the convention on international trade in endangered species and other groups.\n\na washington, d.c.-based conservation group, environmental investigation agency (eia), said late last year that it had found loopholes and weaknesses in japan's ivory controls.\n\nthe group also said the yahoo japan auctions site sold more than 12 tons of ivory products, including whole elephant tusks, in 2012-2014. that site and others feature thousands of ads for ivory and ivory products.\n\nthe international environmental campaign group avaaz addressed its petition to yahoo ceo marissa mayer and manabu miyasaka, ceo of yahoo japan, and all other companies allowing ivory sales online.\n\nas global citizens, we are appalled that you allow ivory to be sold on your site/platform, fueling elephant extinction, it says. we call on you to urgently stop all ivory sales from sites/platforms in japan and all other markets.\n\nsoftbank said in a statement it had no comment on the issue.\n\nyahoo japan's kaminaga said the company was in touch with the environment ministry and other agencies on the issue and with yahoo and other shareholders.\n\nyou can't say there's absolutely no intention to change, she said when asked if yahoo japan might alter its stance on the issue.\n\nin september, the u.s. and china agreed to work toward nearly complete bans on the ivory trade, and japan is increasingly isolated in its stance favoring continued sales.\n\neia contends that widespread use of fake documents has enabled traders to legalize more than 1,000 tusks a year since 2011.\n\nindividually owned tusks face no registration requirement in japan, and the tusks aren't marked in any way to ensure that the documents are valid for the items being registered.
topeka, kan. -- less than three weeks after gop gov. sam brownback signed tightened rules for kansas amusement parks, lawmakers who were spurred by the death of a colleague's son are proposing to delay the law's implementation.\n\nthe house federal and state affairs committee met thursday afternoon and passed tweaks to the new requirement that amusement rides be inspected by qualified, outside inspectors. they also voted to push off the implementation until july 2018. the law was set to go into effect july 1.\n\ncaleb schwab, 10, was killed while on the world's tallest water slide at a kansas city, kansas, water park. family photo\n\nrepublican rep. john barker, who chairs the committee, has called the old regulations some of the loosest in the country. he led a charge to change the law after republican rep. scott schwab's son, caleb, was killed last year on a water slide in kansas city.\n\nbarker said the department of labor asked for some minor changes and to delay the new law's implementation. he said some local carnival operators were concerned they wouldn't be ready to comply by july 1 and wouldn't be able to run their rides.\n\nthe department of labor regulates amusement parks and will have to develop rules, regulations and permit processes in accord with the new law.\n\ndeputy general counsel j.l. mcfarland also said in a statement that the department asked lawmakers to delay implementation over concerns that some parks wouldn't be able to come into compliance in time.\n\nwe look forward to developing the necessary permitting and registrations systems so that kansans are afforded the safety protections of the original bill, mcfarland said in the statement.\n\nbrownback said he had heard that people were hoping to adjust the law and its impact on rural, county-fair groups.\n\nlawmakers nearly unanimously supported the stricter inspection requirements for amusement parks when the bill passed both chambers last month.\n\nthe new law requires that rides be inspected by a qualified inspector who is either an inspector certified by one of several national boards; a certified engineer with two years of experience in the amusement park field, at least one of those in inspections; or someone with five years of experience in the amusement park field, two of those in inspections. the new law also requires parks to report injuries.\n\nkansas' previous law allowed parks to do their own inspections. that policy came under scrutiny after caleb, who was 10, died last year on schlitterbahn water park's verruckt water slide, a 17-story tower that was dubbed the world's tallest.\n\nschwab declined to comment on the implementation delay. he stayed quiet on the bill until he gave an emotional endorsement on the house floor last month.\n\nthe schwab family has settled for nearly $20 million with the park's owners, the manufacturer of the raft that carried riders down the slide, a general contractor and a company that consulted on the slide.\n\nthe verruckt water slide remains closed and will be torn down at the completion of an ongoing investigation by the kansas attorney general's office.\n\nwhen it initially opened, the park advertised the ride for only people 14 years and older but was later removed from its website. the combined weight of the passengers in the raft must fall between 400 and 550 pounds.\n\ntwo other women, unrelated to schwab, were in the raft when the boy died. they suffered injuries to their faces, according to authorities.\n\nthe apparent shift away from the age restriction could be one of the questions in determining liability, according to cbs news legal analyst rikki klieman, who said the park owner and ride designer face potential legal troubles over schwab's death.\n\nthere's also anecdotal evidence of problems with the ride's safety equipment. parkgoer paul oberhauser told cbs news his belt came off while riding with a friend and his 9-year-old son.\n\nas soon as i hit the bottom of the first curve the shoulder strap just kind of busted loose, oberhauser said.\n\nhe said he had to grip handles by his legs to hold on and told park staff what happened.\n\nthey kinda said, 'oh no, really,' or something, 'yes, that's not good.' and so it sounded like you know they were gonna do something about it, oberhauser said.

in an interview with cbs evening news anchor norah o'donnell, senator bernie sanders talked about the cost of his health care plan, his relationship with former rival hillary clinton and the impact of the impeachment trial of president donald trump. sanders told o'donnell it's disappointing to not be meeting with voters in iowa, but acknowledged the importance of attending the trial in washington, d.c.\n\nread o'donnell's interview with sanders below.\n\nis the impeachment trial putting sanders at a disadvantage?\n\nnorah o'donnell: so impeachment's now gonna keep you here in washington for about 10 days and not in iowa. does that place you at a distinct disadvantage?\n\n\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, let me be frank. i mean, obviously, when we had planned out our schedule, trust me, we were not planning to be in washington this week. we had set up a number of town meetings all over the state. we usually bring out good crowds. so it is disappointing to me not to be in iowa, talking to the people there.\n\n\n\no'donnell: don't you think it's important business?\n\n\n\nsanders: here? well, of course, it is. and i am accepting my constitutional responsibility. but what i'm saying, obviously, it's at a disadvantage.\n\n\n\no'donnell: do you think it places biden at an advantage over you?\n\n\n\nsanders: politically in the last week or so of the campaign, yeah, i think it does. i mean, he and others, not just biden, are able to go out, talk to people. that's really important.\n\non his role in the impeachment trial\n\n\n\no'donnell: on saturday, the president's legal team will make their presentation. is there anything they could say that would change your mind?\n\n\n\nsenator bernie sanders: look, i am functioning as a jurist. i want to hear all sides. but i will tell you right now what has upset me the most and upset the american people is: how do you have a fair trial when you don't have witnesses when you can't get documents? what is the president, what are the republicans hiding?\n\nit's unusual for a senator to be seated for nine hours\n\no'donnell: we don't get to see your colleagues during the trial. the cameras are not pointed at the senators. take us inside. i mean, what is everybody doing?\n\n\n\nsanders: i think it's unusual for a senator, especially somebody who's running for president (i think we have four or five of those on the floor right now) to be seated for nine hours. it's just not the way the senate usually works. so i think what people are trying to do is to listen as intently as they can.\n\n\n\no'donnell: are the senators staying awake?\n\n\n\nsanders: in most cases.\n\nhow much will health care cost?\n\no'donnell: i want to talk about your agenda. you want the government to pay for everyone's health care.\n\n\n\nsanders: i want the united states to do what every other major country on earth does: guarantee health care to all people as a human right.\n\n\n\no'donnell: but you've been confronted by voters on the campaign trail and acknowledge that there will be job losses as a result of such a plan. is that a hard sell, that your plan?\n\n\n\nsanders: yeah, it would.\n\n\n\no'donnell: is gonna cost?\n\n\n\nsanders: sure, it might be a hard sell. the american people want a health care system that works for them, not for huge profits for the drug companies who are ripping us off every day and the insurance companies. at the end of the day, we will create more jobs. will there be some job loss? yes, there will. we're gonna create more jobs. we need more doctors. we need more nurses. we need more psychologists and psychiatrists to help us deal with the opioid epidemic. there'll be a net plus of jobs.\n\n\n\no'donnell: you're a self-proclaimed socialist.\n\n\n\nsanders: democratic, put in there, please.\n\n\n\no'donnell: thank you. your agenda has promised free health care for everybody, free college tuition, and to pay off people's college loans. the price tag for that is estimated to be $60 trillion over ten years, correct?\n\n\n\nsanders: well, look. we have political opponents.\n\n\n\no'donnell: you don't know… you don't know how much your plan costs?\n\n\n\nsanders: you don't know. nobody knows. this is impossible to predict.\n\n\n\no'donnell: you're gonna propose a plan to the american people, and you're not gonna tell 'em how much it costs?\n\n\n\nsanders: course i will. do you know exactly what health care costs will be, one minute, in the next 10 years if we do nothing? it will be a lot more expensive than a medicare-for-all single-payer system.\n\nhis reaction to hillary clinton saying nobody likes him\n\no'donnell: it was also mentioned by senator hillary clinton, who said that while you two were campaigning against each other that you also said that she was unqualified to be president. she said that you foster a toxic culture in your campaign where your prominent supporters, bernie bros, attack women. and will you denounce those attacks?\n\n\n\nsanders: i have, of course. i am sorry for what secretary clinton had to say. i know she said that nobody likes me, right? i mean, this is not the kind of rhetoric that we need right now when we are trying to bring the democratic party together to defeat the most dangerous president in american history.\n\n\n\no'donnell: when's the last time you spoke with senator clinton?\n\n\n\nsanders: it's been quite a while.\n\n\n\no'donnell: do you think it's important to have her supporters if you were the nominee?\n\n\n\nsanders: well, right now my job is to win in iowa. it's to win in new hampshire, do everything we can. but what secretary clinton did indicate, i was glad to hear this, is that she would support the democratic nominee. and if that's me, i look forward to her support.\n\n\n\n\n\nhis feud with warren\n\no'donnell: i want to turn to your feud with senator warren. did you and senator warren ever discuss her allegation that you said a woman couldn't win the presidency?\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm sorry. i really-- i know the media likes that issue, but i'm not gonna get into that issue. we had it out. senator warren is somebody i've known for 25 years, have a lot of respect for. we're gonna go forward together. and i have the feeling we'll be working together.\n\ncan sanders defeat trump?\n\no'donnell: president obama's former campaign manager, jim messina, said-- this about you in a matchup with president trump, i'm a business guy, the economy's good, and this guy's a socialist, that that's what trump would say about you. do you acknowledge it would be an uphill battle against president trump?\n\n\n\nsanders: you've obviously seen the latest polls, right?\n\n\n\no'donnell: uh-huh.\n\nsanders: how am i doin'? i think the last cnn poll had me seven points ahead of trump. i think we are the strongest-- campaign to defeat trump, and i will tell you why. to defeat donald trump, you're gonna need an incredibly large voter turnout. i think our campaign is the campaign of energy, of excitement that can reach out to young people, reach out to working-class people who today are sick and tired of a government and an economy that works for the people on top and ignores them.\n\nuniting the democratic party\n\no'donnell: can you unite the democratic party? we've just talked about criticism from senator warren, criticism from senator clinton, criticism from the obama camp.\n\n\n\nsanders: you know, norah, as you well know, when there are camp-go back to 2008 and look at obama and clinton. you think there was criticism between the two? there was bitterness between the two.\n\n\n\no'donnell: i know. the primary stretched through the summer.\n\nsanders: that's right.\n\n\n\no'donnell: beginning of the summer.\n\nsanders: that's right. i mean, that's what politics is about. you know, unfortunately, that's the way it is. but i have no doubt that if i become the nominee, we're gonna be able to unite the party because, number one, every democrat and a majority of independents know how dangerous donald trump is. how he's trying to undermine democracy. how he's running a corrupt administration. how he is a racist and a sexist, and so forth. we're gonna unite the democratic party. and the issues that we are talking about, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, health care for all, dealing with the global crisis of climate change, that is an agenda that will bring the american people together to defeat trump.\n\nhis battle with joe biden on social security\n\no'donnell: let me ask you about vice president joe biden. he is looking for an apology for a video circulated by your campaign that he says takes his position on social security out of context. will you apologize?\n\n\n\nsanders: no, of course, i won't. not on that one, i won't. for many, many years as a united states senator, joe biden has been on the floor and elsewhere, talking about the need to freeze or cut social security benefits. he voted for the balanced budget amendment.\n\n\n\no'donnell: so you believe it is wrong that vice president biden supported a freeze of cost-of-living adjustments in social security?\n\n\n\nsanders: absolutely. bad vote. i voted against it. there are ways to raise money in order to protect the working families of this country. cutting social security ain't one of 'em.\n\n\n\no'donnell: all right. senator bernie sanders, thank you for being here.\n\n\n\nsanders: thank you.
the parents of a florida state university student who died in an alleged hazing incident are pushing for a new federal anti-hazing law. junior andrew coffey was found unresponsive on a couch the morning after a pi kappa phi fraternity party in november. a lawsuit claims he'd been asked to drink an entire bottle of 101-proof bourbon. he died of acute alcohol poisoning.\n\nnine fraternity brothers pleaded not guilty to hazing charges.\n\nhazing has killed at least one person a year since 1961, reports cbs news correspondent tony dokoupil. andrew was one of four victims in 2017. in the lawsuit, the coffey family is seeking justice and accountability. their goal is to help lead a new movement against hazing, one that might keep their son's memory alive by saving others.\n\nif people in the past had gotten together, maybe my son would still be here, if hazing wasn't a problem. so therefore, we have to yell as loud as we can in order to get this stopped, father tom coffey told cbs this morning, speaking publicly for the first time. i don't want another family going through what we go through. crying ourselves to sleep.\n\nsandra and tom coffey cbs news\n\nit's been just four months since tom and sandra coffey got the news that their 20-year-old son had died in an alleged hazing incident.\n\nwhen you send your child away, it's the last thing you're thinking of. never even crosses your mind, tom added. it's getting him into his dorm, getting his classes lined up. getting, you know ... this never crossed my mind.\n\ni remember driving, going, 'this doesn't happen to us,' sandra said.\n\nandrew was a high school athlete with dreams of joining the navy after college.\n\ngreat kid, sandra said. you could count on him.\n\nhandsome as the day is long and a smile that'll light up a room, you know, tom described.\n\nandrew coffey (left) with his family coffey family\n\nbecoming a brother in pi kappa phi was a goal even before he enrolled at florida state.\n\n\n\nhis friends belonged and he'd joined with them at some of the fraternity functions and everything else and wanted to belong, tom said.\n\nwhat did you guys think about him becoming a brother? dokoupil asked.\n\njust told him we had a deal. we just said ... grades suffer because of partying or something like that, then, you know, you're out. and he agreed to that, tom said.\n\nbut the idea of a fraternity sounds like a good one, right? dokoupil asked.\n\nit does. support system. brothers, friendships for life, tom said.\n\nbut according to a lawsuit filed by the coffeys, the fraternity had been hazing and having pledges abuse alcohol for years. on the night of his death, andrew drank a bottle of 101-proof bourbon in an initiation ritual known as the family bottle.\n\nit wasn't until the next morning that a pledge called 911.\n\nhis lips are purple, his body is extremely stiff and... i can't wake him up and i honestly don't feel a pulse, the caller said to the 911 dispatcher.\n\nwhy the fraternity brothers waited so long to call is a question that wakes us up in the middle of the night, sandra said.\n\n\n\nthere were estimated 100 people at that party, tom said. and 99 of them didn't help my son. ... andrew died in a room full of people that just didn't care. and he died alone.\n\na spokesperson for pi kappa phi said with the pending litigation we are unable to provide comment.\n\n\n\ndavid bianchi, the coffeys' attorney who helped pass a florida law in 2005 that made hazing a felony, also blocks defendants from claiming the victim went along willingly.\n\nhazing is the byproduct of peer pressure, and peer pressure gets really good young people to do things that they would otherwise never do, bianchi said.\n\nthe legislation, named after hazing victim chad meredith, is one of the strictest in the nation. seventeen years after chad's death, parents gerry and carol meredith are still fighting to expand the laws.\n\n\n\nyou know, every morning i see his picture, i'll talk to him about it. sayin', 'they're still workin' on it.' so i pray, carol said.\n\nthere will be people who will watch this interview and they'll think to themselves, 'hazing has been happening for decades.' what hope is there really that it's ever gonna end? it's an unstoppable problem, dokoupil pointed out.\n\nwell, if we don't do something, it definitely is not gonna end, gerry said.\n\nthey've joined with the coffeys and more than a dozen other surviving families to form push, parents united to stop hazing. it includes the piazza family, whose son tim died last winter at penn state. together they are rallying for justice.\n\n\n\nhow do you break the cycle? dokoupil asked.\n\n\n\naccountability and education, tom said. a federal statute has to be written that goes from the top, you know, where the national fraternity is at risk, as well as the local chapter. and then education to high school students.\n\nif they succeed, their hope is that push never has a new member.\n\n\n\nit's about legacy, dokoupil said.\n\nyeah, if we keep his spirit alive, then he's not dead, tom said, getting emotional.\n\nshortly after andrew's death, fsu acted swiftly in temporarily banning greek life. but fsu president john thrasher tells us there is still room for improvement.\n\ni don't want it to happen again on our campus, and i hope other campuses are paying attention to what we're doing, because i think -- i think we are making progress. but, i will say this: i think greek life as we know it today has to change -- has to change -- in order for us to move forward with the positive things that the greek community does, thrasher said.\n\nthe coffeys and all the victims' families said it's important for schools to step up and have stricter policies.
the price you pay at the pharmacy is going up — again. prices increased on more than 250 drugs in the beginning of the year, with an average jump of 6.3 percent, according to data from rx saving solutions, a consultant to health plans and employers. that's down from the 400 drugs that saw price jumps last year, but prescription drugs still remain one of the highest out-of-pocket medical costs for many consumers.\n\nthis in spite of several trump administration initiatives over the past weeks designed to lower the cost of prescription drugs. in addition, house democrats joined the fray last week with sweeping investigations of pharmaceutical drug-pricing practices.\n\nas washington continues to wrestle with the pharmaceutical industry, consumers may actually find the most relief from their own efforts. understanding how drug pricing works and learning to navigate that maze can result in dramatic savings. here's what you need to know.\n\nyour insurance isn't always the best option\n\nsometimes you may be better off paying cash for a drug than using your insurance. that sounds counterintuitive, especially because so many consumers, especially medicare part d recipients, spend hours trying to find insurance plans the cover the drugs they use.\n\nbut often a pharmacy will offer a discount on a drug that makes the cash price cheaper than the co-pay your insurance company or pharmacy benefit manager (pbm) has negotiated for the same drug, be it brand name or generic. for example, a common generic for lipitor, the cholesterol lowering medicine, comes with a standard $40 co-pay under many plans. but at some pharmacies offering discounts, the total cash price of the drug may be only $9.\n\nwhat's more, until very recently, pharmacists were prohibited from telling you about these price differentials because they were under contract not to say so with various pbms.\n\nlast october, the trump administration passed new rules barring these gag orders. now pharmacists may tell you about cheaper alternatives, but — and this is the catch — they don't have to volunteer this information. your pharmacist is only obligated to tell you if you ask.\n\nso, every time you fill a prescription covered by your insurance be sure to ask your pharmacist what is your co-pay, and, importantly, what is the retail price of the drug. the answer will make it clear which way to go because now the pharmacist must offer you the best price.\n\nmeanwhile, your prescription drug insurer may push you to go to a certain pharmacy, chain store or mail order service to fill your prescription because they have negotiated lower prices overall with a certain vendor. that makes sense. but again, it may not be the best deal when you consider other prices and discounts.\n\nthe recent rift between walmart and cvs caremark pharmacy benefit management, during which the two companies butted heads over drug pricing, is evidence of how volatile the prescription drug landscape can be. always compare the preferred pharmacy price with others in your area, said dr. nancy simpkins, rx saver's medical expert. preferred can be a misnomer. it doesn't necessarily mean cheapest.\n\nyou might get a better deal across the street\n\ninsurance aside, many times consumers simply don't realize just how much that the price of drugs can vary from one pharmacy to another, even in their own zip codes. that's because each pharmacy negotiates its own contracts with pbms for multiple drugs.\n\nenter the new array of smartphone drug pricing apps, including goodrx, onerx, retailmenot rx saver, and scriptsave. plug in the drug you're looking for and you'll find a list of prices at pharmacies in your area. in some cases, you may find additional discounts generated by the apps themselves.\n\nbottom line, that's a lot of shopping. to find the absolute best deal, you need to compare not only among pharmacies in your area but also among the deals offered by each of the apps. that can get a bit time consuming, but in many cases the savings warrant it.\n\nthere are caveats. for one, apps are frequently updated and discounts change often. the deal you get this month on say, that lipitor generic 'script, may not be available for the same price at the same pharmacy next month. in other words, you have to go hunting all over again.\n\nalso, most doctors usually phone in prescriptions rather than write out an order on their pad. if the prescription is automatically sent to your regular pharmacy but you find a better deal elsewhere, you'll need to call your regular pharmacy and ask them to transfer the prescription. they will do it willingly, but it adds an extra step. simpkins suggests going retro and always asking for a hard copy of your prescription so you can have more flexibility.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this article.
one flag missing from this month's olympics is russia's. russia is banned because, during the last winter games, the russian government engineered a doping scheme that cheated clean athletes. we know this because the man who ran the doping told the world. but grigory rodchenkov's story is more than just a tale of olympic cheating, it's a window into vladimir putin's russia. rodchenkov, came out of hiding to speak with us because he hopes this interview might save his life.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov is waiting for a bullet. in 2015, he escaped to the united states carrying the files of russia's doping program. he asked us to disguise his appearance.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov, disguised for his interview with 60 minutes cbs news\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: this was done for security reasons. there is information that my life in jeopardy, and we took all necessary steps.\n\nscott pelley: is it the kremlin that wants to kill you?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: kremlin wants me to stop talking,\n\nscott pelley: vladimir putin wants you to stop talking?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes\n\nscott pelley: and people who cross vladimir putin often die of mysterious circumstances?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes, yes. even on u.s. soil.\n\nin his disguise you can't see what he looks like these days, so he doesn't mind us showing you what he looked like back in 2015 when he was the director of russia's anti-doping lab in moscow. he was a former college athlete with a degree in chemistry and a lifelong interest in performance-enhancing drugs.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov in 2015 icarus/netflix/grigory rodchenkov\n\nscott pelley: was it your aim in the moscow lab to catch cheaters or protect cheaters?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: it was dual, you know. of course, as each accredited laboratory, we have to report certain percentile of positives, 1% to 2% of positives. but on the other hand, we have to protect russian national team and the ultimate goal was, win at any cost at world championships and olympics.\n\nscott pelley: to win at any cost at the world championships and the sochi olympics?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: including sochi olympics. it was the same concept which remains untouchable since soviet time.\n\nlike in soviet times, the kremlin will tell you today that rodchenkov is a criminal and mentally ill. in 2011, he and his sister were investigated for selling performance-enhancing drugs.\n\nscott pelley: when you were under investigation at that time, you tried to take your own life?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes. because they tried to blackmail me, to threaten me. they asked me to tell lies about my sister. otherwise, you will go to prison.\n\nscott pelley: what did you do?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: i punched knife to my heart.\n\nan emergency room saved his life and soon, the kremlin would change his life. russia was preparing to host the 2014 winter games in sochi. vladimir putin was determined to win. and mysteriously, the investigation against russia's doping mastermind was dropped.\n\nscott pelley: who got you out of that jam?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: of course putin. but it had--\n\nscott pelley: vladimir putin?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes.\n\nscott pelley: so vladimir putin in your estimation needed you?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes.\n\nsochi was the first olympics hosted by russia since 1980. to win at any cost, rodchenkov formulated an illicit performance-enhancing prescription that contained three banned drugs. he told us the bobsled team was among those using his concoction. at the end of the games, russia came out on top with 33 medals.\n\nscott pelley: how many russian golds were there in sochi?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: thirteen, 1-3.\n\nscott pelley: and of the 13, how many of those do you believe were won by athletes who were dirty?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: five.\n\nscott pelley: what sports were those?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: biathlon, skiing, bobsled…and skeleton.\n\nfive medals, by the way, was the difference between first place and the second place finish of the united states.\n\nscott pelley: no russian athlete was ever found dirty at the sochi games?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: during sochi games, no one.\n\nat sochi, athletes gave urine samples after their competitions. the samples went into these tamper-proof bottles used by the international olympic committee and the world anti-doping agency. when the cap is tightened—it locks. and to be removed, it must be destroyed. the bottles were then delivered to this high-security lab on the grounds of the games.\n\ncorrespondent scott pelley and grigory rodchenkov look at a diagram of the high-security lab cbs news\n\nscott pelley: now, this area shaded in red, this is the secure area?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: correct.\n\nthe lab had a secure side and a non-secure side, separated by a locked door.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: it's absolutely impossible even to touch this door. this door only for emergency exit. there are cameras from both sides. and immediately opening this door, you have alarm and the security, people sitting, controlling the whole laboratory.\n\nby day, rodchenkov was the director of the olympic anti-doping lab. by night, he was russia's director of doping. his accomplice was evgeny blokhin.\n\nscott pelley: what was his job?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: he was a plumber, officially, taking care about the cleaning.\n\nscott pelley: he was supposed to be a plumber?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes. he has his plumber-- badger\n\nevgeny the plumber was an agent of the russian intelligence service -- the fsb. rodchenkov says that he, his assistants and fsb agents, worked through the night to replace dirty russian urine samples with clean samples that had been collected and frozen before the games.\n\nscott pelley: what is this?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: this is mouse hole from room 125.\n\ncbs news\n\nthis hole, near the floor, with a cover on it, was built into the lab as a secret pass through from the high-security side to the non-secure side.\n\nscott pelley: so you've got this super high-security laboratory and nobody notices that?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: because there is a drawer.\n\nscott pelley: oh, it was behind a piece of furniture?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: of course. and you take, it's a small drawer, you take it away. it so simple and so effective.\n\nscott pelley: so simple and so effective.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: effective, yes.\n\nthe dirty russian samples were passed through the hole. evegny the plumber put them in his tool bag and walked them to a russian intelligence operation nearby.\n\nscott pelley: who figured out how to open those bottles?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: fsb experts.\n\nscott pelley: the fsb experts.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: genius.\n\nscott pelley: geniuses?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: absolutely. i never saw how it was done. i saw only the same miracle. bottle was closed and now bottle is opened.\n\nthe bottles used which held the urine samples. berlinger\n\nthe tamper proof bottles were filled with clean urine. rodchenkov made sure that the chemistry of the sample was normal in every way, and then the bottles were closed and slipped back through the mouse hole.\n\nscott pelley: this was cheating on an industrial scale.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: correct.\n\nrodchenkov told us the details of the plot were known to vitaly mutko, russia's minister of sport.\n\nscott pelley: vitaly mutko reported to whom?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: vitaly mutko reported to putin. they are friends since early years in st. petersburg since '90s.\n\nscott pelley: and do you believe that putin was aware of the doping program?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: i do believe. moreover, mutko was telling me that putin has permanent concern how preparation for sochi is ongoing, whether we have any problem, whether we need any other support.\n\nscott pelley: he was telling the minister of sport and through him, you, that you could have anything you needed?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: exactly.\n\nthe russian government admits there are russian athletes who have cheated, but it claims that it wasn't the kremlin, it was rodchenkov alone.\n\nscott pelley: putin says, you're a liar.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: i'm not liar. i was not telling truth in russia. but coming to united states, i am telling truth.\n\nin 2015, rodchenkov was forced out of the moscow lab. not for sochi, but because the world anti-doping agency found that russians were dirty in the 2012 london games. he fled to los angeles with the help of bryan fogel, a filmmaker shooting a documentary about rodchenkov.\n\nscott pelley: when you came to the united states, did you bring anything with you?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes. i brought with me backup of my moscow and sochi computer because in the big computer-- office computer, i destroyed all files, following order from fsb.\n\nscott pelley: but you kept some of the information about the sochi scheme on your laptop and you brought it with you.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes.\n\nrodchenkov told his story in the documentary titled icarus which is nominated this year for an academy award. he also told the new york times, and the world anti-doping agency. the agency found witnesses who backed up his story and marks left by the tools used to tamper with the tamper-proof bottles. russia was stripped of 13 sochi medals. more than 100 russians were banned from the rio games. and at the current winter games russia itself has been disqualified although some russian athletes, not under suspicion, are competing under the olympic flag. all of these sanctions add up to reasons for revenge.\n\nscott pelley: do you believe that grigory's life is in danger?\n\njim walden: there is no question about that.\n\nattorney jim walden is trying to get the u.s. government to let rodchenkov stay so he won't be deported to russia where he is a wanted man.\n\njim walden: they are desperate to silence him. and the day after the international olympic committee-- banned the russians-- law enforcement came to me and said that security protocols needed to be changed immediately. because we had to assume that there was a team of russians here looking for him.\n\nscott pelley: american law enforcement told you that.\n\njim walden: correct. so it couldn't be more serious.\n\nscott pelley: how do you think this ends for him?\n\njim walden: i think grigory has so much incredible experience with doping that he can be a powerful tool for anti-doping authorities.\n\nscott pelley: do you believe the olympics can ever be clean?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: you could believe, but in fact, it's human nature. it's our sins. it has nothing to do with sports. but there are 10% or 15% of people who are incorrigibles. you can do nothing. they are cheaters by their natures. incorrigibles, 15%.\n\nscott pelley: how many countries are doping?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: twenty plus.\n\nscott pelley: twenty plus.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: for sure.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov was a cheater by nature, an incorrigible to use his word. his recipes for banned drugs are now well known among competitors and are likely to outlive him.\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: so now it's a big-- big problem, and i am sorry to creating such problem because of my experience and knowledge.\n\nscott pelley: you are sorry that you created this?\n\ngrigory rodchenkov: yes, because now it's effective and working, and it's not my contribution to fight against doping. absolutely not.\n\nearlier this month, an international court removed the lifetime bans on two-thirds of the russian athletes allegedly caught doping at sochi, the court said there was insufficient evidence against the athletes themselves. as a result, 9 of the 13 medals taken from the russians were reinstated. vitaly mutko, the former russian minister of sport, was promoted to deputy prime minister after the sochi victory.\n\nproduced by henry schuster and rachael morehouse.

as the ongoing coronavirus pandemic keeps businesses closed and social distancing measures in place, americans are turning to the hobbies they love to help deal with the self-isolation. dr. lisa damour, a psychologist, said hobbies can be a positive form of coping that can help bolster self-esteem and help pass the time.\n\nthere's a lot of benefits to hobbies, especially in times like this, damour said. it's meaningful work, and meaningful work is something that we know helps people through high stress.\n\ncheryl traylor is using her time at home to embrace her passion for art.\n\n\n\ntraylor, 62, worked as a sales adviser for h&m for five years before she was furloughed. after getting the news, she immediately started preparing to make the best of the abrupt change to her daily life in new york city.\n\neverything has stopped. now is the time to go back to what is important to you, she told cbs news. for me, that's my art.\n\nbefore becoming a mom in the 1980s, traylor got her associate degree at parsons school of design, and worked as a fashion illustrator for jcpenny.\n\nsince being furloughed, traylor has started sketching again, and said she has been inspired by stories of how others are coping with the coronavirus crisis.\n\na lot of people are going to discover a lot of things about themselves, and a lot of things about, you know, what they missed from the hustle and bustle of just being in the mix, traylor said.\n\nshe credited the strong support of her church community and her family, who she communicates with over video chat, as another inspiration.\n\ntraylor said that one project of importance for her is a gift for her niece, who is due to give birth in june, years after having a stillborn birth on mother's day. preliminary sketches, shared with cbs news, show a 12-year-old girl holding her baby sister.\n\n\n\nwhen i told my niece's mother, my sister, what i was doing, she cried, she said.\n\npreliminary sketches of cheryl traylor's project for her niece. cheryl traylor\n\nas for people in her position who might be thinking about picking up a paint brush or pencil, traylor said that when it hits you, do it. especially with all this time you've got, do it.\n\ni want to encourage people with my art, she said. i'm not looking at it right now in terms of commerce, but i'm looking at the art right now in terms of being a ministry that just reaches out and makes people feel good.\n\nfurther down the east coast, pennsylvania resident david wilson's refuge from the pandemic-forced new normal is his garden.\n\nwilson, who works at overdevest nurseries in bridgeton, new jersey, is encouraging other americans to turn to nature for solace as well, calling gardening a tremendous relaxation.\n\nit's great therapy — you don't need to be near anyone else, you're out in an outdoor space, fresh air, you're with nature, birds are chirping, he said. it's just wonderful to see nature, it's reassuring really to see nature happening.\n\nwilson highlighted the pride that comes from growing and nurturing something, and said growing a plant can help with getting through tough times.\n\n\n\nand for those who can't plant a garden in their home, wilson suggests planting a window box or getting an easy-to-grow indoor plant like a succulent. for those who can't do either, wilson made virtual walkthroughs of the private garden he and his wife have planted.\n\nit's getting close to nature, and yeah, you might be in the middle of the city but there's a lot of stuff like that you can do, he said.\n\ngrow some plants there and cheer yourself up — it's good to have something you can nurture.\n\nalthough both gardening and art can be a source of joy to many, dr. damour stressed that hobbies are highly personal, and what might work for one person may not necessarily help another.\n\nand if hobbies aren't their cup of tea, so long as they're finding some healthy way to cope with the challenge of covid-19 ... that's good too, she said.
dallas – a former catholic priest suspected of sexually abusing as many as 100 boys in the late 70s and 80s, spent his last seven years in the dallas-fort worth area where he used an alias on social media to meet young men. cbs dfw reports that james brzyski, considered one of the worst abusers in the history of the archdiocese of philadelphia, was found dead in september in a fort worth motel room.\n\nan autopsy revealed brzyski suffered from heart disease and was full of vodka and anti-depressants at the time of his death.\n\nrecords, obtained through the texas public information act, show that police recovered a laptop, thumb drives and a cell phone from brzyski's room. fort worth police detectives, however, said they found nothing further to investigate.\n\nfort worth motel where james brzyski was found dead. cbs dfw\n\nbut while brzyski's death may have been an accident, the cbs dfw found the life he led, to his very last days, is worth investigating.\n\nthis man was a monster, said john delaney, who was raped by brzyski in the early 1980s at saint cecilia parish in philadelphia.\n\nas bad as you could possibly imagine it could be, that's what happened, said delaney, who was 11-years-old when the assaults began. it broke me as a kid.\n\ndecades later, when the catholic church sex scandal began to unfold, a grand jury investigation revealed brzyski sexually abused at least 17 victims and noted that he may have abused as many as 100 boys. the 2005 report released by the grand jury called brzyski one of the most brutal abusers in the philadelphia archdiocese.\n\nbrzyski was kicked out of the church, but eluded prosecution due to the statute of limitations.\n\nit was swept under the rug, delaney told cbs dfw.\n\nafter years of living the life of a nomad, brzyski made his way to dallas in 2010. he first lived in southeast dallas where he roomed with a man who, himself, was just years before arrested for sexually assaulting a boy. brzyski then lived at two other dallas apartments, most recently across from top golf on park lane in northeast dallas.\n\na month before his death, a reporter and photographer with the philadelphia inquirer confronted brzyski at his park lane apartment. the newspaper was working on a story about brzyski's 1980s victims committing suicide, but the former priest declined to answer their questions.\n\nthe priest's park lane neighbors say they knew nothing of his dark past, but do recall that a young man from australia moved in with brzyski in late 2014.\n\ncbs dfw discovered the two not only lived together, but also married in oklahoma in december 2014. brzyski was 63 and his partner 21 when they wed, according to their marriage license.\n\nfights between the two brought police out to their dallas apartment just weeks after their marriage. a police report from january 2015 questions whether the australian was in fact 21. the report lists him as 15. brzyski told the officers that the two met online, but didn't mention they were married. while cbs dfw found no evidence of a divorce, it appears the two broke up in early 2015. cbs dfw located the australian's family. their attorney told cbs dfw they did not want to talk about the relationship.\n\nmr. brzyski caused great harm and trauma to many people, they wrote in an email.\n\ncbs dfw's investigation found that brzyski — using aliases like joshua williams and joshua in dallas — appears to have connected online with many young men during his time in dallas. brzyski had at least seven social media accounts, including facebook, instagram, tumbler and twitter. the accounts are filled with pictures of overweight young men, some who appear to be boys.\n\ni am a feeder in dallas, reads a may 2016 tweet by @joshuawillie3. i will fatten you without limit. the tweet then provides an email address and phone number.\n\nplano det. jeff rich, a nationally-known child exploitation investigator, said what stands out to him is that nearly all of brzyski's online friends are young males.\n\ni don't see a lot of adult activity on there, det. rich said. i see a certain type of individual that he certainly is seeking to be friends with and those are typically more vulnerable types in our society.\n\na photo of a painting posted to brzyski's instagram in july 2017 brings back horrible memories for delaney. the painting depicts a naked boy being feed through a funnel.\n\njohn delaney cbs dfw\n\nthat's the one that has never sat right with me, said delaney, who recalls seeing the painting as a child in brzyski's home. it represents to me that the man is a pedophile. he's attracted to children.\n\nbrzyski was buried in a pauper's grave in arlington in october. even with him gone, delaney said he still fears that there are unknown victims in north texas and elsewhere.\n\nit's sickening to me that they allowed this to happen and because they are keeping everything silent, he said of the catholic church. it afforded him the opportunity to travel around the country and abuse more children.\n\nduring his seven years in north texas, dallas police officers made contact with brzyski on at least five separate occasions, none of which were related to child sexual assaults.\n\nthe archdiocese of philadelphia wouldn't specifically say if they ever alerted north texas police about

london - uncertainty over britain's future in the european union sent the pound plunging monday, as prime minister david cameron tried to shore up support for remaining in the bloc when the u.k. holds a referendum in june.\n\nthe pound fell 1.7 percent to $1.4166, and also sagged 0.5 percent to 1.28 euros, as bookmakers shortened the odds on a vote to leave -- though betting markets still favor a remain victory.\n\nsimon smith, chief economist at fxpro, said the next four months won't be a fun time for the pound, which has weakened in recent months.\n\nit's more the uncertainty that will weigh on the currency, rather than investors taking a view on the outcome and the implications for the economy, which are hard to argue either way, he said.\n\nmany big businesses have warned that leaving the eu -- with its open internal market of 500 million people -- would hammer the british economy. but london mayor boris johnson, a high-profile supporter of an out vote, said fears of economic catastrophe were wildly exaggerated.\n\nhe likened he warnings to those who had said that if britain did not join the euro single currency, london's city financial district would suffer and great mutant rats would gnaw the faces of the last bankers.\n\nit didn't turn out to be true. on the contrary, the city of london is overwhelmingly the preponderant financial center here in this part of the world, indeed it is the biggest on earth, johnson said during a question session at city hall.\n\nthe rhetorical stakes shot sky-high as politicians began a four-month battle to sway british voters ahead of the june 23 referendum, with the opposing sides battling over whether eu membership made britain more or less safe from terrorist attacks.\n\nformer conservative leader iain duncan smith said sunday that the eu's open border, and the inflow of millions of migrants from the middle east and africa, made it more likely terrorists could slip into the uk - even though britain is not part of the eu's borderless schengen zone.\n\nbut defense secretary michael fallon argued that eu membership made the u.k. safer.\n\nit is through the eu that you exchange criminal records and passenger records and work together on counter-terrorism, fallon told the bbc monday.\n\nwe need the collective weight of the eu when you are dealing with russian aggression or terrorism. you need to be part of these big partnerships.\n\ncameron was due to make his case in the house of commons monday, arguing that a deal he struck friday with 27 other eu leaders gives britain special status, exempting the u.k. from ever-closer political bonds with the bloc and protecting the rights of the pound against the euro single currency used by 19 eu countries.\n\ncameron's governing conservative party is deeply split on the issue, with as many as half of tory legislators in favor of leaving the eu -- a prospect known as brexit.\n\nthey include johnson, whose decision to back brexit was a big boost for the leave campaign.\n\nin a column for monday's daily telegraph newspaper, johnson wrote that the referendum offered a once-in-a-lifetime chance for real change.\n\nunlike some dyed-in-the-wool euroskeptics, who want britain to leave the bloc entirely, johnson suggested his goal is to renegotiate a new relationship with the eu after a brexit vote.\n\nthere is only one way to get the change we need -- and that is to vote to go; because all eu history shows that they only really listen to a population when it says 'no,' he wrote.\n\nsix of the 23 members of cameron's cabinet also have announced they will campaign for an exit, though most of the senior figures say they will support the prime minister.
washington -- today's dangerous times look so bleak and uncompromising because americans don't know their history that well, presidential historian and author david mccullough said.\n\nwell, i think we're living in what is clearly a dangerous time, mccullough said on cbs news' face the nation. not just because of international tensions and clouds hanging over, but because we're sort of groping with how to repair an engine that we don't know how to even take apart.\n\nand yes, we've had times where we wanted to change things, mccullough added. but we've also had times that have been more unsettling, more worrisome, more painful, more costly than what we're going through now. and we think this is just so bleak and uncompromising, because we really don't know what we've been through before and how we came through it.\n\namericans got through an influenza epidemic that killed 500,000 people, the civil war, the great depression and two world wars, he said. the key to making sense of today is learning from history, mccullough said.\n\ni think we need to remember who we are and how we got to be where we are and how much we owe to those who went before us, mccullough said. and there's much to be learned from them, much to be learned from history. we are not doing very well or not doing as well as we should in raising our oncoming generations with an appreciation of the story of their country.
neil young has become the latest musician to strike gold with his song catalogue, selling a 50% stake in his music to a british investment company in a deal announced on wednesday.\n\nthe hipgnosis songs fund said it had acquired half of the copyright and income interests in some 1,180 songs written by the 75-year-old rock star, composer of heart of gold, rockin' in the free world and cinnamon girl.\n\nterms were not disclosed.\n\nthe deal comes a month after bob dylan sold publishing rights to more than 600 songs to the universal music publishing group for a reported fortune of between $300 million and a half billion dollars. stevie nicks sold an 80 percent stake in her music to primary wave for a reported $100 million.\n\nmerck mercuriadis, founder of hipgnosis songs fund limited, said that he bought his first neil young album when he was seven years old.\n\n'harvest' was my companion and i know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately, he said. neil young, or at least his music, has been my friend . . . ever since.\n\nthe businessman also said young's late manager, elliot roberts, was equally an idol to him.\n\nin an industry where music sales have dwindled and the concert industry is on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic, song publishing is seen as an increasingly valuable asset. the companies generally push for use of an artist's songs in movies, video games and advertising.\n\nthe latter use has been a sticking point for young, whose 1988 song this note's for you sharply criticized artists who leased their music for advertising campaigns. the accompanying video parodied ads that featured michael jackson and eric clapton.\n\nain't singin' for pepsi\n\nin the song, young sang: ain't singin' for pepsi, ain't singin' for coke. i don't sing for nobody. makes me look like a joke.\n\nin the years since, it has become much more common for musicians to earn income through advertising campaigns. but at least through 2016, young continued to resist having his music used this way, according to rolling stone magazine.\n\nit was unclear whether the hipgnosis deal augers a change in that policy.\n\nin wednesday's announcement, mercuriadis said that his company and young have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs. there will never be a 'burger of gold' but we will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them on neil's terms.\n\nyoung has released some 70 albums as a solo artist and with bands like buffalo springfield, crazy horse and crosby, stills, nash & young.
the former governor brought in to help michigan state university recover from the larry nassar sexual abuse scandal announced wednesday that he would resign as the school's interim president amid a backlash over his comments about some of the ex-sports doctor's victims.\n\njohn engler, who had resisted pressure to step down over previous remarks, announced his plans in an 11-page letter to dianne byrum, chairwoman of michigan state's board of trustees. it makes no mention of recent criticism of his comments and instead lists what he considers to be his accomplishments in his one year of service, saying the university is a dramatically better, stronger institution.\n\nit has been an honor to serve my beloved university, he wrote.\n\nengler said he was in texas attending a burial service for his late father-in-law. his resignation, which he said he was making at the trustees' request, is effective january 23.\n\nwith his sudden reversal, engler joins a long list of people — including his predecessor as president -— who have been fired, forced out of their jobs or charged with crimes amid fallout from the school's handling of the once-renowned sports doctor stretching back decades.\n\nthe final straw for the university's board came last week when engler told the detroit news that nassar's victims had been in the spotlight and are still enjoying that moment at times, you know, the awards and recognition.\n\nnassar is now serving decades-long prison sentences for sexually assaulting patients and possessing child pornography.\n\nthe associated press left messages wednesday seeking comment from engler, who was hired last february following the resignation of president lou anna simon over the nassar scandal.\n\nbrian mosallam told the ap the board had enough votes to force engler out at a special meeting scheduled thursday at the school in east lansing.\n\nbyrum stopped short of confirming she asked engler to resign but told the ap he had a decision to make because the board is poised to name a new interim leader at thursday's meeting. both byrum and mosallam are democrats, and engler is a former republican governor.\n\nmosallam, a long-time engler critic, said on twitter john engler's reign of terror is over. his tweet followed a post by byrum announcing thursday's meeting.\n\njohn engler's reign of terror is over. https://t.co/lyumrnuww4 — brian mosallam (@bmosallam63) january 16, 2019\n\nafter engler was hired by the board, michigan state agreed to a $500 million settlement with 332 women and girls who said they were sexually assaulted by nassar. of that, $75 million will cover future claims.\n\nin april, engler told another university official in emails rachael denhollander, the first woman to go public with her accusations about nassar, was probably getting a kickback from her attorney.\n\ndenhollander told the ap wednesday her hope is the board is signaling at least the beginning of a true change in direction and tone. and in order to do that, they have to deal with the person they put in place.\n\nshe said who engler was and how he operated was no secret in michigan. the former board — five members remain and three are gone — picked engler for a reason, she said, and it needs to take responsibility for what they did.\n\nher biggest concern with engler's tenure has been what he has communicated about abuse, denhollander said. what he has communicated is that survivors who speak up will be attacked and blamed and shamed, that those who push for change are going to be accused of enjoying the spotlight, that they will be lied about.\n\nthe elected board has five democrats, two republicans and an appointee who was named last month by then-gov. rick snyder. the board's makeup became more democratic in the november election. engler, a michigan state alum, served as governor from 1991 through 2002.\n\ngov. gretchen whitmer, also an msu graduate, said in a statement: the msu board of trustees now has an opportunity to build a new foundation that will provide this university with a clean slate and a brighter future. the new president should be someone who will begin the healing process and restore trust between survivors, students, alumni and the administration.\n\nthe board is due to announce a permanent president in june.\n\nthe university fired nassar in 2016, two years after he was the subject of a sexual assault investigation. he also worked with the u.s. olympic gymnastics team.\n\nhundreds of women and girls, most of them gymnasts, accused nassar of molesting them when they sought treatment during his time working for michigan state and usa gymnastics.\n\na special prosecutor in december accused michigan state of stonewalling his investigation into the school's handling of the scandal. bill forsyth released a report that said the school fought the release of certain relevant documents and released others that were heavily redacted or irrelevant. it says such actions hampered the investigation.\n\ntheir biggest concern was the reputation of the university, forsyth said at a news conference.

washington, confusion about mixed messages from president trump about whether he intends to declare a national emergency at the border to build his wall.\n\npresident donald trump (thursday): probably i will do it. i would almost say definitely.\n\n(friday): i'd rather not do it, because this is something that congress should easily do.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll talk with house republican leader kevin mccarthy about why it's not so easy. plus, former homeland security secretary jeh johnson on what constitutes a national security emergency. plus, new problems for the president as news reports raise more questions about his ties to russia. and as the u.s. begins to withdraw troops from syria, we'll ask secretary of state mike pompeo about the administration's conflicting statements on the drawdown.\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, the president's guidance is incredibly clear.\n\nmargaret brennan: finally--\n\njulian castro: let's go work. vamonos.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll talk with the latest candidate to enter the 2020 presidential campaign, former san antonio mayor, julian castro.\n\nand as always, we'll have analysis on all the news ahead on face the nation.\n\ngood morning and welcome to face the nation. it's day twenty-three of the partial government shutdown, now the longest in history. and there's no end in sight. some eight hundred thousand federal workers did not get paid friday. and even president trump concedes he has, quote, no idea whether he can get a deal with house speaker nancy pelosi. we spoke earlier with secretary of state mike pompeo from abu dhabi, one of the stops on a nine-country trip through the middle east.\n\n(begin vt)\n\nmargaret brennan: mister secretary, we are in the middle of this shutdown, and i know a number of state department employees are not getting paid, including a quarter of u.s. employees in foreign countries. you've been going to u.s. embassies. what are you telling staff about when they can expect a paycheck?\n\nmike pompeo (secretary of state/@secpompeo): look, it-- it's unfortunate that we're in the shutdown, i-- i wish we weren't, too. i-- i hope that it's resolved quickly and i've certainly told our-- our teams that. but you have to know these great americans who are working in our embassies around the world. they understand the mission. they understand its importance. they understand that whether the government is open or closed they have a task to do and they are hard at it.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, i do want to ask you since we are so focused on what's happening with this shutdown here at home, the state department when it comes to the border issues has issued a report in 2017 about counterterrorism and it says that there is no credible evidence that international terrorist groups have established bases in mexico or sent operatives via mexico into the united states. it adds the southern border is vulnerable, but terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the united states. how does this match with the claim that there is a border security crisis?\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, make-- make no mistake about it, margaret, keeping our southern border secure is an important national security component, it's-- it's critical that we do that well. there's a real risk to the united states of america. we need to take this seriously. we need to secure our southern border. we need to make sure that those who want to do us harm don't have a way to access us in that way. there are many things we have to do. one of the reasons i'm in the middle east is to work on prevailing against terror. there are lots of elements of this but border security is a certain and impor-- certainly an important component.\n\nmargaret brennan: so is the state department report wrong to say that this is not how terrorists are trying to enter the united states?\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, terrorists try to get into our country lots of ways. one of the ways they can come in is across our southern border. what you saw was an unclassified report. make no mistake about it, terrorists will always find the weakest link. and we need to make sure that the weakest link in our national security isn't our southern border.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to get to your trip through the middle east, but i first want to ask you about this new york times report that says right after president trump fired former fbi director james comey, the fbi began investigating whether president trump himself was a potential threat to national security and whether he'd been working for russia or unintentionally influenced by moscow. what is your reaction to this?\n\nmike pompeo: i'm not going to comment on new york times stories, but i'll certainly say this: the-- the notion that president trump is a threat to american national security is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nmargaret brennan: just to clarify since you were cia director, did you have any idea that this investigation was happening?\n\nmike pompeo: margaret-- margaret-- margaret, i-- i've answered this question repeatedly indeed on your show. the-- the idea that's contained in the new york times story that president trump was a threat to american national security is-- is silly on its face and not worthy of a response.\n\nmargaret brennan: one of the reasons you're in the middle east is to reassure and explain to some of our allies what the u.s. policy in syria is. so i'd like you to do that for us today because the pentagon announced yesterday that it actually has begun its withdrawal from syria. yet the u.s. national security adviser john bolton said that wouldn't happen until two things: one, the u.s. defeated isis; and two, turkey assured us it wouldn't go after our kurdish allies. have those two conditions been met?\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, the president's guidance is incredibly clear. the roughly two thousand uniformed soldiers that are in syria today are going to be withdrawn that-- that activity is underway. we're going to do so in an orderly and deliberate way. a way that protects america's national security, a way that allows us to continue the important mission that they were on--the counterterrorism mission. the effort to make sure that with the destruction of isis is not only complete, but that their resurgence is not possible. our efforts to counter the threat from terrorism stemming from the islamic republic of iran. those are all real missions. the tactical change we've made in the withdrawal of those two thousand troops is just that--a tactical change. mission remains the same.\n\nmargaret brennan: so has turkey's president promised you not to attack our kurdish allies?\n\nmike pompeo: yeah. look, when president erdogan and president trump spoke, they talked about this issue. the turks have made clear that they understand that there are folks down in syria that have their rights. we also want to make sure that those in syria aren't attacking-- terrorists aren't attacking turkey from syria. we're fully engaged. ambassador jeffrey is in-- fully engaged in conversations with the turks as well as with the sdf in syria to make sure that we accomplish all of those missions. we can-- we can do each of those things. margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: the sdf among some of the fighters that we were talking about kurdish allies there. just to explain for our audience.\n\nmike pompeo: that's right.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you here, though--\n\nmike pompeo: yes, ma'am.\n\nmargaret brennan: --because you know as a diplomat the-- the threat of credible use of military force is what gives you power at the negotiating table. how does taking out u.s. troops from syria get you any closer to expelling iran?\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, the united states of america can project military power from lots of places in the world. the absence of a couple thousand soldiers on the ground in syria in no way materially diminishes the capacity of the united states of america and our amazing armed forces to deliver american power to accomplish our objectives anywhere in the world. that certainly includes in syria. it certainly includes into iran if need be. we still have those tools. american diplomats still have that leverage and that power standing behind them. i'm very confident in our military capabilities here in the middle east.\n\nmargaret brennan: so by that, are you saying that having u.s. troops in nearby iraq will fill any kind of vacuum left by pulling out of syria?\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, we have lots of tools in the arsenal. i was out visiting some amazing warriors out at navcent yesterday in bahrain. we have an enormous amount of american military capacity. our-- our ability to achieve what we need to do militarily is there. my task as america's secretary of state is to make sure that we don't have to use that tool. that we get the diplomatic outcomes to secure the middle east and keep it stable and protect the american people as well.\n\nmargaret brennan: when it comes to iran, the trump admin-- administration has taken some, you know, confrontational tactics here, pulling out of the nuclear accord saying that iranian threats would be matched here. but we saw this week another american--a navy vet--michael white, has been behind iranian bars since july. so the trump administration is not stopping iran from taking americans hostage. what is happening with this american?\n\nmike pompeo: this administration is proud of the work that we've done to get americans released all across the world. with respect to that michael white case, in particular, i can't say much. it's an ongoing consular matter. but the american people should know we take the security of every american, wherever they are traveling in the world as one of our foremost priorities. we will continue to work to get each of them back. and your point-- your point about the islamic republic of iran is spot on. it's why the jcopa was such a horrible idea. many americans are being held there today that were taken by the iranian regime. these are a group of people who are among the worst terrorists in the world and who have the least respect for human rights in the world. and it's why this administration has taken the very hard line you just described against iran.\n\nmargaret brennan: is the trump administration open to a prisoner swap with iran?\n\nmike pompeo: i'm not going to talk about something like that.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, i ask you because michael white's mother spoke to cbs and she said she would like the administration to negotiate for her son. she said, what is a human life worth? i would like the u.s. to negotiate. i want him home. what can you tell her you're doing to bring her son home?\n\nmike pompeo: i have great sympathy for the families of those americans who are wrongfully detained all across the world. and we do everything we can every day to get their return. we use our diplomatic tools in every corner of the world, to reach out to these places to get these young men and women home. we're intent to do that in iran. we're intent to do that all across the world. we-- we take this-- this obligation as a solemn one. and this administration's had quite a few successes. i hope we have more.\n\nmargaret brennan: potentially open to negotiations then?\n\nmike pompeo: we're using every tool that we have in our arsenal to get these americans back home, wherever we find them.\n\nmargaret brennan: ambassador bolton said the next summit with kim jong-un would be in january or february. we're in that window. when will we see president trump sit down with the north korean leader?\n\nmike pompeo: we're working out the details, margaret. you'll be among the first to know.\n\nmargaret brennan: i know, sir, you're at the end of this trip, you will be headed to saudi arabia. it has been about a hundred days since washington post journalist jamal khashoggi was brutally murdered. will you raise this issue with mohammed bin salman, the crown prince?\n\nmike pompeo: of course.\n\nmargaret brennan: then what will you say?\n\nmike pompeo: i'll say what-- margaret, i'll say what we have said consistently. america's position both privately and publicly is the same. this was an outrageous act, an unacceptable murder. those who were responsible will be held accountable by the united states of america. we're determined to do that. we're determined to get at the facts just as quickly and as comprehensively as we can. we've had a policy that's been remarkably consistent with respect to this. we-- we-- we, we like the rest of the world value human rights all across the globe. and the murder of jamal khashoggi was outrageous and we'll hold those responsible accountable. and then we'll talk about all the important things we do with the kingdom of saudi arabia and all the support they provide to keep americans in kansas and colorado and california and in washington, dc, safe.\n\nmargaret brennan: mister secretary, thank you very much for your time. safe travels.\n\nmike pompeo: margaret, thank you very much. you have a great day.\n\nmargaret brennan: we turn now to house republican leader kevin mccarthy. congressman, you're usually in your home state in california when we talk to you so we like having you here in person in snowy dc.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy (house minority leader/@gopleader/r-california): thanks for having me.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to get to this washington post report before we talk about the shutdown. it-- it says that the president has tried to conceal the substance of his conversations with vladimir putin, even taking away the notes from his translator who sat in-- the interpreter in the room during their talks. does it concern you that there's no public record of what the president discussed with vladimir putin, the leader of the country that interfered in the 2016 elections?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: well, margret, what i do know is what this administration, this congress has done. we've been very tough on russia. look at the sanctions that we have taken. with this administration: one, on the election meddling that russia has done, the movement of russia with inside ukraine as well. and i just listened to the president last night. he's more than willing to have an open to what that discussion was about he said on a news show last night. but i know what the president likes to do. he likes to create a personal relationship, build that relationship, even rebuild that relationship like he does with other world leaders around.\n\nmargaret brennan: but this was keeping the record of the conversation from the national security adviser. the person who is supposed to be the top adviser to the president.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: well, in hearing the president last night on the show, he says he was more than willing to let that information go out. so that's what i know right now.\n\nmargaret brennan: does congress want to see any of this? or speak to the interpreter?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i'd like to-- the president to be able to build these relationships. i know this administration. i know this congress is very tough on russia. and we will continue to be so. but i want this president to be able to build the relationship, even on a personal level with all the world leaders as well.\n\nmargaret brennan: i know you speak to the president, have you ever asked him about this?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i haven't asked him about this situation, yet, because it just came out. but i did talk to the president yesterday about the shutdown. i know this president is focused on giving this government open. that's why the president is here. that's why i am here in washington. the challenge has been from the very beginning the president has made numerous offers about this shutdown. reasonable too, moving further to the democratic side. and there has not been one offer coming back from the democrats. it is unacceptable that eight hundred thousand u.s. employees are not being paid. you know what we're arguing over? one-tenth of one percent of the federal budget. and it's not as though we're asking democrats to do something they haven't done before. they voted for border wall and fencing. we have democrats, even the new progressives from california. katie hill, says she would vote for a wall. you had the chairman--\n\nmargaret brennan: i think the barrier-- defining the barrier is the point that you're kind of stuck on right now.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i would take the language we had voted on before. the president even said he would add in no concrete--\n\nmargaret brennan: the fencing act from 2006?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: no. just the appropriations bills that we'd taken prior. that would allow us to do the job that needs to be done. you know the chairman of armed services, he actually says, walls work and he was supportive of it.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: we had our own former president, president obama in 2014 said there was a crisis on the border.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: the new governor of california gavin newsom used it in his-- in his inaugural address said there is a crisis along the border. the only people who believe there is not is nancy-- speaker pelosi--\n\nmargaret brennan: well, they agree--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --and senator schumer.\n\nmargaret brennan: --in-- in border security funding and offered 1.3 billion for that. it's the how it's spent that it seems to be you're disagreeing on--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: well, who--\n\nmargaret brennan: but let me--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: well, who in america believes in border security, doesn't have some form of a barrier? because i've heard democrats say they want a form of a barrier. the president has moved from a concrete to a steel barrier. so i've watched this president look for compromise. there just has been no compromise on the other side.\n\nmargaret brennan: but should you reopen the government while you have this argument?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: we can have this government reopened. the president is correct. less than forty-five minutes--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you would have--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: you know what.\n\nmargaret brennan: --some sort of cr to open the government--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i've been in--\n\nmargaret brennan: --and then continue the immigration argument?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i've been in every single one of those meetings. i watched the president turn to nancy pelosi and say, okay if i reopen the government right now, in thirty days--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --could we have border security? she said, no. not at all. so that--\n\nmargaret brennan: you have--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --is the real challenge. who is holding this government up? it's senator schumer and speaker pelosi.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, the-- the federal government workers are the people paying the price right now.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: they are.\n\nmargaret brennan: and you have about ten thousand of them in your district.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: and that is--\n\nmargaret brennan: so what do you tell them?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: and that is--\n\nmargaret brennan: when are they going to get paid?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: that is unacceptable. that's why i'm here right now. i'm-- i'm not in puerto rico. i'm here because i want to solve this problem.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: and you know what--\n\nmargaret brennan: do you--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: do you know what is happening--\n\nmargaret brennan: do you have a way to pay those--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --in each one of those--\n\nmargaret brennan: --workers while you continue--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: we have just voted--\n\nmargaret brennan: --arguing over immigration?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: we just voted on friday and sent it to the president a law to make sure they are being paid when this is done. what we need to have happen--\n\nmargaret brennan: for those living paycheck to paycheck now matters.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: yeah, that's unacceptable. and where has the president been this whole time? what-- what those constituents and what your viewers need to understand, before we ever got to this point when the republicans had the house--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --they moved a bill to the senate. in the senate, it takes sixty votes.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: senator schumer would not come to a compromise. he would not even come for a vote. he left. when we sat during that break--\n\nmargaret brennan: so should the president--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --before the new swearing in--\n\nmargaret brennan: do you oppose the president declaring a national emergency? since what you're describing sounds like you're not going anywhere.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: you know what?\n\nmargaret brennan: because he-- he's talked about--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: the emergency act exists--\n\nmargaret brennan: --about possibly using money that would be allocated to california for disaster relief. that's your home state.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: the emergency act exists for these type of circumstances. but one thing i will tell you, we should solve this legislatively. i-- i agree with what the president said on friday, we need to solve this legislatively.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, it sounds like--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: because--\n\nmargaret brennan: --you don't want--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: listen, it's--\n\nmargaret brennan: --him to declare an emergency?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: it's one tenth of one percent of the federal budget. if we cannot do this together, what else can we not do in the future? this is not that big of a problem. democrats in the past have voted for fencing and for wall. why, now, do they disagree? because it's president trump? i think the american public understands this. we can solve this in minutes and these-- these workers should be able to be paid. it only takes a few minutes inside the meetings, but when the democrats will not even make a counteroffer, it's unacceptable.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm. i want to ask you about iowa republican congressman steve king. you called some of his language reckless when he, in an interview with the new york times, said the term, white nationalists and white supremacists, he didn't know when they became offensive. some republicans have come out very strongly here. jeb bush--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: as have-- as have i.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, jeb bush said it's not enough to condemn him, that party leaders actually have to do something. either support a primary opponent to challenge him, others have said he should be at least censured. should there be action against congressman king?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: first, and foremost, i came out at the very moment--that language has no place in america. that is not the america i know and it's most definitely not the party of lincoln.\n\nmargaret brennan: should he be--\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i have--\n\nmargaret brennan: --punished for it?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: i have a scheduled meeting with him on monday, and i will tell you this: i've watched on the other side that they do not take action when their member says something like this. action will be taken. i'm having a serious conversation with congressman steve king on his future and role in this republican party, because--\n\nmargaret brennan: what does that mean?\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: as a leader. there is a number of things you'll see that is taking place, but i will not stand back as a leader of this party, believing in this nation that all are created equal--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative kevin mccarthy: --that that stands or continues to stand and have any role with us.\n\nmargaret brennan: thank you very much, congressman.\n\nwe will be back in a moment with more face the nation.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: with dozens of democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid on saturday the former mayor of san antonio, julián castro, became the latest candidate. castro gained national attention when he delivered the keynote address at the 2012 democratic convention and he was also secretary of housing and urban development during the obama administration. the grandson of a mexican immigrant, julian castro has already been endorsed by a democratic member of congress, his twin brother, joaquin. and julian castro joins us from the site of his announcement.\n\nthe president visited your home state of texas this week, went to the border, said there is a humanitarian and national security crisis. do you agree with him that there is a crisis at the border?\n\njulián castro (d-presidential candidate/@juliancastro/former housing and urban development secretary): what i believe is that he's created a tragedy at the border. this policy of separating children from their parents and the terrible way that customs and border protection has managed its responsibilities, including the deaths of two children within the last few weeks. that's a real tragedy.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, that family separation policy has been paused at least. but there are a record number of family units crossing the border and that creates a lot of challenges. so what would you do?\n\njulián castro: i don't believe that we should have family detention for people that are seeking asylum or refugee status, so that we should develop other ways to ensure that people are processed, that we're able to keep track of them in the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: you were critical even under the obama administration, specifically about their high level of deportations. so what do you offer as an alternative if you're not going to detain and you're not going to deport what do you do with illegal immigrants?\n\njulián castro: well, what i believe we could do and what the obama administration did do i believe toward the end of its tenure was to look at things like ankle monitors so that you're able to monitor where people are in the country. but we also need to be serious about recognizing the right of people to seek asylum. and the president is playing games with this, blocking people's right to seek asylum. i would change that. i would make sure that we push as hard as possible for comprehensive immigration reform so that for the people who are already here, if they've been law abiding, if they pay a fine, that-- that they can get an earned path to citizenship.\n\nmargaret brennan: you announced your candidacy and almost immediately the rnc issued a statement. i want to read it here to you. it says, julián castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president. he was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being hud secretary. this is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate. these are sharp words, but it's the first official attack on you. how do you respond and-- and how do you explain why you are qualified to be commander-in-chief?\n\njulián castro: you know they're going to use those kinds of words for every single democrat that decides to run for president. i wouldn't put too much stock in that. i would just say to the american people directly, i've had executive experience. i have led one of the largest, most diverse cities in the country. i've led a federal agency at hud and-- and done some great work to expand opportunity. i know what it takes to ensure that we have a government that functions well and to help inspire people. i also have a life experience that i think resonates with a lot of americans. you know i'm here in my neighborhood that i grew up in. grew up in a single parent household, went to the public schools here in san antonio. was able to go to college and law school and to reach my american dream. and i am motivated to make sure that every american can reach their dreams.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, some of the things you outlined as part of your platform, medicare for all, universal access to prekindergarten education, a green new deal, these put you in the more liberal or progressive wing of the democratic party. so one of the challenges for you is how do you attract centrists or people who perhaps were alienated by the president but aren't comfortable with being so reliant on the government as their main provider?\n\njulián castro: what i hear out there is that there are a lot of folks, a lot of people, who want us to invest in universal health care. and i'm under no illusion that accomplishing something like medicare for all would be easy. but i do believe that in this nation, in the richest nation on earth, that not a single person should be without health care when they need it.\n\nmargaret brennan: so what is that going to cost taxpayers? you've got to make some real changes there to be able to pay for it.\n\njulián castro: no, you do. there's no question that it's going to take several things. i think it's going to take asking wealthier individuals to pay their fair share.\n\nmargaret brennan: what does that mean?\n\njulián castro: we've had basically the-- the last forty years essentially of-- of lower and lower commitment on people at the very top. same thing goes for corporations. we have corporations-- multinational corporations that are hardly paying anything in federal taxes.\n\nmargaret brennan: you want to increase the corporate tax rate?\n\njulián castro: we need to ask them to pay their fair share. i think that we can consider different ways, different proposals, to be able to raise more revenue from, you know, the wealthiest corporations.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. we will be tracking you and your campaign. thank you so much for joining us.\n\njulián castro: thank you.\n\nmargaret brennan: there will be more of our interview on our website at facethenation.com. we will be back in a moment.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we will be right back with a lot more face the nation, including our political panel and former homeland security secretary jeh johnson. stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. for some expert analysis on the government shutdown, the emerging 2020 presidential race and so much more we would like to welcome our political panel. jeffrey goldberg is the editor-in-chief of the atlantic, seung min kim covers the white house from capitol hill for the washington post, david nakamura is a white house reporter for the washington post, and michael crowley is the white house and national security editor at politico. seung min kim, let me start with you. did you hear any signs of progress from what leader mccarthy talked about today?\n\nseung min kim (the washington post/@seungminkim): there is no signs of progress anywhere that we've seen in the last several days. we don't get a way out of the shutdown at least legislatively if three people aren't talking. that's the president, nancy pelosi, and chuck schumer. and by all accounts they are not having any discussions right now after the president reportedly stormed out of that meeting in the situation room on wednesday at the white house. and that's why there seems to be sort of a sense of inevitability or at least there was until friday about the president declaring a national emergency as kind of a way out of the shutdown. although the president seem to kind of scale that back in his latest comments at the white house on friday. but there are concerns with that as well. i mean we-- first of all, it's not a guarantee that the government reopens.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nseung min kim: congressman mark meadows, who is a trump ally on capitol hill told us that he's like i don't really know why people think that just because the president does this the government will reopen. so that was kind of a sign for us that perhaps this isn't the easiest way out and also the concern among republicans about declaring this national emergency. you've gotten some pretty strong pushback from senior republicans saying this could be an abuse of executive power. something they talked a lot about under the obama administration.\n\nmargaret brennan: michael, we're hearing, you know, the white house seems to be focusing in on speaker pelosi and the opposition in the house. they seem to be seeing an opportunity with some of these new freshmen democrats who've been elected from districts that otherwise have been supportive of trump. what do you make of this as a strategy? can you actually pick them off? do you get anywhere by doing so?\n\nmichael crowley (politico/@michaelcrowley): sure. i mean, i guess, it's-- i don't know, if it's arbitrage or the concept where you can exploit a gap between evidence of the president's past support and then a democrat maybe in theory over performing in that same place. so those are the natural targets you go for. i haven't seen a lot of evidence that they are strategically hitting those targets so far. and i know that we've reported at politico that there are white house allies who want to see the president, for instance, go in to some of those districts or have white house officials, you know, hold events in these members' districts really put the pressure on them with local media and try to exploit that tension between a district that was pro-trump in sixteen and maybe one pro-democrat in eighteen and really put them on the spot. but, you know, fundamentally, what's so interesting here is the president really just seems to be doubling down on this base strategy, the one that he went for in 2018. and it seems like we're kind of setting the stage for the 2020 presidential campaign. and the president may feel that he just absolutely has to keep that base, but that base is fortyish percent. and it's going to be tough for him to win reelection if he doesn't do something more broadly. so it's going to be interesting to see--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmichael crowley: --if he remains dug in on that.\n\nmargaret brennan: and-- and to that point we have some cbs news polling that we've done and it seems that the president's approval rating is low in terms of how he is handling this shutdown, down to about thirty-five percent. of course, for congressional republicans it's even lower than that--just twenty-one percent. so this, is it necessarily a political win or could it be?\n\ndavid nakamura (the washington post/@davidnakamura): well, that's a great point. the-- we have also a new poll out today from the washington post, though, that shows something interesting, which is that, although a majority of the country does blame the president much more than democrats for the shutdown, it also said that support for a border wall has actually spiked among republicans at large--by sixteen points over the past year as the president keeps talking about this. and i'm sure the president is seeing that and saying, look, this is broadly popular, not just among the base of the republican party but eighty-seven percent, according to this poll we have out today of the republicans support it. seventy percent of republicans strongly support a border wall. so the president is reading that and he really believes that his strategy is working despite this idea that he is going to take the blame the longer this goes on.\n\nmargaret brennan: it's interesting you say that the cbs news poll, in terms of how you build the wall, shows that about two-thirds, sixty-seven percent of americans oppose declaring a national emergency to get us there. and-- and it looks like it really breaks down along partisan lines, jeff.\n\njeffrey goldberg (the atlantic/@jeffreygoldberg): right. right. i mean, a national emergency might actually be the only way out of this impasse because it doesn't seem likely. i was talking this week to one of the new democrats, going to the opposite of your point.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm..\n\njeffrey goldberg: one of the-- not the most famous new democrat on the hill, but one of the--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\njeffrey goldberg: --one of the new ones. and there is a-- there is a strong ideological feeling that you can't give in on-- on any-- any compromise, even a compromise that gets them daca or something else, which is a kind of interesting mirror of what you're seeing in the republican base, which is wall or-- or nothing at all. so you have everybody dug in and you have no negotiating going on. i'm always struck in these moments by the fact that the president, who allegedly is one of the world's great negotiators, isn't much of a negotiator at all. so i just don't-- i don't-- i don't see-- i don't see this resolving itself anytime soon.\n\ndavid nakamura: if-- if anything-- we had a-- a year ago, there was a big debate over immigration. this idea, he traded a border wall funding for legalization for these dreamers. the president then turned that down by all accounts and asked for more. he said, we want to cut legal immigration, we want to speed up deportations, change laws that democrats didn't agree with and many, even moderate republicans don't want to change, which is providing some protection legally to immigrant children who're coming across. since then, he has made it tougher by the policies he's enacted unilaterally--the separations at the border in june of children from their parents, sending troops to the border during the campaign.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ndavid nakamura: from the democrats i talked to, they said this has made us even less-- more-- more skeptical of him that he either-- either take a deal. but also his policies are so inhumane, in their mind, we're not going to give him any ground on the wall.\n\njeffrey goldberg: skepticism. that's even more salient is the skepticism of the core of the trump's base worrying ann coulter-base, let's call it, worrying that he is going to give in. he's extraordinarily sensitive to that. that's why there is really not much hope for negotiating a settlement to this anytime soon because he's so worried about that that core of the core.\n\nmargaret brennan: seung min, when we heard from senator graham last week on this show, he was saying one of the things most offensive to him as representative of republicans was this accusation that somehow in their calls for border security they're being called racists. i thought it was interesting to hear from-- from leader mccarthy here that when it comes to those accusations within his party right now around this iowa republican steve king that that he wants to take a stand on this.\n\nseung min kim: i found it really fascinating, as well. i mean, i-- those comments from leader mccarthy on your show just a few minutes ago was probably among the strongest condemnations that we have heard from senior house republicans about congressman king's rhetoric and behavior. and i found it really interesting when he said, quote, actions will be taken against congressman king--\n\nmargaret brennan: yes.\n\nseung min kim: -- that he's meeting with him tomorrow to discuss this issue.\n\nmargaret brennan: it sounds like he may be losing his committee memberships.\n\nseung min kim: that's exact--\n\nmargaret brennan: there will be action taken against in the meeting. he will be downgraded.\n\nseung min kim: that was my-- that was my assumption when-- because that's usually what--\n\nmargaret brennan: yes.\n\nseung min kim: --a party leader can do. the congressional black caucus has called for congressman king to be stripped of his committee assignments. and it's just interesting because congressman king has been controversial for a very long time. i mean i'm-- i'm from iowa, so i'm familiar with his rhetoric. but-- and he said things about immigration during the immigration debate a few years ago. but you are seeing this rise in very vocal condemnations of his rhetoric. i mean, it wasn't just leader mccarthy, senator joni ernst from iowa called those remarks racist and said they are not representative of the state.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator tim scott--\n\nseung min kim: exactly.\n\nmargaret brennan: --had the bet on it.\n\nseung min kim: exactly, as well. so it's-- so the-- the rise in opposition against what he's-- what the congressman has been saying, you know, frankly for a long time has been interesting to watch.\n\nmichael crowley: and that's really important because we're at a moment in this country where people worry that certain kinds of rhetoric are being normalized and that the--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmichael crowley: --that the parameters of debate are expanding to areas that would have been intolerable a few years ago. and you think about, for instance, what happened in charlottesville in the degree that there was some-- some-- almost a tacit approval of that or even when the president said there were, you know, find people on both sides in charlottesville.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmichael crowley: it's nice to see that people are pushing back. they are still to some degree enforcing those norms of conversation.\n\nmargaret brennan: i also want to ask you, seung min, to clarify something. leader mccarthy mentioned, i'm not in puerto rico, i'm here in washington. what was the point he was trying to make there?\n\njeffrey goldberg: very subtle point.\n\nseung min kim: so--\n\nmargaret brennan: very subtle point.\n\nseung min kim: --there is-- yeah. so there is a contingent of congressional democrats who are on-- in nevada and puerto rico right now for a super pac. the optics are great, i will say--\n\nmargaret brennan: during the shutdown.\n\nseung min kim: --during the shutdown. and there is, obviously-- because a lot of the shutdown is a messaging war and optics war. and you-- leader mccarthy-- kevin mccarthy made a point of saying, look, i am here in dc. i am ready to work. he pointed out that he is usually in california when-- when you speak to him.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nseung min kim: and there is some unhappiness among democratic quarters that that trip happened this week.\n\njeffrey goldberg: i am old enough to remember when people thought that puerto rico was a natural republican stronghold, by the way. but it doesn't seem like the party believes that anymore.\n\nmargaret brennan: no. if we did-- when we looked at the-- the group, the delegation that did go to puerto rico, it looks like speaker pelosi decided not to go though she had been originally expected to be there. so it-- it is an optics war, it's a rhetoric war. and, unfortunately, it doesn't sound like there is much traction to getting anything done.\n\nbut i want to take a quick break, come back because there is a lot more we need to sort through here. so we're going to take a short break. stay with us, more from our panel.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: and we are back now with our panel. we started off the show with speaker, excuse me, with secretary of state mike pompeo talking about his trip through the middle east. jeff, can you tell me what the syria policy is of the trump administration?\n\njeffrey goldberg: it's the best policy. all the best policies. that's the problem in understanding and probably doing commentary on our foreign policies that we have so many foreign policies at once. this secretary did a-- made a valiant effort to suggest that we are not withdrawing from syria even though we're actually withdrawing from syria. and-- and the people who are coming out of syria, the americans troops, even if they are coming out in an orderly fashion, as he said, are there to fight terrorists. and it's very, very hard to make the case that you're doubling down your fight against terrorism when you're leaving. the-- the core of the problem is that the president he works for is isolationist by disposition. doesn't understand why we're in the middle east at all. mike pompeo comes from another tradition, quite the opposite tradition. he believes in a muscular american presence. and we saw his very, very strong speech in cairo, which is allegedly a repudiation of obama policy. so it's--\n\nmargaret brennan: even down just to the-- to the orchestration of it--\n\njeffrey goldberg: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --in cairo.\n\njeffrey goldberg: right. a little bit-- a little bit in your face. i'm going to cairo and i'm repudiating what you just said in a really unusual way. and-- and so you have so many different foreign policies in-- inside one administration, it's hard to keep them straight.\n\nmargaret brennan: and--\n\ndavid nakamura: think about this, though. i was thinking about this, you know, the president's other big gambit on foreign policy is this ongoing dialogue of some, sort of, with north korea. think what kim jong-un must be seeing here. you have the-- the hawkish secretary of state and national security adviser john bolton with one view of how to approach iran and stay in syria.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ndavid nakamura: and the president is saying, no, you know, i have my own view. i'm just going to do the opposite. you see, now kim jong-un continue to send letters to president trump, very flattering. he wants to deal directly with the president because he sees this sort of a-- a chance, you know, to sort of maybe get some gains. i mean the idea of--\n\njeffrey goldberg: but if he's smart--\n\ndavid nakamura: yeah.\n\njeffrey goldberg: --he might know that that those gains are not durable.\n\ndavid nakamura: they are not durable.\n\njeffrey goldberg: yeah. and it-- yeah.\n\ndavid nakamura: but-- but, you know, kim jong-un's goal is to reduce troop presence, right, in-- in the korean peninsula. look-- look, what's going on here in syria?\n\nmargaret brennan: right. and to cut back all the military--\n\ndavid nakamura: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --umbrella--\n\ndavid nakamura: umbrella.\n\nmargaret brennan: --that the united states has in the region. on iran, to add to jeff's point, you heard the secretary of state this week say, we are going to try to get every boot, iranian boot out of syria. how do you do that when you don't have a military there?\n\njeffrey goldberg: can you convince them with strong words? i-- i don't know. you made the excellent point that the threat of military force, obviously is-- is when you couple that with effective diplomacy that's one way to do it. no, it doesn't seem-- i mean, look, this is why the israelis and many of the gulf arabs were so nervous when trump announced this impromptu policy shift, radical policy shift, because you-- you leave syria that allows iran to come in fully. pompeo's speech in cairo was a very, very anti-iran speech.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\njeffrey goldberg: nothing is adding up. this is the problem. i mean you have to have policies that actually correspond to the reality on the ground. and so i-- i think it's very, very hard to understand how this works.\n\nmichael crowley: pompeo did say something today that i've heard him say before that i think could be worth focusing on. he keeps referring to the withdrawal of uniformed american troops from syria. i don't know exactly what he means. but i am wondering to what degree the administration at least maybe telling (indistinct) officials like pompeo in defending trump's policy. we're going to have the cia and then we might even have--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmichael crowley: --contractors. we know there's been a lot of debate around this administration with the possibility of using contractors. so i think that's something to keep an eye on. i think it's noteworthy that he keeps stressing that word.\n\nmargaret brennan: it-- it's a good-- good point to (indistinct) because clearly having an intelligence presence is incredibly important in a place that is home to so many terror groups at this point. that's one of the things that israelis were concerned about--\n\njeffrey goldberg: right. of course.\n\nmargaret brennan: --losing.\n\njeffrey goldberg: i mean the other quick point to make on this is that pompeo's speech was very, very hard on iran. but one of the reasons it's not flying in the middle east is that recognizing that all diplomacy is hypocrisy to some degree. there is not a harsh word to be said about saudi arabia, and one does not have to think that iran is anything other than the leading state sponsor of terror. you-- you can still think that but also think that our punitive allies are also human rights violators and authoritarian despotic regimes.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeffrey goldberg: it would be fascinating to watch this week.\n\nmargaret brennan: michael, i want to ask you, we-- we did ask both the secretary and leader mccarthy about these reports in the past few days about the president's relationship with russia or at least his decision to not make public the notes that he has had from interpreters from private meetings with vladimir putin. why is it important that the rest of the national security establishment be part of this? as leader mccarthy said this is just about a personal relationship.\n\nmichael crowley: sure. well, there's the-- there's the sort of traditional reason, which is that the foreign policy machine works better if all the smart people who are looking at it from different angles, people who have regional focuses who have expertise in putin's psychology who are arms control experts can see the conversation and weigh in. and-- and, you know, referring back to the parsing language, hey, it was really important and significant that putin use this word. you know, he hasn't used this word in six years. it means that they're interested in this again. or somebody can point out i can see that he's putting pressure on this issue trying to move us. the president who, you know, is totally new to diplomacy as of two years ago, wouldn't be picking up on those things. that's just how it traditionally works. and you have-- it's almost like crowdsourcing, right, get all the best minds looking at this and then--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmichael crowley: --you get together and talk about it. okay. so, now the trump's specific problem is that, you know, we know senior officials in our own justice department at one point, a couple of years ago according to the great reporting by the new york times yesterday, believed it was at least worth investigating whether the president, i can't believe i'm saying these words--\n\njeffrey goldberg: yeah.\n\nmichael crowley: --on television, it's like am i living in a dream, may have been acting as an agent for the russian government and vladimir putin.\n\njeffrey goldberg: it's not a dream, it's a bad movie.\n\nmichael crowley: i mean, a bad-- a bad movie, the greatest movie ever made, who knows exactly--\n\nmargaret brennan: it's an extraordinary report.\n\njeffrey goldberg: right.\n\nmichael crowley: it's-- it's stunning. and i want to say, to go back-- and then the washington post, by the way, followed up with the great report, that after a meeting he had with vladimir putin and only a translator in the room, asked the translator for those notes and took them away. and they were not circulated through the government. just very quickly, last point, david, to your earlier point about leaders seeing the officials around trump and going around them--\n\ndavid nakamura: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmichael crowley: --and going straight to trump. lot of reasons, i think there's vla-- that vladimir putin is doing that, whether or not it's some kind of a spy movie running an-- an agent thing or just pure psychology. that's the game he's playing.\n\nmargaret brennan: it's also extraordinary to have the america's top diplomat, the secretary of state, twice clarify that the president is not a national security threat--\n\njeffrey goldberg: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --and laugh-- and-- and say that's laughable.\n\njeffrey goldberg: right. it's worth dilating on this for one moment, that we're in a situation where we're discussing in serious terms whether or not the president of the united states is a russian intelligence asset. and that's-- that's what's happening in washington today. and that is truly remarkable thing that we're experiencing right now.\n\nmichael crowley: yeah.\n\ndavid nakamura: and the president's response on this about, you know, keeping this meeting quiet is-- and keeping people out of it, it's not just to have a better relationship with leader like vladimir putin. but also that there's been leaks of his other, especially early in his presidencies, from really embarrassing leaks about what he said to other world leaders that made him look foolish, made him look reckless. but now he's sort of created this extra problem that either-- leaders-- because he's not staying on some sort of script or--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ndavid nakamura: --you know-- you know, going with the talking points that are developed by a national security agency or staff, be prepare for these meetings, sort of ad-libbing and having these sort of embarrassing--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ndavid nakamura: --leaks come out. now he's left with a situation where it looks certainly bad if, you know, if he's keep-- if he's taking notes from his translator.\n\nmargaret brennan: the story is not going away. we'll continue it. but we have to leave the panel here.\n\ndavid nakamura: thanks.\n\nmargaret brennan: and we'll be back in a moment with former obama administration homeland security secretary jeh johnson.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're joined now by former department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson. welcome to face the nation.\n\njeh johnson (former secretary of homeland security): margaret, thanks for having me.\n\nmargaret brennan: in addition to being homeland security secretary, before that you had also been general counsel at the pentagon.\n\njeh johnson: correct.\n\nmargaret brennan: so i know you're very familiar with some of the legal authorities here--\n\njeh johnson: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --that we may need to-- to look at, because the president says that he may declare a national security emergency in order to get border funding for this wall. take it from other monies that congress had already approved and use it in a way they didn't approve. does he have the ability legally to do this?\n\njeh johnson: well, first, margaret, i just have to say there is an emerging crisis in homeland security on our border, by taking the very workers we depend upon for our security, land, sea, air, secret service, coast guard, border patrol, customs agents and so forth, and inflicting on them all sorts of stress and anxiety in their personal life about whether they're going to be paid and when. that's the security crisis that i see from the workforce in dhs.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeh johnson: now when it comes legally to whether or not the president can declare a national emergency to get around the dispute, earlier in the week the administration seemed to be talking about using a department of defense authority to take money that's been designated by congress for military construction toward another project. the law specifically allows for that upon the declaration of a national emergency. but that particular provision is typically used overseas to support the military like building detention facilities or military housing. the lawyers in the administration now seem to have come to a provision that allows for a reprogramming, as we refer to it, taking money from army's civil works projects here in the united states that were at some point essential to national defense and then redesignating and reprogramming it for some other army civil works project.\n\nmargaret brennan: some of that aid money for puerto rico and--\n\njeh johnson: correct.\n\nmargaret brennan: --money for california--\n\njeh johnson: so, in my view, that's probably slightly more legally plausible. the earlier defense authority was really trying to jam us square peg in a round hole.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeh johnson: this one is slightly more plausible, but politically highly objectionable because you're taking billions of dollars away from important civil works projects to recover from the hurricanes and the wildfires. and i-- i would predict there'd be huge, huge objection to doing that. ultimately, this-- this has to be something for our political leadership to work out--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeh johnson: --to get the government back to work. that's the most basic function of our civilian political leadership, to keep the government open and pay the workers.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, and to your point, it is worth what you underscored there, that a number of people who work on national security issues aren't getting paid because of this--\n\njeh johnson: the people we--\n\nmargaret brennan: --border crisis.\n\njeh johnson: --depend upon to find explosives and luggage, to find weapons and luggage, the people we depend upon to secure our borders to look for contraband at ports--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeh johnson: --to look for narcotics at ports, are the people that are under great stress right now because of this shutdown. it be must be leading-- i think i know this workforce. it must be leading to all kinds of uncertainty, stress and anxiety, and frankly, anger and resentment. we see reports of tsos calling in sick. and if this is not resolved soon, i predict that that's going to go in the wrong direction and we're going to start seeing longer and longer lines at airports.\n\nmargaret brennan: when you were at dhs, i know you said that-- at that time in 2015, you saw the influx and apprehensions of children and family units as an emerging crisis.\n\njeh johnson: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: now the trump administration is seeing record numbers of those family--\n\njeh johnson: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --units coming across the border. they're saying this is a crisis now, and it sounds like the one you saw coming. so this is a unique challenge for them. are they wrong to call that a crisis?\n\njeh johnson: it is very definitely humanitarian crisis because of the poverty and violence in central america. and the way to deal with this problem, frankly, is make a long-term investment in helping to eradicate the poverty and violence in the three countries that are probably the most violent on earth. that's not a quick, simple, easy fix which washington likes.\n\nmargaret brennan: el salvador, honduras and guatemala.\n\njeh johnson: correct. and so we need to make a long-term political commitment to investing and dealing with those push factors, otherwise we're going to continue to deal with this problem for a very long time.\n\nmargaret brennan: border wall, what i hear you saying, not the most effective way. let me get, though, to-- to the nuts and bolts of the family members here. because the obama administration faced some challenges on the question of whether they could detain families together--\n\njeh johnson: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --for more than twenty days.\n\njeh johnson: mm-mm.\n\nmargaret brennan: that's at the heart of the trump administration's, you know, defenses as to why they were justifying the separation of families. so what alternatives are there?\n\njeh johnson: well, you're referring to the flores decision--\n\nmargaret brennan: yes.\n\njeh johnson: --which imposed basically a limit on us to hold people for longer than-- than twenty days. i think that there has to be a range of tools that dhs can go to in-- in a crisis when you see a spike like this. again, it requires a long-term investment and the push factors. but we need things like-- we, you know, we can always assess whether there is more border security that's necessary. more surveillance, more road, perhaps, fortifying walls. in my judgment, there also needs to be more immigration judges--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeh johnson: --to move these cases along. but it does require a range of things and a long-term political commitment to dealing with the underlying factors that lead to these crisis.\n\nmargaret brennan: very quickly, do you expect the supreme court to uphold the daca ruling?\n\njeh johnson: i-- i hesitate to predict what this supreme court will do.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\njeh johnson: i think that there is adequate legal basis for the program.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. at the heart of-- of some of these potential solutions. so thank you very much.\n\njeh johnson: thank you.\n\nmargaret brennan: we will be right back.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: that's it for us today. thank you for watching. until next week for face the nation, i'm margaret brennan.
a baggy-clothed homeless man who walks up and down minneapolis' lake street begging for change got more than he bargained for when he strolled into cesia abigail's cafe two weeks ago.\n\ninstead of turning away the man, the 25-year-old owner of abi's cafe asked, why don't you have a job? you know nothing is given to me for free, right?\n\nbowing his head down to avoid eye contact, the man named marcus replied: well, i have a lot of felonies and no one wants to hire me for that. so, now i had to turn myself to the streets and get money the only way i know -- stealing and asking for money.\n\ndespite hitting a rough patch in her business, a soft-hearted abigail decided to offer the man a job washing dishes for the day.\n\nyou want a job? then i have one for you, abigail told him.\n\nwith a big grin, the man gladly accepted the woman's offer: i will do anything for food.\n\nmarcus washes dishes inside abi's cafe in minneapolis, minnesota, on march 25. cesi abi/facebook\n\na lot of people are saying i've been a blessing for him, but at that point i was the one who needed a blessing, abigail told cbs news.\n\nas marcus finished washing his hands and began to tie an apron around his waist, abigail offered him a sandwich.\n\nbefore eating, he wrapped half of the meal in foil, ran outside and gave it to another homeless woman on the street.\n\nthat really touched me, abigail recalled.\n\nafter putting in two hours of work -- the number of hours abigail could afford to pay him, marcus was on his way. the next day, he returned.\n\nfor the past two weeks he's been on time for his two-hour shift. and today, abigail plans to make his position permanent.\n\nsome restaurants wouldn't even let you use their restrooms, she said. i don't judge someone on how they look -- go use it. i do not treat [homeless people] any different.\n\nif restaurants and businesses don't do anything to help the less fortunate, then they become part of the problem, abigail said.\n\nlast weekend, abigail shared marcus' story on facebook to encourage others to give strangers a shot; the post was shared more than 30,000 times and received more than 1,500 comments.\n\nwe need more people like this, one person commented on the post. we are all human; we make mistakes.\n\nall we need sometimes is a helping hand, another said.\n\nmarcus, who has been living on the streets since he was 16 years old, still has a long way to go to turn his life around.\n\nit's going to be hard for him to let go of whatever addiction he has, abigail said. i want to help [him], but [he] needs to want to help [himself.]\n\nfor now, the pair decided to take 10 percent from his paycheck and set it aside so he can start learning to save his money.\n\njust like marcus, i had my help, abigail explained. i had plenty of people to help make it to where i am today. they believed i could do it. people need to have someone believe in them.
rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii, said she is running for president in an interview slated to air on cnn's the van jones show saturday evening. a source close to gabbard confirmed to cbs news that she is running.\n\nthere are a lot of reasons for me to make this decision. there are a lot of challenges that are facing the american people that i'm concerned about and that i want to help solve, she told jones, listing issues such as health care, criminal justice reform and climate change.\n\nthere is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, gabbard added. i look forward to being able to get into this and to talk about it in depth when we make our announcement.\n\ngabbard, one of bernie sanders' key surrogates in congress in 2016, been widely criticized for her views on syrian leader bashar al-assad, with some considering her an apologist for him. she met with assad in 2017.\n\nshe made waves recently for saying in a tweet that president trump is saudi arabia's bitch for announcing the u.s. will stand with saudi arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman's involvement in the killing of washington post columnist jamal khashoggi.\n\nhey @realdonaldtrump: being saudi arabia's bitch is not america first, gabbard tweeted.\n\nshe has also courted controversy by picking a fight with hawaii sen. mazie hirono. gabbard, in an op-ed in the hill, accused hirono of fomenting religious bigotry by questioning one of mr. trump's judicial nominees about his membership in the knights of columbus.\n\ngabbard, a native of american samoa, was elected to the hawaii state legislature in 2002 at the age of 21, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature in u.s. history at the time. she left office in 2004 and volunteered to be deployed to iraq. she would return in 2006, work for hawaii senator daniel akaka, then return to iraq in 2009.\n\nin 2010, she returned to office as a member of the hawaii city council. in 2012, she was elected to the u.s. house of representatives. she comes from a multicultural, multi-religious family and, as a practicing hindu, was the first hindu elected to congress.\n\ngabbard joins an increasingly crowded field of democrats vying to be president.\n\njack turman contributed to this report
frontier airlines has changed its in-flight tipping policies to allow flight attendants to pocket gratuities from serving food and beverages to passengers. the jan. 1 shift in rules ended a three-year policy of pooling flier tips among crew members.\n\nthe program has resulted in millions of dollars in tips since its inception more than three years ago, showing how much our customers appreciate the great work of our flight attendants, frontier spokesperson jonathan freed told cbs moneywatch.\n\nbut the shift comes amid strained contract negotiations with frontier's unionized employees, who are fighting for higher wages and other concessions, including better healthcare benefits and more flexible work schedules. flight attendants made a median salary of $50,500 in 2017, according to the u.s. bureau of labor statistics, and frontier lags other airlines in terms of wages, in some cases earning 20 percent to 30 percent less than their peers at rival airlines, like spirit, according to sara nelson, president of the association of flight attendants.\n\nfrontier gives passengers the option to tip flight crew for exceptional service in the air -- a practice union leaders and others say reduces flight attendants from safety professionals to flying waiters and waitresses, according to industry analyst and atmosphere research group founder henry harteveldt.\n\nnelson argued the tipping policy was designed to pass the cost [of labor] onto passengers. the jan. 1 change represents only a small victory, she said, in that it will create better transparency to ensure flight attendants are receiving the tips passengers intended to give.\n\nthe afa in 2011 negotiated its first contract with the airline after it filed for bankruptcy reorganization in 2008. the contract is currently amendable, and frontier flight attendants voted in november to strike unless their demands are met.\n\nit's a significant pay increase we are looking for, nelson said. frontier has gotten away all this time paying less than the market rate and they are really dragging at the bottom of the industry.\n\nsome analysts say the change in the tipping policy disadvantages both flight attendants and customers -- and only benefits the airline, the eighth-largest carrier in the u.s. with a reported $1.8 billion in revenue in 2017.\n\ni think it's a bad idea. i think it's also clearly a way for the company to reduce the amount of money it pays flight attendants. they're now at a point where they believe they should be able to pay the flight attendant less because they are making it up in tips, harteveldt said.\n\nhe also worries about the competition the new model could create among colleagues. it could pit the flight attendants against one another in terms of serving customers, and i am concerned about this policy creating tensions between flight crew members -- tensions that could boil over to frontier's customers, he said.\n\nsome airlines ban tipping altogether, including allegiant, whose policy states that flight attendants should decline tips if offered.\n\nnelson doesn't worry that the policy will catch on at other airlines.\n\nmost airlines understand that they don't want to set a tone in the cabin that flight attendants are there for service. they need to keep control -- they are in a safety environment, not a restaurant. first and foremost you need to get there safely and flight attendants need to be able to fill that role of authority in the cabin, she said.
scientists recently suggested that corporations have vastly underestimated the costs of climate change. the impending bankruptcy of pacific gas & electric could be proving them right.\n\nthe fires that raged through california in the past two years have been the some of the most devastating to ever hit the state, according to cal fire. in 2017, they did as much damage as all the wildfires in the prior 16 years, according to some estimates. that record stood for less than a year before it last november's disasters eclipsed it. the camp fire, which destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and took at least 86 lives, was the most destructive in california's history.\n\nthis is the new abnormal, former gov. jerry brown said.\n\nexperts agree that a changing climate has made wildfires more frequent and more damaging. longer, drier summers have extended the typical wildfire season and made trees more susceptible to burning, according to a recent u.s. government report on climate change. but wildfires aren't just a seasonal event anymore. now they're a year-round threat -- and not just in the west. the southeastern u.s., which has historically not seen wildfires, is increasingly at risk, as the 2016 fires in tennessee demonstrate.\n\nmeanwhile, infrastructure hasn't kept up. a 2015 review of u.s. infrastructure found that the biggest threat to it, by far, was climate change. and that's complicated by the reality of more people living in wooded and fire-prone areas, in houses that are increasingly more expensive and may not be fireproof.\n\nwe're continuing to build in areas in the urban-wildfire interface, and it's going to lead to damages to the larger economy, nik steinberg, head of analytics for four twenty seven, a climate-change research group, recently told cbs moneywatch.\n\nstate of constant crisis\n\n\n\nit's possible to prevent power lines from sparking fires or power outages by putting them underground. but that option was found to be so expensive that a utility watchdog group said it was really not feasible, according to the san francisco chronicle.\n\nand despite a state of constant crisis for infrastructure, other spending priorities -- often for more immediate needs -- mean it's almost inevitable that maintenance and investment get shifted to the back burner.\n\ni've had countless delays on our projects when we're trying to get infrastructure built or work, and we have a call from pg&e that they have to postpone that work because of a mudslide, or downed power lines, said brian curtis, ceo of concentric power. when you're doing that all the time, it's hard to keep up with preventative maintenance.\n\ncurtis, whose company builds microgrids, advocated for letting private customers build out parts of the grid, which they would then be responsible for maintaining. if you're an industrial consumer and you want to build your own generation or even just connect to the grid, the utility ends up building the infrastructure, but you're the one who ends up paying for it, he said.\n\nthere's a growing anger\n\n\n\nplenty of people in california fault pg&e for not doing enough to mitigate the fires. hearings before california's utility regulator have been flooded with people calling for criminal prosecution of the utility's executives.\n\nthere's a growing anger, steve zeltzer, a longtime bay area activist, told cbs moneywatch recently. people feel like there's no accountability, and these executives violate the law and get off scot-free while lives have been destroyed and communities have been destroyed.\n\ndemocratic senator jerry hill this week accused the pg&e of being dishonest and prioritize[ing] profits way over safety, he told the associated press. i don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.\n\nthere's no guarantee that pg&e's bankruptcy -- which would be one of the biggest by a u.s. company --will lead to the desired result. what's almost certain, however, is that the nearly $30 billion in damages pg&e potentially faces would be dramatically reduced in bankruptcy.\n\nunder california law, utilities must pay for wildfire damage if their equipment caused the fire, even if negligence wasn't involved. in most other states -- and for other types of natural disasters -- liability requires evidence that the utility was negligent. that system no longer works in a world where wildfires are more frequent and more destructive, said ralph cavanagh, co-director of the climate and clean energy program at the natural resources defense council.\n\nif you want electric service, you're going to have to find a different way to structure the system because no utility will survive. that's the lesson here, he said.\n\nsince all california utilities face similar challenges, cavanagh is worried that crippling pg&e wouldn't only eliminate a major investor in the state's clean-energy infrastructure. it could also spell doom for some of the very companies that have been at the forefront of decarbonizing the economy -- an effort that's key to the fight against climate change.\n\nnationwide, our utilities are cutting their emissions, cutting their carbon. it's a glorious success system for the country as a whole, he said. trying to maintain that momentum without your hometown utility is a losing proposition.\n\nno more insurance?\n\n\n\nthe insurance industry is demonstrating one way to handle rising costs: pass them on to homeowners in the form of high wildfire deductibles. some insurers, faced with higher payouts, could outright refuse to insure homes in wildfire-prone areas.\n\nlawmakers recently let pg&e raise rates to cover the costs of the 2017 wildfires, but they balked at repeating that after the vastly more expensive disasters of 2018. vox asked: how does a utility price in the risks of rising temperatures and stay in business?\n\nthe answer is still somewhere out there.
as part of its efforts to combat the opioid epidemic, the u.s. food & drug administration is asking manufacturers of over-the-counter anti-diarrhea treatments to change the way they package their products. the fda says the voluntary measures are needed to curb the growing abuse of loperamide – sold under the brand name imodium a-d, as well as store brands and generics – which is used by some suffering from opioid addiction as a potential way to manage withdrawal or maintain a high.\n\nloperamide is safe at approved doses, up to a maximum of four 2-milligram tablets per day without a prescription. but when higher than recommended doses are taken we've received reports of serious heart problems and deaths with loperamide, particularly among people who are intentionally misusing or abusing high doses, fda commissioner scott gottlieb, m.d., said in a statement.\n\nexperts say it takes an enormous dose of anti-diarrhea medication to get high. addicts have been found to be popping anywhere from 50 to 300 pills per day.\n\naccording to a 2016 study published in the annals of emergency medicine, imodium a-d, in massive doses, works in the body the same way as heroin, morphine, and oxycodone. however, imodium a-d is a cheaper alternative since some big box stores sell 400 tablets for less than $10.\n\nthe anti-diarrhea drug loperamide, sold under the brand name imodium. wtvh\n\nfolks that are desperately addicted, folks that are looking to stave off withdrawal symptoms will do whatever it takes sometimes, really extreme things, dr. jeffrey reynolds, of the family and children's association, told cbs new york at the time that study was published. so in the scheme of things, taking 300 pills is not unheard of.\n\ndr. robert glatter, an emergency physician at lenox hill hospital in new york city, says he has encountered patients who abuse loperamide either to get high or to self-treat symptoms of opioid withdrawal.\n\nmany people view it as low risk since they think it's only medicine to treat diarrhea, he said. but those who abuse it to get high are gambling with their life, in essence. simply put, escalating use may place you at risk for an overdose.\n\nin the spring of 2017, the fda added a warning to the product label to warn against ingesting high doses of loperamide, including from abuse and misuse.\n\nthis week, the fda sent letters to manufacturers asking that they take additional steps, including limiting the amount of loperamide per package for short-term use. for example, a retail package could contain eight 2-milligram capsules – enough for two days.\n\nwe asked the manufacturers to take the necessary steps to implement these changes in a timely fashion to address these public health concerns, gottlieb said.\n\nhe said the fda also intends to reach out to distributors who sell loperamide online to ask for their cooperation in limiting the quantities sold. we know that many of the bulk purchases of these large volumes are being made online through major online web retailers, gottlieb said.\n\nglatter said he applauds the fda for adding restrictions to packaging that can help to protect teens and adults who abuse loperamide. but he adds that more needs to be done to raise awareness of the problem. it also starts with education, and informing parents and teens via social media platforms of the dangers of loperamide abuse.
on the great white way, broadway producers are constantly designing new shows, and re-designing old ones. and it certainly doesn't hurt the chances of a broadway revival if it features one of the biggest talents of our time, as cbs this morning co-anchor gayle king shows us:\n\nsimply put, bette midler is the ultimate designing woman.\n\nin a career spanning generations, she is constantly creating and recreating, leaving a trail of memorable personas and unforgettable performances. and at age 71, she's re-inventing herself, yet again.\n\nthis is the biggest challenge of my career, she told king. and i needed a challenge.\n\ni had been on the road. i came off the road two years ago. and that was a huge show. and it was a very successful show. i took it to europe, had a great time. but i had done it. and i didn't want to do it again.\n\nwhat she's done instead is return to broadway, starring in hello, dolly! -- winning rave reviews, earning a tony nomination, and playing to sold-out houses.\n\nbette midler received a tony award nomination for best actress in a musical for her performance as dolly levy in the revival of the 1964 jerry herman musical, hello, dolly! hello, dolly/julieta cervantes\n\nit is extraordinary, she said. and i'm very grateful for it. and it doesn't matter in what frame of mind i come into the theatre -- i know that when i get out there, it's going to be there. and i'm just going to sail -- we're going to go on a little journey that's a lovely, little, joyous journey for two-and-a-half hours. and we're gonna have a ball!\n\nmidler is matchmaker dolly levi, the role famously originated by carol channing back in 1964.\n\nking asked, were you worried about coming after her model?\n\nterribly, midler replied. and i went to see carol.\n\nwas it intimidating meeting here to talk playing this role?\n\nwell, she is very close to six feet tall. and i'm very, very little. but she was so gracious and so loving and sweet. that's all i can say. it was an unforgettable afternoon with her.\n\nto midler, dolly has a message aimed at one particular group: this part is for a woman of a certain age who can make it her own. and it can be hilarious. and i really wanted it to be funny.\n\nyou said 'women of a certain age.' and every time i hear that -- because now that phrase, i'm starting to hear that a lot -- \n\noh, really? that's a very old-fashioned and polite way of saying, mmmm ...\n\nshe old.\n\ni'm actually thrilled, midler said. and i think the crowd is thrilled, too. because a lot of people my age are coming. and they see me skipping, and they flip out. i skip -- a step that they haven't done since they were seven. and they feel like, 'wow. if she's doing it, maybe i can do it, too.' and i love that.\n\nmidler's career pretty much began on the great white way, shortly after arriving in new york from hawaii. she appeared in fiddler on the roof. she was 20.\n\nwell, i came to do broadway musicals, she said. i had been in community theatre as a kid, 14 years old. i was fired from my first show.\n\nwhy? because i upstaged the lead! she laughed.\n\nyou might be surprised to learn that hello, dolly! is midler's first time back in a broadway musical in nearly half-a-century.\n\nthat's a long time, said king. fifty years it's taken you to come back to the musical theatre.\n\nfif-ty years! no lie. no lie. isn't that interesting?\n\nsince you love it so much, why did it take you so long?\n\nwell, i loved it. i loved it in the days that i was working in it, but it changed, you know? midler replied. it changed considerably. it wasn't musical comedy anymore. it was more musical theatre. it became much more serious. i wanted musical comedy. i wanted to be funny on the stage and i wanted to be able to sing and dance on the stage.\n\nwhen king asked midler for the story about her salmon-pink hair highlights, midler laughed: there's no story. it's semi-permanent. wash it in, wash it out. have some fun!\n\nbut you don't see -- there i go again --'women of a certain age' with pink highlights.\n\nyes, you do!\n\nfair to say, bette midler does it all -- singer, comedian, actress, activist, truly comfortable center-stage.\n\nking said, i've heard you say that on stage you are absolutely fearless, that you are really in your comfort zone when you're on the stage.\n\nyeah, i'm very happy here, midler replied. i've been happy ever since i discovered that i could make people laugh. and it's a great place to be. it's warm. it's very warm. the lights are warm. and you know, you look great because the lights are so gorgeous. and often they put you in a very beautiful costume, so you look your best. so yes, i am very comfortable here.\n\nat ease on stage -- private in real life. i'm shy. i'm basically quite shy, midler said.\n\nstop, bette midler. stop. you are basically shy?\n\ntruly! i'm a librarian, and everyone knows it. i've been saying it for years. i'm like a reader. i'm a bookworm. i peek out, and i observe. i'm very observant. and i do take things from a lot of sources, but i'm shy.\n\nbetter midler in the rose (1979). 20th century fox\n\nmidler has made dozens of movies, from hocus pocus and beaches to the first wives club. but one role stands out for her: the rose. oh, that was my favorite movie that i ever made. i had a great group around me, and it was a beautiful, beautiful production. wonderful. i loved it. and i loved her, 'cause i totally understood her. i knew where she was coming from. i knew the pain that she had lived through.\n\nand then there's her alter-ego, the divine miss m.\n\nwhat's she up to these days? well, she's working in a broadway show! midler laughed.\n\nwill we see her again? king asked.\n\nwell, i did retire my mermaid. last year we deep-sixed her.\n\nbut you always have the right to change your mind, bette midler.\n\ni don't want to put on a fish tail again! midler replied. i'm sorry, gail -- the time has passed.\n\nso no more mermaid. but that's okay. bette midler is standing tall, firmly rooted in the present.\n\nin fact, she tells king, i never look back. never look back. never look back. 'cause if you're looking back, you can't look forward. you can't go forward.\n\nthe divine bette midler -- moving forward, and giving back, with one magical emotion: it is love. and it's joy, too. towards the end of the show when you've heard them laughing all night long in a way that you haven't heard a crowd laugh in many, many years, you know that you've given them something that nourished their souls in a way.\n\nbette midler in the broadway revival of the jerry herman musical, hello, dolly! julieta cervantes/hello, dolly!\n\n\n\nfor more info:
drugmakers are starting 2019 with a slew of price hikes, affecting more than 1,000 medications.\n\nthe average increase amounts to about 6 percent, said michael rea, founder and ceo of rx savings solutions, which sells software that helps employers and health plans analyze drug prices. among the best-known drugs getting costlier are the opioid oxycontin, with a 9.5 percent jump, and the blood thinner pradaxa, up 8 percent.\n\nthose increases underscore the challenges facing consumers and health care plans as drug costs far outpace the rate of inflation or wage growth. americans spent $535 billion on prescription drugs last year, an increase of 50 percent since 2010, according to one estimate.\n\na 9 percent increase isn't just over inflation -- it's four times inflation, rea noted. no matter what, that effect is felt by consumers, by payers and the solvency of public and private health plans.\n\ninflation around the u.s. remains around 2 percent.\n\npurdue pharmaceuticals, the manufacturer of oxycontin, didn't immediately return requests for comment.\n\nboehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals, the maker of pradaxa, said its goal is for no patients to be denied access to our medicines because of cost. the company offers programs for patients who can't afford medications, like co-pay assistance, a representative for the firm noted in an email.\n\ntaking price increases does not directly translate to increased profits for our company, it added. most of the increases on our list price, or wholesale acquisition cost is lost through a competitive rebating and contracting process with insurers, pharmacy benefit managers and the government, among others.\n\ndiscounts and rebates\n\ndrug companies say they must raise prices to fund development of new medicines. phrma, the pharmacy industry's trade group, said the analysis was flawed and inaccurate, failing to account for the rebates and discounts provided to insurers.\n\nthe data focus on a selective sample of companies and medicines and ignores how the competitive market works to control costs, it said in an emailed statement. due to negotiations in the market, retail medicine costs grew just 0.4 percent in 2017, the slowest rate since 2012, and net prices for brand medicines grew just 1.9 percent.\n\nother drugs seeing higher prices this year, according to rx: pain-relief med subsys, made by insys, up 9.5 percent, and tecfidera, a psoriasis medication made by biogen whose cost is rising 6 percent.\n\npaying more for the same?\n\nconsumers don't typically pay a drug's list price because discounts and insurance often cut the final cost. in some cases, however, people are paying more even though the medication has had no significant change. that was the case with turing pharmaceuticals, whose ceo, martin shkreli, in 2015 became the poster boy for excessive drug price hikes after he engineered a 5,000 percent price increase for the life-saving medication daraprim.\n\ninsulin is one vital drug that has drawn attention from lawmakers and diabetics, some of whom report cutting back on the medication after prices more than tripled from 2002 to 2013. since then, insulin prices have continued to climb -- costs for the drug from two manufacturers rose almost 8 percent in 2017.\n\nthat may shock some consumers, given that insulin is a nearly 100-year-old medication whose inventors sold the patent for about $3 to get the drug to as many diabetics as possible. but drugmakers have made small tweaks to their insulin products, allowing them to maintain their patents for years.\n\none diabetes drug whose price has shot up lately is metformin, which treats high blood sugar. its manufacturer, granules pharmaceutical, in december jacked up the price 148 percent, rea said.\n\ngranules said the figure was misleading. we launched metformin xr in september 2018 and due to changes in the average wholesale price, it appears granules raised pricing by 148 percent, wrote granules executive vijay ramanavarapu in an email. however in actuality our net pricing in 2018 was static.\n\ntrump's promise\n\npresident donald trump has vowed to reduce drug prices, making it a key part of his election campaign, and last year accused drugmakers of getting away with murder.\n\nso far, there's little evidence his administration's efforts are slowing the steady increase in drug prices. earlier this year, pfizer raised the price on some of its well-known medications, including the erectile dysfunction drug viagra.\n\ni think the ideas are great, and i commend anybody who is fighting the fight with this, rea said. it's like you have the hoover dam and it has 50 holes in it, and you take a stick of bubble gum and put it in one hole. if you're effective, the water will still rush out of the other 49 holes.
eight days ago, georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger was at home when he received a phone call from the president of the united states. it was the eighteenth time president donald trump attempted to call raffensperger following the november election.\n\nin a highly unusual move, the president had already directly called an investigator from raffensperger's office, telling them they would be a national hero if they found evidence of fraud. but no evidence was found that would change the outcome of the election.\n\nfor about an hour on his call with raffensperger, mr. trump rambled through a list of false claims and disproven allegations about voter fraud in georgia, incorrectly stating 30 times that he won the 2020 presidential election. when raffensperger, a lifelong republican and the elected official tasked with overseeing georgia's elections, rebuffed mr. trump's request to find 12,000 votes, the president resorted to threats. the secretary of state was unmoved.\n\non sunday's broadcast of 60 minutes, raffensperger further rebutted false claims made by mr. trump and his allies in an interview with correspondent scott pelley.\n\nin the previously unreleased clip above, raffensperger explains how georgia implemented a new online absentee ballot portal that included a photo id component and signature matching elements, voting processes that have drawn sharp criticism from democrats who say it disenfranchises voters.\n\nsurveillance footage from fulton county\n\ngabriel sterling did not sleep in his own bed the night a violent mob of protestors stormed the united states capitol. the republican and chief operating officer for the georgia secretary of state was the recipient of death threats warning him to sleep with one eye open and including images of his house.\n\nsterling and his boss, georgia secretary of state, brad raffensperger, oversaw the 2020 presidential election and 2021 senate run-off elections in the peach state. both officials began receiving death threats after mr. trump and georgia outgoing senators david perdue and kelly loeffler alleged widespread voter fraud and called for raffensperger to resign. he refused.\n\nsince the november election, sterling has been on a mission to prove the inaccuracy of claims made by mr. trump, his personal attorney rudolph giuliani and other lawyers closely associated with the trump campaign.\n\nit's like having a shovel in your hand and trying to empty the ocean, sterling told 60 minutes about his effort to fight mr. trump's false claims. i have this tortoise and hare thing in my head going. if i just keep on going out and telling the truth and i keep on doing it, at some point it's going to get through.\n\non sunday's episode of 60 minutes, sterling showed correspondent scott pelley how giuliani touted selectively edited surveillance video from fulton county to question the integrity of georgia's election.\n\nwhat's frustrating to me is they had this whole video, sterling told pelley in the video above. they know what happened here. they [are] intentionally misleading people and that's what's so frustrating. it's one thing to think you have suspicions, but to intentionally mislead people using falsified evidence by giving them only part of it is infuriating.\n\nthe secretary of state's office posted unedited surveillance footage taken from fulton county's state farm arena for the public to access.\n\nthe facts behind georgia's dominion voting machines\n\nwhen mr. trump called georgia secretary of state raffensperger on january 5, in an effort to change the outcome of the 2020 election, the president mentioned the state's use of dominion voting machines nearly a dozen times.\n\nthe voting machine company became a target of conspiracy ramblings and unsuccessful legal motions filed by trump-affiliated lawyers before entering the consciousness of mr. trump himself.\n\ndominion voting systems files defamation suit against sidney powell, lawyer who pushed trump election conspiracy theories\n\nin the web extra above, raffensperger told 60 minutes the dominion machines provide a verifiable paper ballot trail that insured the georgia vote tabulation was correct.\n\nchris krebs further supported the assertion. the former director of the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (cisa) who was tasked with securing the 2020 election told scott pelley in november that paper ballots verify that there was no malicious algorithm or hacked software that adjusted the tally of the vote.\n\nthe videos above were produced by keith zubrow and sarah shafer prediger. they were edited by sarah shafer prediger.
when home sales weaken, prices typically do, too, providing breathing room for buyers.\n\nthat's not quite the case now. home purchases in many areas of the country have dipped, and price gains have slowed. yet more middle-class americans are finding that home ownership is unaffordable.\n\nwhy? mortgage rates are up after years near historic lows. price increases have been outrunning paychecks. and at a target price that families with a median income could afford, fewer homes are for sale. even a modest rise in interest rates has a big impact on homebuyers, particularly in expensive markets, adding hundred of dollars onto the monthly cost of a mortgage.\n\nin the past year, the availability of homes that a middle-class family could buy has declined in 86 percent of the largest metro areas, according to an analysis of 49 cities being released wednesday by the real estate brokerage redfin and provided in advance to the associated press.\n\nthat figure assumes a 20 percent down payment. if a buyer can put only 10 percent down — common among first-timers — the number of affordable listings fell in 94 percent of those metro areas, redfin found.\n\nhousing prices went up so much in 2017 and the first half of 2018 that we reached a point where buyers just couldn't pay these high prices, said daryl fairweather, chief economist at redfin.\n\nand it's more affordable to rent, rather than buy, that roof over your head in 93 percent of larger counties around the u.s. (those with populations of at least 1 million), according to a recent analysis by property research firm attom solutions. that includes real estate markets known for sky-high prices and a shortage of a middle-class housing, including boston, chicago, las vegas, miami, new york, san francisco and other big cities.\n\nslumping sales\n\nthe effect of those unsustainable price gains is evident in the slumping year-end sales totals tracked by the national association of realtors. sales tumbled 3.1 percent last year to 5.34 million, the fewest since 2015, the realtors reported tuesday.\n\nthe strong economy offered little support to would-be buyers because mortgage rates climbed for much of last year, making purchases costlier. though more homes are on the market compared with 2017, they're increasingly clustered in price ranges that only the affluent or wealthy can afford.\n\nthe redfin analysis found that on average, 55 percent of homes listed for sale were affordable with a 10 percent down payment. that was a drop from 60 percent in 2017. a higher 20 percent down payment would make monthly payments more manageable, but loan data suggest that a growing number of first-time buyers can't put down 20 percent.\n\nthe squeeze goes well beyond the famously high-priced home markets of san francisco, seattle and new york. in metro areas long known for affordable home values — milwaukee, memphis, pittsburgh, st. louis, phoenix and others — the number of homes for sale that a household with a median income could afford has slipped.\n\nmajor risk\n\nthe trend poses a major risk for many americans: household equity is the principal source of wealth for middle class households; without it, many would struggle to build much wealth at all.\n\nthe median net worth of an american homeowner is $231,400, according to the federal reserve. that is more than 44 times the median net worth of renters, which is $5,200. the median net worth of homeowners surged by an inflation-adjusted 15 percent from 2013 to 2016, according to the fed, while renters actually became poorer over that time.\n\nhome affordability has been worsening since the real estate market bottomed in 2012. the recovery in home values has easily surpassed gains in typical paychecks. this made many existing homeowners better off — though not enough to necessarily move up to costlier homes. and their decision to stay put has compounded the shortage of homes for sale.\n\nin the dallas area, just 55 percent of the listings are affordable for median-income families with 10 percent down payments. that's a decline from 59 percent in 2017.\n\ncathy mitchell, a real estate broker in the dallas area, said it's really tough to find starter homes for $150,000 or less. mitchell said some builders are beginning to shift their focus away from luxury properties to more affordable homes. but she said she thinks any such trend will be gradual.\n\ni am hoping it's going to change, she said. but is it going to change right away? i don't think so.\n\nincomes fall short\n\nnationally, home values have climbed 44 percent on average since 2012 but incomes only about 15 percent, according to tendayi kapfidze, chief economist at the online loan broker lendingtree.\n\nultimately, incomes are the anchor or the gravitational field on prices, kapfidze said.\n\nif the housing market is to accelerate again, he added, incomes will need to start rising faster than home values or home values must decline. the slowdown in price increases should eventually boost the supply of homes for sale, though, kapfidze said.\n\nthe realtors' december sales report found that the median home price had risen just 2.9 percent in the past year to $253,600. this marked the first time since 2012 that home price gains were lower than increases in average hourly earnings, which have risen 3.2 percent in the past 12 months.\n\nbut the gap between home-price growth and typical pay raises remains so wide that it could take the housing market several more months of lower price gains to adjust.\n\nit's a very slow process — and there's no guarantees, kapfidze said.
new york -- mayor eric garcetti spoke exclusively with cbs news on friday, reflecting on how the history of the 1992 los angeles riots has shaped the city over the years.\n\ngarcetti said the disconnect between the public and authorities appeared to be the main source of turmoil years ago.\n\nlos angeles in 1992 was a different place, garcetti said. it was much more segregated. [people] felt helpless because their voices hadn't been heard. this was something that happened long before there were cell phones.\n\nwe had too many disconnects where there was no accountability, he continued. we had to find projects to bring our city together. ultimately, it took the federal government's consent to take over our police department.\n\ngarcetti says he is hopeful about the future safety of the city, which has adopted radical changes such as the police department's use of body cameras.\n\nthe trust is much stronger now, he said. i think there is more accountability. we are never perfect, but i would say we're half way up the mountain. we're still vulnerable, and that's why we have to keep improving every day.\n\ni think any city in america can erupt in violence, the mayor added. violence happens spontaneously and quickly. i think what you can do in the meantime is change the system, vent the feelings, and let human beings know that there is accountability.\n\n1992 l.a. riots\n\nchaos erupted in the streets on april 29, 1992, moments after a jury acquitted four police officers accused in the videotaped beating of rodney king, an african american man, during a traffic stop.\n\nthe verdict led to widespread anger and mass rioting over several days, which was largely driven by social unrest. the incident caused destruction and turmoil of historic proportions.\n\nsaturday marks the 25th anniversary of the riots.
california's coronavirus catastrophe reached a staggering new level monday as johns hopkins university data showed the nation's most populous state has recorded more than 30,000 deaths since the pandemic started nearly a year ago. deaths have exploded since a surge in reported covid-19 cases began in october. it took california six months to record its first 10,000 deaths. but in barely a month, the total rose from 20,000 to 30,000.\n\nover the weekend, state officials reported a two-day record of 1,163 deaths. hospitalizations also have exploded and many hospitals are stretched to the limit.\n\ncalifornia ranks third nationally in coronavirus deaths, behind texas and new york, which is in the no. 1 position with nearly 40,000.\n\ntwo nurses put a ventilator on a patient in a covid-19 unit at st. joseph hospital in orange, calif. thursday, january 7, 2021. jae c. hong / ap\n\nhealth officials have warned the worst is yet to come later this month, when there's full picture on infections from the holidays.\n\nin los angeles county, deaths have topped 12,000 and confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 900,000. cbs los angeles reports that as a result of the continuing surge, military personnel have arrived to assist in los angeles county and riverside with the record-number of cases.\n\ni presume now that every patient that i am seeing and i act like every patient that i am seeing is covid positive. except for my last few shifts, i would say that close to 80 percent, maybe 90 percent of patients, are covid positive, said dr. haig aintablian, a ucla emergency room physician.\n\nduring the weekend, county public health director barbara ferrer characterized the spread of the virus as immense and said it reflected unsafe things people did during the holidays, making any activity outside a household much more risky.\n\nthis is just not the time to go to the shopping mall or to a friend's house to watch a basketball or football game, ferrer said.\n\nlos angeles county, meanwhile, announced it will stop using curative covid-19 tests at pop-up testing sites after a u.s. food and drug administration alert to patients and health care providers that the test could produce false negatives.\n\nthe department said curative pcr tests at the pop-up sites between december 13 and january 2 made up about 10% of all covid-19 tests administered at county-supported test sites during that same time frame. the switch to fulgent genetics tests will take place this week.\n\nin another change, the city of los angeles announced late sunday that its huge covid-19 testing site at dodger stadium will be transformed into a massive vaccination center by the end of the week.\n\nthis shift in resources will temporarily reduce testing capacity in la county, but it will more than triple the number of daily vaccines available to be dispersed to angelenos, a city statement said.\n\nmayor eric garcetti said vaccines are the surest route to defeating this virus and charting a course to recovery.\n\nthe first covid-19 case in california was confirmed january 25. the death of a san jose woman on february 6 is the first known u.s. death from covid-19.\n\nmany of the state's hospitals are out of regular intensive care beds for the sickest covid-19 patients.\n\nthe hardest-hit areas are 15 counties in southern california and the agricultural san joaquin valley. those counties comprise a majority of the state's population, including many lower-income residents who may live in crowded areas or work in jobs that place them in close contact with customers or other employees, increasing their risk of infection.\n\nhospitals in the counties have been ordered to delay non-essential elective surgeries, such as knee replacements, to make room.\n\nthe biggest fear is that after a surge of cases from christmas and new year's gatherings hospitals will be tipped into rationing care — apportioning care on the basis of who has the best chance of survival.\n\nlawmakers and public health officials say that surge on top of a surge would involve people who were infected when they ignored social distancing rules to gather with friends and relatives during the holidays.
cupertino, california -- apple ceo tim cook defended his company's opposition to the fbi's iphone-hacking plan at its annual shareholder meeting, one day after the tech giant formally challenged a court order to help the fbi unlock an encrypted iphone used by a murderous extremist in san bernardino, california.\n\nwe do these because these are the right things to do, cook said in a brief reference to the company's privacy stance in the case.\n\nmajor tech companies are also rallying to apple's cause, and now plan a joint friend of the court brief on its behalf. facebook said it will join with google, twitter and microsoft on a joint court filing. a twitter spokeswoman confirmed that plan, but said that different companies and trade associations will likely file multiple briefs.\n\nfederal officials have said they're only asking for narrow assistance in bypassing some of the phone's security features. but apple contends the order would force it to write a software program that would make other iphones vulnerable to hacking by authorities or criminals in the future.\n\napple filed court papers on thursday that asked u.s. magistrate sheri pym to reverse her order on the grounds that it over-reached the government's legal authority by forcing the company to weaken the security of its own products. the company accused the government of seeking dangerous power through the courts and of trampling on its constitutional rights.\n\nthe dispute raises broad issues of legal and social policy, with at least one poll showing 51 percent of americans think apple should cooperate by helping the government unlock the iphone.\n\nbut it's unclear how the controversy might affect apple's business. analysts at piper jaffray said a survey they commissioned last week found the controversy wasn't hurting the way most americans think about apple or its products.\n\nat least one shareholder at friday's meeting voiced support for the company's stance.\n\napple is 100 percent correct in not providing or doing research to create software to break into it, said tom rapko, an apple investor from santa barbara, california, as he waited in line to enter the auditorium at apple's headquarters. i think if you give the government an inch, they'll take a yard.\n\nthe company also received support from the rev. jesse jackson and a representative from the electronic frontier foundation, an internet rights groups.\n\nwe applaud your leadership, jackson, a longtime civil rights leader and former adviser to martin luther king jr., told cook. i recall the fbi wiretapping dr. king in the civil rights movement, he added. we cannot go down this path again. some of us do remember the days of (former fbi director j. edgar) hoover and mccarthy and nixon and enemies lists.\n\napple's share price has seen little change since the issue erupted in the news last week. overall, though, the company's stock has declined in recent months over worries that iphone sales were slowing around the world.\n\na hearing on the iphone legal dispute is scheduled for next month.
the end of the road to impeachment\n\nas house impeachment managers and president trump's defense team wrapped up two weeks of arguments thursday night, the senate faces a pivotal vote friday on whether to call witnesses in the impeachment trial of president trump.\n\nahead of the vote, two of four potential republican defectors - retiring tennessee republican lamar alexander and lisa murkowski of alaska - announced they would not support the measure.\n\nalexander wrote in a statement that while it was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold united states aid to encourage that investigation, the charges don't warrant grounds for impeachment. murkowski concluded that there will be no fair trial in the senate and additional evidence won't change anything.\n\nwith murkowski's eleventh-hour decision to vote no, the gop is now poised to block witnesses from testifying.\n\nsenior white house officials and senate republican leadership predict a final vote to acquit the president won't happen until wednesday, which would mean the trial would extend into trump's state of the union address on tuesday.\n\niowans head to caucus\n\niowa democrats gather together monday to kick off the nomination contests that eventually lead to the party's nominee.\n\nlatest cbs news polling shows a tight and fluid race heading into the final push in iowa, with vermont sen. bernie sanders leading the pack with 26%, former vice president joe biden closely following at 25% and south bend indiana mayor pete buttigieg within striking distance at 22%.\n\nglobal health emergency\n\nas the coronavirus outbreak has spread to 22 countries, the u.s. state department is warning americans not to travel to china, issuing its most serious travel advisory after the world health organization declared the wuhan coronavirus to be a global health emergency.\n\nmore than 200 people in china have died and the number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide has risen to nearly 10,000.\n\nface the nation guest lineup:\n\nrepresentative adam schiff , @repadamschiff\n\n\n\n, @repadamschiff national security adviser robert obrien\n\ndemocratic presidential candidate pete buttigieg , @petebuttigieg\n\n\n\n, @petebuttigieg dnc chair ronna mcdaniel , @gopchairwoman\n\n\n\n, @gopchairwoman anthony salvanto, cbs news elections & surveys director, @salvantocbs\n\n\n\ncbs news elections & surveys director, @salvantocbs ed o'keefe, cbs news political correspondent, @edokeefe\n\n\n\nhow to watch face the nation\n\ndate: sunday, february 2, 2020\n\ntv: face the nation airs sunday mornings on cbs. click here for your local listings\n\nradio: subscribe to face the nation from cbs radio news to listen on-the-go\n\nfree online stream: watch a rebroadcast of the show on cbs' streaming network cbsn at 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. et.\n\nwith the latest news and analysis from washington, don't miss margaret brennan (@margbrennan) this sunday on face the nation (@facethenation).\n\nand for the latest from america's premier public affairs program, follow us on facebook, twitter, and instagram.
new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to congress, recently sat down with anderson cooper for an interview airing sunday on 60 minutes. see the full interview at 7 p.m. et/pt on cbs.\n\nanderson cooper: you're willing to compromise?\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez: yeah, absolutely. absolutely.\n\nit's just about what we choose to compromise.\n\nmy personal opinion, and i know that my district and my community feels this way as well, is that we as a party have compromised too much, and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. and —\n\nanderson cooper: the democratic party has lost too much —\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez: i think so. i think — i think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised, whether it's judgeships with mitch mcconnell, whether it's compromising on climate change. i think we've — there are some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on. but am i open to compromise on certain ways to get things done? absolutely. absolutely.
virgin galactic is one step closer to their goal of sending tourists to outer space.\n\nthe company revealed their new spaceship, the unity, friday in mojave, california, which could be the future of private space travel, helping ordinary citizens become astronauts, reports cbs news correspondent carter evans.\n\ntogether we can make space accessible in a way that has only been dreamt of before now, and by doing that we can truly bring positive change to life on earth, said virgin galactic founder richard branson.\n\nbranson's 1-year-old granddaughter christened the ship friday at the star-studded event.\n\nunlike spacex and blue origin that are testing reusable rockets to move humans and cargo, branson is focused solely on tourism. the shuttle is designed to detach from an airplane, turn on its rocket engine and blast into sub-orbital space.\n\nfrom 50 miles above earth, passengers will be able to experience a few minutes of weightlessness. seven-hundred people have already put down deposits of $250,000 to reserve their seats.\n\ninside her spacious cabin, hearts and minds will be transformed by the unique experiences that touches those who step away from earth's bounds and see our planet for the first time with their own eyes and in a new light, branson said.\n\nbut amid the celebration, the event also took a somber tone as the company addressed the deadly test flight in 2014. an ntsb investigation revealed the pilot unlocked part of the re-entry system too early. the company says the new ship has more fail-safes to prevent pilot error.\n\nbranson said he questioned continuing the program after the crash but felt that it was too important to walk away.\n\nwhat a great testament this spaceship is to what can be achieved against any background, when true teamwork, great skill and deep pride are combined with a common purpose, branson said.
janet jackson is finally a mom.\n\nthe control singer welcomed her first child -- a boy named eissa -- with husband wissam al mana on tuesday, her rep confirmed to people magazine.\n\njanet jackson and husband wissam al mana are thrilled to welcome their new son, eissa al mana, into the world, the rep said in a statement. janet had a stress-free healthy delivery and is resting comfortably.\n\njackson and al mana were married in 2012. in april, the singer postponed her unbreakable world tour for family reasons.\n\nwe're in the second leg of the tour, and there actually has been a sudden change, she said in a video statement released on twitter. i thought it was important that you be the first to know.\n\nmy husband and i are planning our family, she said. so i'm going to have to delay the tour.
chicago -- a yearlong study offers rigorous new evidence against using prescription opioids for chronic pain. in patients with stubborn back aches or hip or knee arthritis, opioids worked no better than over-the-counter drugs or other nonopioids at reducing problems with walking or sleeping. and they provided slightly less pain relief.\n\nopioids tested included generic vicodin, oxycodone or fentanyl patches although few patients needed the most potent opioids. nonopioids included generic tylenol, ibuprofen and prescription pills for nerve or muscle pain. the study randomly assigned patients to take opioids or other painkillers. that's the gold standard design for research.\n\nif they don't work better than less risky drugs, there's no reason to use opioids given their really nasty side effects -- death and addiction, said lead author dr. erin krebs, a physician and researcher with the minneapolis veterans affairs health care system.\n\nthe results likely will surprise many people because opioids have this reputation as being really powerful painkillers, and that is not what we found, krebs said.\n\nthe study came out on the same day that the u.s. centers for disease control (cdc) reported more troubling news about the scale of the current opioid epidemic. according to the cdc study, which examined data from 16 states, hospital emergency department visits for suspected opioid overdoses jumped 30 percent from july 2016 through september 2017. some states saw increases of 70 or 80 percent or even more.\n\nin a press briefing on tuesday, cdc acting director anne schuchat, m.d., said the u.s. is seeing the highest drug overdose death rate ever recorded in the country.\n\nthe pain reduction study was published tuesday in the journal of the american medical association. its findings echo the results of previous, less rigorous studies, providing more evidence to bolster guidelines against routine use of opioids for chronic pain.\n\nabout 42,000 drug overdose deaths in the u.s. in 2016 involved opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl. many people get hooked while taking opioids prescribed for injuries or other short-term pain and move on to cheaper, more accessible illicit drugs like heroin.\n\ni think people need to be aware that if they're given an option for opioids, they should ask to try non-opioid options. it should be used in the lowest dose for the least amount of time possible, and that according to this study it was really not as effective, cbs news medical contributor dr. tara narula said on cbs this morning wednesday.\n\nkrebs said the strongest evidence from other studies shows that physical therapy, exercise or rehabilitation therapy works best for chronic pain. and she said noted that there are a variety of nonopioid drugs to try if one type doesn't work.\n\nu.s. government guidelines in 2016 said opioids are not the preferred treatment for chronic pain, and they recommend non-drug treatment or nonopioid painkillers instead. opioids should only be used if other methods don't work for chronic pain, the guidelines recommend. prescribing rates have declined slightly in recent years although they are still much higher than two decades ago.\n\ndoctors are more aware now, narula said, and they are being more conscious about not prescribing.\n\nshe added that patients also need to be aware of the risks and not seek prescription painkillers when other options are available. a lot of this is education for patients, for families, she said.\n\nthe study involved 234 patients from minneapolis-area va clinics who were assigned to use generic versions of opioids or nonopioids for a year. follow-up ended in 2016.\n\nthis is a very important study, said dr. david reuben, geriatrics chief at ucla's medical school. it will likely change the approach to managing long-term back, hip and knee pain.\n\nhe noted one limitation -- most study participants were men, but krebs said the results in women studied were similar.\n\nthe study's opioid patients started on relatively low daily doses of morphine, oxycodone or generic vicodin. they switched to higher doses if needed or to long-acting opioids or fentanyl patches. the nonopioid group started on acetaminophen, ibuprofen or similar anti-inflammatory drugs. they also could switch to higher doses or prescription nonopioid pain pills. few in either group used the strongest medicines.\n\npatients reported changes in function or pain on questionnaires. function scores improved in each group by about two points on an 11-point scale, where higher scores meant worse function. both groups started out with average pain and function scores of about 5.5 points.\n\npain intensity dropped about two points in the nonopioid group and slightly less in the opioid patients.\n\nother research has shown that over-the-counter medicines can also work as well as opioids at treating short-term pain, including from broken bones, kidney stones or dental work.
when president donald trump paid a visit to the national institutes of health last march, the leads at the vaccine research center explained their life-saving mission. the key to that mission was a 34-year-old doctor named dr. kizzmekia corbett.\n\ni was just there telling the task force about the work that we've been doing, corbett told cbs this morning: saturday co-host michelle miller.\n\ntwo weeks after the visit, corbett's team began the first stage of clinical trials. she said they took a lot of the knowledge they have gained in the last six years and applied it to a vaccine platform in collaboration with moderna. the vaccine rolled out 10 months later.\n\nthe vaccine teaches the body how to fend off a virus, because it teaches the body how to look for the virus by basically just showing the body the spike protein of the virus she explained. the body then says 'oh, we've seen this protein before. let's go fight against it.' that's how it works.\n\ndr. anthony fauci, the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health, credited corbett during a webinar for her work.\n\nthe vaccine you are going to be taking was developed by an african american woman and that is just a fact, fauci said.\n\nthe centers for disease control and prevention reports that more than 6.5 million americans have received their first dose of the covid-19 vaccine. that number is expected to grow daily, though it is well behind what public health experts were hoping to see.\n\ncorbett's interest in science started from an early age, but she never knew the difference she would make.\n\nto be honest, i didn't realize the level of impact that my visibility might have... i do my work because i love my work, corbett said.\n\none opportunity in her life made a key difference. she attended the university of maryland, baltimore, as a meyerhoff scholar, an aggressive program that mentors minorities and women in science. graduates of the program include surgeon general jerome adams.\n\ndr. freeman hrabowski has been president at the university of maryland, baltimore, for nearly 30 years. he said corbett had a strong science background but the way she was able to talk to people separated her from the rest.\n\nshe was definitely going to make it in life, hrabowski said. we need more scientists who can connect to people. she could do that when she was 17, easily... what we do at umbc is to support students of color, black, but also students in general, to make sure they make it in science.\n\naccording to the national center for education statistics, only 18% of all students graduate with a stem degree, among 2% are black — something hrabowski believes needs to change.\n\nit's important for people to see people looking like them, like themselves, who can be involved. if it's about women, or if it's about blacks because it shows that you've got people who understand what you've gone through.\n\ndr. barney graham and corbett have worked together for over 15 years. graham is not only her mentor. he's also corbett's boss as deputy director of the vaccine research center.\n\nwhen you recognize somebody has special qualities, you need to do things that can keep those other things out of the way and avoid some of the dismissiveness that often happens not only to minority people but to women, graham said.\n\nhistorically that bias strikes not just professionals in the field but those they serve. in 1931, scientists conducted the tuskegee syphilis experiment, a study by the public health service and tuskegee institute. it examined the progression of syphilis by letting infected black men go untreated, with no regard to the suffering it caused.\n\nanother example often cited is the removal of special cells of henretta lacks, a baltimore, maryland, cancer patient. in 1951, a research team at johns hopkins university removed lacks' cells without her permission and used them in medical research worth billions of dollars. lacks died of cancer and her family was never compensated.\n\nthere are many other examples of supposedly objective scientists who were caring about everyone, who valued people of color less... it's a painful truth, hrabowski said.\n\ncorbett's understanding of the socio-cultural issues and her knowledge of science has made her an influential person in the scientific community.\n\nin a time where vaccine skepticism is high among african americans, corbett hopes black people will put faith in the vaccine and faith in the scientists working behind the scenes to bring it to the american people.\n\nnumber one is that i get it. and then number two is to really take advantage of the level of transparency that we are attempting... even i haven't even seen before, such as fda hearings and briefings being broadcast online, and data coming out almost instantly, she said.\n\nas for dr. hrabowski, he believes corbett deserves all the visibility she can get.\n\nshe cannot be a hidden figure, he said. she needs to be in textbooks. little girls need to see her — of all races. this is what's possible.
several senators, led by senator ted cruz, say they will reject the electoral college results unless a commission is appointed to conduct a 10-day audit of the results. congress is set to count the electoral college votes on january 6.\n\nwe intend to vote on january 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, the group said in a statement on saturday.\n\ncruz's group is working separately from republican senator josh hawley in his effort to challenge the electoral college results when congress convenes on wednesday. dozens of house republicans are also expected to challenge president-elect joe biden's victory even though the electoral college affirmed his 306 electoral votes in december.\n\nthese last-ditch challenges are not going to change the outcome of the election, and mr. biden is set to be inaugurated on january 20. biden transition team spokesperson michael gwin called the efforts by these republicans a stunt.\n\nthis stunt won't change the fact that president-elect biden will be sworn in on january 20th, and these baseless claims have already been examined and dismissed by trump's own attorney general, dozens of courts, and election officials from both parties, gwin said.\n\nthe list of republican lawmakers challenging the results include some of the party's biggest rising stars, and these efforts are an attempt to curry favor with president trump and his base.\n\ncruz is working with senators ron johnson, james lankford, steve daines, john kennedy, marsha blackburn, and mike braun, and senators-elect cynthia lummis, roger marshall, bill hagerty, and tommy tuberville. only one of these senators, johnson of wisconsin, represents a state won by mr. biden.\n\nin their statement, the senators claim to be trying to restore faith in the democratic process, due to claims of voter fraud. mr. trump's legal team was repeatedly unable to provide evidence of voter fraud in several lawsuits challenging the election results.\n\nthe statement cites the election of 1876, when congress appointed an electoral commission in early 1877 to consider and resolve disputed election returns.\n\ncongress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed, the statement said.\n\nthe joint session of congress is required by law to ratify presidential results, but also allows members to object to the returns from any individual state as they are announced, according to the congressional research service (crs).\n\nhawley was previously the only republican senator to commit to challenging the electoral votes in a last-ditch effort to deliver mr. trump a second term after previous efforts to challenge the election results failed, including losses of several lawsuits brought by the campaign.\n\nat the very least, congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. but congress has so far failed to act, hawley said last week.\n\nbut even some republicans consider the effort by hawley and others to be damaging to democratic institutions, and have accused them of making a cynical ploy to garner the support of mr. trump's voters.\n\nsenator pat toomey of pennsylvania — one of the states that mr. trump's supporters may seek to challenge the election results — soundly denounced the actions of hawley, cruz and others in a statement on saturday.\n\na fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders. the effort by senators hawley, cruz, and others to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in swing states like pennsylvania directly undermines this right, toomey said. i voted for president trump and endorsed him for re-election. but, on wednesday, i intend to vigorously defend our form of government by opposing this effort to disenfranchise millions of voters in my state and others.\n\nin a scathing tweet last week, republican congressman adam kinzinger said hawley's internal monologue while releasing his statement was: i want to be president so i decided to try to get potus tweet saying i'm great even though i know this isn't going anywhere, but hey... i'll blame someone else when it fails.\n\nrepublican senator ben sasse published a lengthy facebook post on wednesday saying that anyone seeking to challenge the election results were playing with fire.\n\nlet's be clear what is happening here: we have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage. but they're wrong – and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government, sasse said.\n\nmeanwhile, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell called the upcoming electoral vote certification the most consequential vote on a call with senators this week, according to senator mitt romney, who was on the call. romney told reporters friday that he interpreted mcconnell's comments to mean the vote is a referendum on our democracy.\n\nlook, i lost in 2012, i know what it's like to lose, said romney, who ran for president in 2012. and there were people that said there are irregularities. i have people today who say 'hey you know what you really won' — but i didn't, i lost fair and square. of course there were irregularities there always are, but spreading this kind of rumor about our election system not working is dangerous for democracy here and abroad.\n\nin their statement, the senators acknowledged they fully expect most if not all democrats, and perhaps more than a few republicans, to vote otherwise and accept the election results.\n\na fair and credible audit-conducted expeditiously and completed well before january 20-would dramatically improve americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next president. we owe that to the people, the statement said. we are acting not to thwart the democratic process, but rather to protect it. and every one of us should act together

it's comeback season (technically comeback szn) for johnny manziel right now, and the free agent quarterback, who spent the last two years getting his life together after multiple off-field issues, is making a number of public appearances as he does his best to convince an nfl team to give him a second chance.\n\nnotably on monday morning, manziel appeared on a good morning america segment in which he told the world he is bipolar and trying to make a comeback after his huge downfall. manziel also said he is currently sober; he talked about his sobriety previously during the 2016 offseason.\n\ni am taking medication for bipolar, and i am working to try to make sure i don't fall back into any type of depression because i know where that leads me, and i know how slippery a slope that is for me, manziel said.\n\nthe quarterback said he was diagnosed as bipolar about a year ago.\n\nat the end of the day, i can't help that my wires are a little bit differently crossed than yours, manziel said. i can't help my mental makeup or the way that i was created.\n\nand he said, when confronted directly about it, that he is not currently drinking. manziel then proceeded to get open and honest about the issues he had with drinking.\n\nno, i'm not. here's the way i look at it -- going back the last couple years of my life, i was self-medicating with alcohol, manziel said. that's what i thought was making me happy and getting out of that depression to a point where i had some sense of happiness. but at the end of the day, when you're left, staring at the ceiling by yourself, and you're back in that depression and back in that hole, that dark hole of sitting in a room by yourself and being super depressed and thinking about all the mistakes you've made in your life.\n\nwhat did that get me? where did that get me except out of the nfl? where did that get me? disgrace? i went a solid five months until i really fell back into a little depression where i didn't drink, but still i was going to therapy. the difference that i know this year is i started looking at my mental health.\n\nhe believes now his friends and family see a drastic change in his lifestyle, and he is hoping to make that change sustainable.\n\nnow the question you asked is, 'is that sustainable?' and 'would that be the case moving forward?' manziel said. i would like to sit here and say, yes, and i have a lot of confidence that would be the case.\n\nthe former heisman trophy winner, once upon a time selected in the first round by the cleveland browns, spent virtually his entire nfl tenure struggling with off-field issues that leaked onto the field at times. he started eight games over a two-year period with the browns, at times flashing his immense potential, but largely displaying a lack of maturity both on and off the field.\n\nfootball brings him joy, manziel said, and that's why he's trying to get back to the game.\n\ni am coming back from a huge downfall, manziel admitted. i don't know what kind of comeback it will be, but i know i want to get back on a football field, to what brought me so much joy in my life.\n\nhe's not wrong: manziel's rise was meteoric at texas a&m, and his downfall in cleveland was even quicker. he was drafted with a first-round pick in the 2014 nfl draft, along with blake bortles and teddy bridgewater. he was released by cleveland in march of 2016, well before anyone in his draft class was even eligible to sign a second contract.\n\nat one point during his struggles, his own father said he was worried manziel wouldn't make it to see 24 years old if he continued partying the way he was. reports surfaced that manziel was sent home from browns practice because he was intoxicated at said practice although the browns later disputed those reports.\n\nmanziel was also indicted on an assault charge involving his then-girlfriend colleen crowley although the charges would later be dismissed by a texas judge.\n\nconsidering how often he was a headline during his partying days, manziel has done an impressive job staying out of the media spotlight. that changed this week, but for positive reasons, as manziel continues his push toward trying to make a comeback in the nfl.\n\nthis article originally appeared on cbssports.com.
new york governor andrew cuomo said monday that hospitals that have been able to quickly administer their allocated vaccine doses — which he termed high-performing hospitals in a briefing on the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic — will get more doses, while those that have been slow to use up their allotment won't be allocated more.\n\ncuomo said 8,771 new yorkers were hospitalized with the virus as of monday, with more than 1,500 of those in intensive care. more than 170 people died from coronavirus-related complications in the state sunday.\n\nthe announcement comes as the nationwide vaccine rollout is hitting speed bumps and the country sees new variants spread. cuomo had said saturday the state will not receive enough vaccine doses for the more than 7 million new yorkers who are now eligible for the shot and called on washington to increase its distribution efforts. the federal government is expected to send 250,000 doses this week.\n\nfor the lower performing facilities, we are going to give them less, if any, of the new allocation. they'll all have enough to do their staff, but we want to make sure that the faster facilities — the higher-performing facilities — get more of the new allocation because we want it out the door, cuomo said, after detailing the relative performance rates of hospitals in different regions. we don't want it sitting on the shelf. so those that can vaccinate faster will get more of the new allocation.\n\nlocal governments across the state, including new york city, overwhelmingly agree with the plan, said melissa derosa, secretary to the governor.\n\nif you have allocation remaining, you don't need the allocation that's going out,  said derosa. the other hospitals that are faster can get more out the door.\n\nthe state will also open pop-up vaccination clinics in areas cuomo called healthcare deserts, and will open eight more mass vaccination sites this week, bringing the state's total to 13.\n\ncuomo said the state had also directly contacted pfizer, the manufacturer of one of two coronavirus vaccines authorized for emergency use by the federal government, to buy more doses. the vaccine distribution effort has been coordinated by the federal government, which allocates doses to states rather than states contracting directly with the manufacturers.\n\nhealth and human services secretary alex azar said last week the federal government would change its allocation formula based on the pace of administration as reported by states, and by the size of the 65 and older population in each state. president-elect joe biden has said his administration's goal is to vaccinate 100 million americans within his first 100 days in office.\n\nthe vaccine efforts come as the country is hurtling toward a grim milestone. data compiled by johns hopkins university showed 397,808 reported deaths in the u.s. from covid-19 as of monday afternoon. with nearly 4,000 deaths being reported per day, the country is soon expected to cross the 400,000 mark.\n\ndr. rochelle walensky, president-elect joe biden's nominee to lead the centers for disease control, told cbs news that she expects the country to hit a half-million deaths by mid-february.
washington -- with three devastating hurricanes, extreme wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the united states tallied a record high bill last year for weather-related disasters: $306 billion. the u.s. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars each, the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) reported monday.\n\nthat ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005.\n\ncosts are adjusted for inflation and noaa keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. three of the five most expensive hurricanes in u.s. history hit last year.\n\nnoaa said the 16 billion-dollar disasters included eight severe storms, three tropical cyclones, two flooding events, one wildfire event, one drought and one freeze event. these events resulted in the deaths of 362 people and had significant economic effects on the areas they affected, the noaa said.\n\nnoaa\n\nhurricane harvey cost $125 billion, second only to 2005's katrina, while hurricane maria, which slammed puerto rico, cost $90 billion, ranking third, the noaa said. irma was a $50 billion storm, the fifth most expensive hurricane in u.s. history.\n\nwestern wildfires fanned by hot, dry conditions racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous u.s. wildfire record, according to the noaa.\n\nwhile we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the national academy of science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today's extremes have climate change fingerprints on them, said university of georgia meteorology professor marshall shepherd, a past president of the american meteorological society.\n\nnoaa announced its figures at the society's annual conference in austin, texas.\n\nthe weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in u.s. records for the lower 48 states, with an annual temperature average of 54.6 degrees fahrenheit, or 12.6 degrees celsius -- 2.6 degrees higher than the 20th century average. only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. the five warmest years for the lower 48 states have all happened since 2006.\n\nthis was the third straight year that all 50 states had above-average temperatures for the year. five states -- arizona, georgia, north carolina, south carolina and new mexico -- had their warmest year ever. temperature records go back to 1895.\n\nnoaa says 2017 was the second-warmest year on record worldwide.
it's official: hoda kotb will replace former nbc anchor matt lauer as savannah guthrie's co-host on the today show.\n\nguthrie announced the change just after the show's open on tuesday morning, saying, hoda is officially the co-anchor of today. this has to be the most popular decision nbc news has ever made and i am so thrilled.\n\nkotb, 53, has hosted the 10 a.m. hour of today with kathie lee gifford since 2007 and has been a dateline nbc correspondent since 1998.\n\nnbc has been looking to fill the seat since november 29 when the network announced lauer, a 20-year veteran of the show, was being fired for inappropriate sexual behavior.\n\nlauer had been co-host of today since 1997, propelling the show to the top of the morning show ratings with co-host katie couric. it fell to second place behind abc's good morning america following the departure of longtime news anchor ann curry in 2012 after just a year as co-host.
mexico made it clear it won't pay for the border wall promised by president donald trump during the 2016 election campaign. yet mr. trump keeps repeating the notion in various forms, most recently tying it to his newly renegotiated trade agreement with mexico. the latest utterance came in his speech from the oval office last night.\n\nthe wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with mexico, mr. trump said.\n\nfact check: false.\n\nthe new trade agreement reached last year, called the united states mexico canada agreement, or usmca, would replace the existing north american free trade agreement, known as nafta, which has been in effect since the early 1990s. nafta eliminated most tariffs between the three signatories, with a few exceptions.\n\nusmca, which does little to change those eliminations, isn't yet in effect. that's because congress still needs to ratify the deal (as do legislative bodies in mexico and canada).\n\nin the u.s., usmca ratification is far from certain and isn't likely to be taken up soon, given democrats now control the house and the government remains partially shut down. even if the new trade deal is enacted, it's not clear how funds in the u.s. treasury would be earmarked to build mr. trump's wall.\n\ncongress controls the purse strings\n\n\n\nthe president has previously implied that tariffs paid on mexican imports could be used to bolster u.s. coffers and, in turn, be eventually allocated to pay for wall construction. that's also problematic: congress drafts budgets and must approve any government spending.\n\ndonald trump keeps repeating the ludicrous claim that somehow the revised nafta will fund his wall even though it remains unclear if the deal will be enacted, lori wallach, director of trade policy for advocacy group public citizen, said in a statement. and if it is, the text does not include border wall funding directly nor would it generate new government revenue indirectly given it cuts the very few remaining tariffs, not raises them.\n\ntariffs are taxes paid at the border to the government in order to import goods and services into the u.s. for sale inside the country.\n\nany taxes collected into the u.s. treasury that could be allocated for wall construction would still have to be approved by congress, which at the moment remains at an impasse with mr. trump on that very topic. it's why the government is partially shut down.\n\nreminder: companies, not countries, pay tariffs\n\nimporters like ford or walmart pay these duties. they either swallow the cost or pass it along to consumers. that means it's often ordinary americans who foot the bill for tariffs.\n\nmr. trump's trade levies are designed to make certain goods more expensive for u.s. consumers, who in turn are likely to seek out lower-cost items made in the u.s. or from countries that aren't facing the higher tariffs.\n\nfor u.s. manufacturers, purchases are often raw materials, like steel, or finished and semi-finished parts, like seats for automobiles. the u.s. also imports food and commodities like grain and meat.\n\ntake steel and aluminum. mr. trump's white house imposed tariffs on imported steel and aluminum last year. because prices for imported metals are now higher, domestic producers have also been able to raise prices. and it's those increases that can get passed onto consumers for the finished goods.\n\nwhen it comes to the usmca, mexico generally doesn't pay taxes on goods imported into the u.s. if there are tariffs, u.s. companies pay them. higher tariffs can force a company to pass on that extra cost to the consumer.\n\nanother theory is that the u.s. economy will be so good under the new agreement that the u.s. treasury's coffers will swell, providing enough funds to pay the billions for mr. trump's wall. that's a lot of ifs, given the current impasse, experts have noted.\n\nbottom line: no matter how many times mr. trump says it, mexico probably isn't paying for the wall, directly or indirectly, anytime soon. as things now stand, u.s. taxpayers would wind up with the bill.
manitowoc, wis. -- a caller who phoned in a bomb threat to a wisconsin county sheriff's office made an apparent reference to getting justice for the man at the center of the making a murderer documentary, authorities said wednesday.\n\nthe manitowoc police department said in a statement a male caller made the threat around 6:40 p.m. wednesday, warning of bombs inside the manitowoc county sheriff's office building and a vehicle in the parking lot packed with explosives.\n\nsteven avery enters a courtroom in the calumet county courthouse monday, march 18, 2007, in chilton, wis. avery was found guilty of first degree intentional homicide in the murder of photographer teresa halbach, 25, on oct. 31, 2005 near the family's auto salvage lot in rural manitowoc county. ap\n\nthe caller also mentioned getting justice for steven, something the statement described as an apparent reference to steven avery, the wisconsin man whose prosecution in a 2005 killing was the centerpiece of the 10-part netflix series issued in december.\n\nthe series questions whether avery, who was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide in the death of photographer teresa halbach a decade ago, was treated fairly. it suggests the possibility that manitowoc county sheriff's deputies planted evidence in the case, a claim authorities have denied.\n\navery had been wrongfully convicted years earlier in a rape case and served 18 years in prison. he sued manitowoc county for tens of millions before he and his nephew, brendan dassey, were arrested in halbach's death.\n\nauthorities deemed the area around the sheriff's office all clear around 9 p.m. wednesday, and the courthouse was checked as a precaution. no suspicious devices were found.\n\na second very similar threat was received about 20 minutes later, the statement said. manitowoc police responded to provide security for dispatch and sheriff's office employees who were about to go through a shift change. again, no suspicious activity or items were discovered.\n\nmanitowoc police and the wisconsin department of criminal investigation are working to determine the origin of the call and identity of the caller.
at the pentagon thursday, president trump addressed the deaths of the four americans killed in a targeted attack by isis in northern syria on wednesday, expressing his deepest condolences to the families of the great american heroes who laid down their lives yesterday, and calling them great, great people.\n\nlast month, mr. trump declared victory in the battle against isis in syria. the president's speech then very quickly segued to talk about the need for a wall at the southern border. he said that more caravans are already forming and said the government is still shut down because democrats refuse to fund border security.\n\nthe party has been hijacked by the open-borders fringe, he said.\n\nthe president also addressed nato, an entity he has criticized some in the past.\n\nwe will be with nato 100 percent, but as i told the countries, you have to step up and you have to pay, mr. trump told his audience at the pentagon.\n\nthe president was at the pentagon as his administration rolls out its plan to ramp up missile defense capabilities in response to threats that may be posed by potential adversaries. the administration's strategy will possibly entail a new layer of spaced-based sensors to spot enemy missiles.\n\nour nation does not seek adversaries, but we do not ignore them, either, acting defense secretary patrick shanahan said thursday, noting that a missile defense strategy requires offense.\n\nspace is key to that missile defense strategy, shanahan said thursday, in an announcement that comes as mr. trump is working on plans for a space force as the sixth branch of the military.\n\nthe trump administration recently completed its review of what it is describing as the united states' first major and comprehensive review of the united states' missile defense policies and capabilities since 2010. one senior administration official explained to reporters in a conference call wednesday that a significant change to the threat environment has been seen in recent years.\n\nwhat the missile defense review responds to is an environment which our potential adversaries have been rapidly developing and fielding, a much more expanded range of new advance offensive missiles, the senior administration told reporters. some of these missiles are capable of threatening the united states, threatening our allies, our partners.\n\nsenior administration officials shared little on exactly the threats the u.s. is concerned about, but one senior administration official said the united states' missile defense capabilities are primarily postured to stay ahead of rogue states' threats.\n\nlast year after meeting with north korean leader kim jong un, mr. trump declared north korea to no longer be a threat. senior administration officials, asked whether there is still a threat from north korea, deflected.\n\nthe review does look at the comprehensive environment that the u.s. faces, that our allies and partners face, and it does posture our forces to be prepared for the capabilities that currently are a threat and that we anticipate in the future, a senior administration official said.\n\n— cbs news' fin gomez contributed to this report
urban meyer agreed to become head coach of the jacksonville jaguars on thursday, leaving the broadcast booth and returning to the sidelines after a two-year absence that followed another health scare.\n\nthe 56-year-old meyer was team owner shad khan's top target, and khan waited nearly a week to get it done. they met last friday on khan's yacht in miami, again wednesday and one final time at the facility thursday. hiring the longtime college coach with three national championships would signify a new direction for a franchise that has lost 105 of 144 games since khan took over in 2012.\n\nthis is a great day for jacksonville and jaguars fans everywhere, khan said in a statement. urban meyer is who we want and need, a leader, winner and champion who demands excellence and produces results.\n\nwhile urban already enjoys a legacy in the game of football that few will ever match, his passion for the opportunity in front of him here in jacksonville is powerful and unmistakable.\n\nmeyer went 187-32 - a staggering winning percentage of 85.3 - in stops at bowling green (2001-02), utah (2003-04), florida (2005-10) and ohio state (2012-18). he ranks seventh all-time in collegiate winning percentage, trailing only notre dame legends knute rockne and frank leahy among coaches at major programs.\n\nbut some doubts remain about meyer's ability to make a smooth transition to the nfl, where motivational tactics tend to be moot and losing multiple games every year is a given. meyer never lost more than five times in any season as a college head coach; he went 83-9 at ohio state.\n\nstill, meyer has been eyeing an nfl move for months. he researched the league with help from former players and friends, started assembling a potential staff and learned how the front office works. meyer and khan have been friends for years, building a relationship while both were living in big ten country.\n\nurban meyer in 2019. zach bolinger/icon sportswire via getty\n\njacksonville was the most attractive opening. the jaguars have 11 picks in the 2021 draft, including five in the top 65, and are nearly $100 million under the projected salary cap. adding to the appeal: khan, a billionaire businessman, has shown a penchant for patience and a willingness to spend big.\n\nclemson quarterback trevor lawrence is a lock to land in jacksonville with the top pick and will be the centerpiece of the team's latest rebuild.\n\nmeyer replaces doug marrone, who was fired after losing the final 15 games in 2020. marrone went 25-44 in four-plus seasons with the jaguars, including 2-1 in the 2017 postseason. marrone failed repeatedly to fill the team's long-standing hole at quarterback, and khan kept him and general manager dave caldwell around a year longer than many expected to make them clean up a fractured locker room and a stressed salary cap.\n\nkhan also interviewed kansas city offensive coordinator eric bieniemy, atlanta defensive coordinator raheem morris, san francisco defensive coordinator robert saleh and tennessee offensive coordinator arthur smith.\n\nthe general belief was the job was meyer's if he wanted it. he clearly did, with some stipulations.\n\nhe will have the leeway to put his touch on every aspect of the organization, the kind of overhaul jacksonville hasn't seen in nearly three decades of existence. khan is switching to a coach-centric model that could give meyer final say in personnel. meyer and the next general manager will report to khan, who wants to be more involved in the most significant roster decisions.\n\nthere's little doubt, though, that meyer will be calling the shots.\n\nmeyer's health remains a concern, though. he stepped down at ohio state in 2018 mostly because of a congenital arachnoid cyst in his brain, which required surgery in 2014 and bothered him throughout his final season with the buckeyes. he also resigned at florida for health reasons in december 2009 only to change his mind the following day and instead take a leave of absence.\n\nhe returned to coach in 2010 and then walked away again at the end of the season, a move that eventually angered many florida faithful because he took the job at ohio state less than a year later.\n\nmeyer spent the last two years in an analyst role for fox sports, appearing weekly on the network's college football pregame show.
carrie underwood says she is healing from an injury, but not quite looking the same. the country singer revealed to her fan club that she needed more than 40 stitches on her face after she fell on the steps in front of her home in november.\n\nthere is also another part of the story that i haven't been ready to talk about since i have still been living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up, she wrote. it's crazy how a freak random accident can change your life.\n\nunderwood continued, in addition to breaking my wrist, i somehow managed to injure my face as well. i'll spare you the gruesome details, but when i came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [underwood's husband] mike that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in.\n\nthe singer said that seven weeks after the accident, she is still not quite looking the same, and is not ready to share a photo of her face at the moment.\n\nwhen i am ready to get in front of a camera, i want you all to understand why i might look a bit different, she explained.\n\nunderwood canceled a benefit concert after her injury. recently, she shared a selfie on instagram in which her face was covered by a scarf.
on saturday, yale university president peter salovey announced that the ivy league school will rename a residential college to honor one of the institution's most distinguished alumni, grace murray hopper. the residence is currently named for john calhoun, the 19th-century white supremacist statesman from south carolina.\n\ngrace murray hopper, 1983 cbs news\n\nthe decision to change a college's name is not one we take lightly, but john c. calhoun's legacy as a white supremacist and a national leader who passionately promoted slavery as a 'positive good' fundamentally conflicts with yale's mission and values, salovey said in an announcement.\n\nrear admiral hopper, who earned a master's degree and a ph.d. in mathematics from yale, was a pioneer both in computer science and in the united states navy. in 1983, 60 minutes correspondent morley safer interviewed hopper, who at the time held the distinction of being the oldest officer in active service at 76.\n\nin the profile, playing in the video player above, safer hit the highlights of hopper's life. a math whiz, she left her professor job at vassar college when she was 36 to serve as a lieutenant in the navy reserve during world war ii. she chose the navy to follow in the footsteps of her great-grandfather, who was a rear admiral during the civil war.\n\nassigned by the navy to a computation project at harvard, hopper used her math genius to help program the very first computer, named mark i. the rudimentary machine could only spit out what safer called indecipherable numbers, so hopper invented a way to transform it into language.\n\nhopper foresaw the computer revolution. in 1983, though the computer had come a long way from mark i, she compared the current model to the model-t, acknowledging that the computer was still in its preliminary state.\n\nsafer asked hopper if she thought people could put too much trust in technology.\n\npeople are scared of computers, just as i can remember there were people who were scared to death of telephones—wouldn't go near them, she said. there were people that thought gaslight was safe but electric light wasn't very safe. we've always gone through this, with every change.\n\nhopper told safer that the saddest day of her life was in 1966, when the navy forced her to retire at age 60. but the next year, they called her back to active duty, and she happily returned.\n\ni've already received the highest award i'll ever receive, no matter how long i live, no matter how many more jobs i have, hopper told safer, and that has been the privilege and the responsibility of serving very proudly in the united states navy.\n\nafter watching hopper on 60 minutes, then-representative philip crane championed a joint resolution that led to her promotion to commodore, which she received by presidential appointment in december 1983. in 1985, the rank of commodore was renamed rear admiral (lower half).\n\nhopper died on january 1, 1992, and was buried with full military honors at arlington national cemetery. on november 22, 2016, she was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom.
the trump administration on monday re-designated cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism, hitting the country with new sanctions that could hamstring president-elect joe biden's promise to renew relations with the communist-governed island. secretary of state mike pompeo announced the step, citing in particular cuba's continued harboring of u.s. fugitives, its refusal to extradite a coterie of colombian guerrilla commanders as well as its support for venezuelan leader nicolás maduro.\n\nthe designation, which had been discussed for years, is one of several last-minute foreign policy moves that the trump administration is making before mr. biden takes office jan. 20.\n\nremoving cuba from the blacklist had been one of former president barack obama's main foreign policy achievements as he sought better relations with the island, an effort endorsed by mr. biden as his vice president. ties had been essentially frozen after fidel castro took power in 1959.\n\nas he has with iran, mr. trump has sought to reverse many of obama's decisions involving cuba. he has taken a tough line on havana and rolled back many of the sanctions that the obama administration had eased or lifted after the restoration of full diplomatic relations in 2015.\n\nsince mr. trump took office, after a campaign that attacked mr. obama's moves to normalize relations with cuba, ties have been increasingly strained.\n\nin addition to attacking cuba for its support of maduro, the trump administration has also suggested that cuba may have been behind or allowed alleged sonic attacks that left dozens of u.s. diplomats in havana with brain injuries starting in late 2016.\n\nhowever, few u.s, allies believe cuba remains a sponsor of international terrorism, quibbling with either the definition based on the support for maduro or outright rejecting american claims that cuban authorities are bankrolling or masterminding international terrorist attacks.\n\ncuban foreign minister bruno rodriguez condemned the u.s. action. the us political opportunism is recognized by those who are honestly concerned about the scourge of terrorism and its victims, he said on twitter.\n\nrep. gregory meeks, the new chairman of the house foreign affairs committee, said mr. trump's designation would not help the cuban people and seeks only to tie the hands of the biden administration.\n\nthis designation of cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism with less than a week to go in his presidency and after he incited a domestic terror attack on the u.s. capital ... that's hypocrisy, meeks said in an interview with the associated press.\n\nnonetheless, cheered on by cuban american and venezuelan exiles in south florida, the trump administration has steadily increased restrictions on flights, trade and financial transactions between the u.s. and the island.\n\nthe latest sanctions put cuba alongside north korea, syria and iran as the only foreign nations deemed state sponsors of terrorism. as a result of monday's actions, most travel from the u.s. to cuba will be barred as well as the sending of remittances to cuba from relatives in the united states, a significant source of income for the impoverished island.\n\nbut with dollar-generating business already reeling from the effects of the coronavirus and previous measures like mr. trump's ban on cruise ships and cap on remittances, the biggest impact will likely be diplomatic.\n\nthis will really slow any thaw in relations with the biden administration, said emilio morales, an exiled cuban economist and president of the miami-based havana consulting group.\n\nmorales said unwinding the measure will take at least a year and require careful study by the u.s. government. he is also doubtful whether biden, who played no significant role in the obama administration's opening to cuba, would be willing to invest the sort of political capital mr. obama did and throw a lifeline to cuba's leadership without anything in return.\n\nmr. obama's removal of cuba from the state sponsors of terrorism list had been a major target of mr. trump, pompeo and other cuba hawks in the current administration.\n\ncuba has repeatedly refused to turn over u.s. fugitives that have been granted asylum, including a black militant convicted of killing a new jersey state trooper in the 1970s. in addition to political refugee status, u.s. fugitives have received free housing, health care and other benefits thanks to cuba's government, which insists the u.s. has no legal or moral basis to demand their return.\n\nbut perhaps the biggest change since mr. obama's outreach in 2015 is cuba's strong support for maduro, who is considered by the a dictator whose pilfering of the oil-based economy has driven 5 million venezuelans from their homes.\n\ncuba has had a long-standing alliance with maduro, although it has long denied it has 20,000 troops and intelligence agents in venezuela and says it has not carried out any security operations. cuban officials, however, have said they have the right to carry out broad military and intelligence cooperation that they deem as legitimate.\n\nthe relationship between the two countries has grown strong in the past two decades, with venezuela sending cuba oil shipments worth billions of dollars and receiving tens of thousands of employees, including medical workers.\n\nin may 2020, the state department added cuba to a list of countries that do not cooperate with u.s. counter-terrorism programs.\n\nin making that determination, the department said several leaders of the national liberation army, a colombian rebel group designated a terrorist organization, remained on the island despite colombia's repeated request they be extradited to answer for the 2019 car bombing of a police academy in bogota that killed 22 people.\n\ncuba has rejected such requests, saying that turning over the leaders would violate protocols agreed to by colombia's government for peace efforts that were broken off after the deadly bombing.\n\nin repudiating the allegations, president miguel díaz-canel has said cuba was the victim of terrorism. he cited an armed attack on its embassy in washington last april as one example. cubans see the blacklist as helping the u.s. justify the long-standing embargo on the island and other economic sanctions that have crippled its economy.
the following is a transcript of the interview with vice president mike pence that aired sunday, jan. 20, 2019, on face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: good morning and welcome to face the nation. we begin today with vice president mike pence. welcome and so good to have you here.\n\nvice president mike pence: yeah, morning margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: you arrived here today with secret service agents who are with you 24 hours a day. are they getting paid during this shutdown?\n\nvice president pence: they're not at this point and 800,000 federal workers are also going without pay and if we don't have a resolution then those paychecks won't go out at the end of this week. but we also have a crisis at our southern border, margaret. humanitarian and a security crisis. and as the president laid out yesterday we're absolutely determined to secure the border to end the shutdown. and what the president articulated yesterday was a good faith, common sense compromise where the president laid out his priorities: building a physical barrier on the southern border - a steel barrier - new resources for border patrol, humanitarian assistance technology. but the president also announced that- that he'd be willing to support legislation that provides temporary relief, three years of temporary legal status for those in the daca program and also those who have temporary protective status. it really is an effort to- to compromise and- and we really look forward to the senate taking this bill up tuesday and beginning to work in earnest not just to end this government shutdown, which is a burden on the families of 800,000 federal workers but even more importantly in that to address the crisis that we face in our southern border.\n\nmargaret brennan: if this is a genuine attempt why weren't any democrats included in the consultations for this?\n\nvice president pence: well, margaret we've been talking to democrats--\n\nmargaret brennan: who?\n\nvice president pence: --over the last four weeks. well, first the president's met repeatedly with democrat leadership all the way through a week ago last wednesday--\n\nmargaret brennan: but democratic leaders have said this is a nonstarter.\n\nvice president pence: well look, that- that meeting in the situation room a week ago wednesday the president looked at speaker pelosi and said, ok if i gave you everything you wanted, if i signed legislation for most- funding most of the government and- and had a 30 day extension on homeland security. he said to her - i was sitting there - he said, would you give me funding to secure the border and a wall? and she said, no. so what the president directed us to do, our negotiation team, was to reach out with rank and file democrats in the house and in the senate. and what the president presented yesterday really is an effort to bring together ideas from both political parties. i- i think it is an act of statesmanship on the president's part to say, here is what i'm for. it includes my priorities, it includes priorities that democrats had- have advanced for some period of time. and we believe it provides a framework--\n\nmargaret brennan: which--\n\nvice president pence: --a framework for ending this impasse, securing our- our border and reopening government.\n\nmargaret brennan: i- i didn't hear you say which democrats are supporting it though.\n\nvice president pence: right. well--\n\nmargaret brennan: i need that.\n\nvice president pence: --well the- the president met this week, we all did, with the problem solvers caucus. i think we all know who was there and we- we were grateful for their presence. but we've had- we've had good conversations with democrat members of the senate but look, their- their- their leadership has discouraged them in the house and the senate from engaging the administration so i want to respect those conversations. but, i think what the american people saw the president do yesterday was say, i- i- you know i- i want to set the table for us resolving this issue in a way that achieves his objectives to secure the border, end the humanitarian security crisis, end the government shutdown, but also to- to bring together- bring together the democrats' priorities to accomplish that. that's what the american people expect us to do. and- and honestly you know- you know the hearts and minds of the american people today are thinking a lot about it being the weekend where we remember the life and work of the reverend dr. martin luther king jr. but one of my favorite quotes from dr. king was, now is the time to make real the promises of democracy. you think of how he changed america. he inspired us to change through the legislative process to become a more perfect union. that's exactly what president trump is calling on the congress to do. come to the table in a spirit of good faith. we'll secure our border, we'll reopen the government and we'll move our nation forward as the president said yesterday to even a broader discussion about immigration reform in the months ahead.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've said that this is not- this offer on the table is not amnesty. the president this morning tweeted something that i'd like you to clarify though. he said, amnesty will- will be used on a much bigger deal whether on immigration or something else. was that an offer for a path to citizenship?\n\nvice president pence: well i'll- i'll let the president's words stand. but at the end--\n\nmargaret brennan: do you know what he meant?\n\nvice president pence: -- at the end. yes i do.\n\nmargaret brennan: what was it?\n\nvice president pence: at the end of his remarks yesterday he made it very clear that while this proposal is just it's- look- it's- it's funding to secure our border, to build a steel barrier on the southern border, to give additional resources that the department of homeland security has requested in terms of personnel and facilities and detection technologies as well as humanitarian assistance. but the president's also said he's more than willing in this legislation that comes to the floor of the senate on tuesday, to extend temporary relief to people that are in the tps program as well as--\n\nmargaret brennan: three years--\n\nvice president pence: --the daca program. but at the end of that speech i hope the american people heard him. so once we move past this impasse, once we begin to build more trust between the parties. this is a president who is absolutely determined to fix our broken immigration system in this country. but he has always said it all begins with border security.\n\nmargaret brennan: will he come down from that five point seven billion dollar ask? is that also up for negotiation?\n\nvice president pence: well look, that's the president's request and the senate leadership has agreed to bring the bill to the floor with our request for funding for the wall and all the other resources. but look we recognize the legislative process is a process of give and take. the democrats want to bring amendments or recommendations forward. i know the president will give them due consideration, but the president is absolutely determined to build a steel barrier on the southern border in the 10 priority areas that the department of homeland security said that we need a physical barrier. it's roughly two hundred and thirty four miles. it's not from sea to sea. it's two hundred thirty four miles of additional steel barrier. and- and- and frankly you look back at prior administrations- you know virtually the last four presidents have all built similar barriers on the southern border including president obama. and we just want to respond to the needs that we have to secure our border. but once the legislative process goes forward i know president trump will be listening to recommendations from the other party.\n\nmargaret brennan: there is an inspector general report this week that said that the trump administration actually separated far more children from their parents than initially reported, more than the twenty seven hundred. in fact they couldn't put a figure on it. do you regret that policy?\n\nvice president pence: well the president reversed that policy. and now we have in place--\n\nmargaret brennan : but do you regret what happened to the more than twenty seven hundred children?\n\nvice president pence: i think- i think we, we regret not only that circumstance but what's driving that circumstance. it's one of the reasons why the president had secretary nielson negotiate with mexico that going forward we'll be able to allow families to remain in mexico while they apply for asylum and it would obviate the need to bring them into our system that is ill-equipped to handle the extraordinary influx of families and unaccompanied minors that's coming across our border today. a majority of the sixty thousand people that are- that are detained attempting to come into our country illegally every single month more than two thousand a day are now families and unaccompanied children. we now have an arrangement with mexico where those families can remain in mexico. the president in his proposal also recommended that we allow children to apply for asylum--\n\nmargaret brennan: in the countries of origin.\n\nvice president pence: --in the central american countries. look, the human traffickers and the cartels take american cash to- to entice families to send either their family or their children on the long and dangerous journey north. we want that to end. these reforms will advance that from ending. but look it's time for congress to come to the table and take this important step.\n\nmargaret brennan: i do want to- i'm sorry to interrupt you, but i do want to ask you two- two quick things since it's so rare we get time with you. do you care to comment on this buzzfeed report that the special counsel seemed to have found some issue with, but wasn't specific. what part of this report was inaccurate?\n\nvice president pence: well, we- i- the- the special counsel said that the report of buzzfeed was inaccurate and- and frankly the response by many in the national media to take it at face value and engage--\n\nmargaret brennan: well, what part of it was wrong?\n\nvice president mike pence: --and i- in- in hyperventilating about accusations against the president was really a disgrace. look, look--\n\nmargaret brennan: but you don't know which part of it was inaccurate.\n\nvice president mike pence: there is a- there is an obsession in this town. look, we- we've fully cooperated with the special counsel, over a million documents, we'll continue to fully cooperate. i'll let the special counsel address that issue. the president's maintained that he did nothing wrong. but look, what the american people saw this week was the obsession of many in the national media, and frankly some democrats on capitol hill, to assume the worst about this president.\n\nmargaret brennan: well that's why i wanted you to--\n\nvice president mike pence: and- and frankly we appreciate\n\nmargaret brennan: --to tell us--\n\nvice president pence: --the special counsel--\n\nmargaret brennan: -- what part of it was inaccurate.\n\nvice president pence: well frank- we- we--\n\nmargaret brennan: --but can i ask you--\n\nvice president pence: --appreciate the special counsel making it clear that that report was inaccurate.\n\nmargaret brennan: noted.\n\nvice president: --and- and look, the- the special counsel is going to complete his work. and we're- we're going to continue to focus on the issues that are most important to the american people.\n\nmargaret brennan: very quickly, four americans were killed in a suicide attack in syria this week. that same day you gave a speech and said the isis caliphate was defeated. do you regret in hindsight saying that?\n\nvice president mike pence: well first and foremost--\n\nmargaret brennan: their deaths seemed to contradict what you said.\n\nvice president pence: well, look. first and foremost, we're deeply saddened at the loss of these four brave americans and we were praying, especially yesterday, when the president joined their families at dover air force base. and- their contributions to our national security will forever be enshrined in the hearts of the american people. but look, president obama withdrew american forces--\n\nmargaret brennan: but should you have said that?\n\nvice president pence: --from iran. well let me be clear- president obama withdrew american forces from iraq precipitously in 2011. isis rose up virtually out of the desert, overran--\n\n\n\nmargaret brennan: -- and that's the criticism--\n\nvice president pence: --overran vast areas of iraq and syria--\n\nmargaret brennan: --of what the trump administration is doing in syria now.\n\nvice president pence: president obama began a bombing campaign. but when we came into office two years ago today, president trump said we are going to drive isis out of iraq. we're going to drive the caliphate out of existence. and because of the sacrifices and the courage of people like those four brave americans, last- the end of 2017 we captured the so-called capital of their caliphate in raqqa. the- the isis state has been defeated. but as i said in that very same speech, the president wants to bring our troops home. but he also wants to make sure that we hand off the fight against--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nvice president pence: -- isis in syria, what remains of isis in syria, to our coalition partners and that we continue to support them with american assets in the region.\n\nmargaret brennan: mr. vice president--\n\nvice president pence: the isis caliphate has crumbled thanks to the courage of our armed forces and our allies in the region. but america is going to continue to support the effort until we drive any remnants of isis from the region and from the face of the earth.\n\nmargaret brennan: mr. vice president thank you for your time today.\n\nvice president pence: thank you, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: next up, we'll speak to house democrat congressman adam schiff.
bidding their crewmates farewell, a russian cosmonaut and two nasa astronauts boarded their soyuz ferry craft, undocked from the international space station and fell back to earth tuesday, landing safely on the snowy steppe of kazakhstan to close out a 168-day mission.\n\nwith cosmonaut alexander misurkin at the controls in the soyuz ms-06 spacecraft's center seat, flanked on the left by flight engineer mark vande hei and on the right by joe acaba, the russian spacecraft separated from the station's poisk module at 6:08 p.m. est (gmt-5) to begin the three-and-a-half-hour trip home.\n\nafter moving a safe distance away from the station, misurkin and vande hei monitored a critical four-minute 39-second rocket firing that slowed the spacecraft by 286 mph, just enough to lower the far side of the orbit deep into the atmosphere for a fiery plunge back to kazakhstan.\n\nslamming into the discernible atmosphere a half hour later at nearly five miles per second, the soyuz descent module, protected by a heat shield, endured temperatures of more than 2,500 degrees fahrenheit and a deceleration of three times the force of earth's gravity before slowing enough to deploy the spacecraft's main parachute.\n\nthe soyuz then descended into dreary winter weather, with several inches of snow at the landing site, low clouds and freezing temperatures. television cameras were unable to spot the spacecraft during the final moments of entry, but the crew module settled to a rocket-assisted upright touchdown near the town of dzhezkazgan at 9:31 p.m.\n\nthe returning soyuz ms-06 crew, seen inside the space station's kibo module (left to right): joe acaba, vehicle commander alexander misurkin and flight engineer mark vande hei. nasa\n\nrussian recovery crews and medical personnel, along with a contingent representing nasa, reached the scene within a few minutes to help the returning station fliers out of the cramped capsule as they began readjusting to the unfamiliar tug of gravity. and equally unfamiliar wintry weather.\n\nbut all three appeared healthy and in good spirits, smiling and chatting with recovery crews amid satellite phone calls to family and friends.\n\nthe on-time touchdown closed out a 168-day five-hour mission since launch from the baikonur cosmodrome last sept. 12, a flight spanning 2,688 orbits and 71.1 million miles.\n\nwith landing, misurkin's total time in space over two station flights stood at 334 days while acaba, veteran of a space shuttle flight and a previous station visit, had logged 306 days aloft. vande hei was completing his first space mission.\n\nduring their stay in orbit, the crew helped unload four visiting cargo ships, welcomed three crew members aboard and monitored the departure of five visiting vehicles. all three also participated in multiple spacewalks, with misurkin and acaba each taking part in single excursions while vande hei took part in four.\n\nafter medical checks, misurkin, vande hei and acaba were to be flown in separate helicopters to dzhezkazgan. from there, misurkin planned to board a russian jet for a flight home to star city near moscow while a nasa plane bound for houston awaited vande hei and acaba.\n\nduring a change-of-command ceremony monday, misurkin turned over responsibility for the station to anton shkaplerov, who now commands expedition 55, and his two soyuz ms-07 crewmates, scott tingle and japanese astronaut norishige kanai.\n\nmisurkin, speaking in english, thanked flight controllers around the world for allowing his crew to use this station. we didn't (break) almost anything, and hope we did some good things and helpful things for science. looking forward now to going home, back to the earth, to work with you guys on the ground.\n\nsaid shkaplerov: you did very good job here on board international space station, and now you are ready to return to our planet.\n\nalexander, i am proud to be part of the great team you have been leading here, he said. station is in excellent condition, and we'll do all the best keeping this unique scientific laboratory fully functional and safe. with honor, i am taking command.\n\nshkaplerov, tingle and kanai will have the station to themselves until march 23 when three fresh crew members arrive: soyuz ms-08 commander oleg artemyev and nasa astronauts ricky arnold and drew feustel.\n\nthe space station's crew normally is evenly split between the russians and the u.s. segment, with three cosmonauts responsible for the lab's russian modules and three astronauts, representing nasa, esa, japan and canada, operating systems and carrying out research in modules supplied by nasa, esa and japan.\n\na shot of earth taken through the station's multi-window cupola compartment. joe acaba tweeted: the future of our home is in all of our hands. may we all care for #earth and practice good stewardship. nasa\n\nnasa is responsible for arranging transportation for the station's non-russian crew members, known collectively as u.s. operating segment -- usos -- astronauts.\n\nthe russians decided in late 2016 to downsize their crews in the near term to save money, a decision that freed up seats aboard upcoming soyuz spacecraft.\n\nat roughly the same time, boeing and the russian aerospace company energia reached a settlement in a $320 million dispute involving the sea launch commercial rocket company. as part of the settlement, boeing obtained two soyuz seats, one in 2017 and another in 2018, with options for three more.\n\nnasa eventually agreed to buy all five seats from boeing for an average cost of $74.7 million each, according to space.com, modifying an existing contract with the russians.\n\nthe two near-term seats allowed nasa to expand the usos segment of the station crew from three to four, sharply increasing the crew time available for research. the other seats will serve as insurance in case commercial ferry ships being built by boeing and spacex are delayed, requiring additional soyuz flights for usos crew members.\n\nas of this writing, spacex or boeing plan to launch unpiloted test flights of their new spacecraft around the end of august. if one or both of those flights gets off on time, the first piloted test flight, by either spacex or boeing, could come in late december.\n\nin the meantime, the russians plan to resume their normal staffing levels after feustel and arnold return to earth on aug. 28.\n\nbut once the boeing and spacex crew ships are certified for regularly scheduled flights to the station, nasa will be able to carry three usos crewmates at a time, along with at least one cosmonaut, while russian soyuz spacecraft will routinely carry two cosmonauts and one nasa astronaut.\n\nthat will result in seven-member station crews in 2019 with four usos astronauts aboard for the duration of the program, allowing nasa to maintain a high science output.\n\nright now, having four usos crew members on board, it gives you a lot more opportunities, not only to maintain the space station but then do the science we're up there for, acaba said. i think the number i heard is somewhere around 800 more hours of utilization. that's a big chunk of science we're going to be able to do by adding an extra crew member. so it's pretty cool.
on exhibit at a recent art show in youngstown, ohio: an interpretation of alfred hitchcock's 1958 film vertigo, which starred jimmy stewart and kim novak. the artist? none other than kim novak.\n\nin the 1950s and early '60s novak was one of the biggest stars in hollywood. she's most famous for vertigo, about the obsession of a retired police detective with a mysterious blonde named madeleine, and his attempts to remake a brunette named judy into madeleine.\n\njudy: if i let you change me, will that do it? if i do what you tell me, will you love me?\n\nscottie: yes. yes.\n\nboth women were played by novak.\n\ncorrespondent mo rocca asked, was it a challenging role, or i should say roles, for you?\n\nwell, you know, the wonderful thing about alfred hitchcock is, in one way, he is obsessed with changing you in the physical sense of the character has to be exactly the way, novak said. but he allows you total freedom in the way you play the part.\n\njames stewart and kim novak in alfred hitchcock's romantic thriller vertigo (1958). paramount pictures\n\nbut freedom doesn't exactly describe the studio system that controlled hollywood in the 1950s. when harry cohn, the head columbia pictures, put a then-21-year-old marilyn pauline novak under contract, he intended to make her over, starting with her name. he wanted me to be kit marlowe, novak said. you see, they made up their mind behind my back – 'we all decided your name is going to be kit marlowe.' i said, 'i'm not going to be kit marlow, how can i be kit marlow? i understand i won't be marilyn, but i will not be kit marlow.'\n\nnovak's upbringing in chicago seemed to have prepared her well for standing up to the man time magazine once called a hollywood despot. harry cohn was frightening; my father was frightening. they had that in common, novak said.\n\nan undated photo of actress kim novak. cbs news\n\nher father was a railroad worker, and strict with his youngest daughter. her conflicted feelings toward cohn and her father remain raw. i loved my father, i adored my father, she said. but he terrified me. my father, he was a fine man in his way.\n\nbut he was tough?\n\nhe was a tough man. i loved him. and i hated him. but i loved him more than i hated him.\n\nwhen it came to dealing with cohn, the newly-named kim novak had a novel approach: i brought him chocolate fudge at christmas, she said. and i remember him actually tear up.\n\nbut did you have affection for him?\n\nno, not really. although in a way i did, because he made good movies, you know? he always picked out good movies for me, and i appreciated that.\n\ngood movies like 1955's picnic, where the 22-year-old starred opposite william holden.\n\nif this dance scene crackles with electricity, novak says that's because a tornado was approaching the kansas town where they were shooting.\n\ni think the electricity in the air had so much to do with all that we were feeling, she said. and we were both charged with all that energy that was out there.\n\nthe life of an actor wasn't something that novak expected. she thought she might become a poet or a painter, but modeling work brought her out west.\n\nwhen you got to los angeles, were you thinking, 'i'm gonna take this town'? asked rocca.\n\nthe star of such classics as alfred hitchcock's vertigo and picnic turned her back on hollywood in the 1960s, and has since pursued painting. cbs news\n\noh, god. no. i was so shy, she said.\n\nsoon, novak was working with some hollywood heavyweights, both in front of the camera and behind, including hitchcock, who knew exactly how he wanted his leading lady to look.\n\nrocca asked, tell me about the wardrobe for 'vertigo.' what happened?\n\ni went to edith head, and i said, 'that suit's gonna drive me crazy. and i have to wear black shoes, i hate black shoes.' and she says, 'well, i think, my dear, you better talk to alfred hitchcock about that.'\n\nthe gray suit novak wore as madeleine was form fitting. he says, 'yes, my dear, that's exactly what i want you to wear.'\n\nhe wanted you to be uncomfortable in that? asked rocca.\n\nexactly, said novak. that's when i realized, i have to have that discomfort. i need to feel uncomfortable in it, and that's the way my character should feel.\n\nkim novak and jimmy stewart in vertigo. paramount pictures\n\ndid you like hitchcock? asked rocca.\n\ni adored him, she replied.\n\nbut novak didn't always adore hollywood. when harry cohn died suddenly in 1958, she found herself professionally out at sea, offered mostly beach movie scripts. in 1966, she left hollywood.\n\nyou know, i wasn't gonna wait around. and i thought, 'you know, what i'd like to do if i have my choice, i wanna go to big sur and go back to painting.' for better or worse, i left hollywood. i let in very few people in my life, and i got involved with animals in my life.\n\nand not just cats and dogs. i had to learn who i was again through animals, because animals know who you really are, she said.\n\nthe animals don't care about box office, rocca said.\n\nexactly, or money, or anything else.\n\nwith all the animals in her life, it's perhaps no surprise she married a veterinarian, robert malloy. they live in rural oregon.\n\nnovak's life these past few decades has been quiet, even idyllic ... mostly.\n\nin 2014, when novak made a rare public appearance at the oscars, social media lit up with vicious comments about her appearance, including one from a soon-to-be president trump.

in an unprecedented move to improve airport security, tsa is training all its new screeners at one centralized academy. it was created after a number of missteps that raised doubts about the agency's ability to properly screen airline passengers. cbs news got the first access to the training academy on the grounds of the federal law enforcement training centers in glynco, georgia.\n\nthe basic training is a two-week course, and at the center point of the training academy is a fully functional tsa checkpoint. in doing a top-to-bottom review, the tsa found gaps in training and proficiency with the equipment. the academy aims to change that, reports cbs news correspondent kris van cleave.\n\nit's an explosive lesson on the dangers the soon-to-be airport screeners will be asked to help prevent. the nearly 200 students assembled are some of the first to go through the new tsa training academy.\n\nit's controlled chaos. ... it's a very difficult job, 19-year-old yasmine cerda said. it's a challenge. but it's a rewarding challenge.\n\nthis is the first time since the agency's reaction post-9/11 that the tsa has centralized training of newly hired screeners who make between $31,000 to $45,000 a year. previously, they were trained largely on the job at the airport where they'd work.\n\nthe academy opened in january as the tsa tries to recover from a series of high-profile embarrassments, including two officers fired for allegedly groping passengers in denver and a damning inspector general investigation where screeners failed to catch potential threats in 67 out of 70 tests.\n\nthose are bad results, said peter neffenger, who took over as administrator following that report.\n\nso what i've tried to do is refocus on the mission, neffenger added. i said, what is a screener's job is to ensure that something that shouldn't get past the checkpoint doesn't get past.\n\nthe ig, if they're going through checkpoints today with one of their teams trying to bring things that should be flagged...will those things be caught? van cleave asked.\n\ni think we'll catch them today, neffenger said.\n\nall of them? van cleave said.\n\ni don't know if we catch everything. i sure hope we catch all of them. my testing has told us that we have dramatically improved, said neffenger, who said screeners have caught the vast majority of illegal items.\n\nfor instructor shawn weeks freeman, the success of the 5,400 new tsa screeners who will be trained here this year is personal. she was a flight attendant on a pan am flight 830 on august 11, 1982, and was just a few rows away when a bomb went off on board. a 16-year-old passenger died and more than a dozen others were hurt.\n\nwhen i talk to my class, i tell them, you're not here by accident, and i wasn't saved at that moment by accident because that threat in 1982 is today's threat still, weeks freeman said.\n\nstudents have to pass written and practical tests on the equipment at the academy. if they don't, they will not become airport screeners. the goal is to bring all 45,000 transportation security officers here over the next several years.
donors have given brian kolfage, the wounded veteran behind the viral gofundme trump wall campaign, permission to transfer at least $7 million to his new plan to privately fund and build a southern border wall, according to kolfage and another source familiar with the effort. president trump has asked congress for more than $5 billion to build the same project, but kolfage says he can do it for half the cost.\n\nkolfage first launched the trump wall campaign in december, and $20 million was pledged from more than 300,000 people. his original goal was to raise $1 billion and hand over the money to the federal government to subsidize the cost of the wall.\n\nbut last friday, kolfage changed course and announced funds would instead go toward his new non-profit, we build the wall, inc., which he said would use contributions to build a wall on private land. in a gofundme post, kolfage wrote the federal government won't be able to accept our donations anytime soon.\n\nbecause of the change and the fact the initial campaign fell short of the fundraising goal, gofundme said donors would automatically get their money back unless they actively opted to roll over their donation to kolfage's new venture.\n\nkolfage and the source close to the campaign claimed $7 million had been redirected to we build the wall, inc. kolfage said more than 120,000 donors have chosen this option, a number gofundme did not confirm. after initially offering the $7 million figure tuesday morning, kolfage later said it was a guess.\n\nbrian kolfage cbs news\n\nour donors gave to us to get the job done, and they trust us to do so, kolfage said in an email to cbs news.\n\nwhen asked specifically how the money would be spent, kolfage declined to give specifics and pointed to his recently revised gofundme page, which says the the money will go toward wall construction only. gofundme did not respond to whether the funds had been released to kolfage yet.\n\nwhat happens to the remaining $13 million that had been pledged? donors who take no action will receive refunds by april 11. those who ask for their money back should get it within 3 business days; more than 8,300 people have asked for that option, according to kolfage. as gofundme processes those refunds, it will update the amount raised — on wednesday, the page still said more than $20 million had been raised.\n\nlast thursday, buzzfeed news reported kolfage had misused funds from a previous gofundme campaign intended to help other wounded soldiers. kolfage had raised $16,246 for a veteran mentorship initiative, but buzzfeed news reported it had no evidence kolfage had used the money for the program: none of the partners he claimed to have worked with — including walter reed, brooke army medical center and landstuhl regional medical center in germany — have any records kolfage worked with their patients or donated money, according to representatives at the centers buzzfeed news spoke to.\n\nin an email to cbs news, kolfage disputed the buzzfeed report, claiming he used the funds to travel to the hospitals where he conducted his mentorship program. he called the piece a fake article.\n\nthey [sic] money was raised for my mentor program, kolfage wrote tuesday in an email to cbs news. the money wasn't raised for a hospital or another charity it was raised for me to travel for my award winning mentor trips to visit wounded veterans.\n\non his gofundme page, kolfage also provided an address for donors to send checks in case they weren't comfortable with online transactions. according to kolfage, he's received 3,500 mail-in donations, but he said he hasn't totaled them yet.
much has been written about brick-and-mortar stores' age problem: the changing shopping tastes of a younger generation are implicated in the closing of hundreds of stores and will be the demise of up to a billion more square feet of retail space, according to one analysis.\n\nbut one phenomenon actually lures millennials to visit stores in slightly greater numbers, according to data from foursquare: a store-closing announcement.\n\nthe location tracking service examined foot-traffic data from six months in 2015, when both kmart (shld) and macy's (m) stores announced closings. foursquare put visitors into two categories. it labeled shoppers who visited a kmart or macy's store at least once in the six months before the retailer announced store closings as typical shoppers. it dubbed people who didn't, but who did visit a store once it was slated to close opportunists.\n\nfor both kmart and macy's, the opportunists were younger and more male, said sarah spagnolo, foursquare's editor-at-large.\n\ntypically, these stores tend to draw a demographic that's more female than male and a majority of shoppers who are over 35, spagnolo told cbs moneywatch. that was less true of the opportunist shoppers, however. kmart opportunists had 10 percent more people under 35 than typical shoppers at the store. for macy's, the opportunists' increase was 8 percent.\n\nwhat this shows us is that men and millennials are lured by closeout sales, spagnolo said.\n\ncloseout sales were so attractive that competing chains in their vicinity actually lost market share while they were happening. during kmart's closing sales, which began in april 2016, kohl's (kss), macy's and target (tgt) all lost shoppers to kmart, foursquare found. the pattern repeated itself when macy's announced store closings.\n\n(to get the analysis, foursquare looked at the portion of its user base who visited macy's and kmart stores during six months in 2016, the company said. the sample was adjusted to resemble the u.s. population at large and to remove variations caused by age or demographics.)\n\nperhaps millennials have an incorrect reputation for being lazy or not being drawn into brick-and-mortar stores, and our data shows otherwise, spagnolo said. millennials are still attracted by deals.\n\nwhile this finding will surely fuel popular retail theories of young consumers as flaky dilettantes, it also speaks to the changed consumer habits of shoppers who came of age during the great recession. this generation has been shown to be much more sensitive to prices, for reasons ranging from the ease of comparison shopping to their lower income and higher living costs compared with their parents.\n\nas none of these conditions appears set to change in the near future, it's likely that the bad news for retailers stuck with too many stores will remain rather attractive to lots of millennials.
jeremiah tower is considered by some to be the godfather of modern american cooking. but many don't even know his name. a new documentary, executive produced by chef, author and tv personality anthony bourdain, aims to change that.\n\njeremiah tower: the last magnificent, which highlights the chef's tumultuous career and long-lasting impact, was inspired by bourdain's sense of rage and historical injustice that tower had been omitted from the narrative of american cuisine.\n\ntower and bourdain joined cbs this morning to discuss tower's recently republished memoir, start the fire: how i began a food revolution in america, and why bourdain felt so compelled to shed light on tower's contributions to american cuisine.\n\nthe thing that brought the two men together in the first place was tower's original memoir, california dish. bourdain read it and realized, i'd been cooking dishes that were influenced by jeremiah's work for much of my career without even knowing they were jeremiah's work. for him, tower is the chuck berry of modern american cooking.\n\nhe changed everything, bourdain said. he was somebody with a unique voice, a unique vision who came along and changed not just the way we eat — the way we looked at american ingredients and american sourcing and the role of the chef in the dining scene, as suddenly the chef became someone you wanted to see in the dining room and whose opinion you wanted.\n\nyet many people still have no idea who he is. i think jeremiah wasn't around for a while and allowed people to create out of, i think, laziness, largely out of laziness, a narrative that persisted and people became invested in it over time, bourdain said.\n\ntower, who had unexpectedly walked out of the spotlight for a quiet life in mexico, explained, well, you know, after 35 years of shaking 350 people's hands a day i just decided i needed a little quiet. you know, just to balance all that noise and then i wanted a little quiet from the beach.\n\ncbs this morning co-host gayle king admitted that she couldn't wait to meet tower after seeing the documentary, in which he's described with words like darling and sexy.\n\ndespite the glowing comments, king pointed out tower's reputation for being prickly and controversial in how he behaved in the kitchen.\n\nwhen you're trying to do the best at every moment of every day — and that sounds pretentious but actually, you know, that's what it takes in a good restaurant, tower said.\n\nwhen pressed on why he's making a return to the spotlight, he insisted that his intention is not to get back into the kitchen, unless maybe it was on the amalfi coast or a little beach bar in phuket.\n\nfor bourdain, it's not just a story about what he did for the culinary world. i think it's a great character story about what it takes to be a great chef and the potential perils and costs, he said.\n\none of the major controversies explored by the documentary is who really created california cuisine: tower or alice waters? waters is the founder and owner of berkeley's famed restaurant chez panisse, where tower also began his career.\n\nthe point is well made in the film that she claimed to have done everything, but it's always teamwork and certainly the menus were my work. so i decided as long as anthony said, you know, speak up, i thought i would, said tower.\n\njeremiah tower: the last magnificent is in theaters friday, april 21.
the following is an edited version of a commentary written by andy rooney for a 60 minutes segment which aired on december 28, 1986.\n\ntonight, the dependable old new year's resolutions. here goes for 1987.\n\ni'm not going to try to lose weight. why break my heart again this year? i'm facing the facts. i'm not six feet four inches tall, i'm not 23 years old, and i'm not a thin person.\n\nwhen one shoe lace breaks in 1987, i'm going to change both of them.\n\ni'm going to stop rushing through the week and then complaining about how time flies.\n\nwhen a motorcycle cuts in front of me, and weaves in and out of traffic, i'm going to try not to hope have happen to him what i hoped would happen to him several times last year. that wasn't nice.\n\ni'm going to buy less stuff. i have enough stuff for a while now. i especially don't need any more shoes.\n\ni'm going to be consistent pronouncing iran i-ran and not i-rahn. i don't know which is correct, but i-rahn sounds like tomato and either and i don't say to-mah-toe or eye-ther. i'm also going to pronounce iraq i-rack and not i-rock.\n\ni'm going to stop leaving a light on in the house when we go out to keep the burglars away. i don't think burglars care whether there's a light on or not.\n\ni'm not going to watch any more sports events sponsored by cigarette companies.\n\ni'm going to be nicer to some of the impossible jerks i meet every day. i'm just going to smile at them, nice as pie, and say, have a nice day.\n\ni'm not going to stay in the hot shower so long in 1987.\n\nand one last thing, this new year's eve, i'm not going to pretend i'm having a good time. i'm just going to drink, say happy new year to everyone and go home and go to bed.\n\nhappy new year.
why chemical engineers are now studying coffee the university of california-davis hopes to become the worldwide epicenter of coffee research, just as climate change threatens the multi-billion dollar industry. with the land in some countries that farm coffee eroding, researchers hope to find an environmentally-friendly solution that will also let you still have your regular morning cup. dana jacobson speaks to scientists who are working on the coffee genome.
washington -- anchorage, alaska, was warmer tuesday than jacksonville, florida. the weather in the u.s. is that upside down.\n\nthat's because the arctic's deeply frigid weather escaped its regular atmospheric jail that traps the worst cold. it then meandered south to the central and eastern united states. and this has been happening more often in recent times, scientists say.\n\nsuper cold air is normally locked up in the arctic in the polar vortex, which is a gigantic circular weather pattern around the north pole. a strong polar vortex keeps that cold air hemmed in.\n\nthen when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst, and the cold air heads south, said judah cohen, a winter storm expert for atmospheric environmental research, a commercial firm outside boston.\n\nthis is not record-breaking for canada or alaska or northern siberia, it's just misplaced, said cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the u.s.\n\nis this unusual?\n\nyes, but more for how long -- about 10 days -- the cold has lasted, than how cold it has been. on tuesday, boston tied its seven-day record for the most consecutive days at or below 20 degrees that was set exactly 100 years ago.\n\nmore than 1,600 daily records for cold were tied or broken in the last week of december, according to the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa). for greg carbin of the national weather service's weather prediction center, the most meaningful statistics are how last week's average temperature was the second coldest in more than a century of record-keeping for minneapolis, chicago, detroit and kansas city, third coldest in pittsburgh and fifth coldest in new york city.\n\nglobal warming and cold weather\n\nwhile the united states has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. the globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees warmer than normal tuesday and the arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal, according to the university of maine climate change institute's analysis.\n\nif you look at the temperature map for the climate as a whole right now, the entire rest of the planet is warmer than the historical average with the exception of the eastern united states and canada, and the last three years -- 2014, 2015 and 2016 -- have been consecutively the warmest years on record, atmospheric scientist and columbia university professor adam sobel told cbs news last week.\n\nwhat's next?\n\na brutal winter storm dumped snow, sleet and freezing rain from normally balmy florida up the southeast seaboard wednesday, delivering a white coating that some cities hadn't seen in decades. cars spun out of control on icy overpasses from texas to georgia. forecasters warned that conditions could worsen, especially in the northeast.\n\nin the southern u.s., a wind chill advisory was in effect wednesday from orlando down to boca raton as a bomb cyclone storm was expected to swirl up the east coast, said cbs news weather producer david parkinson. he said when a storm system loses 24 millibars of pressure, which is to say it gets that much stronger, in under 24 hours, you have what's called a 'weather bomb,' and so that's where you get the term 'bombogenesis' – that's where we talk about storms 'bombing out.'\n\nmuch sort of like a sandy or a hurricane or something like that, it gets really strong really quickly, and when that happens you have these bursts of intense snow, he said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nif the storm moves just 25 miles in one direction or the other when it gets to the northeast, that could be the difference between four and eight inches of snow, parkinson said.\n\nthere is a blizzard concern along the coast – in cape ann, mass., and along the state's southern coast. winds are expected to be 40-70 mph.\n\nwe're not going to have ridiculous snow totals that we've never seen before … but what we are gonna have is a lot of wind, a lot of low visibility and what i suspect will be a lot of traffic accidents, parkinson said.\n\nforecasters warned of frost bite and hypothermia in chicago, where wind chills of minus 35 degrees were predicted. according to cbs chicago, many homeowners are already facing the consequences of frozen or broken pipes due to bone-chilling temperatures.\n\nwhat makes the polar vortex move?\n\nthis is an area of hot debate and research among scientists and probably is a mix of human-caused climate change and natural variability, said furtado. climate change hasn't made the polar vortex more extreme, but it probably is making it move more, which makes the weather seem more extreme, he said.\n\na recent study by potsdam institute climate scientist marlene kretschmer found the polar vortex has weakened and meandered more often since 1990, but that study focused more on europe. ongoing research shows that there seems to be a similar connection for more frequent arctic cold snaps like what the u.s. is now experiencing, kretschmer said.\n\nhow can it be so cold with global warming?\n\ndon't confuse weather -- which is a few days or weeks in one region -- with climate, which is over years and decades and global. weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, furtado said.\n\na few cold days doesn't disprove climate change, furtado said. that's just silly. just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash.
after years of rape, beatings and persecution from notorious gangs in their home countries, 12 central americans fled to the united states last year to seek asylum. but then-attorney general jeff sessions had just issued a policy change: domestic and gang violence would not be grounds for asylum.\n\nthey sued, and in december, a federal judge said the policy change was unlawful, and those individuals would get a second chance. but six of them had already been deported back to their native countries and, per the judges orders, ice agents are responsible for bringing them back. all of six remain in central america, and the government blames the shutdown.\n\namong the plaintiffs still stuck in central america is nora, an el salvadorian women who survived years of beatings and rape by her partner, a known gang member. when nora attempted to end the relationship in may of last year, her partner's gang targeted her, threatening to rape her and kill her children.\n\nin may, when nora was walking home with her three young children, [her partner's friend] pursued her down the street and told her that he knew she lived alone with her children and that he would come to her house at night to have sex with her, according to the original complaint against sessions' new asylum policy. he showed her a gun in his waistband and then looked to her son, indicating that he would kill them both if she did not submit to his demands.\n\nshortly after the threat, nora and her son fled el salvador, seeking asylum in the u.s. even though an immigration officer believed her story — hers is a typical experience for women in central america — she did not pass her credible fear interview because of the new policy.\n\ngenerally, asylum is available to anyone who fears persecution in their home country because of their affiliation with one or more of five accepted groups: race, religion, nationality, political opinion or particular social group.\n\nin his december ruling on the lawsuit, the judge called the policy change arbitrary, capricious, and in violation of the immigration laws insofar as those policies are applied in credible fear proceedings.\n\nof the 12 plaintiffs in the case, grace v. whitacker, six had already been deported to central america, five had been released from detention centers as they awaited removal, and one remains detained, according to jennifer chang newell, an attorney with the aclu's immigrants' rights project who worked to strike down sessions' asylum policy.\n\nthe judge ordered that the six who had been removed be brought back to the u.s. for immigration proceedings. but the partial government shutdown has restricted ice agents' ability to follow through, according to a status report filed by the government jan. 18. although ice agents have been able to locate nora and her son in el salvador, they haven't been successful bringing them back to the u.s. yet.\n\ndue to the lapse in appropriations, the normal process for paying departure and passport fees has become complicated, the report said.\n\nsome of the plaintiffs have had to pay their own travel document fees — despite the judge's order saying that would be the government's responsibility — and told that they would be reimbursed eventually, according to the report.\n\nthere's been a few logistical issues getting them back, things like travel documents, passports, parental consent and travel fees, said newell in a telephone interview with cbs news on friday.\n\nas they wait, six of the plaintiffs remain in the countries and situations that prompted them to seek asylum in the first place. nora and her son continue to fear for their lives, according to the original complaint.\n\nthough the plaintiffs will get a second chance at asylum, thousands others won't.\n\nif someone has already been removed because of the sessions decision and they weren't part of the lawsuit, they're just out of luck, said anne dutton, an attorney at the center for gender and refugee studies who also worked on the case, in a telephone interview with cbs news on friday.\n\nnew asylum seekers won't be held to sessions' struck-down policy on domestic and gang violence, and have the potential to seek refuge in the united states on those grounds thanks to the aclu's lawsuit. however, the relief may not last; the government appealed the decision last week.\n\nwhat exactly happens to the plaintiffs next isn't clear. and last week's status report said part of the delay in returning the asylum seekers is because the parties do not agree on the process that will be applied to the plaintiffs once they are returned to u.s. soil.\n\nthe government argues that upon their arrival in the u.s., nora, her son and the other four should be detained until their credible fear interview, which could take months to schedule. lawyers representing the central americans, however, believe that they should be able to begin that process without being held in a detention center.
your facebook feed will soon start to look pretty different.\n\nthe social network said thursday that it's overhauling the news feed prioritize posts from family and friends, as opposed to ones from brands and publishers.\n\nthat means fewer news articles, and more baby pictures a d status updates from your aunt or coworker.\n\ni'm changing the goal i give our product teams from focusing on helping you find relevant content to helping you have more meaningful social interactions, ceo mark zuckerberg wrote on his facebook page.\n\nyou can read zuckerberg's post below:\n\none of our big focus areas for 2018 is to make sure that the time we all spend on facebook is time well spent. we built... posted by mark zuckerberg on thursday, january 11, 2018\n\nhe also acknowledged that the company's business could take a short-term hit as a result of the change -- but it was an important move to make anyway.\n\nby making these changes, i expect the time people spend on facebook and some measures of engagement will go down. but i also expect the time you do spend on facebook will be more valuable, he wrote. and if we do the right thing, i believe that will be good for our community and our business over the long term too.\n\nthis article originally appeared on cnet titled: facebook overhauls news feed to focus on friends and family
some snap (snap) users have taken to -- what else -- social media to voice their displeasure over the app's recent redesign.\n\nthe company, best known for its snapchat video messages that are popular with teens and young adults, recently cleaved the app into two sections, with media content on the right and friends content on the left.\n\naccording to some snapchat users, the changes have made the site worse. a petition started on change.org, which has attracted 580,000 signatures, calls on the venice, calif., company to change the site back to its previous layout.\n\nthere is a general level of annoyance among users, and many have decided to use a vpn (virtual private network) app to go back to the old snapchat, as that's how annoying this new update has become, the petition says. many 'new features' are useless or defeats the original purposes snapchat has had for the past years.\n\nforced into snap update today, this app is officially ruined. worst redesign i've ever seen — nadir (@nadirkhani) february 10, 2018\n\nhonestly what is going on with the new snapchat update?! it's actually horrendous, can't find a single thing on it... thank you snapchat i wanted to see stories from random people who i have met and not my actual friends😑🙄😤 #snapchatupdate — paige beresford (@_paigeberesford) february 12, 2018\n\ni was backing @snap against instagram, but i really hate the new redesign. instagram, here i come.#snapchat update — jordan d. johnson (@whatthefricativ) february 12, 2018\n\nthey needed to pull off the band-aid and do an app redesign, daniel ives, chief strategy officer and head of technology research at gbh insights. as we have seen over the last year, the complexity and the nature of the snap app was not appealing to older (users).\n\nthe site remains highly popular among younger users. according to emarketer, snapchat overtook both instagram and facebook in terms of total users aged 12 to17 and 18 to 24 for the first time last year. snapchat also is adding younger users at a faster rate than facebook, the largest social network.\n\nkids expect everything to work flawlessly and are notoriously fickle, said michael pachter an analyst with wedbush securities, in an email. he also expressed surprised that snap didn't test the new site before launching it.\n\nmy kids are both 18 and are bitterly complaining about it, pachter said.\n\nsnap has been under pressure from wall street analysts to broaden its appeal after facebook (fb), which offered to buy the company for $3 billion in 2013, began offering a sharing feature and camera filters called stories that is nearly identical to snapchat.\n\nduring its latest quarter, snap reported better-than-expected financial results as it added more users than expected, although the company's net loss more than doubled.\n\naddressing wall street analysts during the company's recent earnings conference call, snap chief executive evan spiegel said the company is monitoring the rollout of the site design and will make adjustments based on feedback from users.\n\nkey snap metrics around content consumption and time spent on the site are disproportionately higher for users over the age of 35, which bodes well for increasing engagement among older users as we continue to grow our business, he said.\n\nto be sure, other social media sites including facebook and twitter (twtr) have previously angered users with site changes, while ultimately continuing to grow.\n\nupdates as big as this one can take a little getting used to, but we hope the community will enjoy it once they settle in, a snap spokesman said in an email.
since the los angeles lakers hired magic johnson as the basketball and business adviser to owner jeanie buss, it seemed like johnson was coming for the jobs of general manager mitch kupchak and vice president of basketball operations jim buss.\n\nafter a few weeks of johnson dropping hints, the lakers announced on tuesday that kupchak has been fired and johnson has been promoted to president of basketball operations.\n\nbuss is also no longer in his role with the lakers.\n\nfrom the lakers:\n\nlos angeles lakers governor jeanie buss announced today that the team has named earvin magic johnson as president of basketball operations. in addition, general manager mitch kupchak has been relieved of his duties, effective immediately. furthermore, jim buss will no longer hold his role as lakers executive vice president of basketball operations. today i took a series of actions i believe will return the lakers to the heights dr. jerry buss demanded and our fans rightly expect, jeanie buss said. effective immediately, earvin johnson will be in charge of all basketball operations and will report directly to me. our search for a new general manager to work with earvin and coach luke walton is well underway and we hope to announce a new general manager in short order. together, earvin, luke and our new general manager will establish the foundation for the next generation of los angeles lakers greatness. it's a dream come true to return to the lakers as president of basketball operations working closely with jeanie buss and the buss family, said earvin magic johnson. since 1979, i've been a part of the laker nation and i'm passionate about this organization. i will do everything i can to build a winning culture on and off the court. we have a great coach in luke walton and good young players. we will work tirelessly to return our los angeles lakers to nba champions.\n\nbasically as soon as johnson was hired in advisory role, it looked like the lakers would be making a change in their front office. but jeanie buss has allowed her brother jim to stick to his three-to-four year timeline of making the lakers a competitive team, so it seemed like that would still be their game plan.\n\nyet, apparently there was no longer time to wait, and now johnson is in charge.\n\nit's a stunning move for the lakers two days before the feb. 23 trade deadline. johnson was a smart player who turned into a shrewd businessman and, despite his often amusing tweets, he is quite knowledgeable about basketball. plus, johnson is well respected around the league and he should help the lakers woo potential free agents just by his name recognition.\n\njohnson, however, is not that savvy when it comes to the collective bargaining agreement and the nba's salary cap. these are areas he is trying to learn more about. but with the trade deadline rapidly approaching, the lakers can't fall into the same type of pitfall that the kings have with vlade divac's naivety.\n\nit should be noted that johnson did not get promoted to be the team's gm. that role is still vacant and johnson will obviously play a large role in the hiring process. espn's ramona shelburne reports that rob pelinka, who is kobe bryant's agent, could possibly be hired by the lakers in a front office capacity.\n\nwith the trade deadline just days away, for better or for worse, the lakers have drastically shaken up their front office at a potentially pivotal point of the season.
jetblue says a passenger who took a flight from new york's jfk airport to palm beach, florida, this week even though he knew he might be infected with the coronavirus will no longer be allowed to fly on the airline. the passenger received a message during the flight wednesday night confirming he'd tested positive for the virus.\n\njetblue — one of many airlines that are currently waiving change and cancellation fees for customers who wish to change their travel arrangements due to the coronavirus outbreak — said it has banned the passenger from future jetblue flights.\n\nwe determined the customer boarded our flight knowing he was awaiting results for a coronavirus test without disclosing it to anyone at jetblue, the airline said in a statement to cbs news. the event put our crewmembers, customers, and federal and local officials in an unsettling situation that could have easily been avoided, and as such, this customer will not be permitted to fly on jetblue in the future.\n\naccording to another passenger, who claimed in a video posted online that he had spoken to the infected man's wife during the flight, the man knew he was likely positive even before they took off. the fellow passenger told cnbc that he was informed that the patient had been tested for the virus two days ago and got a text message on the plane while he was on the plane.\n\npalm beach county fire rescue officials told cbs affiliate wpec that passengers in the vicinity of the positive patient were advised of monitoring procedures. captain albert borroto of palm beach county fire rescue said all other passengers had been sent home and were advised to call the public health department if they have any medical concerns.\n\nthe palm beach county health department has spoken with all passengers who were on the jetblue flight, and a spokesperson for the county's emergency services said all cdc and department of health guidelines were followed for a covid-19 positive patient.\n\nborroto also said palm beach international airport sterilized the limited containment area where the passengers were deplaned, which was a separate location from the main terminals of the airport.\n\nlocal news stations reported dr. alina alonso, the health director in palm beach county, advised the 114 people onboard flight 253 as they disembarked from the flight.\n\nan individual on this flight got a text that he tested positive for the coronavirus. he has not been coughing or sneezing or anything on the plane, alonso reportedly told passengers. at this point, you're free to walk around and move around because, most likely, you're not going to have anything because there was no activity. the way you get this virus is somebody has to cough or sneeze on you.\n\nfollowing the incident, jetblue released a statement reassuring customers that it had conducted a thorough sanitizing of the aircraft according to cdc guidance. we have also sanitized common areas in both airport terminals involved. it said it was coordinating closely with health officials.\n\nduring an appearance on cbs this morning on wednesday, jetblue ceo robin hayes said the airline has taken significant steps to help mitigate the spread of coronavirus on all flights. we are deep cleaning and sanitizing and disinfecting our airplanes every night, hayes said. in addition, we have wipes on board so customers can come on and can wipe down their seat if they want to sort of take some additional precautions.
president trump will visit the southern border thursday, as the battle over funding for his border wall and the partial government shutdown continue.\n\nwhite house press secretary sarah sanders announced monday that mr. trump will travel to the border on thursday, although she didn't say exactly where he will be. mr. trump's white house is now demanding $5.7 billion for a steel barrier at the border, while democrats say they won't fund his wall. the partial government shutdown, affecting not just the department of homeland security but also the irs, department of the interior and other agencies, is now in its third week with no end in sight.\n\npresident @realdonaldtrump will travel to the southern border on thursday to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis. more details will be announced soon, sanders tweeted monday.\n\nthere are no talks on any public schedule at the white house monday, and congress isn't back in session until tuesday. representatives from the white house and from democrats and republicans on capitol hill did meet on the white house grounds saturday and sunday, but that yielded little progress.\n\nmr. trump has visited the border in the past. last year, he visited san diego to look at wall prototypes.\n\nit's unclear exactly what he will be doing with this visit, although sanders said more details will be forthcoming.\n\nthe president held an hour-long press conference last week, fielding journalists' questions on the wall and hundreds of thousands of federal employees — including border patrol agents — working without pay. mr. trump now says he'll accept steel slats instead of a concrete wall, although that change doesn't appear acceptable to democrats.\n\nthis is a developing story and will be updated.
sears, once america's largest employer, is now fighting to stay in business. its chairman, eddie lampert, promised again tuesday to line up financing to save the classic retailer. his new offer goes to an auction on monday, competing against other bidders who want to shut down the company.\n\nsears had just under 700 stores and about 68,000 employees, as of late last year. it filed for bankruptcy in october during a record wave of retail store closings.\n\nit was the original everything retailer, delivering the world to your doorstep decades before anyone ever got a box from amazon. but after navigating the shift to department stores and malls, sears stopped innovating, according to former sears executive mark cohen, now director of the retail studies program at columbia business school.\n\nthe company has been on a death spiral for well over a decade, cohen said. it lost sight of the fact that change is a constant.\n\nwhile he blames poor management and stiff competition for the demise of sears, it's not the only company that has failed to change with the times.\n\nfrom 2012 through 2017, u.s. ecommerce sales nearly doubled. in the last two years, at least 200 million square feet of retail space closed – including dozens of stores from j.c. penney, macy's, toys r us, and kmart, which merged with sears in 2005.\n\n\n\nsears itself has shuttered more than 3,000 stores worldwide in the past decade. sears, which once employed as many as 350,000 people, offered workers a path to the middle class and customers a little bit of luxury at middle class prices.\n\n\n\nbobby jones told cbs sunday morning he worked at sears for 35 years, enjoying wages and benefits that many of today's retail workers can only dream of.\n\nit was prestige to say, 'yes, i work for sears,' jones said.\n\nwhile the company's decline is historic, it does not mean the death of retail, said cbs news financial contributor mellody hobson.\n\n\n\nyou have lots of retailers that are thriving out there. and you have some, like amazon, that are building brick and mortar stores like whole foods, which they acquired, hobson said.\n\nbut should any of today's retail giants fail to adapt, hobson said they, too, risk falling.\n\nyou have to be able to play in lots of lanes. online, with brick and mortar, you have to have good products that the customer wants and stay competitive, hobson said.\n\nlast month, a court approved bonuses of up to $25 million for sears executives willing to work through the bankruptcy. the company's frontline employees, meanwhile, are worried they may walk away with nothing. the hedge fund hoping to buy sears said it expects to reinstate the severance program sears had in place prior to its bankruptcy filing.
salt lake city -- the mormon church, the biggest sponsor of boy scout troops in the united states, announced thursday it is pulling as many as 185,000 older youths from the organization as part of an effort to start its own scouting-like program.\n\nthe church of jesus christ of latter-day saints said the move wasn't triggered by the boy scouts' decision in 2015 to allow gay troop leaders, since mormon-sponsored troops have remained free to exclude such adults on religious grounds.\n\nbut at least one leading mormon scholar said that the boy scouts and the church have been diverging on values in recent years and that the policy on gays was probably a contributing factor in the split.\n\ncbs affiliate kutv in salt lake city, utah, reports the lds church said it doesn't believe young men between 14 and 18 years old are not being served well by the varsity or venturing programs.\n\nthe church said the decision will affect 185,000 teens; the boy scouts put the number at 130,000.\n\nthe loss is only a fraction of the 2.3 million youths in the boy scouts of america, but the organization has been grappling with declining membership for years and has enjoyed an unusually close bond with the mormon church for more than a century because of their shared values. joining the boy scouts is practically automatic among mormon boys.\n\nboy scouts of america spokeswoman effie delimarkos said the organization is saddened by the decision but understands the church's desire to customize a program.\n\nabout 280,000 mormon boys ages 8 to 13 will remain in the scouts while the church develops its program, the mormons said. the boy scouts estimated their number at 330,000.\n\nkutv reports the church will continue through 2018 to make the same payment to the boy scouts of america for registration of its young men.\n\nlike other conservative faiths, the mormon church opposes gay marriage and teaches that being in a homosexual relationship is a sin. the church initially said it was deeply troubled by the boy scouts' policy change on gays but stayed with the organization after receiving assurances it could appoint troop leaders according to its own religious and moral values.\n\nin thursday's announcement, the church said that it learned recently that the boy scouts are considering admitting girls, but that its decision was made independently of that.\n\nmatthew bowman, a mormon scholar and history professor at henderson state university, said the schism reflects the two organizations' diverging values, with gays and girls among the issues on which they are moving apart.\n\nthe church is wedded very much to traditional gender roles and they see the boy scouts of america increasingly move away from that, bowman said. that means that they have come to see it as less of a hospitable place.\n\nthursday's announcement represents a first step toward something that has been in the works for years: a mormon-run scouting-type program that could be used in congregations around the world. the church has 15.8 million members, nearly 6 in 10 of them outside the u.s. and canada. scouting is available only in the u.s. and canada.\n\nthe long game here is the church looking forward to a time when americans are even more of a minority in the church than they are now, bowman said.\n\nmormon teenagers who want to continue working toward the eagle scout rank will be able to do that on their own while also participating in the new program, said church spokesman eric hawkins.\n\nthe boy scout movement has been entrenched in mormon culture for as long as anyone can remember.\n\nin 2013, the church put on an extravagant theatrical production inside its 21,000-seat auditorium in salt lake city to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the faith's alliance with the boy scouts.\n\na boy scout training complex in west virginia is named after mormon church president thomas s. monson, a longtime member of the boy scouts' executive board and a major supporter. charles dahlquist ii, a mormon, holds the top volunteer position with the boy scouts.\n\nbecoming an eagle scout is an especially proud badge of honor within mormon culture. many utah lawmakers list it on their resumes. social media was buzzing with jokes thursday about mormon women adjusting their hopes of finding a husband who was an eagle scout.
a rare find off hawaii is captivating shark lovers around the world. gracefully appearing from the deep – and dwarfing nearby divers – the shark affectionately named deep blue is one of the largest great whites ever documented. marine biologist ocean ramsey seen swimming with the shark on tuesday is still in awe.\n\nnever would have imagined that a massive, beautiful, great white, looks-like-she's-pregnant female, would swim up, ramsey said.\n\na shark said to be deep blue swims off hawaii, u.s. on january 15, 2019 in picture obtained from social media on january 17, 2019 @juansharks/@oceanramsey/juan oliphant/oneoceandiving.com via @juansharks/@oceanramsey/juan oliphant/oneoceandiving.com via reuters\n\ndivers, researchers, and photographers shared incredible images after a once-in-a-lifetime encounter with the shark off oahu's southern coast this week. but the pictures and videos are attracting crowds and prompting warnings from wildlife experts.\n\ndeep blue was first spotted this week feeding on a dead whale. she's estimated to be more than 20 feet long, weighing about 2.5 tons – as much as a large suv.\n\nshe is already a star in the scientific community. researchers have been tracking her for years but said she hasn't been seen up close since 2015. ramsey said she documented her encounter to change the public perception of sharks.\n\nthe message i really hope to get across with these beautiful images and video [is] to show that they aren't the mindless man-eaters that they are so often portrayed as in media, like the movie 'jaws,' ramsey said. they deserve a high level of respect and they need protection.\n\ndeep blue is so famous, she has her own twitter page and cameras capture her every move whenever she decides to make a special appearance. wildlife photographer kimberly jeffries, who took new photos of the shark, said shots like hers are especially rare because great whites are naturally reclusive creatures.\n\n\n\ntheir habits are so different from ours. they make these really deep dives during the day and then come up to the surface briefly, so it's no wonder we don't see them, jeffries said.\n\nbut since these latest images hit the internet, the shark's new feeding ground is attracting amateurs who want to get up close and personal to the great white.\n\nsocial media is definitely whipping this into a frenzy, said jason redulla, chief enforcement officer with the department of land and natural resources. he warned visitors against trying to have their own dive with the animal.\n\n\n\nthis is a dangerous mix where we do have sharks in the water, we do have a lot of public interest and really would behoove everyone not to compromise their safety. it's just not worth it, redulla said.\n\nwhat do you say to people who might see your pictures and think that shark is still out there, i can go get a selfie with her? evans asked ramsey.\n\ni would strongly advise against people purposely jumping in the water with a great white shark, ramsey responded. i wouldn't even be in the water if i wasn't there purposely trying to document and record ids and behavior… trying to share that with the public so we could hopefully better co-exist.

minnesota governor tim walz announced wednesday that he's relaxing covid-19 restrictions for minnesota bars and restaurants, which have been closed to indoor dining for the last six weeks, cbs minnesota reports. loosened restrictions were also announced for movie theaters, gyms, places of worship and small gatherings.\n\nwalz also mentioned during his press conference that the amount of new covid-19 cases are approaching the pre-surge level seen last year at the height of the pandemic.\n\nthe governor will now allow bars and restaurants to reopen indoor dining at 50% capacity, or up to 150 people. restaurant tables will be able to seat up to six people, and bars will be able to seat groups of two. under the new rules, reservations will be required, and establishments must close by 10 p.m. local time.\n\nthe new rules are slated to take effect monday, when the governor's current executive order banning indoor dining is set to expire.\n\nthe situation in minnesota is undeniably better than it was last month, walz said in a statement earlier wednesday. we have reasons to be optimistic, and minnesotans' sacrifice and commitment to their communities helped change the pandemic's trajectory and saved lives. but we need to protect the progress we've made.\n\nwalz also announced relaxed restrictions for gyms, churches, and indoor entertainment facilities such as theaters, museums and bowling alleys. starting monday, gyms will be able to hold up to 150 people, although capacity will remain capped at 25%. up to 25 people will be allowed in gym classes, as long as there can be 9 feet of separation. masks will be required.\n\nmovie theaters, museums and bowling alleys will be able to reopen at 25% capacity, with no more than 150 people in the venue area. masks will be required, and there'll be no food service after 10 p.m.\n\nsmall gatherings such as wedding receptions and private parties will be allowed to resume with limits. if food and drinks are served, the gatherings will be limited to 10 people from two households indoors or 15 people from three households outdoors. if no food or drinks are served, the gatherings will be restricted by venue guidelines. any ceremonies — such as weddings or funerals — will fall under guidelines for places of worship, which will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity but with no maximum number limit.\n\nthe relaxed restrictions come as minnesota has seen weeks of declining covid-19 cases and hospitalizations. additionally, frontline health care workers and those in long-term care facilities have begun to be inoculated against the virus. although the vaccine rollout has been slower than expected, some health care workers this week began receiving their second and final doses.

watch the new cbsn documentary, hindsight is 2020: an unprecedented election, in the video player above.\n\non the day congress officially counted the electoral votes making joe biden the next president, chants of stop the steal echoed through the u.s. capitol. the deadly assault followed months of president trump's insistence that mr. biden's win could only be explained by rampant fraud, and he encouraged his supporters to demand a different result.\n\nbut none of the claims of widespread fraud or election theft hold up under scrutiny. election officials around the country and the trump administration's own attorney general and cybersecurity experts verified the election was the most secure in american history. all of the lawsuits claiming otherwise were rejected by state and federal courts.\n\nhere is a look at some of the most common conspiracy claims that were used to try to undermine the election results, and what experts have to say about their validity.\n\n\n\nno, dominion voting machines did not change or delete votes for trump\n\nfor qanon and trump supporters harry formanek and traci specht, this was one of the most damning fraud allegations. they believe that dominion voting machines used in some states were somehow programmed to either flip votes to favor mr. biden or delete votes for mr. trump — a story spread by mr. trump and his lawyers.\n\nwhat happened was there was 6,000 total votes that flipped, that were trump's votes that flipped to biden that they discovered, formanek said, repeating a misconception about the vote count in michigan. and they said, 'oh, it's a glitch,' but then they saw in other states this same anomaly happened. and it always happened against trump.\n\nformanek appeared to be referring to antrim county, michigan, where an unofficial preliminary tally on election night showed biden had won the county, which was not accurate. election officials said it was the result of human error that was quickly discovered and corrected.\n\nsecretary of state jocelyn benson explained in a statement on november 6 that an election worker had made an honest mistake and failed to update the software to properly combine the electronic totals, even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly.\n\nelection clerks work extremely hard and do their work with integrity. they are human beings, and sometimes make mistakes. however, there are many checks and balances that ensure mistakes can be caught and corrected, benson said, including a bipartisan commission that canvasses the results. the official results show mr. trump won antrim county with 9,748 votes to mr. biden's 5,960.\n\nnevertheless, white house press secretary kayleigh mcenany and others claimed a computer glitch counted republican ballots as democrat.\n\nsimilar claims were leveled at georgia, even though it conducted three recounts — including a hand-recount of paper ballots — to confirm final results showing that mr. biden won the state by 11,779 votes.\n\nanother location targeted by these claims was maricopa county, arizona.\n\nthe county elections department conducted a post-election accuracy test to verify the results and ensure no changes were made to any software throughout the election. with the secretary of state and representatives from republican, democratic and independent parties present, the county announced on november 18 that the results were 100% accurate and nothing had been manipulated.\n\nspecht also claimed the dominion voting machine manual tells workers how to change the vote. she said she obtained this information from ron watkins, whose internet message board 8kun disseminates qanon posts and who was an expert witness in sidney powell's failed georgia election lawsuit because he read the dominion manual.\n\nit says right on there how you can open the back of the machine up, and you can change it up, and do all kinds of things, specht said. so, that in and of itself, just that right there is very concerning and alarming.\n\nthat's not happening, georgia's top election operations official, gabriel sterling, a republican, said at a briefing earlier this month. no one is changing parts of pieces out of dominion voting machines. that's — i don't even know what that means, it's not a real thing.\n\nin the lawsuit, which was dismissed by a republican-appointed federal judge, watkins claimed dominion machines may reject ballots that have stray marks or even some with bubbles correctly filled in next to candidates names. those ballots would then be reviewed by election workers. this, watkins said without proof, allows workers to manipulate the results.\n\nto get a better understanding of these claims, cbs news spoke with deen freelon, an associate professor at the university of north carolina's school of media and journalism, who studies disinformation, hyper-partisan communication and conspiracy theories.\n\nthis claim, freelon said, is probably the wildest and largest category of electoral disinformation in 2020.\n\nhe pointed out that dominion systems have been used for years and were used not only in swing states, but also in states that heavily leaned in favor of mr. trump. he also pointed out that those who believe this claim only used it to cast doubt on the presidential race — and not the senate and house races that were decided on the same ballots.\n\nthe story really just does not add up at all when you really look at its particulars, he said. folks are just relying on the idea that they can just advance this claim without any evidence and folks will accept it.\n\ndominion says it provides voting systems in 28 u.s. states and has supported tens of thousands of elections. it says all of its machines have undergone certification and logic accuracy testing before the election, publicly and with the oversight of bipartisan election inspectors. the company also says all votes counted by the system can be easily checked with hand audits.\n\nthe company has filed a defamation suit against sidney powell.\n\nno, sharpie markers did not invalidate trump votes in arizona\n\nthis claim was quickly debunked by state election officials.\n\nsharpie markers are recommended by the manufacturer of maricopa county's vote tabulation machines as the preferred way to mark ballots for use in those machines, maricopa county said. ink from ballpoint pens can cause smudges in the machines and foul them, while sharpie markets do not. ... even if bleed through should occur, there is no impact on any race.\n\nsharpie markers are recommended by the manufacturer of maricopa county's vote tabulation machines as the preferred way to mark ballots for use in those machines. below is our response to the arizona attorney general's request for more information. https://t.co/srh9zxcgy5 pic.twitter.com/hn7kqtg1tw — maricopa county elections department (@maricopavote) november 5, 2020\n\nmaricopa county was sued for this alleged interference, but on december 9, a judge ruled that the plaintiffs failed to provide any factual support for their extraordinary claims.\n\ndominion has also said that its voting machines have no problem with felt-tip markers.\n\nit really just seems to me to be a situation where it's any port in the storm, freelon said of the claim, where people are grabbing onto any possibility that there may have been malfeasance that resulted in trump losing a particular state.\n\nfreelon also noted that this claim, as with many of the others, would have impacted biden voters, too, if it were true.\n\nall of the ballots that used sharpies were counted, as they should've been, he said. there's no evidence that trump voters are disproportionate sharpie users any more so than biden voters. so, i'm not really sure exactly where they were going with that one.\n\nno, mail-in voting is not rife with fraud\n\nas the coronavirus pandemic surged in the months leading up to the election, many voters favored voting by mail to avoid crowded polling sites on election day. amid that surge, conspiracy theories about the safety of mail-in voting started to circulate, largely at the hands of mr. trump.\n\nin the months leading up to the election, he continuously insisted that mail-in ballots could be tampered with or enable people to vote multiple times.\n\nbut the system has a long and successful history. people in this country have voted by mail since the civil war, said debra cleaver, founder and ceo of voteamerica. she explained to cbs news some of the safeguards mail-in ballots have in place.\n\nthere is a lot of security built into the ballots themselves, cleaver said. the outgoing ballots have a barcode, and then when you send your ballot in, you put it in a return envelope and that barcode has to match the barcode that was sent out in order for the ballot to be counted.\n\nmany election offices have ballot tracking websites that allow voters to track the location of their mail-in ballot and confirm when it is counted.\n\nthere have been a few cases in the 2020 election in which counties sent voters ballots with the wrong or missing information. however, those counties rectified the situation and sent correct replacements.\n\nwidespread voter fraud is a myth, cleaver said. you are more likely to be struck by lightning twice than you are to commit voter fraud.\n\nchristopher krebs, the former director of the department of homeland security's cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (cisa), has said that voting by mail is a resilient and secure system because it generates paper trails that can be audited.\n\nfreelon agreed, telling cbs news there is no evidence that mail-in voting is more subject to fraud than in-person voting. a tampering effort of such magnitude, he said, would have some kind of smoking gun.\n\nif you consider the degree of coordination that would be required to shift the vote in one direction or another via mail-in voting in any given state, it's massive, freelon said, and it's not something that you could cover up with no evidence.\n\nno, people were not throwing out bags of ballots or finding suitcases full of ballots\n\na number of videos went viral after the 2020 election purporting to show fraudulent handing of ballots, but they were misleading.\n\nin one video, an election worker in georgia was seen throwing away a piece of paper. social media posts accused him of throwing away a ballot when he was actually tossing a list of instructions, as proven by the fulton county elections supervisor richard barron.\n\nanother video showed a man in detroit taking a box from a white van and moving it into a polling center. while many speculated the box had ballots that were going to be counted after polls had closed, it turned out the man seen in the video was a cameraman from a local news station who was loading equipment.\n\nin washington state, radio station komo reported that two trash bags filled with mail, including several unopened ballots, had been found along a road in october. those ballots, according to officials, were returned to the post office and re-sent to recipients.\n\nyet another viral video misrepresented a shot of georgia election workers pulling a case of ballots out from under a table. it wasn't fraud or fake ballots — it was a routine part of the legitimate vote-counting process, which was entirely video-recorded for security, explained state voting official gabriel sterling.\n\nand this is what's really frustrating. the president's legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and from our point of view intentionally misled the senate, the voters and the people of the united states about this, sterling said.\n\nas for the claim that votes for mr. trump were burned or discarded, freelon said it's a lot easier said than proved and there is simply nothing behind it.\n\nno, poll watchers were not blocked from observing\n\nanother common complaint alleged that poll watchers were not permitted to conduct their observation, which allowed some votes to be manipulated. mr. trump's attorneys argued some aspects of this claim in court, and it was found to be untrue.\n\nin philadelphia, for example, mr. trump's attorneys argued that poll observers were being kept too far away from the vote counting process. courts ruled that they were allowed to get within 6 feet.\n\nalong with having democratic, republican and independent observers on site, many election sites also live-streamed their counting process so that voters could see what was happening from home.\n\nthough claims surfaced that poll workers were allegedly changing ballots and that vote-counting sites were banning people from entering, freelon explained these claims are false, and in many instances resulted from a misunderstanding of the typical counting processes.\n\nfor example, only a certain number of certified poll watchers are legally allowed in the rooms where vote counting is taking place. the specific rules and guidelines are different in every state, but those regulations are available online. these observers do not count the votes themselves; rather, they monitor the process to make sure that all votes are counted, that eligible voters are able to fill out their ballots, and that any suspicious activity is reported.\n\nthese kinds of claims trade on people's lack of familiarity with the vote counting process, he said. things that are perfectly normal and happen in every election may look like, to the uninitiated viewer, as something irregular or problematic.\n\nno, there were not thousands of votes by dead people or people voting multiple times\n\nanother popular claim is that people were able to vote multiple times in the election, and that lots fraudulent ballots were cast in the names of dead people. mr. trump even urged his supporters to attempt voting twice.\n\nformaneck told cbs news he knows of people that said they received four or five ballots in the mail.\n\nbut freelon said there is very, very little evidence of this and that it is an old claim that resurfaces in every election.\n\nvoting multiple times is a federal offense, and those found guilty could face imprisonment for up to five years, a fine of up to $10,000, or both.\n\nthe conservative heritage foundation has reported that there were 15 convictions for voter fraud in the entire country last year, for activities in previous elections. just one person was convicted of attempting to vote multiple times in the 2016 general election.\n\nthere were some reports of people voting twice in the 2020 election, but election officials say they have safeguards in place to ensure that multiple votes by a single person are not counted in the final tally. in north carolina, for example, the elections board said it automatically audits after every election and if there are multiple votes by the same registered voter, they are pulled out of the count.\n\nkira lerne, managing editor of votebeat, told cbs news that most states have signature-matching requirements for absentee ballots, meaning that the signature on your mail-in ballot has to match the signature that you used to register to vote, or the signature that the county has on file for you otherwise. this signature and identification-based system prevents cases involving multiple or fraudulent votes.\n\ncases in which ballots were cast in the names of dead people have been known to happen, freelon said, but they are few and far between. sometimes, according to factcheck.org, the person in question died in between the time they sent in their vote and the time of the election. georgia's gabriel sterling says the state has identified two possible instances in 2020 — nothing close to the thousands claimed by president trump.\n\ncbs philly reports one man in pennsylvania was charged in december with illegally registering and voting for his deceased mother. he cast her ballot for donald trump.\n\nfreelon said the real question about such cases is whether those votes were counted, and if they were, was it enough to shift the result of the election.\n\neven if we do allow for the possibility that a few of these did squeak by, if there were some errors or even some malfeasance on the part of somebody, the idea that there would be anywhere near as many as necessary to shift the election relies on, one, a massive conspiracy of doing this in which many, many people would be involved, and secondly, the idea that all of these votes would need to be on one side.\n\nnationwide, voter turnout set a record in 2020 with more than 155 million americans voting for president — 81.2 million of them for joe biden and 74.2 million for donald trump.\n\nattorney general william barr authorized u.s. attorneys across the country to pursue any substantial allegations of voting irregularities, but he said they found no evidence of fraud that would have affected the outcome.
from 1950-1990: 10 home design trends that endure\n\n\n\n\n\nphoto courtesy of zillow it's common wisdom that home design trends are cyclical. some unfortunate features -- like the popular popcorn ceilings of the '80s -- are probably gone for good. but others -- like the pastel bathroom tiles of the '50s -- are back in a big way and seem likely to go in and out of fashion over time. considering a renovation project sometime soon? many homeowners know that honoring their tastes today, while still keeping future marketability in mind, is a tough balancing act. when and if it comes time to sell, it will be important for future buyers to see themselves living there, which will be hard to do if they don't share your love of bold floral wallpaper. even trends that seem lasting could change. when planning a new design project, particularly one representing a large financial investment, think about whether you'll have to undo the choice before selling. that added renovation work might not always be worth the time or money. in some cases, however, the immediate pleasure or practicality of a retro-feeling update is worth the risk. are you looking for a safe, simple home where you can start a family? a '50s-style ranch house with an open floor plan might be just the thing. are you a budget-savvy owner looking for an inexpensive alternative to hardwood flooring? exploring vinyl options -- popularized in the '60s -- might make real sense. whether you're updating to sell, hoping to buy or looking for inspiration, here are 10 home design trends from the '50s to the '90s that are back in vogue.\n\n1950s: ranch houses photos courtesy of zillow though ranch-style homes were being built in the 1930s, they didn't really gain popularity until after world war ii and into the 1950s. ranch homes are known for being l- or u-shaped, single-story properties with gabled roofs, open floor plans and asymmetrical facades. ranch homes fell out of popularity in the '80s when many homeowners started perceiving them as small and unattractive. now, the single-story open layout has made a comeback, appealing particularly to seniors and young families who want safety, accessibility and simplicity. this clarendon hills, illinois, ranch home (left) was built in 1955. in contrast, this burr ridge, illinois, ranch home (right) was built in 2015. it features many of the same design details, but it's much larger -- 3,100 square feet compared to 1,753 square feet.\n\n1950s: pastel bathrooms photos courtesy of pam keuber/retrorenovation.com (right) and zillow (left) pastel pink and green tiles aren't just for your grandparents' potpourri-drenched half-bath anymore. they first came into style in mid-century american homes, but fell out of favor for a while in the 1970s. according to the 2017 kitchen and bath design trends report from the national kitchen and bath association (nkba), mid-century modern style has reemerged as a popular bathroom aesthetic. the bathroom on the left is from the comer house in gallatin, tennessee, which has not one but seven vintage pastel bathrooms built in the early 1950s. on the right is a pastel green, tiled accent wall from a home in new hope, pennsylvania, built in 2007.\n\n1960s: vinyl flooring photos courtesy of zillow on the scene since the early 1940s, vinyl flooring really caught on in the 1960s when manufacturers began to improve on the design and introduced updates like no-wax and cushioned vinyl floors. it went out of fashion briefly in the '80s for a very practical reason: people were concerned about vinyl tiles containing asbestos. now, however, asbestos-free vinyl flooring has made a big comeback due to its affordability, durability and easy maintenance. the home on the left is the wedgwood home of tomorrow, in portland, oregon, which was built in 1959. the carlsbad, california, home on the right, built in 2014, features vinyl plank flooring throughout.\n\n1960s: conversation pit photos courtesy of zillow mad men fans, rejoice. the conversation pit, popular from the 1950s well into the 1960s because of the way it encouraged face-to-face communication, is popping up again in newer homes. though you might imagine a '60s living room featuring a conversation pit front and center -- like the one in don draper's apartment -- many were also built around features like fireplaces or barbecues, like the homes above. this flemington, new jersey, home on the left (1960) features a conversation pit built around an indoor stone fireplace. the conversation pit on the right has been moved outside in this irvine, california, home, built in 2005.\n\n1970s: wood paneling photos courtesy of zillow believe it or not, wood paneling is back. like brightly colored jumpsuits and high-waisted jeans, don't be surprised if you start seeing wooden walls around the neighborhood again. wood paneling was popular from the 1950s through the 1970s for being low-cost and easy to install. like the ranch house, it fell out of popularity when it became too common, but now it's back on the scene. this park forest, illinois, home on the left, built in 1973, features more traditional painted wood paneling throughout the home. the old greenwich, connecticut, home on the right, built in 2004, has floor-to-ceiling wood paneling in the living room.\n\n1970s: open-plan living photos courtesy of zillow following the popularity of open-plan ranch houses in the '50s, open-plan living expanded in the 1970s. the concept of the great room -- combining kitchen, dining and living rooms into one space -- led to homes with high ceilings, large windows and interior second-floor balconies. the houston, texas, home on the left above was built in 1979 with a second-floor balcony that overlooks the home's great room. built in 2016, the omaha, nebraska, home on the right features a similar open-plan great room.\n\n1980s: floral wallpaper photos courtesy of zillow floral wallpaper, like wallpaper in general, has come in and out of style over the decades. the '80s were the last time it graced our walls en masse, but it's coming back among young homeowners. a 2014 houzz decorating trends study showed that homeowners under 35 were the most likely to incorporate wallpaper into their interior designs, and if today's hgtv home makeovers are any indication, not much has changed. you might remember floral wallpaper as it appears in this la verne, california, home, built in 1983, on the left above. now, wallpaper is more likely to be seen on a statement wall or used boldly in one room as shown in this 2016 bozeman, montana, home on the right.\n\n1980s: glass block photos courtesy of zillow like floral wallpaper, glass block had its last heyday in the '80s. it's still a popular material for building walk-in showers, but can be found in other areas of the home as well. both homes above feature glass block walk-in showers. the medina, ohio, home on the left was built in 1988. it incorporates glass block into the facade of the house, as well as a few interior half-walls. glass block in the raymore, missouri, home on the right, built in 2007, ends at the shower.\n\n1990s: large master suites photos courtesy of zillow large master suites -- typically on the second floor, featuring en suite bathrooms and walk-in closets -- came into popularity in the '90s and haven't gone anywhere. however, these days many owners are looking for master suites on the main floor. first-floor bedrooms allow for the possibility of aging in place and could improve privacy for parents if children's rooms are in another area of the house. the raleigh, north carolina, home on the left, built in 1994, has a master bedroom with an en suite bathroom and walk-in closet. the massillon, ohio, home on the right, built in 2016, also has a master bedroom with an en suite bathroom and an attached walk-in closet with built-in shelving.
birmingham, ala. — the estate of to kill a mockingbird author harper lee is not happy about an upcoming broadway adaption of the novel. lee's estate has filed suit over the play, arguing that screenwriter aaron sorkin's script wrongly alters atticus finch and other characters from the book.\n\nthe suit, which includes a copy of a contract signed by lee and dated about eight months before her death in february 2016, contends sorkin's script violates the agreement by portraying finch, the noble attorney who represents a black man wrongly accused of rape in mockingbird, as someone else in the play.\n\nfiled against the theater company of new york producer scott rudin, the complaint cites an interview with the online publication vulture in which sorkin was quoted as saying the small-town lawyer would evolve from a racist apologist at the start of the show to become atticus finch by the end of the play.\n\nsuch a change during a play could fit with the character evolution shown between the pulitzer prize-winning mockingbird and lee's first draft of the novel, finally released in 2015 as go set a watchman.\n\nbut the lawsuit contends the script would violate the contact by changing finch and other characters and adding still more people who aren't in the novel. it asks a judge to enforce a section of the agreement that states the play won't depart in any manner from the spirit of the novel nor alter its characters.\n\na firm that represents rudin's company, rudinplay inc., said sorkin's script is a faithful adaptation of a singular novel which has been crafted well within the constraints of the signed agreement between the producers and lee.\n\nthe statement also took a jab at the history of litigious behavior of lee's estate, overseen by attorney tonja carter of lee's south alabama hometown of monroeville.\n\nthis is, unfortunately, simply another such lawsuit, the latest of many, and we believe that it is without merit, said the statement. while we hope this gets resolved, if it does not, the suit will be vigorously defended.\n\nthe play is scheduled to open in new york in december.\n\nthe suit names as its plaintiff carter, who represented lee during the final years of the author's life. carter handled lee's will and is listed in the lawsuit as the personal representative of lee's estate.\n\nrudinplay paid lee $100,000 after she approved sorkin as the screenwriter in november 2015, the suit said. carter first saw a draft of the play in september, according to the lawsuit, and she later spoke with rudin by phone to express numerous concerns about sorkin's script.\n\nmr. rudin assured ms. carter that he wanted to do the play right and that he would make sure that the estate would be satisfied with the final product, the suit said.\n\nthe two talked again in february about the script, suit said, adding: at times, the conversation was heated. carter sued after rudin's attorney wrote earlier this month saying extensive changes to the script weren't possible, the suit said.\n\nsorkin has won multiple emmys for his work on the drama series the west wing, and he won an academy award for his screenplay of the social network in 2011.\n\nrudin's credits include lady bird, which was nominated for an academy award as best motion picture this year, and fences, which was a 2017 nominee. he won a best picture oscar for no country for old men in 2008.
sen. kirsten gillibrand, d-new york, is expected to announce her plans to form a presidential exploratory committee on tuesday's late show with stephen colbert, according to a person familiar with her planning.\n\ngillibrand is scheduled to appear on the cbs late night program on tuesday night. if she announces her exploratory committee, as expected, she would become the second u.s. senator — and second female senator — to announce plans to begin the legal process of running for the democratic presidential nomination in 2020. the 52-year old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of president trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017.\n\ngillibrand would join a democratic presidential field beginning to take shape. over the weekend, former housing and urban development (hud) secretary julián castro formally launched his presidential bid, while sen. elizabeth warren, d-massachusetts, launched an exploratory committee on new year's eve. rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii, said over the weekend that she plans to form an exploratory committee in the coming days. several other senators, current and former governors and mayors, and former vice president joe biden are still mulling potential campaigns.\n\nspokespeople for gillibrand declined to comment. in recent days, she has announced that her senate chief of staff, jess fassler, and meredith kelly, a former communications director for the democratic congressional campaign committee (dccc), would be joining the senior staff of her prospective campaign.\n\ngillibrand is the junior senator from the state of new york and was appointed to the seat in january 2009 to replace former sen. hillary clinton, who had stepped down to serve as secretary of state. previously, she was known as a moderate democrat representing new york's north country who openly touted her support of gun rights. but her positions on many policy issues took a decidedly liberal turn once she began serving the empire state and she became an outspoken proponent of stricter gun laws, comprehensive immigration reform and women's rights. she won her first full term to the senate in 2012 and was reelected this past november.\n\nin the senate, she's used her perch on the armed services committee to push for the repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy that banned gay men and lesbians from serving in the military. last year she was the first senate democrat to call on former sen. al franken, d-minnesota, to resign amid accusations of inappropriate behavior towards women. she also sits on senate committees focused on agriculture, aging and the environment.\n\nbefore running for congress in 2006, gillibrand once served as special counsel to then-hud secretary andrew cuomo and later as a manhattan-based attorney who worked for a firm that represented philip morris, the cigarette company.\n\ngillibrand graduated from dartmouth college and received her law degree from university of california los angeles. she is the author of the book off the sidelines: speak up, be fearless, and change your world, and a children's book named bold & brave: ten heroes who won women the right to vote.
the new york stock exchange has withdrawn plans to delist shares of three chinese state-owned phone carriers. the shares were to be removed under an order from president donald trump, a move beijing had warned might lead to retaliation.\n\nthe exchange cited further consultation with regulators but its announcement late monday gave no other details. china's foreign ministry on tuesday criticized washington for suppressing foreign companies but made no direct comment on the nyse announcement.\n\nthe nyse, a unit of intercontinental exchange, said last week it would remove china telecom, china mobile and china unicom hong kong under mr. trump's november order barring americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed to be linked to the chinese military.\n\ntensions ratcheting up\n\nthe order added to mounting u.s.-chinese tension over technology, security and spying accusations. the trump administration has imposed export controls and other sanctions on some chinese companies, visa curbs on members of the ruling communist party and other restrictions.\n\nthe suppression will have very limited impact on chinese companies, but it will damage the national interest and image of the united states, said a foreign ministry spokeswoman, han chunying. she expressed hope washington will do more to maintain the order of the global financial market and protect investors.\n\npolitical analysts expect little change in policy under president-elect joseph biden, who takes office jan. 20, due to widespread frustration with china's trade and human rights records and accusations of spying and technology theft.\n\ntrump's november order bars americans from investing in securities issued by companies deemed by the defense department to be part of efforts to modernize the communist party's military wing, the people's liberation army. the 2 million-member pla is one of the biggest and most heavily-armed militaries. it is spending heavily to develop nuclear submarines, stealth fighters, ballistic missiles and other advanced weapons.\n\ngrowing u.s. blacklist\n\nthe pentagon has added 35 companies to its blacklist. in addition to the phone carriers, they include telecom equipment giant huawei; china's biggest maker of processor chips; three state-owned oil producers; and construction, aerospace, rocketry, shipbuilding and nuclear power equipment companies.\n\ndespite the nyse's reversal on delisting the chinese telecoms, some wall street analysts think investors will sell their holdings in companies linked to the defense department's blacklist.\n\nhong kong-traded shares in the three phone carriers surged tuesday. china telecom rose 3.4%, china mobile jumped 5.7% and china unicom surged 8.5%. shares in all three have fallen recently.\n\n[w]e expect many investors to divest themselves of all companies related to entities on the dod's list to avoid any regulatory, compliance or legal actions/liabilities, analysts with height securities said in a note.\n\nthe chinese government has accused washington of misusing national security as an excuse to hamper competition and has warned that trump's order would hurt u.s. and other investors worldwide.\n\non saturday, the foreign ministry said beijing would take unspecified necessary countermeasures to protect its companies.\n\nthe government made the same announcement following previous u.s. sanctions without taking action.
extreme weather and natural disasters are among the most significant threats facing the world this year, according to a recent survey of global experts and decision-makers. hurricanes harvey, irma and maria -- along with 13 other major natural disasters -- caused more than $300 billion in damage last year. that's a new record for the u.s.\n\nthe research done at fm global research's 1,600-acre campus in northwestern rhode island is passed along to businesses so they and the communities they serve can bounce back faster after a disaster strikes.\n\ninside the facility's fire lab, one of the world's largest flames tears through two shelves stacked high with boxes. it looks like a catastrophe, but this is only a demonstration.\n\none shelf is protected by a sprinkler system that triggers moments into the test; the other is not.\n\na warehouse fire scenario is tested in fm global researxch's lab. one stack is protected by an automatic sprinkler, the other is not. cbs news\n\nthis feels like a furnace right now, said correspondent tony dokoupil.\n\nit is truly a wall of fire, said louis gritzo, who creates disasters regularly for his clients.\n\nso, what's the lesson?\n\nthe lesson here is, tested, installed and maintained protection works effectively, gritzo replied. one sprinkler, he said, would reduce a fire to a distraction, rather than a disaster.\n\ngritzo is research manager for insurance firm fm global. his team believes the only way to truly know how something will stand up to disaster is to put it through one.\n\nwe're in the business of protecting businesses from every hazard they can throw at them, so that's all the things that mother nature does and all the things that people do, he said.\n\nfm global uses these tests to show its clients -- including fortune 500 companies -- how they can better protect themselves. a better protected business is less risky to insure.\n\nthere are also takeaways for consumers. one machine can test shingles against hurricane-force winds. dokoupil watched during one test in which a roof was ripped off.\n\nthese roof shingles fail the wind machine test. cbs news\n\nso, what do you do to prevent a thing like that? he asked.\n\nuse a shingle that's designed for those higher wind speeds, gritzo replied. it's going to be stiffer. it's going to have a little more adhesive.\n\ndo you ever have clients that just don't believe it until you show it to them?\n\nseeing really is believing, gritzo responded.\n\nlast year certainly created believers. losses from hurricane harvey alone totaled $125 billion. historic flooding caused much of the damage.\n\nwe did a study last year with some worldwide experts and showed that in the u.s., the precipitation patterns are such that extreme precipitation -- in other words, when it rains, it's going to rain heavier -- is on the rise, gritzo said. and there's good sound physics and good sound data behind that.\n\nso, whatever the politics of climate change, the insurance and risk picture is pretty clear, said dokoupil.\n\nthe physics are clear, gritzo said.\n\nthe physics are also clear in this test of a 2x4 piece of lumber being shot out of a cannon, aimed at a half-inch sheet of plywood.\n\na one-half-inch sheet of plywood is no match for a 2x4 projected with a force comparable to hurricane-speed winds. cbs news\n\nplywood sheets are easy for one person to carry comfortably, so they're often used to protect the windows of businesses and homes during hurricanes.\n\nas gritzo demonstrated, you can see that this projectile, which is moving according to a storm that has about 100 mph wind speed -- went right through that half-inch piece of plywood.\n\nif there was a window behind it, this 2x4 would have smashed through the plywood and glass, exposing the inside to additional damage from wind and rain.\n\ndokoupil asked, so, the solution is, get a friend to help you pick up the one-inch plywood?\n\nwell, there's some different solutions. and if you really have to do it yourself and you have half-inch plywood, just put up two, gritzo said.\n\nas dokoupil witnessed, a 2x4 aimed at a one-inch thick piece of plywood just bounced off.\n\ngritzo says the one natural hazard they can't always protect against is an f-5 tornado, the strongest kind. one of the company's clients is a missouri hospital destroyed by an f-5 tornado in 2011. fm global says it paid that claim, and now the hospital has been rebuilt, with some lessons learned.
nearly three-fourths of american teenagers own smartphones — many filled with social media apps. thirty-one percent of teens are connected to friends they have not met in person, and 32 percent have been contacted online by a complete stranger, according to a pew research center survey.\n\nalabama's blount county district attorney pamela casey is raising awareness about smartphone dangers for children. casey joined cbs this morning to discuss the risks and how parents can protect their kids by changing the settings on their phones.\n\ncasey's interest in the subject began with an upset phone call from one of her friends whose daughter had been taking inappropriate photos.\n\nshe said she found them in a vault app which is basically like a calculator but you put in a certain pass code it took you to a vault that she had hidden all these photos that she had been sharing, casey said.\n\nthe mother told casey, you've got to tell everybody.\n\nscreenshots of a calculator vault app which uses a password to privately store photos and videos. cbs news\n\nso, she did. the district attorney made a video about it and it went viral.\n\nas a result of that it's become my new mission to educate parents, casey said.\n\ndespite that fact that she is in law enforcement, the district attorney admits it's hard for even her to keep up with the new technology.\n\nthere will always be a new app every day with the same dangers, casey said.\n\ncasey shared some of the risks associated with popular apps.\n\nan app called yellow, for example, allows users to find new friends and chat. casey calls it tinder for teens and noted the dangers of the default settings which share the user's location and phone number.\n\nyellow app cbs news\n\nlive.ly is a live video streaming app that also concerns casey because lets strangers view each other's videos and also allows users to share their location.\n\nlive.ly's parent company issued a statement that reads, we strongly encourage parents to review and adjust privacy settings.\n\nthere is an apple rating associated with every app to help determine whether it's safe for your child to use or not. for example, a 17+ rating means it's rated for people 17 years or older.\n\nhowever, casey warned, there's nothing that keeps you or makes you prove that you're 17 or older.\n\na lot of parents don't realize you can actually go into the iphone and turn off your child's ability to even download an app. you can turn off the camera and you can turn off installing.
a possible second run for president by sen. bernie sanders is being overshadowed by allegations of sexism and harassment during his 2016 campaign. former female staffers told the new york times they faced harassment and were paid less than their male colleagues.\n\nsanders was asked about the claims on cnn wednesday. he apologized and said if he runs again, they will do better. but he also said he was a little bit busy running around the country at the time.\n\ncbsn political contributor and democratic strategist lynda tran told cbsn's red and blue sanders' comments are tone deaf.\n\nat the end of the day, if it's your campaign, you're ultimately responsible and you're also responsible not only for the culture you set but what you do to respond to it, she said.\n\ntran said that if sanders runs for president again, he will be facing a vastly different democratic field compared to the race in 2016. in addition, he will have to contend with the #metoo movement and a historic year for female voters that brought more than 100 women to the house.\n\nbut both tran and republican strategist leslie sanchez said alleged sexism isn't unique to sanders' campaign. they also called harassment prevalent on both sides of the aisle.\n\nthere are not a lot of opportunities for sexual harassment training in these kind of start-up campaigns that are moving so rapidly. but it's something that would really be a dark contrast from corporate america, for example, or any other type of workplace environment. this is almost the last area where this taboo is still unchecked, said sanchez.\n\nshe pointed to a lack of women in leadership roles within campaigns.\n\nhowever, after the developments of the past two years, campaigns will be forced to address diversity within their ranks,\n\naccording to sanchez.\n\nthere's an understanding that having a broad perspective on gender, on diversity, ethnic diversity among others, is bringing value to highly competitive markets and campaigns, sanchez said.\n\ntran, meanwhile, said she doesn't believe the new york times report will be the last.\n\nnow that you're hearing stories like this, i think that we're going to see the curtain lifted on a number of other campaigns and experiences, tran said. ultimately, that serves the purposes of the movement to have these voices be heard and for people to take these allegations seriously so that we can change the way we treat people.
detroit — joe biden had a heated exchange with a construction worker who accused him of trying to take americans' guns away during a campaign stop in michigan, one of six states holding primaries on tuesday.\n\nthe former vice president was touring an assembly plant under construction for fiat chrysler, shaking hands with and praising the electrical workers union members who are building the plant. as biden was working the room, one man confronted him about his stance on gun ownership.\n\nyou are actively trying to end our second amendment right and take away our guns, the worker told biden.\n\nbiden replied: you're full of sh**.\n\ni support the second amendment. the second amendment — just like right now, if you yelled 'fire,' that's not free speech, biden continued. and from the very beginning — i have a shotgun, i have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge. my sons hunt. guess what? you're not allowed to own any weapon. i'm not taking your gun away at all.\n\nthe man repeated his accusation that biden was trying to take our guns, and biden pushed back. i did not say that. i did not say that.\n\nformer vice president joe biden exchanges words with a construction worker at an unfinished auto plant in detroit on tuesday, march 10, 2020. cbs news\n\nafter the worker told him that he had made the remark in a viral video, the former vice president replied that it's a viral video like the other ones they're putting out that are simply a lie.\n\nthis is not ok, alright? the man said, to which biden replied, don't tell me that, pal, or i'm going to go outside with you, man.\n\nyou're working for me, man! the worker said.\n\ni'm not working for you, biden said. don't be such a horse's ass.\n\nthe viral video the man mentioned appears to be a clip that has been inaccurately characterized by guns-rights groups and on social media in recent days. the clip was taken from a livestream by beto o'rourke, the former texas congressman and presidential candidate who endorsed biden last week. the video shows biden in a restaurant with o'rourke and amy sanders o'rourke, his wife. biden looks into the camera and praises o'rourke for his stance on gun control and climate change, and says he will recruit him to work in his administration if elected.\n\nand by the way, this guy can change the face of what we're dealing with, with regard to guns, assault weapons, with regard to dealing with climate change, and i just want — i'm warning amy, if i win, i'm coming for him, biden says in the video. the quote has been widely misconstrued to claim biden said, i'm coming for them.\n\ntuesday's remarkably candid exchange in detroit comes just a few hours before biden is scheduled to meet with the leaders of gun control organizations at a stop in columbus, ohio.\n\nbefore the argument, biden was greeted by hundreds of hooting-and-hollering ibew members excited to meet the democratic frontrunner.\n\nyou're the best damn workers in the world, biden said. i promise you if i become your president you will never have a better friend in the white house. i'm union from, as my — i won't say what my grandfather used to say — but from belt buckle to shoe sole, man.\n\neditor's note: an earlier version of this article quoted biden as saying, don't tell me that, pal, or i'm going to go out and slap you in the face. an alternate angle of the interaction shows biden instead said, i'm going to go outside with you, man.
while death and taxes may be two inevitabilities of life, some people like to push the envelope when it comes to the latter.\n\nprocrastinators live among us, given that about 20 percent of taxpayers wait until the last two weeks of the tax season to file their returns. the majority of americans tend to file early because of the anticipation of receiving their tax refund, said lisa greene-lewis, cpa and tax expert at turbotax. others, however, may have complicated tax issues or late-arriving tax forms that delay their ability to file, while some might simply put it off because they are worried or confused about the process.\n\nbut issues such as higher preparation costs and even more delays may come hand-in-hand with putting off tax preparation until the last minute. because the workload intensifies leading up to the filing deadline -- which is april 18 this year -- some certified public accountants will ask their procrastinating clients to file a tax extension. consumers relying on tax software programs or online filing will face higher costs than if they had filed earlier in the season.\n\nturbotax, for instance, ended its early season pricing on its online filing products on march 17, which means that consumers will now pay as much as 25 percent more for the same products. the company still offers its federal free edition, which is geared for consumers filing either the relatively simple 1040ez or 1040a forms, although turbotax said that is subject to change. turbotax's deluxe edition now costs $54.99 for federal returns, for instance, instead of the $34.99 before march 17.\n\nh&r block, meanwhile, appears to have kept its online and software prices steady. like turbotax, it also offers a free filing option for simple tax returns. still, many of those free filing options disappear later in the tax season, according to research from oppenheimer & co. cited by bloomberg news. h&r block didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nas for taxpayers who rely on accountants, there's the danger that your cpa may not have time to handle your returns the closer you wait until april 18. it's not all that unusual to file for an extension, since about 8 percent of all returns the irs receives are filed with the additional 6 months that the extension provides.\n\nas far as using an accountant, what i've seen, having worked for a cpa firm, they may (have) a deadline about when they want to see your tax documents because they get backed up, said greene-lewis. they may have a cut off where they put you on an extension.\n\nthere are a few issues to be aware of with extensions, such as the fact that payments are still due on april 18. that means people filing extensions will need a reasonable estimate of what they owe the tax agency by the deadline.\n\nyou should try to file as soon as possible, said greene-lewis, who noted that turbotax users can file up to 11:59 p.m. on the night of the tax deadline. people who rush at the last minute may leave something out or forget about tax deductions and credits, even though we do remind you. it's best to do everything earlier.
washington - volkswagen's (vlkay) top u.s. executive is resigning amid the automaker's ongoing emissions cheating scandal.\n\nvolkswagen group of america announced wednesday that president and ceo michael horn is leaving to pursue other opportunities effective immediately.\n\nhe had been with the german automaker for 25 years, assuming his most recent post in 2014. hinrich woebcken, chairman of volkswagen group of america, will take over as president and ceo of the unit on an interim basis.\n\nhorn's sudden departure comes as the company continues to grapple with the fallout from its admission last year that nearly 600,000 cars were sold in the u.s. with software that regulators say was designed to cheat on required emissions tests.\n\nthe company potentially faces more than $20 billion in fines from state and federal regulators, as well as hundreds of class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of angry vehicle owners. the justice department is also conducting a criminal investigation.\n\na federal judge is pressing volkswagen to say how it will ensure that nearly 600,000 of the german automaker's diesel cars don't violate u.s. clean air laws. u.s. district court judge charles r. breyer in california is overseeing hundreds of class-action lawsuits against the german automaker.\n\nvolkswagen says as many as 11 million cars worldwide have the software that enables them to cheat on tests. the company says it is working to fix the cars and to change its culture so that something similar does not happen again.
patients who take certain heartburn medications may be more likely to suffer recurrent bouts of a common superbug infection, a new study suggests.\n\nproton pump inhibitors, such as prilosec, prevacid and nexium, or so-called h2 blockers, such as zantac, pepcid and tagamet, were linked to a 50 percent increased risk of developing multiple clostridium difficile infections, researchers found.\n\nhowever, the study did not prove these heartburn medications cause recurrent c. difficile infections, just that an association appears to exist.\n\nand one specialist not involved with the study said the findings won't make him change his prescribing patterns.\n\nc. difficile can cause diarrhea and life-threatening inflammation of the colon. in the united states, about half a million people get sick from c. difficile each year. in recent years, these infections have become more common, more severe and more difficult to treat, according to the mayo clinic.\n\ngastric acid suppression medications are commonly prescribed and consumed over-the-counter for gastric reflux disease [gerd], peptic ulcer disease or functional dyspepsia, but they are also sometimes prescribed for unnecessary indications, which leads to overuse of these medications, said study lead researcher dr. sahil khanna. he's an assistant professor of medicine at the mayo clinic's division of gastroenterology and hematology in rochester, minn.\n\nrecurrent c. difficile infection is a major problem, with the risk as high as 50 to 60 percent in people having had three or more infections, khanna said.\n\nc. difficile most commonly affects older adults in hospitals or in long-term care facilities and typically occurs after use of antibiotics, he said.\n\nbut recent studies have shown increasing rates of infection among younger and healthier individuals without a history of antibiotic use or exposure to health care facilities, khanna said.\n\nhe speculated that the suppression of stomach acid might affect the bacteria living in the gut in these people, leaving the door open for c. difficile.\n\nit's also possible that those taking acid suppressors may be in worse health than those not taking them, which in turn might make them more susceptible to infections like c. difficile, khanna said.\n\nhe thinks the best way to prevent recurrent c. difficile infections in these patients is to curtail the misuse of these drugs.\n\npatients with c. difficile should be reevaluated to assess the necessity of using gastric acid suppression medications, khanna said.\n\nthe report was published online march 27 in the journal jama internal medicine.\n\none specialist not involved with the research doesn't think doctors or patients should be concerned about these findings.\n\nmy advice to patients is not to change anything and not be concerned — there are no warning signs or bells going off that would warrant any further discussion, said dr. david bernstein, chief of hepatology at northwell health in manhasset, n.y.\n\nbased on clinical experience, we don't see this as a problem, because so many people are on these drugs, bernstein said. i wouldn't change anything in what we do medically or tell patients based on what this meta-analysis found.\n\nto come to their conclusions, khanna and colleagues analyzed 16 studies that included more than 7,700 patients with c. difficile. among these, 20 percent developed recurrent infections.\n\nthis type of study is called a meta-analysis, because it tries to assess previously published studies in the hope of finding a common thread that can apply across all of them. the weakness of such a study is that it mixes findings developed using different approaches and tries to fit them together.\n\nthe researchers found that 22 percent of patients taking acid suppressors experienced recurrent c. difficile infections, compared with 17 percent among those not taking these drugs.
happy birthday, iphone. you're 10 years old! what do you want to be when you grow up?\n\nwhen steve jobs unveiled the first iphone 10 years ago today, he touted apple's ability to combine three products -- a revolutionary mobile phone, a widescreen ipod with touch controls, and a breakthrough internet communications device with desktop-class email, web browsing, searching and maps -- into one small and lightweight handheld device.\n\nthose characteristics are still in today's iphones, but they're so much more. think over 2 million apps more, changing everything from the way we commute to the way we communicate with family and friends. at the same time, it has spawned hundreds of copycats and created new industries that couldn't exist without phones. the iphone is the most successful consumer device ever created.\n\nthe original iphone (left) compared to the current iphone, the 7 plus. sarah tew/cnet\n\nso where does it go from here?\n\nfor apple, the next 10 years will be about refining and simplifying its hugely popular phone. whether the iphone remains a rectangular slab of glass for the next decade is anyone's guess (or, rather, up to chief designer jony ive). importantly, what will become an even bigger focus will be everything else that surrounds the iphone, like virtual reality and smart home.\n\niphone is an essential part of our customers' lives, and today more than ever it is redefining the way we communicate, entertain, work and live, apple ceo tim cook said in a statement posted in apple's online newsroom. iphone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started. the best is yet to come.\n\nhere are some of cnet's predictions:\n\nsimplicity\n\niphones used to celebrate just doing a few things well. now, ios and the iphone are endlessly complex. settings and hidden easter eggs lurk everywhere. managing cloud storage and photos, or navigating notifications and privacy will send you down rabbit holes.\n\napple could aim for simplicity once again, paring down the experience to something more essential. it might find a way of pushing only a few things to your attention while keeping the rest in the background. it needs to reinvent its design, even the software, to be less cluttered.\n\nand then there are all the phones. there used to be one iphone... now there are models in different sizes, colors and processors. one rumor has apple offering multiple display types next year.\n\nthe reality of the phone market is apple will have to continue to meet different budgets and lifestyles. there's no going back to that single original iphone.\n\nconnecting to everything\n\nthe iphone's already a hub for our fitness trackers, the apple watch and a growing world of smart home appliances and connected gadgets. the latest version of ios included smart home shortcuts built into the control panel, like a home-based remote control. imagine more of that spreading across more devices and services.\n\nit'll be able to talk to other gadgets more easily. bluetooth 5 promises greater range and higher speeds to connect to other peripherals. in a home, that could make a huge difference. a wild card could be wi-gig, an extremely high-bandwidth, short-range variation of wi-fi that could be a path to how future iphones could mirror instantly to larger screens or accessories.\n\ndeeper ai\n\namazon echo opened the door. talking to your gadget is now awesome, not annoying. siri, however -- which lives on nearly all apple devices -- is still problematic. it's not as responsive as amazon's alexa or as intuitive as google assistant. it should do more and understand context better.\n\na more ambient, helpful iphone is a necessary next step. consider assistant and how it lives on google's pixel phone, ready to help. ios 9 takes a few steps there, but expect apple to continue knitting together apps and services with ai and machine learning.\n\nthe interesting twist is the company's emphasis on doing its computations on-device, instead of in the cloud. that's a completely different approach than google and amazon, one rooted in privacy. apple's latest photos app smartly organizes photo libraries by faces and places and automatically knits together memory-reel trailers around themes. better siri and smarter ai aren't just what the iphone needs; it's what apple needs across the board.\n\ntotally port-free\n\nwe're all sad about losing the headphone jack. what about losing the rest? macbooks and iphones have shaved down their inputs to just a few options in 2016. next, perhaps, comes lightning.\n\ncharging, for iphones, still happens via the lightning cable. contactless charging -- the type that has been available for android phones for years, and is used by the apple watch, hasn't arrived yet. but when it does, perhaps in the iphone 8, that lightning cable will be a lot less necessary.\n\nwe already can transfer files locally via airdrop or stream via airplay. it would be shocking if apple followed up a headphone jack-free iphone 7 with a completely closed-off iphone 8, but someday there will be an iphone that flirts with going full wireless.\n\nall-screen\n\nthe iphone still has bezels, areas of the front of the phone where the screen doesn't extend. for instance, consider the area around the home button. samsung's recent phones have gone nearly edge-to-edge, and even wrapped the display around the sides. a bezel-free all-screen iphone would fill up more screen space in a smaller size for an easier grip. reports of touch id being integrated into the display would mean you'll just touch a part of the screen to log in or pay.\n\nthe cloud, the cloud\n\napple's relationship with cloud services feels overcomplicated. google and amazon offer lots of free storage and syncing options. with icloud, paying for the right storage tier can get pricey. relying on the cloud has become an answer for accessing files (there's an icloud drive folder, now) and photos. but how do photos and videos get managed properly? despite a growing number of alternative cloud-storage options, it's hard to keep things organized properly.\n\ncloud services are what's bringing mac os and ios closer together, sharing imessage, file storage, photos, notes and pages files. cloud services like those from google co-exist, sometimes beautifully, sometimes awkwardly. phones are, more than ever, just small terminals to a huge connected system. the iphone's going to be increasingly dependent on the cloud.\n\nar and vr\n\nsamsung has already turned its flagship phones into mobile virtual reality accessories via gear vr. google has the daydream headset and its cardboard initiative. apple, however, has stayed quiet on vr.\n\ninstead of thinking about a pair of phone-goggle accessories, consider the possibilities of a more advanced camera. google tango -- an augmented reality initiative under the same umbrella as daydream's vr -- uses depth-sensing 3d cameras to scan a room and help project imaginary things into it... or, track movement so that a vr headset could feel like it's really mapping motion. cook has stated his interest in augmented reality, which probably indicates that more advanced camera features could be where things go next.\n\nmuch like the iphone 7 plus can sense depth with its dual cameras, imagine more advanced cameras that can enable augmented reality like google tango. then imagine that these cameras could do power tracking for a vr headset, like the occipital bridge. maybe that's way too much in the weeds for apple, a company that seems to prefer sleek minimalism. but it's a short jump for the iphone to adopt ar or vr.\n\nthe original iphone came with 4gb of storage. james martin/cnet\n\nmoving past the phone itself\n\nthe biggest change in the iphone of 2027 is that it may not be a phone at at, at least not in the sense of the device we know today. what could be more vital about mobile computing over the next decade is what's around the phone. apple already envisions the iphone as the remote control for our lives; over the next 10 years, that remote will extend to things like vr and smart homes and cities.\n\nand much like the ipod got obliterated, the iphone may go the same way. phones may work like chromecasts, where devices pick up and stream based on what another tells it. or the apple watch can serve as the key to tying connected devices together. apple is already exploring cross-device communication; if your phone rings, so does your mac or ipad.\n\nthere's at least one vision of the future where the phone as a discrete device goes away and turns into other interfaces like wearables, jackdaw research analyst jan dawson said. input, output and the brains of a product will be less tied to a specific device over the years.\n\nthis article originally appeared on cnet.com.
a federal appeals court in california on friday initially blocked a centerpiece of the trump administration's network of restrictive policies at the southern border, ordering officials there to stop sending asylum-seekers to mexico, where tens of thousands of latin american migrants returned by the u.s. have been stranded for months.\n\nbut later on friday, the same court temporarily paused its own order, granting an emergency request filed by trump administration lawyers who rushed to defend the controversial migrant protection protocols (mpp) program.\n\nthrough its initial ruling, the 9th circuit court of appeals had prohibited the government from continuing to enforce the program, known as remain in mexico, finding that it is likely illegal. the decision was a major setback for the administration since officials have touted the program as one of the main reasons it curbed an unprecedented influx of central american families last year that overwhelmed officials and stations across the southern border.\n\nsince early 2019, the u.s. has required nearly 60,000 asylum-seekers to wait in mexico for the duration of their immigration court proceedings under this program, which has drawn scathing criticism from advocates. they believe the policy violates both domestic and international refugee law, pointing to the high levels of violence and insecurity in the areas of northern mexico where the u.s. has been sending migrants placed in the program.\n\nthe program's hours-long halt was a short-lived victory for the american civil liberties union (aclu), the group spearheading the legal challenge against the policy, and immigration advocates and lawyers, some of whom traveled to border checkpoints to see if any of their clients could get relief under the initial ruling.\n\nthis is a temporary step and does not change the fact that courts have ruled multiple times against this illegal policy. we will continue working to permanently end this unspeakably cruel policy, judy rabinovitz, the top aclu attorney in the case, said in a statement.\n\nimmigration lawyers working with the atlanta-based group lawyers for good government, attempted to inform hundreds of asylum seekers of their legal rights after they had been sent back to matamoros, as part of the trump administration's remain in mexico program. michael nigro/sipa via ap\n\nhours after the court's initial ruling early friday afternoon, u.s. citizenship and immigration services (uscis) asylum officers — who interview asylum-seekers in the remain in mexico program — were instructed in an email to immediately cease all mpp processing, including cases pending decision service. customs and border protection (cbp), the agency that places migrants in the remain in mexico program, also said it had issued a cessation of processing under the program.\n\non friday night, top cbp officials, including acting commissioner mark morgan, said the agency was reinstating the program.\n\nthis evening, with support of doj attorneys and cbp's declaration, the 9th circuit granted a stay of its earlier order enjoining mpp. @cbp will immediately reinstate mpp! — acting commissioner mark morgan (@cbpmarkmorgan) february 29, 2020\n\nin their initial order, which upheld a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge last spring, two circuit judges on a three-judge panel in san francisco appeared to share the concerns raised by advocates, writing that migrants returned to northern mexico risk substantial harm, even death, while they await adjudication of their applications for asylum.\n\nu.s. district judge william a. fletcher, who was appointed by president clinton, said in his majority opinion that the asylum-seekers and legal groups the aclu is representing are likely to succeed on their two main challenges to the policy: that it violates the non-refoulement principle in international and u.s. law of not returning asylum-seekers to places where they may face persecution, and that a 1996 law the administration has been citing to defend the legality of the program does not allow officials to return all asylum-seekers to countries that border the u.s. like mexico.\n\ncircuit judge ferdinand fernandez, an appointee of president george h. w. bush, dissented.\n\nofficials across the administration denounced the initial ruling on friday. the trump administration has acted faithfully to implement a statutory authority provided by congress over two decades ago and signed into law by president clinton, a justice department spokesperson said in a statement. the ninth circuit's decision not only ignores the constitutional authority of congress and the administration for a policy in effect for over a year, but also extends relief beyond the parties before the court.\n\nthough he called the first order reckless, acting homeland security secretary chad wolf said his department has other tools to maintain the end of catch and release, presumably referring to recently created rapid deportation programs, as well as deals with countries in central america's northern triangle that allow the u.s. to re-route asylum-seekers there.\n\nasylum seekers wash clothes on the mexican side of the rio grande at an immigrant camp on december 8, 2019 in the border town of matamoros, mexico. getty images\n\ndemocratic congresswoman veronica escobar, who represents the border district in el paso, praised the 9th circuit's initial decision. but she called for more than a halt to the policy. dhs must now follow the law, issue guidance for the nearly 60,000 asylum-seekers who have been returned to mexico, employ alternatives to detention, and guarantee the humane treatment of all asylum-seekers, escobar said in a statement.\n\nas a result of the mpp policy, tens of thousands of asylum-seekers from central america, cuba, venezuela and other latin american countries who would otherwise be in the u.s. are stranded in overcrowded shelters and squalid makeshift encampments in northern mexico, including in crime-ridden cities like ciudad juárez and matamoros, located in a region the u.s. government warns american travelers not to visit due to rampant violence.\n\nadvocates and even some of the asylum officers implementing the program have been withering in their criticism of remain in mexico, saying it violates international obligations against returning migrants seeking refuge to dangerous places. the group human rights first has denounced hundreds of reported kidnappings and assaults.\n\na cbs news series last summer detailed the due process concerns about the policy, which makes it extremely difficult for migrants to secure u.s.-based lawyers generally needed for successful asylum claims. according to data by researchers at syracuse university, only about 5% of migrants in the program have had lawyers represent them in proceedings in the u.s. — which, for many migrants, now occur inside makeshift tent-like courts in the rio grande valley.\n\nout of about 35,500 completed cases in the program, only 263 migrants have been granted asylum or some other form of protection, according to syracuse university's transactional records access clearinghouse (trac).\n\ndespite the criticism, the administration has defended the remain in mexico program as an effective tool in reducing border apprehensions, which have dropped for eight consecutive months since may.\n\nthe policy had been briefly blocked by a federal judge in april, but the 9th circuit ruled in may that the administration could proceed with the policy as it considered the merits of the legal challenge mounted by several advocacy groups. after the panel's decision, the administration dramatically expanded the program with the consent of the mexican government, which accepted the expansion last summer after mr. trump threatened to impose tariffs.\n\nin a separate ruling on friday, another panel in the 9th circuit upheld a lower court injunction that has blocked a rule that would render migrants who cross the border in between ports of entry ineligible for asylum.\n\nonce again the courts have recognized there is tremendous danger facing asylum seekers along the entire southern border, and that the administration cannot unilaterally rewrite the laws, said lee gelernt, the top aclu attorney in that case.
a brooklyn software developer has found himself in tornillo, texas, hoping to learn as much as he can about children held at a controversial detention center. it was opened last june as a way to accommodate what officials called a dramatic increase in kids who crossed the u.s. border alone.\n\nthe tornillo detention center will soon become the largest in a network of 100 shelters for migrant children. at its peak, more than 2,800 were housed there.\n\nwhen the family separation crisis gained national attention, 66-year-old joshua rubin made a few trips to tornillo. eventually he wanted to see what would happen if he stayed for an extended period of time and decided to camp out in an rv.\n\nafter nearly four months, he called the detention center a prison.\n\njoshua rubin outside the tornillo detention center. cbs news\n\nwhen i got here, you know, a lot of the employees would come out. they weren't supposed to talk to me, he said. they'd say, 'hey, they've got it great in there, you know? they're eating great. they get to play. they're warm. they got new clothes.' and, you know i would say, 'and can they leave?'\n\nit doesn't matter how much ice cream they give ya. it doesn't change that fact, he said.\n\nrubin said it's hard to know what goes on inside the detention center. it's obvious the kids are allowed to go outside to play soccer. but he said he sees other things that concern him.\n\ni also see them led around single-file. i also can see, with my binoculars, that a kid can't even go to the bathroom by himself without having a guard with him, rubin said.\n\nas cbs news toured the grounds outside the facility with rubin, a homeland security helicopter and two border patrol vehicles approached. rubin managed to talk to some of the kids through a fence, even though they were instructed not to talk to him. one boy said he had been there for four months, and another said six months.\n\ni'm not out here to say that they're not feeding them well, and they're not trying to take care of them, rubin said. but they're not providing the kind of mental health care that these kids need. they've been traumatized by their journeys from home, by the time spent in other detention centers and by interminably long stays here.\n\nmental health is a big concern for rubin.\n\nthey're in a situation where they have no choice. they're with people who tell them that they're treating them great and you know, it's a situation that they can't get out of, he said.\n\nrubin left the area on monday, since the detention center is closing. but others remain, vowing to stay until the center is completely shut down.\n\nrubin's activism is at the center of a documentary called the boys of tornillo.
netflix announced the biggest price hike in its history tuesday with subscriptions going up by 13 to 18 percent, meaning the most popular plan cost will now cost about $156 per year.\n\nnew netflix users are already being charged the higher prices but existing customers will see them phased in over the next few months. but as cbs news contributor and wired editor-in-chief nick thompson reports, subscription services like netflix don't seem to have trouble keeping customers, even after price hikes, which means they could keep coming.\n\nthe streaming giant has made big bets on lots of original programming to set itself apart from its competitors. the company's stock price soared almost $22 – to nearly $355 per share – reflecting wall street's belief the higher rates won't upset consumers.\n\nfrom tv shows like stranger things and orange is the new black to movies like bird box, netflix has been churning out hit after hit after hit. while all that original content draws in new subscribers, they also cost a lot of money to produce.\n\nits most expensive monthly plan now costs $16, compared to $12 for hulu, $9 for amazon prime video and $10 for cbs all access, offered by the parent company of cbs news.\n\nthis is the fourth price hike over the last five years and people keep paying, said financial analyst rick munarriz.\n\nnetflix is the world's largest premium video service, with nearly 150 million subscribers. its membership almost tripled since 2014 even though the price of its standard plan has gone up nearly 63 percent.\n\nit's a monthly plan, it is something that you sort of just set it and forget it like many other monthly subscription services. it's almost an afterthought when you're scouring your credit card bill and that $12.99 a month comes around. you're usually fine with it, munarriz said.\n\nmunarriz believes most customers will continue paying for netflix so long as the company keeps delivering hits.\n\nthere will come a point where people will say – 'no mas!' but until they get to that point, you're going to see netflix nickel and dime about every year or so and adjust their prices higher, munarriz said.\n\nin a statement, a netflix spokesman said, we change pricing from time to time as we continue investing in great entertainment.\n\nnetflix subscribers will get 30 days' notice via email before they start getting higher monthly bills.
taken together, 2017 and 2018 were the costliest years for weather-related disasters on record, with total losses of $653 billion, according to a new analysis\n\nthis year's devastating hurricanes in the u.s. -- florence, which hit the carolinas in september and michael, which roared through the florida panhandle the following month -- cost $15 billion and $17 billion, respectively, professional services firm aon said in a report that evaluates the impact of natural disasters. but they were dwarfed by 2017's hurricane harvey, which flooded houston and resulted in losses of $125 billion.\n\nhurricanes were only part of the natural disaster landscape described by aon. in the past year alone there were typhoons in japan and east asia, flooding in japan and china and drought in central europe. all told, the company tallied 394 significant natural catastrophes in 2018, costing a total of $225 billion.\n\nfourth-warmest year since 1880\n\nthe two-year whammy indicates that worse might come as the world's climate continues to change, with aon meteorologist steve bowen noting that catastrophe risks continue to evolve.\n\namong the causes raising those risks: shifts in population to vulnerable locations such as low-lying shorelines, as well as a changing -- and warming -- climate that is contributing to more volatile weather patterns, aon said.\n\ndating back to 1880, 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, according to the report.\n\nbowen might also have been referring to california, where drought, heat, high winds and untamed brush caused the state's deadliest and most destructive fire on record, according to aon. the camp fire destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and other structures in paradise, california, killing 88 people and resulting in $15 billion in losses. that and other california conflagrations charred 1.8 million acres in the state, a record.\n\nthere was some good news in aon's report. while 10,000 people died in natural disasters around the world in 2018, that loss of life ranked well below the average,. 2018 ranks among the lowest disaster-related fatality totals since 1950, the company concluded.
new york — a group of over two dozen curators at the american museum of natural history have objected to a museum trustee who is a donor to groups that challenge climate change.\n\nthe new york times reports that 28 curators at the new york city museum said in a jan. 19 letter to leadership they are concerned about rebekah mercer's donations to organizations they say challenge and politicize climate change science.\n\nnews of the internal letter comes after a group of 200 scientists and academics called for the removal of mercer from the museum board in an open letter last week.\n\nthe museum said in a statement that it does not make appointment decisions concerning trustees based on political views, and that funders do not shape curatorial decisions.
atlanta -- one of georgia's largest school systems plans to end its school security contract with the atlanta police department.\n\natlanta public schools is moving ahead with the plan despite warnings from atlanta mayor kasim reed that the move could have catastrophic consequences for children.\n\nthe school system is taking steps to form its own police force and replace the city police officers currently patrolling schools with officers directly accountable to the district.\n\nin a letter sent feb. 22, atlanta public schools operations chief larry hoskins notified the city that atlanta schools would terminate the contract effective june 30.\n\nthe school system's decision to end its contract with the city police department was beyond him, reed said recently.\n\neveryone knows aps is independent. they're expressing their independence. but i think they're going to make the children of the atlanta school system far less safe, reed said.\n\ndistrict officials suggested earlier this year the in-house department could cost more than the district's annual $5.6 million contract with the city, the atlanta journal-constitution reported. but district spokeswoman jill strickland said last week that the new department would not actually cost more, and it was unclear why the cost estimates changed, the newspaper reported.\n\natlanta police spokeswoman elizabeth espy said in a statement to the journal-constitution that the department will work with the school system to make sure the change is a smooth one.\n\nthe atlanta police department's priority is to protect city residents and visitors, which includes students in the atlanta public schools, espy said. we will work with aps to ensure a smooth transition so that student safety continues to be our focus, regardless of our physical presence in the schools.
a new study finds the world's oceans are warming significantly faster than previously thought. the analysis, published thursday in the journal science, raises the stakes for curbing climate change.\n\nsince 1970, the ocean has warmed 40 percent more than previous estimates, according to climate scientist zeke hausfather, one of the authors of the study.\n\nthe study examined four new or updated ocean heat content records — a fancy term for measuring how warm the ocean is, taking into account deeper water, not just surface temperatures — and finds the ocean warming is significantly higher than estimated in the last comprehensive report by the u.n.'s intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) in 2013.\n\nninety-three percent of the excess heat trapped in the earth's system by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions is stored in the oceans. if it weren't for this ocean buffer absorbing so much heat, our atmosphere would be roasting us by now.\n\naccording to kevin trenberth, a senior scientist from the national center for atmospheric research and co-author of the study, the increase in ocean heat content observed since 1992 is about 2,000 times the total electricity generation by u.s. utility companies in the past decade.\n\nthat heat build-up has a debilitating impact on many aspects of ocean life. coral reefs are a good example.\n\ncoral is very sensitive to increases in water temperature. when the water is too warm the corals bleach, turning white. a 2016 study estimates that 98 percent of coral reefs worldwide will experience bleaching-level stress each year by 2050.\n\nbleaching can eventually lead to death of the reef community, turning them into ghost reefs. since 25 percent of all life in the ocean depends on coral reefs, this loss has a ripple effect on the ecosystem.\n\nwarmer water also holds less carbon dioxide, meaning more heat-trapping gas escapes back into the atmosphere, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop of perpetuated warming.\n\nand that's just the tip of the iceberg, literally. warm water hastens the rate of glaciers melting, and expands the water column, and together the two phenomena raise sea levels. by 2100 the ipcc estimates sea levels may rise 2 to 3 feet, and some studies say more. the destabilizing effects of this on society are incalculable.\n\nthe most dramatic effect of warmer water is the impact we already feel most directly: extreme weather. a warmer ocean means stronger hurricanes and heavier flooding events.\n\nfor example, it's estimated that rainfall from hurricane harvey was 15 percent to 38 percent greater because of climate change. as the ocean and air warms, extreme flooding events will increase.\n\nlast friday 8/25 the gpm satellite measured heavy rainfall in hurricane #harvey as it moved towards the texas coast https://t.co/1blapbnstw pic.twitter.com/gmzr0ouazv — nasa precipitation (@nasarain) august 28, 2017\n\na well-cited study by highly respected noaa climate modeler tom knutson shows that by late this century the number of category 4 and category 5 hurricanes may increase by 42 percent in the atlantic basin and over 300 percent in the eastern pacific. this is due to warmer water which acts as high-octane fuel to power storms. stronger storms mean exponentially more damage.\n\nbecause the oceans are so large and less variable than the atmosphere, it makes ocean heat content a much better gauge for the pace of global warming.\n\ntrenberth says, the warmer ocean is the memory of the past climate change and the ocean heat content is breaking records every year.\n\nunlike the surface temperature record which can vary dramatically from year to year, the ocean heat content record acts a bank and steadily accumulates heat. so, if the earth is trapping excess heat, the ocean heat content record will tick upward, with no ambiguity.\n\nand that is where this study lays to rest a misconception about whether there was a global warming hiatus between 1998 and 2013. if you look at a short-term snippet of the surface temperature record, one could conclude that warming was negligible during that 15-year period. those skeptical of climate change often refer to this to poke holes in the evidence.\n\nbut in this new analysis, the authors of the study say, although climate model results have been criticized during debates about a 'hiatus' or 'slowdown' of global mean surface temperature, it is increasingly clear that the pause in surface warming was at least in part due to the redistribution of heat within the climate system.\n\nin other words, the oceans were just hiding the heat and now new tools have enabled scientists to find it.\n\nthe broader point i was trying to make is that unlike in the case of surface temperature, ocean heat content has increased fairly smoothly, with no decadal-scale slowdowns or hiatuses. you can see this clearly in the cheng et al data, for example: pic.twitter.com/lffulk4qcu — zeke hausfather (@hausfath) january 10, 2019\n\nthe improvement in the four new datasets examined in this study is due partially to new analysis methods and partly due to the development of a vast network of ocean sensors called argo. it's a global array of nearly 4,000 temperature and salinity profiling floats measuring temperatures as deep as 2,000 meters down.\n\nthe study also lays to rest a long-standing discrepancy in the climate science community, namely the question of why climate models over-project ocean heating. according to this new study, it turns out they don't.\n\nthe new measure of actual ocean heat matches almost perfectly the average projection from the best coupled ocean-atmosphere models (cmip5). by this metric, the climate models are performing very well. it gives climate scientists and the public greater reason for confidence in future projections.\n\nthis study is a reminder that the state of our oceans is the best bellwether of our changing climate. and the evidence shows our current climate is changing much faster than at any time in human history.

the trump administration has faced criticism over the availability of coronavirus test kits in the united states. vice president mike pence has said any american would be able to get tested for the disease it causes, covid-19 — but acknowledged this week, as the government raced to distribute tests, that the capacity wasn't there yet.\n\nso what should someone do if they want to get tested?\n\naccording to the american hospital association, people who think they have the coronavirus should call their physician to see if a test is warranted. if so, they will direct you to an appropriate testing site.\n\nclinicians should use their judgment to determine if a patient has signs and symptoms compatible with covid-19 and whether the patient should be tested, reads the cdc's website.\n\nthe cdc guidance urges doctors to consider local epidemiology — who the person came in contact with and their travel history — as well as a patient's symptoms. it also strongly encourages them to test for other causes of respiratory illness, such as the flu, before moving forward with a coronavirus test.\n\nthat guidance may evolve as the virus is better understood.\n\naccording to dr. rochelle walensky, chief of infectious disease at massachusetts general hospital, someone could potentially have the coronavirus and the flu at the same time.\n\nwhat we don't know is about people who are asymptomatic ... where in the course of the disease does it turn negative, and where does it turn positive, walensky said.\n\ntesting for the virus involves both a nasopharyngeal (nose) and oropharyngeal (mouth) swab, which provide labs with upper respiratory tract specimens. the cdc also recommends – though does not require — that health care providers collect lower respiratory tract specimens — sputum or phlegm — if available.\n\nthe time it takes to get results varies.\n\ntest results processed by the cdc initially took four to five days due to constraints on personnel and the number of tests available, according to walensky. now, she said, the turnaround from the cdc is usually one to two days.\n\nhow long it takes to get results from other labs depends on where tests are conducted.\n\ntesting in california, where the most cases of covid-19 have been confirmed in the united states, takes about 48 hours, according to the california department of public health. cdc kits are already being used by 11 public health labs in california, and will expand to 20 labs in the coming weeks, the department said thursday.\n\ndr. sarah turbett, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at massachusetts general hospital, said labs in massachusetts are able to determine results within 24 hours.\n\nin washington, where 13 people have died from coronavirus, testing is taking place daily at the state's public health laboratory. according to the washington state department of health, the laboratory performed 209 tests for 91 people as of wednesday.\n\nas of friday, 245 people had tested positive for covid-19 in the united states — a figure that could jump as more people are tested.\n\nthe availability of tests is expected to jump within the next few weeks as the cdc sends out a new batch and independent manufacturers ramp up production.\n\nan initial coronavirus test distributed by the centers for disease control and prevention had a faulty reagent that prompted labs to report problems, delaying testing across the country. for one month, the cdc was one of only a handful of labs able to run a diagnostic test, according to the association of public health laboratories.\n\nreporters pressed secretary of health and human services alex azar thursday on why the u.s. response hasn't matched that of countries like south korea, which has a large outbreak and has tested over 100,000 people.\n\nazar said more production will put availability of testing in the u.s. far ahead of similarly impacted major countries around the world.\n\non friday, azar said as many as 4 million tests will be sent to public health labs, the private sector, and hospitals by next week.\n\nthe cdc sends kits to laboratories designated as qualified by the cdc, according to its website. these include u.s. state and local public health laboratories, department of defense laboratories and select international laboratories.\n\nazar added that integrated dna technologies, idt, a manufacturer that works with the cdc, will make a million of its own tests available by the end of next week.\n\nhe also noted that an fda policy change that allows cdc-qualified labs to create its own tests before the fda has completed its review will radically expand availability of tests.\n\none such lab, quest diagnostics, said in a press release thursday that it would be able to provide testing as early as monday.\n\nthe new service is expected to employ respiratory specimens collected in appropriate health care settings, such as hospitals and physician offices, reads the statement. ... patients suspected of, or confirmed to have, covid-19 should consult with a physician regarding the best way to provide a specimen for testing by quest.\n\nit's unclear which states and facilities will receive the new tests. right now… it is a challenge if you are a doctor wanting to get somebody tested, said azar.\n\non friday, azar said washington and california have received all the tests they've requested.\n\nby this weekend, that broad network of hospitals, other labs, will be receiving from idt those million tests that we referred to… so that experience will get better within the next week, week and a half, two weeks, he said.\n\nbut do not be surprised if you hear concerns of doctors saying 'i have a patient i don't know how to get this done.'\n\nwith more tests will come better data.\n\nwe're only testing people who are the sickest so it does make the mortality rate look quite high, turbett said.\n\nan uptick in testing could be a double-edged sword, walensky said. the mortality rate will likely go down, but the number of confirmed cases could also go up.\n\ni sort of like to think about it as turning the lights on, she said.
a campaign that started more than two years ago and featured more than 2,200 candidate events is down to its final weekend in iowa. on monday night, iowa will officially kick off the presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses.\n\nthere has been a clear top tier of democratic hopefuls in iowa since the early fall: former vice president joe biden, former south bend mayor pete buttigieg, vermont senator bernie sanders and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren. two of those candidates, sanders and warren, have been stuck in washington for the impeachment trial the past two weeks, while biden and buttigieg have been able to camp out in the state. senator amy klobuchar, who has also been in washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months.\n\nall the major candidates are blanketing the state this weekend and making their closing arguments to fire up supporters and try to win over some of the voters still trying to make up their minds.\n\nread more here.\n\nthe democratic candidates' closing iowa arguments\n\nbernie sanders\n\nbernie sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in january. while he has been one of the candidates stuck in washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like representative alexandria ocasio-cortez, filmmaker michael moore, and sanders' wife, dr. jane sanders. the vermont senator has spent some of his final days in iowa stressing that his political revolution can begin here.\n\nthe entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back, sanders said in storm lake on sunday, according to cbs news campaign reporter cara korte. he has also emphasized that the democratic establishment is worried about the strength of his movement. we are their worst nightmare! this is their 'nightmare on elm street,' sanders said in sioux city on sunday, korte reports.\n\nif sanders is successful on monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class americans. the campaign also has an aggressive ground game in iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come caucus night.\n\njoe biden\n\njoe biden has spent months making the case to iowans, in person and in advertisements, that he's best suited to take on president trump in a general election and restore the soul of the nation. in the days leading up to the caucuses, advertisements have emphasized biden's poll numbers against trump and stressed that this is no time to take a risk. we need our strongest candidate.\n\nbiden has repeatedly said the values that uphold american democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them.\n\ncharacter is on the ballot, biden said in waukee on thursday in a speech aimed at president trump, according to cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson. does it matter if a president lies? does it matter if a president has no moral compass? does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? does it matter if a president is petty? mean? cruel? spiteful? does the character of a president matter? i believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes.\n\nbiden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son hunter to sit on the board of a ukrainian energy company. they have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far, biden said in iowa city on monday. and i'm just gonna say it...i'm still standing and just getting stronger. biden also ramped up his visits to iowa in december and january while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities.\n\nif biden is successful on monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating mr. trump. while many important issues come up in conversations with iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. the biden campaign hopes those iowans will turn out for the former vice president.\n\npete buttigieg\n\npete buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including future former republicans. buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for president obama before switching to mr. trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in iowa's pivot counties.\n\nthe midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside washington for democrats to win in november. he also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. and in the final days before the iowa caucuses, buttigieg began to draw finer distinctions between himself and some of his top rivals.\n\ni hear vice president biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, buttigieg said in decorah on thursday, according to cbs news reporter jack turman. but history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like donald trump, who is new in kind.\n\nat another stop, turman reports, buttigieg again went after biden and sanders. he framed sanders' vision as a revolution where nothing counts unless you go all the way. buttigieg took on two of sanders' signature policy proposals: medicare for all, the ambitious and expensive plan for the government to provide health care to all americans, and free public college.\n\nif buttigieg prevails on monday, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. the campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. he also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state.\n\nelizabeth warren\n\nelizabeth warren, who has also been tied up with the impeachment trial, has sent a flood of surrogates to the state, including former democratic rival julian castro. she built up an early operation in iowa, but has seen poll numbers dip since the fall. at events in iowa last weekend, warren addressed the electability argument head on and stressed that she believes democrats need to nominate a woman to beat mr. trump.\n\nwe now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since donald trump was elected, warren said in davenport on sunday, according to cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak. warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she's a fighter who can defeat mr. trump and deliver progressive victories in washington.\n\nwe have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back, warren said on saturday in muscatine. me, i'm fighting back. that's why i'm in this.\n\nif warren is successful on caucus night, it will be partly due to her organizing strength in the state. her team built a large operation early in the process and deployed organizers around the state before many campaigns built out their iowa infrastructure. her broad range of policy proposals has resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views.\n\namy klobuchar\n\namy klobuchar has pitched herself as a candidate with a strong electoral record and midwestern roots. at nearly every event she has told people that she has won every race, every place, every time and talks about the surge she sees in iowa in polls and her endorsements.\n\nshe has emphasized that she believes the election is a decency check on mr. trump and in order to send a strong message, democrats need to win big. last thing that i will say is just that we want to win, klobuchar said in waterloo on sunday. and my profound advice to you is we'd better not screw this up. and we better put someone at the top of the ticket, and this is my piece for me, someone at the top of the ticket that has the record of bringing people with her and winning big.\n\nwhile she's been in washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. and she's told undecided iowans to call friends and family in minnesota for a performance review.\n\nif klobuchar is successful on monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. she has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of iowa's 99 counties.\n\nandrew yang\n\nandrew yang is approaching the end of a of a 17-day swing across iowa. yang has been campaigning on a message that a changing economy requires a different perspective in washington to ensure americans aren't left behind. he's promised that a win in iowa will also mean a victory in new hampshire.\n\ntom steyer\n\ntom steyer has presented himself as the unconventional politician who can go head-to-head with president trump on the economy. steyer also points to his work building grassroots coalitions and reminds iowans at nearly every town hall that he's the only candidate who will make tackling climate change his number one priority.\n\nup for debate\n\nthe democratic national committee is switching the qualifications for candidates to participate in the nevada democratic presidential primary debate, including eliminating the unique donor threshold, which paves the way for mike bloomberg to potentially qualify for future presidential debates.\n\nto make the debate stage in las vegas on february 19, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says candidates need to meet either a new polling threshold or received pledged delegates. presidential hopefuls must receive either 10% in four state or national polls or 12% in two state polls out of either nevada or south carolina from a list released by the dnc. those polls must be released between february 15 and 11:59 p.m. et on february 18.\n\nalternatively, candidates can qualify based on pledged delegates. those delegates will be awarded based on the results of the iowa caucuses on february 3 as calculated and reported by the iowa democratic party or the new hampshire primary on february 11 as calculated and reported by the associated press.\n\nbased on a cbs news analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: joe biden, bernie sanders and elizabeth warren. all candidates have until february 18 to qualify.\n\nfor the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to help candidates qualify for the debate. this could benefit billionaire mike bloomberg who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. the requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past. he has not yet reached the polling threshold but has ticked up in support in polls released in recent weeks.\n\nwe are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see mike bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat donald trump and bring our country together, bloomberg's campaign manager kevin sheekey said in a statement. mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. he is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.\n\nother campaigns including sanders' and steyers' have slammed the decision to remove a donor qualification, calling it wrong.\n\nread more here.\n\nbiden takes note of timing in bolton manuscript\n\nformer national security adviser john bolton's book manuscript has piqued the interest of joe biden, who mentioned it today at a campaign stop in fort madison, iowa, cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson noted. it's the timing that caught his attention. according to a new york times report, in early may last year, president trump told bolton to call the ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had just won the presidency, in order to ensure that he'd meet with the president's personal attorney, rudy giuliani.\n\njust about an hour and twenty minutes before the senate voted not to call witnesses, including bolton, biden told the crowd that he was in the race in may, and according to the transcript, the president instructed bolton to go to the ukrainians and try to dig up dirt on joe biden. (h/t cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro). the former vice president was likely referring to the fact that it's giuliani who has been alleging and investigating, on mr. trump's behalf, corruption allegations of joe and hunter biden related to ukraine. no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either biden has surfaced.\n\nearlier this week, the times reported that bolton had written in his book draft that the president had told him in august that he wanted to continue the pause in military aid to ukraine until officials helped with investigations into democrats including biden.\n\nbiden declared he was running for president on april 25, days before the meeting described by bolton.\n\nstate-by-state\n\nnevada\n\ncory booker's former supporters are picking new favorites in nevada this week, among the new endorsements rolled out friday by the elizabeth warren and joe biden campaigns. included are two women of color in the state: state assemblywoman selena torres, now backing biden, and reno-sparks naacp president patricia gallimore, now behind warren. cbs news campaign reporter alex tin says a quarter of the nevada's democratic electorate is estimated to be women of color, with 22% of likely caucus-goers in the demographic still undecided in a recent poll by advocacy group she the people in the state. biden and bernie sanders virtually tied for the lead in the survey, with only warren (10%) and tom steyer (14%) also clearing double digits.\n\nmoney matters\n\nspending spree\n\nformer new york mayor mike bloomberg filed his fourth-quarter fec report. although he was late entering the democratic field, launching at the end of november, his campaign spent nearly $188 million, including over $140 million dollars on television and digital advertising says cbs news campaign reporter tim perry.\n\nour first month's filing represents a down payment and commitment in all 50 states to defeat donald trump, and it shows we have the resources and plan necessary to take him on, bloomberg 2020 campaign manager kevin sheekey said in a statement released by the campaign.\n\nother expenses include $14 million in payments to his private company bloomberg lp. a campaign aide tells cbs news that these expenses include air travel, as mayor bloomberg travels on a plane owned by bloomberg lp and it also includes personnel costs, for employees who switched over to bloomberg's presidential campaign. hawkfish llc, a tech start-up launched by bloomberg also received $12 million for its advertising work for the campaign. the campaign also disclosed $679,000 in spending for some campaign staffers living in new york city, the location of the campaign headquarters. housing and furniture were offered to some staffers who relocated to the city, regardless of seniority. the campaign listed the merchandise it sold as other receipts, saying that the products were union-made in the usa, and priced at cost.
when the vice president of the united states presides over the counting of the electoral college votes and announces the final tally and winner of the election, it's usually little more than a formality. but this year, president trump's refusal to accept his loss to joe biden — and the willingness of many republican lawmakers to indulge him — has teed up a tense day in the capitol.\n\nit's vice president mike pence who's tasked with this duty on wednesday for the pro forma joint session of congress. tellers will read each state's tally aloud, and at any point, members may object to that state's votes. it takes one senator and one house member to trigger consideration of an objection. the senate and the house then debate the objection separately and vote on whether to accept the state's ballots.\n\nhere are some of the claims viewers may anticipate — and whether they stand up to scrutiny.\n\nclaim: some states failed to follow their own state election laws — gop senator josh hawley of missouri\n\nfact check: this has been argued in lawsuits that have been denied by numerous state and federal courts.\n\nhawley was the first senator to announce his intention to object to the electoral vote count. he was soon followed by senator ted cruz and a group of 10 other senators who are also threatening to reject the outcome of the election.\n\ni cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on january 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws, hawley said in a statement.\n\nin november, a trump-appointed judge rejected a trump campaign lawsuit that claimed pennsylvania's secretary of state and some counties restricted poll watchers and allowed voters to fix technical issues with mail-in ballots.\n\nthe campaign's claims have no merit, wrote judge stephanos bibas in his decision. the number of ballots it specifically challenges is far smaller than the roughly 81,000-vote margin of victory. and it never claims fraud or that any votes were cast by illegal voters.\n\ncritics of pennsylvania's election process also contended that pennsylvania's gop-controlled legislature didn't follow the proper procedures in extending absentee voting to all residents. in late november, the pennsylvania supreme court dismissed a lawsuit brought by republicans that sought to invalidate all no-excuse mail ballots in the state. in december, the a request from republican allies of president trump to decertify pennsylvania's election results.\n\nclaim: mega corporations, including facebook and twitter interfered in the election — gop senator josh hawley of missouri\n\nfact check: charge lacks context.\n\nthe missouri republican also claimed big social media companies interfered in the 2020 presidential election.\n\ni cannot vote to certify without pointing out the unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including facebook and twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of joe biden, his statement reads. at the very least, congress should investigate allegations of voter fraud and adopt measures to secure the integrity of our elections. but congress has so far failed to act.\n\ntwitter has labeled the president's tweets as disputed, but has not deleted the president's tweets. on facebook, the posts that perform the best each day are consistently mostly those from conservative websites. mr. trump himself often has some of the most-viewed posts on the internet.\n\nbut social media companies have the right to label posts, as twitter and facebook have done for mr. trump's posts.\n\nhawley has not been specific about his charges against facebook and twitter. but as far as election integrity goes, the cybersecurity & infrastructure security agency (cisa), which is charged with election security, declared that the 2020 presidential election had been the most secure in american history, and stated, there is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised.\n\nwhile we know there are many unfounded claims and opportunities for misinformation about the process of our elections, we can assure you we have the utmost confidence in the security and integrity of our elections, and you should too, cisa's statement concluded.\n\nclaim: some states' results are still disputed — gop senator ted cruz, of texas, and other republican senators\n\nfact check: false. states have certified their results.\n\ncruz's group, which is working separately from hawley, has called for a 10-day audit of states that it says are still disputed.\n\nwe intend to vote on january 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, the group said in a statement.\n\ncongress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states, reads the statement. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nthe senators say they are trying to restore faith in our democracy, due to claims of voter fraud. but all of the states have certified their election results, so they are not disputed.\n\nmr. trump's legal team has not been able to provide evidence of voter fraud in numerous lawsuits challenging the election results, and has exhausted its timeframe to challenge the election.\n\nclaim: voting machines were tampered with. dominion voting systems voting software company moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts. — president trump\n\nfact check: false\n\nthe president reiterated a conspiracy theory about dominion voting systems on a call with georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger over the weekend, alleging that the voting software company moved the inner parts of the machines and replaced them with other parts.\n\na dominion spokesperson said in a statement provided to cbs news in november that the company categorically denies any claims about any vote switching or alleged software issues with our voting systems. election authorities have publicly affirmed the company's statement. and this week, top georgia election official gabriel sterling, who is charged with the implementation of georgia's voting systems, called the claim not real.\n\nno one is changing parts of pieces out of dominion voting machines. that's — i don't even know what that means, it's not a real thing. that's not happening. the president mentioned it on the call. ... that's, again, not real, sterling said during a press conference dismantling numerous claims.\n\nthis is all easily, provably false. yet the president persists, sterling said, adding that such claims undermine faith in the voting system — the same system being used in georgia's crucial senate runoff elections.\n\nclaim: the vice president has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors. — president trump\n\nfact check: false\n\nbeyond the charges that republicans will be raising, president trump is also arguing that vice president pence can make his own decisions about the electors. on tuesday, he tweeted that the vice president has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors. he made the claim after telling supporters at a georgia rally monday that he hopes pence comes through for us on the electoral college tally.\n\nbut the vice president does not have the power to reject any state's electors. the vice president only has the power to preserve order in the joint session and preside over it as the president of the senate. the results will be delivered to the vice president, who is the president of the senate, but he does not have the power to reject electors or change the outcome of the electoral college count.\n\nmr. trump is expecting something of pence that the vice president lacks the authority to execute.
in september 2016, grapevine, texas, police responded to a gruesome discovery in a park. jackie vandagriff, a 24-year-old college student, had been found murdered.\n\npolice soon uncovered video of a man she was last seen with at some college bars in denton, texas.\n\njackie had just met him that night, but caitlin mathis already knew him well. mathis had dated charles bryant in that past summer and had recently broken things off.\n\nhe was just trying to win me back and i was just like, nothing is going to work, she told cbs news correspondent jim axelrod.\n\nin the weeks leading up to jackie's death, bryant kept showing up on caitlin's campus in denton and was arrested three times. she had also filed a restraining order against him.\n\nthis history made bryant a good suspect for jackie vandagriff's murder, but police didn't have enough evidence to arrest him right away. but shortly after jackie's body was found, he tried to contact caitlin again—which was a violation of that restraining order. he was brought in for questioning.\n\nat first bryant denied knowing who jackie was. but texas ranger jim holland, who specializes in interviewing serial killers, thought he might be able to get bryant to confess. holland got bryant to admit he had been with jackie that night, but he wouldn't admit to murder – claiming she had died accidentally after a consensual sexual encounter.\n\nit's a total fabrication, said holland. ranger holland believes bryant did kill jackie intentionally and it was all triggered by his feelings for caitlin.\n\ni think that he really wanted to kill me. i think that he wanted me dead, said mathis.\n\na gruesome discovery\n\njohn luna ([n the park]: when i first arrived on the scene, i saw a lot of police cars, saw fire trucks. there was a lot of activity.\n\nit was september 14, 2016, just before dawn, when john luna, a captain with the grapevine police department, responded to a call about a gruesome discovery at grapevine lake.\n\ncapt. john luna [in the park]: just off of the worn footpath, you have an area that's pretty well overgrown with weeds, but you can clearly see a small area that was burned just beyond where i'm standing … there was a – body that was obviously charred. it had been set on fire …\n\nthe body, found inside a blue kiddie pool, was so badly damaged that police could not determine the most basic facts about the victim.\n\ncapt. john luna: we didn't know if that was an adult or a child, male or female.\n\nthe next day, using fingerprints, police were able to identify the victim. it was jackie vandagriff, a 24- year-old nutrition major at texas woman's university in nearby denton.\n\njackie vandagriff instagram\n\njackie home video: i chose this major … because i realized the importance of nutrition in just overall health.\n\njackie ton was one of jackie vandagriff's closest friends. they met in high school.\n\njackie ton: we're both named jacqueline … after jacqueline kennedy. ever since then we were jackie squared and i loved it. …she made me feel like i could be myself and just be goofy and funny.\n\njackie ton remembers her friend as a good student who was focused and trusting.\n\njackie ton: that girl, smartest girl i've known [emotional].\n\ncapt. john luna: she had her whole life ahead of her. she had plans. … me and my detectives, we went out there for her memorial service [cries]. sorry.\n\nfor captain luna, the brutality of this crime hit close to home.\n\ncapt. john luna: it could have just as easily been my daughter that this happened to.\n\njackie spent the last evening of her life in denton with a man. police didn't know his identity right away, but one woman knew him very well.\n\ncaitlin mathis: he would always give me flowers – always. especially if he had something to be sorry about.\n\ncharles bryant lived some 20 miles away, but he had been making frequent visits to denton, trying to rekindle a relationship with his ex-girlfriend, caitlin mathis, who had recently moved there to attend the university of north texas.\n\ncaitlin mathis: he was just trying to win me back and i was just like, nothing is going to work.\n\ncaitlin's involvement with bryant had begun three months earlier, in june, in the town of grapevine, when he came into the restaurant where caitlin was working as a server.\n\ncaitlin mathis: the day that i met him was the day after i graduated high school. … he had lots of muscles and tattoos, which kind of interested me at the time.\n\nbryant was then 29, working as a bartender and a personal trainer.\n\ncatlin mathis was 18 years old when she met charles bryant, a personal trainer and bartender, in june 2016. caitlin mathis\n\njim axelrod: you're 18. he's 29. he's got muscles and tattoos and must've made your mother crazy.\n\ncaitlin mathis: yeah. extremely crazy … in a good way though, yeah … she cared about me.\n\nkaren hulsey: being a mother of adult children is a different role. … you have to let go for them to fly away and grow up.\n\ncaitlin is the youngest of karen hulsey's four children. she says caitlin was hard to miss.\n\nkaren hulsey: a fireball. like, you know when she's in the house. … she never walked anywhere. she ran everywhere.\n\nand caitlin ran headlong into the relationship with charles bryant that summer of 2016. one of their regular date spots was at the park by grapevine lake. when karen learned about the relationship, she asked caitlin to show her a picture of him.\n\ncharles dean bryant facebook\n\nkaren hulsey: i got this feeling just deep inside to my bones, an evil feeling. and … i said, he's going to hurt you. he's going to do something bad\n\njim axelrod: wow.\n\nkaren hulsey: and she's like, oh, he's nice. he's good to me. … he makes me feel like an adult.\n\njim axelrod: were you're thinking to yourself, you're 18. you're too young to know.\n\nkaren hulsey: yes. but i didn't want to insult her.\n\nwithin weeks, caitlin was having serious doubts of her own about bryant.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i started to see these warning signs that he was manipulative, he was a bit of a narcissist. … he thought very highly of himself. … he would say things like, oh, you'll never find anyone better than me. … it was just toxic, and he was toxic.\n\nin mid-august 2016, caitlin broke up with bryant. she thought that was the last she'd see of him, but the next day, he showed up, uninvited, at her mother's house.\n\ncaitlin mathis: and somehow, he convinced me to get back with him. … he was trying to say, oh, i can work on this and … i can be better and making all these promises.\n\nbut caitlin realized she wasn't interested in promises.\n\ncaitlin mathis: that was one of the things that my mom taught me … people do not change. you can't change someone. … at that point, i was just waiting for the perfect time to end things.\n\na little more than a week later, after caitlin moved away to school, she told bryant it was over—again. later that night, police found him on her campus.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: just by sheer coincidence, i had made a traffic stop and he was driving that vehicle.\n\ncaptain jeremy polk was then a lieutenant for the unt campus police. he pulled bryant over early in the morning of august 24.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: i thought he was an intoxicated driver by the way he was driving, and that was my focus.\n\nofficer to bryant: so, right now i have to place you under arrest so you can just remain seated. it's all good.\n\nbryant was not over the legal limit. he was charged with a few outstanding traffic tickets and they let him go. later that same day, he was back on caitlin's campus … again.\n\ncaitlin mathis: he actually knocked on the door of my dorm room … he didn't know prior where i lived … and he said, oh, your name was on the door.\n\njim axelrod: did that creep you out?\n\ncaitlin mathis: it did. at that point i was scared.\n\ncaitlin got him out of there and called campus police. captain polk recognized bryant's name on the report and went along to interview caitlin the next day.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: she told us things like, i just did not like the way charles spoke to me or i did not like the way he treated me. … and i made that choice then and there, you know, i would do everything i could to help her with this situation.\n\npolk issued a no trespass order, banning charles bryant from the unt campus. but once again bryant would not take no for an answer.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: the biggest fear i have as a police officer sometimes is emotion … because … emotion drives people to do things you would never imagine.\n\nstalked\n\nit was august 31, 2016, a week since charles bryant had tracked caitlin mathis down at her new dorm, and now he was invading her space again— coming into her new restaurant on her first day of work.\n\ncaitlin mathis: it was my first day there. … and he walked through the door, and my heart just dropped to the bottom of my stomach. … i was, like, i just want you to leave. \n\njim axelrod: what did he say to that?\n\nhe was just trying to win me back and i was just like, nothing is going to work, caitlin mathis told cbs news correspondent jim axelrod. cbs news\n\ncaitlin mathis: he didn't really say anything. … he looked upset … my new co-workers – they were, like, yeah. he was here yesterday looking for you.\n\ncaitlin asked her manager to keep bryant out, but her manager said there was nothing he could do.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i can't work here. i don't feel safe enough to work here.\n\ncaitlin went back to her old job a half hour's drive away. her mother found it all hard to watch from a distance.\n\nkaren hulsey: i said come home. … it was my motherly instinct to protect her. and in order to protect her, i had to have her with me.\n\nbut caitlin thought she'd be safe in her dorm. a week later, on september 6, what would have been their three-month anniversary, bryant was back … yet again.\n\ncaitlin mathis: he showed up to my dorm, knocked on my door. and at this point, i was shaking. … i'm all alone. … i actually hid in my suitemate's closet.\n\njim axelrod: you hid?\n\ncaitlin mathis: yes … when i was on the phone with the police they were like, we can't hear you; you need to speak up. and i was just afraid that he was going to hear my voice. … i did hear him say, caitlin, i know you're in there, just open up. i have something for you. and i'm like, god, what do you have for me? i don't want it.\n\nbryant left flowers and a two-page letter. when police arrived, he was gone.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i heard him say, hey, it's charles. i have something for you … officer: you know for sure it was him? caitlin mathis: yeah, i know it was him.\n\nafter another visit to ex-girlfriend caitlin mathis' dorm, charles bryant was arrested for trespassing by university of north texas campus police on september 6, 2016. unt police\n\npolice found him outside 10 minutes later – now in running clothes—and arrested him for trespassing.\n\nofficer to bryant: you know you're not supposed to be here.\n\nbryant posted bond and was released within hours. although caitlin had already blocked him on her phone, email and social media, he created a new email address, and wrote to her later that same day: here i am heartbroken and with a criminal record for bringing the girl i love flowers.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: that's when it became really serious for me … if … an actual physical arrest doesn't stop the behavior, then you're – you know, something is wrong.\n\ncaptain polk helped caitlin get an emergency protective order. and because bryant had kept trying to reach her after his arrest, polk had his officers go to bryant's house the next day and charge him yet again—this time, for stalking. this was his third arrest in 14 days.\n\nthe day after his arrest for trespassing, charles bryant was arrested for stalking. this was his third arrest in 14 days. grapevine police department\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: i told him … if he continued to communicate with caitlin, i would use every email, i would use every text message, i would use every phone call as a reason to have him rearrested.\n\ntwo days later, bryant posted a $5,000 bond and got out of jail.\n\ncaitlin mathis: he was telling his roommate that i was the crazy one in this relationship, so all of his friends were kind of coming at me and they were like, why – you need to, like, drop these charges against him.\n\nby september 13, bryant was back in denton – just a half mile from caitlin's dorm, in an area she had told him about back when they were still dating.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i was talking about going up to fry street and meeting new people.\n\nbryant went to fry street public house that night at about 7 p.m. an hour later jackie vandagriff walked in, asked about a job, and ended up in a conversation with the bartender … and charles bryant.\n\ncharles bryant and jackie vandagriff's introduction was captured on surveillance video. grapevine police department\n\nabout 45 minutes later, jackie posted a message on her twitter: i'm glad i decided to get off tinder and waked [sic] to a bar.\n\njackie ton | jackie vandagriff's friend: jackie was a very social person, whenever she went out she would make friends with everybody. … and it wasn't even flirty, it wasn't anything, you know? she was talking to the bartender, talking to other people.\n\nat about 9 p.m., jackie left with bryant and the bartender. she and bryant went to another bar nearby and started talking to a group of women. by 9:45 p.m. it was raining, and everyone was headed out. jackie left with charles bryant.\n\njackie ton: i feel like she felt comfortable enough with him that night because she had been hanging out with him for so long … that she was like, hey, well, whatever. he's just gonna drop me off, it's not that far, and i'll be good.\n\na convenience store surveillance camera captures the last time jackie vandagriff was seen alive. grapevine police department\n\nonce in his car, bryant stopped at a convenience store. this was the last time jackie vandagriff was seen alive. the day after she was found dead, there was a new post on her twitter: never knew i could feel like this\n\ncapt. john luna: it was just really bizarre.\n\npolice suspected it was a message from her killer and they knew they had to move quickly to id the man jackie had been with. they had some luck when they tracked down the women jackie met that night.\n\ncapt. john luna: one of the … friends that was with her had gotten a business card from this person because he was a fitness instructor.\n\nnow that grapevine police had charles bryant's name, they learned about that restraining order.\n\ncapt. john luna: so, in my eyes, that played into him as being a good suspect.\n\ngrapevine police called captain polk—who was running in a race when he got that call.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: the first thing he told me was charles bryant was their main suspect in jackie's murder. and i immediately just sat down on a park bench in the middle of the race. … it floored me.\n\nbryant was emerging as a strong suspect, but grapevine police did not have physical evidence connecting him to jackie's death. so, for now, bryant was free, and polk was worried about what he might do next.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: i called caitlin, and i just asked, where are you?\n\ncaitlin mathis: i was like, does this have to do with the murder that happened in grapevine? and he's like, i can't tell - i can't specify that to you, caitlin. but are you safe right now?\n\njim axelrod: and what did you say?\n\ncapt. john luna: i said, i think so.\n\nshe might have been wrong. in the days after jackie's murder, charles bryant sent caitlin several emails including a picture of a tree, writing on it… first kiss under this tree once upon a time… that photo was taken at grapevine lake.\n\ncaitlin mathis: he might have taken that picture that same day that jackie was killed.\n\nquestioning charles bryant\n\nit was september 2016 and caitlin mathis, charles bryant's ex-girlfriend, was very worried he might have been involved in the brutal murder at grapevine lake just days before.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i was waiting for more news to come out. because at that point they hadn't even arrested him yet.\n\njim axelrod: were you worried he was going to come after you?\n\ncaitlin mathis: i was. i thought that's exactly what he was going to do.\n\nthe emails and picture bryant had recently sent caitlin were proof that he was still thinking about her in the days after jackie was killed. but they were also proof of something else.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: it was prohibited for charles to communicate with her in any manner… and if he did, he would be violating the restraining order.\n\ncaptain polk thought they could use those violations to help the grapevine police who didn't have enough to make an arrest yet.\n\ncapt. jeremy polk: i told the detective we can get a warrant signed on some evidence we just got … and at least, you know, get him off the street.\n\ngrapevine p.d.: do you go by charles? do you go by dean? charles bryant: charles. grapevine pd: ok.\n\ncharles bryant was arrested on september 18 for violating caitlin's restraining order. grapevine detectives were hoping they'd soon find more evidence connecting him to jackie's death.\n\ncapt. john luna: he's brought to the grapevine police department for an interview. … and right away, he's beginning to distance himself from having any – almost any interaction with jackie …\n\ngrapevine p.d.: [showing photo of jackie]: you recognize who she is? charles bryant: i saw her at a bar. grapevine p.d.: ok, what can you tell me about her? charles bryant: that's about it, i guess.\n\ncapt. john luna: and at the same time, we begin serving a search warrant for his residence.\n\nalthough charles bryant had several days to dispose of potential evidence, investigators found several incriminating items at his home, including this large military style knife that later tested positive for the presence of blood. grapevine police department\n\nit had been four days since jackie's body was found, plenty of time to dispose of any possible evidence, but captain luna at grapevine p.d. says they found a lot at bryant's home, including a large military-style knife.\n\ngrapevine p.d.: you know what? her purse was found in there too.\n\n\n\nbryant had no way to answer for any of it – including two more items police found while he was in custody: video of him buying a shovel the night jackie disappeared and a kiddie pool missing from his backyard that matched the one jackie was found in.\n\nsurveillance video of charles bryant buying a shovel at walmart the night jackie vandagriff disappeared. grapevine police department\n\ngrapevine p.d.: ok, you we have video of you with this girl that you're at the bar. charles bryant: show me. grapevine p.d.: you're walking around walmart at four o'clock in the morning and buying a shovel. charles bryant: can't recall certain times. grapevine p.d.: she's found dead in a pool that came from your backyard.\n\ncapt. john luna: he even got to the point at the end of his interview with our detective where he said, well, i must have done it. i don't remember doing anything.\n\ncharles bryant: everything points to me. it's like i had to have done it\n\nan open-and-shut case? not even close. although there was overwhelming evidence that bryant had disposed of jackie's body, there was no evidence yet that confirmed how jackie had died or that bryant had killed her.\n\nranger jim holland: that's when they reached out to me and asked if i could come in and spend some time with him and interview him and see what i could get.\n\njim axelrod: because … you have an expertise in dealing with this kind of personality.\n\nranger jim holland: right. this is kind of my calling.\n\njim holland is the senior member of an elite team of texas rangers, a select division of texas state police. he specializes in interviewing some of the country's most prolific killers—and analyzing their thoughts. and charles bryant seemed to fit the bill. jackie's body had been dismembered before being set on fire. how do you begin to understand the mind that would do that?\n\nranger jim holland: a lot of these people actually want to tell you. they want to tell someone.\n\nat first, bryant kept to his claim that he didn't remember a thing.\n\ncharles bryant: it's crazy because i really don't remember meeting this girl.\n\nranger jim holland: the idea that he doesn't remember doing it, no, it's absolute nonsense.\n\njim axelrod: so, you knew charles bryant remembered exactly what had happened?\n\nranger jim holland: oh, yes, absolutely.\n\njim axelrod: and your job was just to pull that out of him.\n\nranger jim holland: right.\n\nholland says his strategy was to try and make friends with bryant and get him talking.\n\nranger holland: you're not a violent dude, you haven't really been in trouble, you know. ranger holland: you obviously work out. i mean, you're a stud, right?\n\nranger jim holland: you don't want him to look at you as a law enforcement officer. you want him to think of you as a friend, a compadre, a drinking buddy. … you kind of go back to what two boys would talk about in a high school locker room, you know, about the girl they kissed on friday night.\n\nranger holland: you don't have any issues with girls. charles bryant: no, nothing either. it's just blowing my f–––g mind.\n\nand holland suggested possible scenarios—to see if bryant will take it from there:\n\nranger holland: ok, so something happens, bam, there, there's a snap, and we need to figure out what that is. ranger holland: maybe, you know, she got mad. maybe she's giving you all the signals and then cuts you off. i mean, there could be all kinds of different things going on here, right? i mean, chicks- right? you know chicks.\n\nranger jim holland: you know, as we're going through the interview … i'm watching him. i'm i guess, in a way, a human lie detector. … i'm reading him and i'm throwing things at him in which i know the answer and i'm looking for his responses, whether they're false or true.\n\nunder the pretense of helping bryant remember what happened, holland suggested they do a memory exercise.\n\nranger holland: what we're going to do is these mind exercises, which means we're going to move back in time.\n\nbryant, who claimed he didn't know who jackie was, then seemed to remember her. he says he can see her coming into the bar:\n\ncharles bryant: she is looking for a job – that's what it was.\n\nand offering her a ride:\n\ncharles bryant: it makes sense. it was raining, i probably would have offered her a ride home. ranger holland: so, there's tons of things in this that i can tell you, right?\n\nduring ranger holland's interrogation, charles bryant maintained that he couldn't remember the night of jackie vandagriff's death. holland suggested they do a memory exercise to help trigger his memory. texas rangers\n\nover a pizza, as holland tries steering bryant to confess, he probed about a possible motive:\n\nranger holland: but what does everyone want to know? charles bryant: why? ranger holland: yeah, why? and who's the only one who can tell us that? charles bryant: me.\n\nholland eventually cut to the chase, and asks if what happened with jackie was all really about caitlin:\n\nranger holland: was there a time that you pictured her as this girlfriend that did you wrong or did anything like that come into play? charles bryant: no. … nothing at all.\n\nranger holland: the level of nonsense that came out of his mouth at different points about that was just astonishing.\n\njim axelrod: do you think charles bryant looks around the bar and sees jacqueline vandagriff? oh, she looks like caitlin.\n\nranger holland: it wouldn't surprise me if he actually mistook her at first, you know, saw her from behind and thought, man, you know, my ex is here. … i think in his mind that whole night, i think that's what he pictured.\n\ncaitlin mathis: after the murder – right after the murder, he took jackie's phone and used it to add me on facebook.\n\na serial killer in the making?\n\nwhen texas ranger jim holland was brought in to interrogate charles bryant, the nature of the crime made him wonder if bryant's brain was wired like the serial killers he's encountered.\n\ncharles bryant facebook\n\njim axelrod: in what way is the mind of a serial killer different from the common criminal?\n\nranger jim holland: you know, generally, people like that tend to be sociopathic or psychopathic mindsets, and it's just a different game.\n\nranger jim holland: a psychopath would be someone who's basically born with a scar on their brain. … then a sociopathic mindset is something that society has brought on. … something happened to them that changed their psyche.\n\nkristie dixon: … something maybe had happened in his childhood.\n\nkristie dixon got a glimpse of charles bryant's psyche firsthand. she met him on a dating app the year before jackie vandagriff's death.\n\nkristie dixon: he seemed pretty quiet and reserved, almost like he was shy. … by the second or third time that we were hanging out, i noticed … he was getting pretty attached pretty quickly, and i just was not there. it was very casual to me.\n\nafter she broke things off, he continued to pursue her. bryant even told her that he loved her. kristie says they had never even shared a kiss.\n\nkristie dixon: …it was a little too much too soon, too fast. … i work with abused children, and that, to me, kind of stuck out.\n\nkristie says that's when she asked bryant about his childhood. he told her he had been molested – a claim that 48 hours could not independently verify.\n\nkristie dixon: i remember thinking, that makes sense. … i'm not a psychologist or anything. but …\n\nkristie dixon: his behavior sort of came off to me as maybe an abused child or someone who is just needing that extra love that most people probably aren't seeking.\n\nstill, kristie thought he was harmless and stayed in touch.\n\nkristie dixon: i thought he was just a really nice guy … and felt sorry for him.\n\ncharles bryant [interrogation]: i'm not an angry guy. i'm not aggressive.\n\nas ranger holland continued his interrogation, he wanted to see if bryant would answer the key question: how did jackie vandagriff die? her autopsy didn't provide many answers.\n\njackie vandagriff instagram\n\nranger jim holland: there was a lot we didn't know. we didn't know where it occurred. … we didn't know exactly how it broke down. … and so that's what my goal was.\n\nholland wondered if the crime had a sexual element, but bryant initially denied anything sexual took place:\n\ncharles bryant: i don't recall having sex. ranger holland: you don't? charles bryant: no, normally i recall having sex.\n\nafter three more hours of interrogation, bryant said they did have sex – kinky sex. according to bryant, jackie wanted to be choked with an over-sized zip-tie that just happened to be in his car.\n\nranger holland: she didn't fight you in any way when, when you were putting it on? charles bryant: no.\n\nranger jim holland: the consensual sex aspect of it was one of those things that no, i felt strongly that he was lying about.\n\ninvestigators found a large, white plastic zip-tie with blonde hair in the clasp. dna tests later confirmed that hair was jackie vandagriff's. grapevine police department\n\nand bryant also claimed that neither he nor jackie had tightened the zip-tie intentionally.\n\nranger holland: ok. so, you think it just tightened up on its own, basically? charles bryant: not – it had to like – it had to snag on something. ... ranger holland: ok. and then what happened? charles bryant: i'm trying to remember. she's not responsive. … i shake her. nothing.\n\njim axelrod: are you just thinking this is a complete and total lie?\n\nranger jim holland: yeah, it's total fabrication.\n\nranger jim holland: did he kill her? yes, absolutely.\n\nranger jim holland: when you deal with these people, it's so rare that you would sit down with them and they would just tell you a to z this is what occurred. … they're always going to leave out things that make them look really bad. in other words, there's an excuse. … i'm not a bad person. i didn't mean for this to happen. it was an accident.\n\nalthough bryant was evasive about how jackie died, as holland led him through the memory exercise, he went into gruesome detail about how he disposed of her body:\n\nranger holland: and what do you see in the pool? charles bryant: her in, like, garbage bags. ranger holland: all right, now tell me exactly what you see occurring after that. charles bryant: i go down that trail … [ puts his face in his hands] ranger holland: and what happens next? charles bryant: i set it on fire. ranger holland: the fire. why do you burn the body? charles bryant: destroy the evidence.\n\neven if he couldn't admit to murder, bryant seemed to waver between denial and acceptance – at one point, conceding that the evidence showed he had to have done it:\n\ncharles bryant: … i can't fight it. it's obviously me.\n\nafter an intense, six-hour interrogation and with mounting evidence, charles bryant was finally charged with jackie vandagriff's murder. kristie dixon could not believe the news.\n\nkristie dixon: that night i actually was scared to go to sleep. i had nightmares. …he had never threatened me before. but just the fact that someone that i felt that i knew had murdered someone potentially, i was terrified.\n\nfor caitlin mathis, her worst fears were confirmed. and when she tried to learn more about the woman bryant killed, she made a shocking discovery on facebook.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i looked up jackie vandagriff … and i realized, oh, my god, i'm already friends with her.\n\ncaitlin says that digital friendship began after jackie's death.\n\njim axelrod: you got a friend request from jackie vandagriff?\n\ncaitlin mathis: yes.\n\ncaitlin believes that facebook friend request could only have come from one person: charles bryant.\n\njim axelrod: that really sounds diabolical.\n\ncaitlin mathis: it was.\n\nbryant pleaded not guilty to jackie's murder. his defense was the same story he told ranger holland.\n\nglynis mcginty: these two young people met. they consumed a lot of alcohol. our position is they had sex – kinky sex, albeit – and she died.\n\nbryant's court-appointed defense attorney, glynis mcginty, says jackie vandagriff's death was a tragic accident.\n\njim axelrod: are you telling me there's no evidence that charles bryant killed jackie vandagriff?\n\nglynis mcginty: not direct evidence.\n\nprosecutors lucas allan and anna hernandez believed that the evidence they did have would be enough. but they also knew that most jurors want a motive. and they weren't sure they would be able to tell this jury why they thought jackie was targeted.\n\nlucas allan: you have to wonder what is driving this person to do something like that.\n\njim axelrod: in your minds, there is no doubt that the murder of jackie vandagriff is connected to the stalking of caitlin mathis.\n\nanna hernandez: yes, i think we believe that definitely. … she might have just been victim number one with caitlin being victim number two.\n\nto help prove this, the prosecution was hoping the judge would allow caitlin to testify against her ex-boyfriend-turned-stalker in open court.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i felt sick.\n\nseeking justice for jackie\n\nin april 2018, a year-and-a-half after jackie vandagriff's untimely death, charles bryant was standing trial for her murder. her friend jackie ton could not bring herself to be there.\n\njackie was the most special person … i know i'll never meet someone like her again, jackie ton, right, said of jackie vandagriff. jackie ton\n\njackie ton: i wanted to go. … but i'm going to be honest. i couldn't look at him.\n\ncharles bryant would have to answer for a long list of items the prosecution had collected including that giant zip tie, the shovel he purchased the night jackie died, and that large knife which police believe he used to cut up her body, all found at his house.\n\nanna hernandez: this is something that you pray every night does not happen to your child when they go off to school.\n\ninvestigators had also found a stun gun in his car with jackie's dna on it. but it appears jackie was spared at least one horror. prosecutors ana hernandez and lucas allan say the medical examiner was able to run tests on jackie's remains and found no evidence of sexual assault.\n\nlucas allan: there was zero evidence to support that they had any type of sexual encounter.\n\nprosecutors say this undermines bryant's story that this was kinky sex gone wrong. his attorney glynis mcginty.\n\njim axelrod: how could they have had sex if there's no evidence?\n\nglynis mcginty: no evidence to the degree of no sperm found in her? … that doesn't mean they didn't have some type of consensual sexual encounter.\n\ncharles bryant [interrogation]: she liked it when we were making out.\n\nprosecutors chose not to play that interrogation tape for the jury… which meant bryant would have to take the stand if he wanted jurors to hear his version of events. he elected not to.\n\njim axelrod: shouldn't he be explaining to the jury why he's not at fault for her death?\n\nglynis mcginty: and then that flies … in the face of our constitutional rights.\n\nbut the defense knows they have an uphill battle to convince a jury that bryant is not guilty of murder while admitting he disposed of jackie's body.\n\njim axelrod: if he says it was just an accident, why didn't he call for help?\n\nglynis mcginty: sure. fair question. … intoxicated … panicked – and his mind would not process all of that to make a rational decision that you or i would have made: call the police.\n\nbut bryant went further than simply discarding jackie's body—much, much further. and prosecutors wanted the jury to hear their theory.\n\nanna hernandez: a huge piece of that story … was the stalking.\n\nbut before the jury could hear from caitlin, the judge would have to rule on whether or not to allow this evidence. local tv cameras were there when—without the jury present—caitlin took the stand and faced her ex.\n\ncaitlin mathis faces charles bryant in court ktvt\n\ncaitlin mathis: i was disgusted just to see his face.\n\njim axelrod: did he look at you? did you meet eyes?\n\ncaitlin mathis: at one point, we had to. when they made me describe to the court what he was wearing. and he just had this smirk on his face.\n\njim axelrod: there's nothing really that can prepare you for that, is there?\n\ncaitlin mathis: no. … the second i walked out those doors, i started bawling.\n\nin the end, the judge ruled against caitlin being able to tell her story to the jury.\n\nanna hernandez: it was definitely a real blow to us.\n\nglynis mcginty: that was the right decision.\n\njim axelrod: why?\n\nglynis mcginty: he had not been convicted of anything with caitlin.\n\nas the jury went out to deliberate, the defense was hopeful.\n\nglynis mcginty: i don't believe that they could prove that he murdered her … i don't think that they proved that.\n\nbut would the jury agree? they were out for a little over two hours and — even without hearing caitlin's story, charles bryant was found guilty of jackie vandagriff's murder and dismemberment.\n\njim axelrod: to your way of thinking, was justice done?\n\nlucas allan: yes.\n\njackie ton: i knew she was up there and said, thank you.\n\nbecause prosecutors had no evidence bryant committed another crime at the same time as jackie's murder—like rape or kidnapping—he was not eligible for the death penalty. he was sentenced to life.\n\ncaitlin mathis: as terrible as this is to say, but i wanted the death penalty.\n\nunder texas law, bryant could be eligible for parole after 30 years. caitlin says she feels like she's still looking over her shoulder—and always will be.\n\ncaitlin mathis: i fear that when he gets out / he'll come and find me and do something to either me or someone that i love. that's my biggest fear.\n\never since this happened, caitlin and her mother have been thinking about jackie and her family.\n\nkaren hulsey: this whole time i wanted to reach out … but … i didn't know how they felt.\n\nnearly two years after jackie died, they finally met.\n\nkaren hulsey: her grandmother, bless her heart. … she immediately came up to us and to caitlin and hugged her and said, i've been so worried about you these past two years.\n\njim axelrod: wow.\n\nkaren hulsey: [crying]\n\njim axelrod: karen, why is this the part that gets you?\n\nkaren hulsey: he took away their little girl. and the pain i saw in their eyes. i could feel their pain.\n\njim axelrod: and yet the grandmother was telling caitlin she was worried about caitlin.\n\nkaren hulsey: yes.\n\njim axelrod: they sound like very special people.\n\nkaren hulsey: they are.\n\njackie vandagriff and caitlin mathis instagram/caitlin mathis\n\ncaitlin says she's struggled with the fact that she survived — and jackie did not.\n\njim axelrod: this so easily could have been you.\n\ncaitlin mathis: and some days i wish it was. … it's just the guilt that eats me up sometimes. … i would have easily have taken her place if i had the chance.\n\njackie vandagriff's family has endowed an internship in health and wellness at texas woman's university in her name.\n\nproduced by sarah prior.

moving trucks were spotted outside president trump's mar-a-lago resort in palm beach, florida, on monday, as president-elect joe biden is preparing to move into the white house.\n\neven before he was president, mr. trump's florida club had been a lightning rod for controversy between his family and some of their wealthy neighbors.\n\nas cbs news' manuel bojorquez reports, that is unlikely to change when the president makes the permanent move wednesday.\n\nwest palm beach, where we are right now is extremely democratic, palm beach post senior political reporter christine stapleton said, adding that mr. trump's popularity in the town was fragile.\n\nsince the capitol riots, there has been a real shift in whether or not mar-a-lago will continue to be a venue that gop and conservative groups want to have their events there, stapleton said. they may not want to.\n\na gop fundraising event held at mar-a-lago in february brought in an estimated $25 million, according to the palm beach post.\n\nmr. trump purchased the property in 1985 and turned it into a private club, which has become his winter home during the last four years.\n\nhowever, neighbors are questioning whether it can become his permanent home. nearby palm beach residents recently sent a letter to town leaders, citing a 1993 agreement they say prohibits anyone from living permanently on the property because it is a social club.\n\ni think trump's defense will be that this is political, said democrat dave aronberg, state attorney for palm beach county. he may say in court that the town and everyone knew that he was living there and never sought to enforce this agreement until now when they started to disagree with his politics.\n\npolitics aside, aronberg said people in palm beach simply like their privacy.\n\neven his supporters on palm beach, and there are many supporters on the island, but even they don't want the drama, the commotion that president trump will bring to the island, because that's why they move there. they like their privacy. they like their quiet. and this will disrupt a lot of things on the island, he said.\n\nbut not everyone in the area agrees.\n\nit's going to be massive, massive, there are going to be so many people that are going to come, supporter annie marie delgado said. they're going to welcome this president home, and it's going to be peaceful and it's going to be exciting.\n\nwhen mr. trump returns to palm beach, delgado plans to be front and center at the airport. she had previously been head of trump team 2020, a statewide group of trump loyalists.\n\nasked if she thinks the president's move will make south florida the heart of the gop, she replied, now now brown cow, you said the bad word in my book.\n\nthe bad word was gop.\n\ni'm a trumplican, delgado said. we have to do some serious clean-up work in the 'gop,' especially in the state of florida.
sunday's nfl pro bowl will be the first to cater to the needs of people with sensory issues. across the country, stadiums and arenas are addressing those needs for every game and event – in large part because of the experience of one family from akron, ohio, reports cbs news' dana jacobson.\n\na basketball game or a hockey game seems like it might be an easy thing to go to as a family, but it's not for jeff and amy belles.\n\nit's not. i think it's challenging from the moment – the anxiety of the unknown. where are we going? what are we doing? to getting here and parking, and finding a spot over the crowds getting in. and that's before you get to your seat, amy said.\n\n\n\ngoing to sporting events with their autistic son carson can be more anxiety filled than exciting. large crowds and loud noises can be overwhelming for him. still, in february 2016 they decided to give a hockey game with carson a shot.\n\nit was autism awareness night. and we thought, what a great opportunity, amy said.\n\nthe cleveland monsters of the american hockey league were welcoming autistic fans and their families to a game at its shared home with the cleveland cavaliers, quicken loans arena – also known as the q. but when the belles arrived, they felt anything but welcome.\n\ntwelve-year old carson can't speak and instead uses an electronic device that hangs around his neck to communicate.\n\ncarson jeff and amy belles. cbs news\n\nwe had trouble in going through security, and the security guard not understanding what carson's device was, or what it was used for, amy said. we were actually told that he couldn't come through security with that. and carson got a little anxious.\n\nthe couple said the security guard then told them to get control of their child.\n\namy felt defeated. she couldn't let it go, so she took to social media launching a tweet that read: treated very poorly by the q security last night for autism awareness night ... i think some sensitivity training would go long way. her message reverberated throughout the arena.\n\nanthony bonavita cbs news\n\nher complaint got the attention of antony bonavita, senior vice president for facility operations at the q.\n\ni felt like l, you know, missed an opportunity on a professional level, you know, for us to be better than that, bonavita said.\n\nthe belles' experience hit home for bonavita. his son dominick is also on the autism spectrum.\n\non a personal level ... i felt like i let him down. you know, ultimately, it falls on me, bonavita said.\n\n\n\nso, he reached out to the belles family.\n\nthey just listened. and i just gave them some suggestions, some things that i was thinking of … i wanted to make sure they were gonna follow through, this really needs to be done. this can't happen again, amy said.\n\nthe q responded quickly, working with the cleveland clinic on training for staff. the goal? to becoming more inclusive for those with sensory issues ranging from autism to ptsd.\n\nyou know, for any business, you want to be as broad as you can to attract as many different people as you can, that's just good business. but we're more than that. what we mean to this city means more than a business element. we want it to be more about my son or your son or anybody else's parent or somebody who has ptsd to know that they have a home and a place that they can come, bonavita said.\n\nnow, when a family like the belleses comes to the q, they can pick up a sensory-friendly bag. it includes items like fidget toys, a weighted lap pad, and noise-cancelling headphones.\n\n\n\nquicken loans arena's sensory room. cbs news\n\nthere's also a sensory room, a designated space away from the action that serves as an escape if the sights and sounds in the arena get to be too much. inside, there's soothing bubble art on the walls and tactile displays that can calm an overstimulated mind.\n\nthe q can thank michele kong for the changes. she and her husband julian maha are physicians and the parents of two boys, including a 10-year-old who is autistic. they created a nonprofit called kulture city, focused on a mission of inclusion.\n\nwe saw how having a diagnosis like autism it truly made the families isolated from the community, kong said. so the genesis of kulture city really was us saying, how can we change the culture of a community to one where it is inclusive to all individuals, regardless of their challenges?\n\nkulture city started by helping their local zoo in birmingham, alabama, become sensory inclusive in 2014. but perhaps their biggest impact has been sports venues. kulture city has helped 15 nba and nhl arenas, and one nfl stadium to become sensory aware. their first, was the q\n\nto sit and look around and know that we can do what other families can do is pretty awesome, amy said.\n\nand the sensory rooms don't cost a lot. according to bonavita, all it took was some paint, new carpeting, and a little electrical work to turn an underused room into a place where fans with sensory needs can feel welcome.
with so little to be sure of in this topsy-turvy world, at least one thing is certain: each weeknight, vanna white will glide across the stage of wheel of fortune, revealing letters, applauding contestants, and looking beautiful while doing it.\n\nand that's my job, said wheel of fortune star vanna white. i'll be the first to make fun of it, shall we say. it is what i do. and i feel very lucky that i was able to get this job. i love what i do.\n\nand fans of the show love what she does. white has been co-hosting wheel of fortune with pat sajak for 37 years. back in the dark ages (before 1997), white had to turn the letters.\n\ncorrespondent mo rocca asked, do you miss turning the letters? i'm serious!\n\nvanna white revealing letters on the wheel of fortune puzzleboard. cbs news\n\nno. you know, i said: is there any way you can make my job easier?' white laughed. i really didn't say that! but it took time, because they had to manually stop tape and change those letters [for each puzzle], which was couple of hours, at least, to do. so, when they turned it into a computerized puzzle board, it went like that [snap]. so, it saved hours.\n\nit's not so easy to define white's appeal, but it's impossible to imagine wheel without her.\n\nsome of the show's 10 to 11 million viewers tune in to see what she will wear.\n\nyou've done over 7,000 episodes? asked rocca.\n\nyes.\n\nhow many different dresses?\n\nover 7,000, white replied. i've never worn the same dress twice.\n\nvanna white was born 63 years ago in north myrtle beach, south carolina. it was wonderful. back then, we didn't have to lock our doors. we left the keys in the car. it was a population of about 5,000 people.\n\nand i read somewhere that you used to shoot marbles?\n\nyes, i did! in school. did you?\n\ni have to tell you. i'm not sure how to play marbles.\n\nmarbles whiz vanna white takes correspondent mo rocca to the cleaners. cbs news\n\nshe was ten years old when she decided she wanted a career in television. she did watch game shows: as a matter of fact, 'concentration' was one of my game shows that i loved to watch. i even went to new york when i was 12 years old and went to the set of 'concentration.'\n\nafter high school, she enrolled in the atlanta school of fashion and design, where she studied fashion merchandising and poise.\n\nin 1980 she moved to los angeles: i had $1,000 to my name -- $300 for the car, $700 for the apartment, and a job immediately.\n\nwhat was the job? waitressing.\n\nafter susan stafford, the original wheel of fortune daytime co-host, left, white applied, ultimately vying against two other finalists.\n\nhost pat sajak admits he didn't recommend white at the time: and vanna knows this. not that she wasn't lovely and wonderful and personable and all that, but she was the most nervous, by far, of any of them.\n\nbut the show's creator, merv griffin, who also brought jeopardy! to television, knew what the public wanted, and told white why he chose her: he said, 'first of all, you and pat make a great brother/sister team, i see you guys together. and you did turn the letters better than anyone else.'\n\nsoon enough, vannamania swept the country.\n\nrocca asked, at what point did you realize: 'oh, boy, i'm a household name. i'm a first-name-only person, vanna,' like, that big?\n\nthat was when i was in the grocery line checking out, and i was on the cover of newsweek, she said. i thought: wow, i guess i've made it.\n\nnewsweek\n\nbut four years into the job she suffered a terrible blow.\n\nwhite was dating actor and former chippendale's dancer john gibson. the two were engaged. my boyfriend at the time was killed in a plane crash; that was devastating, said white. and i know there's a lot of people out there that lose relatives, loved ones, suddenly. and it is, of course, the hardest thing to go through.\n\nbut all my fans were so supportive. i received tons of fan mail, like letters: 'i've been through this.' and it just made me feel like i wasn't the only one.\n\nshe calls the show a family, a cliche, to be sure, in television, but white seems genuinely to feel the pain of wheel contestants when they stumble. i feel so bad because those contestants go through so much and they're so nervous up there. you know, they say it the wrong way.\n\nbut you're empathetic.\n\nof course i am. i feel so sad for them when that happens.\n\ncbs news\n\nand that may be the key to vanna white's enduring appeal: she and the audience have a genuine connection.\n\nshe offered some of the things people say to her: 'i've watched you my whole life.' or, 'my grandmother and i watched you.' and 'you taught me the alphabet.' 'you taught me how to speak english.' so, we change people's lives.\n\nwhen asked the number one question he gets about white, pat sajak said, where's vanna?' as if i carry her around with me and put her in the overhead compartment when i travel, which i don't by the way.\n\nduring most of the show's run, white has actually said very little on camera. but that changed this past december when sajak was hospitalized for emergency surgery for a blocked intestine.\n\nwhite filled in for sajak for three weeks. the fact that she did it speak volumes about her, he said. it would have been very easy for her to say, 'i'm sorry, this is not what i do.' but the audience was rooting for her and almost proud to see her up there.\n\nrocca asked her, would you ever wanna do it again?\n\nuhm, it's not at the top of my list, she replied. i loved being there, i loved doing it. but i was so nervous. maybe if i did it a few more times, i would feel better about it. but i'm my worst critic.\n\nwhite tapes wheel of fortune four days a month. when she is not at the studio, she spends time with her son, nico, and her daughter, gigi, and with her boyfriend, real estate developer john donaldson.\n\nwhite's contract has her at wheel of fortune's puzzleboard until 2022, but we're pretty sure her fans will never let her leave.\n\nrocca asked, are you ever worried that a robot's gonna take your job?\n\nno, she laughed. no, i'm not. should i be?\n\ncbs news\n\nweb exclusive: download or stream an extended podcast of mo rocca's interview with vanna white\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nstory produced by jay kernis.
lena dunham says that her weight loss doesn't mean she can't advocate for body positivity anymore.\n\nthe controversial girls creator appeared on ellen and said fans have called her a hypocrite.\n\ni had this experience of my body changing and suddenly i got all of these people being like, 'you're a hypocrite. i thought you were body-positive. i thought you were a person who embraces bodies of all sizes,' she said. i do, i just understand that bodies change, we live a long time. things happen.\n\ndunham said the criticism is sexist.\n\nit really was evidenced that as a woman in hollywood, you just can't win, she said.\n\nthe writer and actress said that she started working out because of her endometriosis, and emphasized that she did not lose weight to please other people.\n\ni also just never felt self-conscious about [my weight], she said. i was like: anyone who was going to take the time to say something negative about my weight on the internet wasn't someone i was particularly keen to impress anyway.
woody allen's adopted daughter dylan farrow is standing by her allegations that the oscar-winning director sexually assaulted her when she was a child.\n\nfarrow discussed the allegations with gayle king co-host cbs this morning in her first television interview, airing thursday morning. in light of the #metoo and time's up movements, she explained to king why she thinks just one accuser can make a difference.\n\ndylan farrow cbs news\n\nwe've gotten very attached to this concept that in order for a victim or accuser to come forward credibly that they have to be flanked by 49 other people, farrow said. this is absolute garbage. it shouldn't have to be that a small army has to come forward against one person to be credible. i have come forward with evidence and i am credible and i am telling the truth and i think it's important that people realize that one victim, one accuser, matters, and that they are enough to change things.\n\nwoody allen has always denied the allegations and has never been charged with a crime. allen released a statement that says, in part, even though the farrow family is cynically using the opportunity afforded by the time's up movement to repeat this discredited allegation, that doesn't make it any more true today than it was in the past. i never molested my daughter.\n\nthe full report will air thursday, jan. 18 on cbs this morning, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. et/pt on cbs.
easton, pa. -- a man who told police a toddler in his care choked on a hot dog was charged thursday with killing her by fracturing her skull at a mobile home filled with trash and bugs, a prosecutor said.\n\ngary foley jr., 32, faces a homicide charge in the death of a 17-month-old girl in walnutport last year, said john morganelli, district attorney for northampton county.\n\nfoley called 911 on feb. 24, 2015, and told dispatchers, something is wrong with my baby. he said he'd been feeding the child a piece of hot dog and put her on the floor to change her diaper when she began choking, according to morganelli.\n\nan autopsy detected the skull fracture. morganelli said it's not clear how she suffered the fracture, but he added that foley was the only adult at home with the child. authorities waited to charge foley while trying to develop more evidence in a case the prosecutor acknowledged is circumstantial.\n\nfoley and the girl's mother, 27-year-old heather surget, also face child endangerment charges. they were living with three other children in a mobile home that authorities said had trash and bugs everywhere and had no running water.\n\nit wasn't clear whether surget has an attorney. surget told police she met foley online, and he had moved in with her about a week earlier, morganelli said.\n\nboth were arraigned thursday. surget was jailed on $100,000 bail. foley was jailed without bail.
the booming business of legalized marijuana may be seeing a favorable shift from the trump administration. attorney general nominee william barr's testimony this week signaled potential relief for business owners in states that have enacted various laws legalizing cannabis products.\n\nmarijuana remains illegal under federal law, and there's no consensus in congress on a recent proposal to change that.\n\nin front of the senate judiciary committee on tuesday, barr said he doesn't plan on using federal resources to go after companies if they are complying with state law. that would be a reversal from the approach taken by his predecessor, former attorney general jeff sessions, who vowed to pursue federal violations more aggressively.\n\naccording to erik altieri, executive director of the national organization for the reform of marijuana laws (norml), barr's stance is a good sign for advocates but it remains to be seen if his actions will follow through on his pledge.\n\nit's encouraging but we do need to remain vigilant to keep him to hold his word to the american people, altieri told cbsn's reena ninan. his organization is a non-profit that supports responsible pro-marijuana policy.\n\nwhile 10 states and washington, d.c. have legalized recreational adult use of marijuana, and more than 20 other states allow some medical uses, u.s. attorneys can still prosecute its possession and sale under federal law. last year, sessions reversed an obama-era policy that encouraged federal prosecutors to take a hands-off approach in states where marijuana is legal. this put business owners back at higher risk of coming under federal scrutiny.\n\nwhile barr's stance may seem like a departure from his previous get-tough approach to drug policy, he made it clear during his testimony that he doesn't support federal legalization.\n\ni think it's a mistake to back off on marijuana, said barr. however, if we want a federal approach, if we want states to have their own laws, then let's get there and let's get there the right way. he said department of justice policy should align with congressional legislation.\n\naltieri agrees that the federal government's official acknowledgment of state legislation should be in the hands of congress, and he urged lawmakers to embrace what he sees as popular support for legal pot among americans.\n\nthere's no putting the toothpaste back in the tube on this one. the american people want to end our failed prohibition and any attempts to really slow that down or stop it will be incredibly unpopular across all party lines and demographics, altieri said.\n\naltieri also argues that federal marijuana legalization would help address many of the issues that concern people about marijuana's potential risks.\n\na recent book by by alex berenson, tell your children: the truth about marijuana, mental illness, and violence, highlights some of those risks, including marijuana's links to mental illness, harder drug use, and violence. berenson argues that legislation and public perception in the u.s. have sped ahead of the science, and that the growth has happened in the face of powerful new evidence that marijuana can be deeply harmful to mental health.\n\nwhen asked about berenson's warnings, altieri said legalization would give the government greater ability to address these concerns.\n\nthat is not a knock against legalization if you have concerns about it. prohibition is defined by the absolute lack of control of marijuana. if you have concerns about its use, particularly with youth and other health concerns, the answer is to regulate it and have those controls — not to leave it in the hands of criminal elements completely unregulated in back alleys and street corners.
watch the cbsn documentary, hindsight is 2020: an unprecedented election, in the video player above.\n\nthe votes are counted. the president knows it. in a few days, joe biden will be inaugurated.\n\nbut for a portion of president trump's most die-hard supporters, none of this proves that mr. biden won a fair election and will be the legitimate 46th president of the united states. some still don't believe mr. biden will be the one taking the oath of office on january 20.\n\nthere's no way that me nor many, many, many, many others would ever recognize this last election, said couy griffin, a county commissioner in new mexico who founded a group called cowboys for trump. griffin is one of several trump supporters featured in the new cbsn documentary hindsight is 2020: an unprecedented election.\n\ni will never accept a biden presidency, he said.\n\nwhen asked who would be standing on the steps of the capitol for the inauguration, griffin replied, i don't know. your guess is as good as mine. (griffin, who live-streamed himself standing on those same steps during the january 6 riot, is now under arrest for entering the restricted area.)\n\nafter months of lies and conspiracy theories about the voting results, it's clear that mr. trump's false narrative about a stolen election has stuck with a core group of his voters. and even the sight of mr. biden being sworn in won't change their minds.\n\nthe deadly riot at the u.s. capitol by trump supporters who were trying to stop the counting of electoral votes confirming mr. biden's win showed how literal and dangerous this belief has become.\n\ncbs news polling released this week found that only 31% of republican voters consider mr. biden the legitimate winner of the 2020 election. about two-thirds of total voters and two-thirds of independents consider mr. biden's victory legitimate, while virtually all democrats — 96% — see mr. biden as the legitimate winner.\n\nthe data indicate that as mr. biden takes office, there are potentially millions of americans who still aren't willing to accept his presidency.\n\nharry formanek, a trump supporter in boca raton, florida, would not even entertain hypothetical questions about biden's presidency, saying there was no reason to discuss it.\n\njoe biden will never be president of the united states, formanek, who also supports qanon conspiracies, told cbsn. it'll never happen. it's not going to happen.\n\na number of gop state and local elected officials continue to say the same.\n\nmr. trump started attacking the integrity of the 2020 election months before election day arrived, spreading falsehoods to cast doubt on mail-in ballots and telling supporters the only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. on election night, as votes were still being counted in many states, mr. trump falsely declared himself the winner.\n\nlater that same day, the first major stop the steal facebook page appeared, created by the leader of the conservative nonprofit women for america first. facebook shut it down in less than 24 hours due to worrying calls for violence from some members of the group, but by then it had already attracted more than 350,000 followers — and become a rallying cry.\n\ntrump supporters in key swing states chanted stop the steal outside of election offices, claiming that the late counting of mail-in ballots — which largely benefitted mr. biden — was part of a plot against the president. such protests have continued online and in person, and stop the steal signs were spotted throughout the crowd that swarmed the capitol on january 6.\n\nsince november 7, more than 60 election lawsuits from mr. trump and allied groups have been thrown out, sometimes by judges he appointed. the supreme court swiftly rejected a challenge to the election results. recounts and audits in multiple states found no systematic fraud, as mr. trump's own justice department confirmed.\n\nall 50 states certified their election results, the electoral college votes were submitted on december 14, and on january 6, vice president pence counted those votes in a joint session of congress to confirm mr. biden's win.\n\nbut as all of this played out, stop the steal became a self-reinforcing alternate reality. for its believers, every step that supported mr. biden's victory was just proof that the steal is even bigger than they thought.\n\nfor formanek, the past two months only convinced him that federal courts, state election officials and republicans in congress are either part of the steal or powerless to stop it. after watching the process unfold, i've only grown stronger in my opposition to the election results, he said.\n\nback in december, hours before the supreme court dismissed that election lawsuit, formanek told cbsn that he would trust mr. trump's word over the nation's highest court if it ruled against him.\n\nthese supreme court justices, they're human beings, he said, explaining that he believes they'd be afraid for their lives and cave in to pressure from mr. trump's opponents.\n\nformanek was a poll worker on election day, and notes that he witnessed no fraud at the polling place where he worked.\n\nafter the capitol attack, mr. trump issued a video finally acknowledging that a new administration will be sworn in january 20 and promising a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power. mr. biden has been extending his hand to disappointed trump supporters, calling for an end to divisiveness and stating in his victory speech, let's give each other a chance.\n\nbut there's no sign that the movement is dying down, and the threat of further violence over the election results remains.\n\nthe mayor of washington, d.c. has urged americans not to attend the inauguration, and the capitol building is now protected by thousands of national guard troops. mr. biden canceled a plan to travel into washington on amtrak out of security concerns.\n\ngriffin, the cowboys for trump founder, live-streamed while he was at the january 6 rally that became a riot, warning of more demonstrations and blood running out of the capitol.\n\nhe insisted he doesn't support violence, but repeatedly implied there could be more of it to oppose mr. biden entering the white house.\n\nthe left is always talking about resistance, he said. the left hasn't even seen resistance until the right comes alive, i guarantee. because the left are all the gun-grabbers. the right's the ones that still have the guns.\n\ngriffin was taken into custody on sunday after he

drivers for uber, lyft and other app-based services filed a lawsuit tuesday to overturn a california ballot initiative that classifies them as independent contractors instead of employees eligible for benefits and job protections.\n\nthe lawsuit filed with the california supreme court contends that proposition 22 is unconstitutional because it limits the power of the state legislature to grant workers the right to organize and excludes drivers from eligibility for workers' compensation.\n\nthe measure, which was passed in november with 58% support, was the most expensive in state history. doordash, lyft, uber and other app-based companies spent $200 million in support of it. labor unions, which joined drivers in the lawsuit, spent about $20 million to oppose the measure.\n\nprop 22 doesn't just fail our state rideshare drivers, it fails the basic test of following our state constitution, said bob schoonover of the seiu union. the law as written by uber and lyft denies drivers rights under the law in california and makes it nearly impossible for lawmakers to fix these problems.\n\nevery day, rideshare drivers like me struggle to make ends meet because companies like uber and lyft prioritize corporate profits over our wellbeing, saori okawa, a plaintiff in the suit, said in a statement. i know it's up to the people we elect to make our laws, not wealthy executives who profit from our labor.\n\nthe yes on 22 coalition, a group of organizations backing the ballot measure, called the lawsuit meritless.\n\nnearly 10 million california voters — including the vast majority of app-based drivers — passed prop 22 to protect driver independence, while providing historic new protections, jim pyatt, an uber driver and spokesperson for the coalition, said in a statement. meritless lawsuits that seek to undermine the clear democratic will of the people do not stand up to scrutiny in the courts.\n\nuber did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while lyft referred a query to the yes on 22 coalition.\n\na long legal battle\n\nthe lawsuit is the latest chapter in a multi-year fight between high-tech gig companies and labor rights groups. gig companies have held they are exempt from california's landmark labor law ab5, which democrats in the legislature passed in 2019 and which made it more difficult to classify certain workers as independent contractors.\n\nthat law expanded a california supreme court ruling that would have required gig platforms to provide drivers with protections like minimum wage, overtime pay, health insurance and reimbursement for expenses.\n\nproposition 22 was written by uber and lyft and supported by doordash, postmates and instacart. when the ballot measure passed last november, proponents said it showed voters' support for the current system, which allows drivers some measure of flexibility to set their own schedules and keeps gig services relatively affordable for customers. opponents accused the gig companies of buying their own law, and vowed to keep fighting.\n\nunder proposition 22, drivers remain independent contractors exempt from those requirements, but do receive some alternative benefits, including a guaranteed minimum wage and subsidies for health insurance if they average 25 hours of work a week. the proposition includes a provision that requires a seven-eighths majority to overturn or change the measure in the future.\n\ncbs news' irina ivanova contributed reporting.
scientists have found warm water beneath antarctica's doomsday glacier, a nickname used because it is one of antarctica's fastest melting glaciers. while researchers have observed the recession of the thwaites glacier for a decade, this marks the first time they detected the presence of warm water – found at a vital point beneath the glacier.\n\na news release on the findings called it an alarming discovery.\n\nthe fact that such warm water was just now recorded by our team along a section of thwaites grounding zone where we have known the glacier is melting suggests that it may be undergoing an unstoppable retreat that has huge implications for global sea-level rise, david holland, director of new york university's environmental fluid dynamics laboratory and nyu abu dhabi's center for global sea level change, which conducted the research, said in the news release.\n\nwarm waters in this part of the world, as remote as they may seem, should serve as a warning to all of us about the potential dire changes to the planet brought about by climate change, he said.\n\nthe collapse of the 74,000-square-mile thwaites — which some scientists see as the most vulnerable and significant glacier in the world when it comes to sea-level-rise — could release a mass of water roughly the size of florida or great britain. its melting would raise global sea levels by more than three feet, enough to potentially overwhelm vulnerable populations, the researchers said.\n\nhot waters drilled an access hole for the deployment of a turbulence device on thwaites glacier. david holland, nyu and nyu abu dhabi\n\nthe team that found the warm water created a nearly 2,000-foot deep access hold to conduct unprecedented research, part of a multimillion-dollar initiative between the united states and the united kingdom. using an ocean-sensing device, scientists recorded waters more than two degrees above freezing flowing beneath the hard-to-reach glacier in early january.\n\nfrom our observations into the ocean cavity at the grounding zone we observed not only the presence of warm water, but also its turbulence level and thus its efficiency to melt the ice shelf base, said aurora basinski, an nyu graduate student who made the turbulence measurement.\n\naccording to the international thwaites glacier collaboration, the amount of ice flowing out of the thwaites and nearby glaciers has nearly doubled over the last 30 years. melting ice from the thwaites into the amundsen sea already accounts for approximately 4% of current global sea-level rise — a number that would significantly increase when the glacier crumbles.\n\nmeasuring the change in the height of the ice across antarctica. tom slater / cpom / bbc news\n\nlast january, a massive cavity the size of two-thirds of manhattan was found under the glacier, a sign of rapid decay. scientists continue to warn that the entire west antarctic ice sheet could collapse within the next 100 years, leading to a sea-level rise of nearly 10 feet and flooding coastlines around the world.\n\nrising sea levels are on track to affect about three times more people by 2050 than originally thought. research suggests that 300 million homes will be affected by coastal flooding in the next 30 years — and 630 million by the year 2100 if carbon emissions don't decrease.
president trump claimed in a statement on tuesday night he and vice president mike pence are in total agreement on the vice president's authority regarding the electoral college count, after multiple news outlets reported pence told mr. trump he lacks the power to alter the election results.\n\nthe new york times and other news outlets reported tuesday that pence told mr. trump he doesn't believe he possesses the power to block congress' certification of president-elect joe biden's win. on tuesday night, mr. trump called that report fake news.\n\nmr. trump, in a statement issued by the trump campaign, claimed he and pence are on the same page. pence has not issued such a statement independently.\n\nthe new york times report regarding comments vice president pence supposedly made to me today is fake news. he never said that. the vice president and i are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act, mr. trump said in the statement. our vice president has several options under the u.s. constitution. he can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification. he can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the house of representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation.\n\nas vice president and president of the senate, pence only has the authority to preside over the proceedings. he does not have the authority to alter the results in mr. trump's favor.\n\nearlier tuesday, mr. trump had tweeted a false claim that the vice president has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors.\n\nmr. trump hinted that he hoped pence would help on monday, when he held a rally for senator kelly loeffler and david perdue.\n\ni hope mike pence comes through for us, mr. trump said on monday night. he also tweeted on tuesday that the vice president has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors. there is no evidence the electors were chosen fraudulently, and the 12th amendment suggests that pence's powers are really more ceremonial. he shall, in the presence of the senate and house of representatives, open all the certificates, and the votes shall then be counted.\n\nthis is a developing story and will be updated.
new york - investors saw some new hints that inflation is increasing on wednesday, but they still sent banks, technology firms and consumer-focused companies climbing. that was a big change after the market's inflation-inspired plunge earlier this month.\n\nafter a shaky start, stocks rose for the fourth straight day, and banks made some of the largest gains as bond yields reached new four-year highs. the move in yields came after the government said consumer prices climbed in january a slightly faster pace than economists had expected. a different government report showed retail sales were unchanged in december and slipped last month.\n\nthe standard & poor's 500 index rose 35.7 points, or 1.3 percent, to 2,699. the dow jones industrial average added 253 points, or 1 percent, to 24,893. the nasdaq composite climbed 130.1 points, or 1.9 percent, to 7,144. the russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks rose 27.2 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,522.\n\nafter a 10 percent plunge in just nine days, the s&p 500 has risen 4.5 percent in the last four days.\n\ni think the fears of the economy overheating have been a little bit balanced out with the combination of these [inflation and retail sales] numbers, said katie nixon, chief investment officer for northern trust wealth management. the bond market is not suggesting that runaway inflation is a deep concern.\n\nstocks began plunging feb. 1 after the labor department said wages grew at a rapid clip in january. investors worried that that meant inflation was rising and that it would push the federal reserve to start raising interest rates more quickly, making it more expensive for people and businesses to borrow money.\n\nthat would slow down economic growth as well growth in as corporate profits. nixon said wednesday's reports show inflation probably isn't rising that fast.\n\nthe labor department said prices paid by consumers rose 0.3 percent in january, excluding volatile items like food and energy. that's the most in a year, and it sent bond yields and gold prices higher.\n\nthe yield on the 10-year treasury note rose to 2.91 percent, its highest mark in four years, from 2.84 percent a day earlier. that helped banks, as the higher interest rates make lending more profitable.\n\nbut it hurt high-dividend companies like utility and phone companies. those stocks are often compared to bonds because of their big dividend payments and relatively steady prices, but investors find them less appealing when bond yields are rising.\n\namericans cut back on purchases of cars, furniture and a variety of other products in january. the commerce department also lowered its estimate for spending in december. that came after a three-month stretch that included the strongest holiday sales in a decade.\n\nretailers traded higher despite the tepid numbers in the report. amazon (amzn) rose $36.54, or 2.6 percent, to a record high of $1,451.05, and tiffany (tif) added $2.15, or 2.1 percent, to $103.11. nike (nke) picked up $2.09, or 3.2 percent, to $67.96.\n\nnixon, of northern trust, said she doesn't expect inflation to increase very much, but it can be unpredictable from month to month. she noted that it could go higher as people who received tax cuts or bonuses spend their extra pay.\n\nnetflix (nflx) climbed after the streaming video company said it signed another big-name tv writer and producer to a production deal. according to reports, glee and american horror story producer ryan murphy received a $300 million deal that will span five years. in august netflix announced a deal with scandal and gray's anatomy creator and producer shonda rhimes.\n\nnetflix climbed $7.73, or 3 percent, to $266.\n\nchipotle mexican grill (cmg) soared after naming taco bell (yum) ceo brian niccol to lead the company. chipotle has been hit hard by food safety scares over the last few years and has had trouble winning back customers. niccol launched breakfast at taco bell and also introduced mobile ordering from its restaurants, and investors felt he might improve the company's fortunes. founder steve ells resigned as ceo in november.\n\nthe stock rose $38.58, or 15.4 percent, to $289.91. it traded above $700 in mid-2015.\n\ngold jumped $27.60, or 2.1 percent, to $1,358 an ounce. silver rose 35 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.88 an ounce. copper picked up 7 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $3.24 a pound.\n\nu.s. crude rose $1.41, or 2.4 percent, to $60.60 a barrel in new york. brent crude, used to price international oil, gained $1.64, or 2.6 percent, to $64.36 a barrel in london.\n\nwholesale gasoline added 3 cents to $1.71 a gallon. heating oil rose 5 cents to $1.88 a gallon. natural gas lost 1 cent to $2.59 per 1,000 cubic feet.\n\nthe dollar fell to 107.09 yen from 107.69 yen. the euro dipped to $1.2435 from $1.2355.
a federal appeals court last friday dismissed a landmark climate change lawsuit brought by 21 young americans against the federal government. two of the three judges on the ninth circuit panel argued that the courts are not the place to resolve the climate crisis.\n\n\n\n60 minutes correspondent steve kroft reported on the case last year. he spoke with oregon lawyer julia olson, who recruited the climate kids from environmental groups around the country. their suit alleged that the use of fossil fuels is causing climate change, and the government's continued support of the fossil fuel industry endangers the plaintiffs' future and violates their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.\n\nolson told kroft that a trove of documents she has collected proves every president since lyndon b. johnson has known about the potentially catastrophic effects of fossil fuels.\n\nour government, at the highest levels, knew and was briefed on it regularly by the national security community, by the scientific community, olson said. they have known for a very long time that it was a big threat.\n\naccording to the majority opinion, written by judge andrew d. hurwitz, the plaintiffs have made a compelling case that action is needed. but he continued: reluctantly, we conclude that such relief is beyond our constitutional power. rather, the plaintiffs' impressive case for redress must be presented to the political branches of government.\n\nu.s. district court judge josephine l. staton wrote a scathing dissent, rebuking the notion that the courts can play no role.\n\nin these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the united states has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response—yet presses ahead toward calamity, she wrote. it is as if an asteroid were barreling toward earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the nation.\n\nthe group told 60 minutes they plan to appeal the decision.
the louisville international airport is changing its name to honor the three-time heavyweight boxing champion and activist muhammad ali. the late icon was born in the city.\n\nthe louisville regional airport authority board voted wednesday to change the name to the louisville muhammad ali international airport, according to a press release.\n\nthe vote comes just one day before what would have been the hometown hero's 77th birthday. he died in the summer of 2016 at 74.\n\nmuhammad ali belonged to the world, but he only had one hometown, and fortunately, that is our great city of louisville, said louisville mayor greg fischer according to the release.\n\nthe vote took place following a recommendation from a board working group that studied the renaming for over a year.\n\nali's widow lonnie ali called the champion a global citizen, according to the release, but added he never forgot the city that gave him his start. it is a fitting testament to his legacy.\n\nwhile the airport's name will change, its current three-letter international air transport association (iata) code — sdf — won't change.
pope francis continued his trip through mexico to ecatepec, one of the country's most dangerous cities\n\npope francis continued his trip through mexico to ecatepec, one of the country's most dangerous cities\n\necatepec, mexico - hundreds of thousands of people gathered sunday for the biggest event of pope francis' five-day trip to mexico, a mass in the capital's crime-ridden suburb of ecatepec, where drug violence, gangland-style executions and kidnappings are a daily fact of life. francis had a clear message for the masses: with the devil, there is no dialogue.\n\nthe mexican bishops' conference said some 300,000 tickets had been handed out and that an estimated 2 million people were expected to line the pope's motorcade route to the huge field where the liturgy took place. they tossed flower petals as francis passed by and cheered with pom-poms in the yellow and white colors of the vatican flag.\n\nfrancis was bringing a message of encouragement to residents of an area where the murder rate, particularly of women, was so high that the government issued a special alert last year. with a densely packed population of some 1.6 million, ecatepec is a sprawling carpet of cinderblock slums mixed in with some better-off neighborhoods, and is a strategic point for drug gangs that thrive amid poverty, unemployment and impunity.\n\nin a clear reference to the drug lords who hold sway here, francis focused his homily on the danger posed by the devil and urged mexicans to resist the temptations of wealth and corruption.\n\nlet us get it into our heads: with the devil there is no dialogue, francis said, improvising from his prepared text. there can be no dialogue because he will always defeat us. only the power of the word of god can defeat him.\n\nas a morning chill turned to a brilliant, warm day, pilgrims on foot and clad in white lined the streets leading to the field. vendors sold t-shirts, plates with francis' image on them, pins, bandanas and cardboard-cutout figures of the pope.\n\nhe's coming to ecatepec because we need him here, said ignacia godinez, a 56-year-old homemaker. kidnappings, robberies and drugs have all increased, and he is bringing comfort. his message will reach those who need it so that people know we, the good people, outnumber the bad.\n\nfrancis' decision to celebrate his largest mass in ecatepec speaks volumes about his priorities and desire to go to the peripheries of mexico. a day after he was feted in the grandeur of mexico city's historic center, francis began the part of the trip that is certainly closest to his heart: offering words of hope and encouragement to society's most marginalized.\n\nat least 1,554 women have disappeared in mexico state since 2005, according to the national observatory on femicide, and last year the government issued an alert over the killings of women in ecatepec and 10 other parts of the state.\n\nin this february 8, 2016 photo, a bus drives through in ciudad juarez, mexico with an ad showing pope francis and saying juarez is love. we are ready. ap\n\nnevertheless, women who came to see francis said they felt safe, thanks in part to the huge security presence: the government assigned more than 10,000 police, soldiers and agents of the presidential guard to protect the pope's motorcade and mass.\n\ngraciela elizalde, 35, arrived at the field saturday evening to wait for the pope and said she wasn't at all afraid to spend the night on the street. she said she felt protected by my faith and the joy of seeing the pope up-close.\n\nthe pope is not going to change things, but at least he will touch the hearts of those who do harm and are trying to destroy the country, she said. he is the 'messenger of peace' because that's exactly what mexico needs, not just ecatepec.\n\nconchita tellez, 65, from the northwest mexico border city of mexicali, said she spent 38 hours on a bus to get to ecatepec and was among the first in line for a spot at the mass. she expressed hope francis can help ease the troubled soul of the country, where 100,000 people have been killed and 27,000 disappeared in gangland violence since president enrique pena nieto's predecessor launched an offensive against drug cartels shortly after taking office in late 2006.\n\nthe pope comes to mexico at a very ugly moment, tellez said, and he comes to pray for us and for all those who lost hope and have submerged the country in blood and violence.\n\nfrancis' is visiting ecatepec a day after his grueling schedule appeared to be already taking a toll. he seemed tired and winded at times saturday, and he appeared to nod off at an evening mass and also lost his balance and fell into a chair set up for him to pray.\n\nhe appeared much livelier sunday, beaming and waving at the crowds along his route.\n\nthe pope's five-day trip to the world's largest spanish-speaking catholic country is shining an uncomfortable spotlight on government and church shortcomings in dealing with social ills.\n\naccording to government statistics, about 46 percent of mexicans live in poverty, including 10 percent in extreme poverty. meanwhile, the homicide rate rose precipitously between 2006 and 2011, before declining somewhat for the next three years and then ticking up again in 2015.\n\nfrancis' schedule sunday includes three popemobile motorcades and a visit to a pediatric hospital.\n\nthe pope is coming to ecatepec because it needs him and because the faith is reeling, said petra arqueta, a 62-year-old from morelos who nonetheless spent a night waiting in line. the poor and the working people are here, and this pope prefers to talk to the humble.
park city, utah -- robert redford is pretty sure this is the best sundance film festival they've ever had, and he also knows that things have to change.\n\nit's not the films. the quality, he said, is better than ever. it's the size.\n\ni'm starting to hear some negative comments about how crowded it is and how difficult it is to get from venue to venue when there's traffic and people in the streets and so forth, redford said. we're going to have to look at that.\n\nredford still seems somewhat bemused that the festival grew the way it did over the past three decades. he sees it as a combination of the narrowing of the entertainment business -- when filmmakers and actors had to look outside of hollywood to find material and projects worth doing -- and a product of globalization.\n\nwhen actors came who were well known, then the paparazzi came. then once the paparazzi came, the fashion houses came. suddenly this thing was going haywire, he said, laughing that the recession actually helped temper the frivolousness a bit.\n\nbut people continue to turn out in droves, looking to be among the first to see a breakout filmmaker's debut -- like ryan coogler's fruitvale station or damien chazelle's whiplash.\n\nas it grew, so did the crowds, so did the development in park city. well, at some point, if both those things continue to grow, they're going to begin to choke each other, redford said. so then i have to think about, oh, do we now risk being who we are in the first place? do we risk (losing) the heart and soul of what we were when we started against the odds. ... do we have to now rethink things?\n\nideas are already swirling in redford's brain about how the festival can and should evolve.\n\nyou have a couple of choices. you can go hard and say we're going to stop it. say 'that's the end.' let it go. let someone else do it, he said. or, you say well, if you want to keep it going, we can't keep it going the way things are.\n\none thought redford had was to break up the festival into sections, instead of cramming narrative, documentaries, shorts and everything else into a tight 10 days in january. so, in this scenario, narrative features could play in january, and february would be for documentaries.\n\ni don't know whether that works or not, redford acknowledged. that's just an idea that's worming in my head.\n\nthe sundance film festival wraps on sunday.
lawton, okla. — at least four people have died as a major winter storm blows across the southern plains. snow and ice have caused hundreds of accidents in texas and oklahoma, and government buildings and schools shut down, with a winter storm warning in effect through friday.\n\nthe four victims died in weather-related crashes in oklahoma. slick roads caused a 21-car pile-up in tulsa wednesday night that sent at least two people to the hospital. in wichita falls, texas, icy roads caused cars to veer out of control and flip over.\n\nup to six inches of snow has fallen in shamrock, texas, making some roads too dangerous to navigate. one good samaritan pulled a vehicle out of a ditch and almost caused another accident. now officials are urging people to stay off the roads.\n\ntracy terrill from the oklahoma department of transportation said his crews started spreading salt on the roads on new year's day in preparation for the storm, but conditions can change quickly, within just a half mile.\n\nthe state has 220,000 tons of salt mix ready to deploy. but the storm is expected to move towards the northeast later this week.
cleveland -- baseball commissioner rob manfred has made his strongest comments on wanting the cleveland indians to eradicate their chief wahoo logo.\n\nmanfred has been in talks with indians owner paul dolan about abolishing the divisive symbol, which has sparked debate for decades.\n\nin the past, manfred has only gone as far as saying he understood why many people find the logo offensive. now, manfred appears to be pressuring the indians, who have reduced wahoo's visibility in recent years, to make more significant changes.\n\njim schulz of elyria shows off his cleveland indians mascot painted head outside of progressive field prior to game 6 of the world series against the chicago cubs on nov. 1, 2016, in cleveland, ohio. getty\n\nmlb spokesman pat courtney said in a statement to the associated press on wednesday that league officials are confident about reaching a positive resolution for the game and the club.\n\nthus far, there have been productive discussions with the cleveland indians regarding the commissioner's desire to transition away from the chief wahoo logo, courtney said. we have specific steps in an identified process and are making progress.\n\nin this april 8, 2014 photo, the cleveland indians chief wahoo logo is shown on the uniform sleeve of third base coach mike sarbaugh during a baseball game against the san diego padres in cleveland. ap\n\non tuesday, protesters gathered outside progressive field to demonstrate against the team's usage of the red-faced, smiling logo, which has been part of the team's history dating back to the 1940s.\n\nthe indians have decreased chief wahoo's profile, switching their primary logo to a block c'' several years ago. however, the symbol still appears on some of the sleeves of some of the team's uniforms and caps and the indians have continued to sell wahoo merchandise.\n\nsome anti-wahoo protesters want the team to change its nickname as well.\n\nwe are people, not mascots, not logos, not imagery, said carla getz, a member of the potawatomi tribe. getz was one of several dozen peaceful protesters that chanted for change on a plaza outside tuesday's game.\n\nthere is also a sizeable contingent of cleveland fans who understand the viewpoints of protesters, but cherish the logo and don't want the team buckle to pressure to abolish it.\n\nthe indians were recently awarded the 2019 all-star game, and a possible compromise could be the wahoo logo being completely removed from uniforms.\n\nbob dibiasio, the team's senior vice president for public affairs, said dolan and manfred have had ongoing dialogue since the world series last year.\n\nwe certainly understand the sensitivities of the logo, those who find it insensitive and also those fans who have a long standing attachment to its place in the history of the team, he said.\n\nwe fully expect to work with the commissioner throughout the remainder of this season on finding a solution that is good for the game and our organization, dibiasio said. our primary focus right now is on the team and our pursuit of returning to the postseason.
unemployment in the u.s. in 2018 will likely sink to its lowest level since astronaut neil armstrong took his giant leap for mankind in landing on the moon nearly 50 years ago.\n\nthat's the view of noted wall street economist joseph lavorgna, who predicts that the nation's jobless rate -- now at 4.1 percent -- will fall to 3.5 percent by year-end. the last time unemployment was that low? december 1969, according to the bureau of labor statistics.\n\nwhile good news for those looking for work and for workers hoping for a meaningful hike in their pay, the rosy prediction for the labor market is also fuel for the fire now torching stock prices, with investors fearing higher inflation.\n\nthe low unemployment rate is likely to further galvanize inflation worries and keep upward pressure on interest rates, wrote lavorgna, chief economist at natixis cib americas, in a note.\n\nlavorgna isn't alone in predicting that joblessness will continue to fall, though other experts think it might take longer for unemployment to dip below 4 percent.\n\nfor now, investors seem convinced. they sent stocks tumbling again on thursday amid ongoing concerns that the federal reserve will have to raise interest rates faster than expected in the face of rising wages and prices. average hourly earnings rose 2.9 percent in january from a year ago, the fastest pace of growth in eight years.\n\noverall, inflation across the u.s. remains modest, especially given the uptick in wages, at just above the fed's target rate of 2 percent. but inflationary pressures are building and already affecting consumers. mortgage rates have climbed along with 10-year treasury yields in recent weeks, with the 30-year fixed rate now at its highest level in more than a year.\n\nwhile average investors may be unnerved by blaring headlines about the plunge in stock prices, market turbulence alone is unlikely to cause a sustained economic downturn, according to gabriel sterne, an analyst at oxford economists.\n\nthe ingredients are inconsistent with that most fearsome of scenarios in which inflation picks up sharply while the economy stagnates, sterne said in a research note.\n\nstill, until the market hears from news fed chair jerome powell later in the month, investors are likely to fret at any signs the economy is starting to run hot.\n\nfor this mentality to change, the powell-led fed needs to tell investors that low unemployment and rising wage growth need not be inflationary, lavorgna said.
the following is a transcript of an interview with missouri senator roy blunt that aired sunday, january 10, 2021, on face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: we want to go now to missouri republican senator roy blunt, he is the head of the congressional committee overseeing the inauguration and the outgoing chairman of one of the two committees investigating what went wrong with security last wednesday. good morning to you, senator.\n\nsenator roy blunt: good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator, we have received sad news this morning from capitol hill police that another officer has died. it's described as an off-duty death. do you know if there's any connection to the events of this week?\n\nsen. blunt: you know, i don't know. officer sicknick, now officer liebengood, both the- their lives were end- ended this week. i'll be interested in finding out if there was a connection with officer liebengood. but mostly i'm interested in reaching out to both of these families. these are people we saw every day, particularly officer liebengood, who was very much assigned to the senate side of the building. and, you know, you have that loss. you have four other deaths of people who got involved in something that they absolutely should not have gotten involved in. and it was a tragedy, even if it had been limited just to that. but then when you see this all over the world, you- citizens of the united states storming the capitol of the united states, certainly something i thought i would never see. and i'm glad we got back into the capitol and got our work done that day where we were supposed to get it done to send that signal. but the signal around the world couldn't have been more helpful to our adversaries than it was. it was a sad and terrible day in the history of the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: i think we agree with you on that, sir. i appreciate your kind words about these particular officers. i have to ask you, though, about some of the images that have been projected around the world as well, which are of some of those officers appearing to remove barriers for rioters to allow them in. there are reports that some actually gave information on where to find certain congressional offices. is there any indication of involvement or complicity from members of the capitol police?\n\nsen. blunt: no, no. and i resent any sense that the capitol police didn't push back, fight back valiantly get out there and stand between first the building and then the people in the building that they're there to protect. now, senator klobuchar and i have announced we're going to look into this, both the planning and whether the support was imminent. certainly the support from the d.c. police was quick and incredibly helpful. i know the mayor's coming on later today. they were here. they were here almost immediately when asked to be. i think we have to think about why the national guard didn't get here quicker, but the- the capitol police fought back. you can do anything with looking at film, not knowing what you're talking about. i do know when you're overwhelmed in law enforcement, one of the things you do is try to step back and regroup,--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsen. blunt: --rather than just get- let yourself get surrounded. senator coons is on later. he and i formed the law enforcement caucus--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsen. blunt: --when we came to the senate 10 years ago. we- we see these officers often. we reach out more than most members do to them. they are- put their lives on the line every day,--\n\nmargaret brennan: yes.\n\nsen. blunt: --particularly last wednesday. and i deeply resent any suggestion that these officers didn't do everything they could do.\n\nmargaret brennan: two republican senators have now called for the president to resign. should he?\n\nsen. blunt: well, it would be up to him, but my- my view would be what the president should do is now finish the last 10 days of his presidency.\n\nmargaret brennan: so no?\n\nsen. blunt: no.\n\nmargaret brennan: your fellow republicans have been quite critical, including liz cheney, including mitt romney, who called this an insurrection and said that the president was directly involved. justice department affidavits have individuals saying they came here because the president told him- them to. is the president a danger to the country?\n\nsen. blunt: well, i think the president's decisions and his actions that day and leading up to that day on this topic were clearly reckless. i said that very early in the evening on wednesday, that this was a tragic day for the- the country and the president had some- had involvement in that. but--\n\nmargaret brennan: are republican leaders going to hold them accountable in any way for it?\n\nsen. blunt: well, i think the country is the- the right way to hold presidents accountable. the president should be very careful over the next 10 days that his behavior is what you'd expect from the leader of the greatest country in the world. now, my personal view is that the president touched the hot stove on wednesday and is unlikely to touch it again. and if that's the case, i think- we- we get- every day, we get closer to the last day of his presidency. we should be thinking more about the first day of the next presidency than the last day of his presidency, in my view. and i'll be there on that day as the chairman of that event seeing the new president sworn in. the- president trump says he's not coming.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsen. blunt: i hope vice president pence does, and i was proud to see the vice president step up as i was standing there right with him as one of the four members of congress that count those electoral ballots and do what the law required us to do.\n\nmargaret brennan: right, but your fellow missouri senator, josh hawley, was on the other side of that. do you think that he was complicit, along with the five other senators who continued to propagate this lie, that there could be a change to the outcome of the election on wednesday?\n\nsen. blunt: well- well, i only have one vote in the senate, which is my vote. now i did- the day senator hawley announced he'd be contesting those electoral votes, announced that i would not be. when senator cruz said he had a plan to put in case- put back in- in place a commission like the one formed in 1877--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsen. blunt: --i said that wouldn't happen. i'm not- i wasn't interested then or now in spending a lot of time on things that can't happen--\n\nmargaret brennan: so no sanction?\n\nsen. blunt: --just like the impeachment- just like the impeachment of the president, to remove him from office clearly is not going to happen between now and the last day he's in office. and that's another thing--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you don't support- you don't believe he has committed an impeachable offense?\n\nsen. blunt: i don't think there's any- that's not really the question. the question is--\n\nmargaret brennn: well, it's my question.\n\nsen. blunt: --is there any- is there any- well, i'm giving you my answer. is there any likelihood that he could possibly be removed between now and january the 20th? and if there's no additional ensuing event my- my belief is there is no possibility of that.\n\nmargaret brennan: ok.\n\nsen. blunt: and so, as nancy pelosi just said, and as jim clyburn said--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsen. blunt: --earlier today, this is more of a long term punishment of the president--\n\nmargaret brennan: yes.\n\nsen. blunt: --than trying to remove him from office. that's when--\n\nmargaret brennan: that's right.\n\nsen. blunt: --the politics take over and the protecting the government is left behind.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. we'll see if you have a different answer in the new congress. sir, thank you for your time this morning.
in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic — which is believed to have first spread to humans at a wet market in wuhan, china, where live animals were sold for food — china has created new guidelines on which animals can be bred for eating. in one significant change, the rules reclassify dogs as pets rather than livestock.\n\nthe move signals an official turn against dog meat consumption, and animal welfare activists hope it will lead to an outright ban of the practice.\n\nthe chinese ministry of agriculture and rural affairs said wednesday that dogs would no longer be considered livestock, meaning they cannot be bred for food, milk, fur, fiber, medicine, or for military or sports purposes.\n\nin a memo explaining its choices, the ministry listed the progress of human civilization and the public's concern for animal welfare as reasons for reclassifying dogs as companion animals from traditional domestic animals. it also said that dogs are not considered livestock elsewhere around the world, and china now aims to follow those global standards.\n\nthe draft, which details which animals are allowed to be bred for meat, medical and other uses, lists 18 traditional livestock species, such as cattle, sheep, horses and chickens and 13 special species such as reindeer, alpacas, ostriches and foxes. the ministry is now seeking public comments on the guidelines by may 8, before they are finalized.\n\nresearchers believe the novel coronavirus originated in bats and then passed through another species to humans at a wet market in wuhan, where the outbreak was first detected in december. since then, covid-19 has infected more than 1.6 million people worldwide and caused over 100,000 deaths.\n\nin january, china temporarily banned the breeding and trading of wild animals during the pandemic, but it will soon resume the practice under the revised guidelines.\n\nwhile dog meat remains a delicacy in some regions, it has become increasingly less popular. last month, the city of shenzhen became the first in the country to ban its consumption.\n\nhealth officials suspect covid-19 originated from animals in chinese wet markets, where exotic live animals, from marmots to muntjacs, are sold. around the world, they remain open -- a grave concern to infectious disease experts. here's @ramyinocencio https://t.co/gvmrstqtma pic.twitter.com/ryo9n8tpbq — cbs evening news (@cbseveningnews) april 9, 2020\n\nhumane society international (hsi) called the new guidelines a potential game-changer moment for other cities in china to follow shenzhen's lead and outright ban the consumption of cats and dogs.\n\nthis is the first time we've ever seen china's national government explain that dogs are companion animals, dr. peter li, china policy specialist at hsi, said in a press release. recognizing that dogs hold a special bond with humans is an essential first step towards eliminating the consumption and trade in dog meat. this could be a pivotal moment that provides encouragement for other cities across the country to follow shenzhen's lead to ban the eating of dogs and cats.\n\naccording to hsi, around 30 million dogs are killed each year for meat in asia, despite warnings from the world health organization that their trade spreads rabies and other health risks.\n\ntens of millions of dogs and cats every year, mostly stolen pets, suffer for the meat trade which is almost entirely fueled by crime and, perhaps most significantly right now, poses an undeniable human health threat with the risk of diseases such as rabies and cholera, li said.\n\nwhile hsi applauded the move, it remains concerned about the other animals on the list, both in terms of welfare and disease prevention.\n\nrebranding wildlife as livestock doesn't alter the fact that there are insurmountable challenges to keeping these species in commercial captive breeding environments, and that their welfare needs simply can't be met, said dr. teresa telecky, vice president of wildlife at hsi. in addition, there's clear evidence that some of these species can act as intermediate hosts of viruses, such as covid-19, which is why we're urging governments around the world to stop trading in wildlife.
washington — immigration lawyers and advocates are denouncing president trump's proposal to reopen the government, saying the bill includes major restrictionist changes to the nation's immigration system.\n\nthis bill is a stephen miller special, aaron reichlin-melnick, a policy analyst at the american immigration council, told cbs news, referring to the white house senior adviser, who is an immigration hardliner.\n\nthe white house promised a bipartisan compromise that would move the action forward — and instead you get a radical, restrictionist dream led by stephen miller, reichlin-melnick added. this is a bill that stephen miller would be proud to pass.\n\non saturday, the president unveiled what he billed as a compromise on immigration that would end the partial government shutdown. mr. trump said he would support legislation to extend temporary immigration protections for deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) and temporary protected status (tps) holders if congress approves $5.7 billion in funding to construct a barrier along the southern border and bolster security. daca shields approximately 700,000 young undocumented immigrants from deportation. immigrants with tps are temporarily allowed to live in the u.s. because of conflict or natural disasters in their native countries.\n\nbut reichlin-melnick and other immigration attorneys said the more than 1,300-page legislation supported by the president and republicans is anything but a compromise. in fact, they believe the bill would make it more difficult for unaccompanied migrant children from central america to seek asylum in the u.s., gut several tps programs and make it easier for the government to strip protections from daca recipients.\n\nunder the proposal, unaccompanied minors from the northern triangle — composed of guatemala, honduras and el salvador — would be barred from seeking asylum near the u.s.-mexico border. instead, the u.s. government would establish processing centers in these three central american countries where children could apply for asylum.\n\nthe government would have approximately eight months to establish these centers — a time period in which the asylum process for central american children could potentially come to a halt, reichlin-melnick said. additionally, the bill would lower the number of applications that could be accepted each year to 50,000. and the government would be able to approve 15,000 asylum grants. more than 50,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended near the southwestern border in fiscal year 2018, according to customs and border protection (cbp) figures.\n\nunder current u.s. immigration law, reichlin-melnick noted, unaccompanied migrant minors from central america and countries which do not border the u.s. are usually provided heightened protection and given a court hearing when they apply for asylum. this is to ensure that children are not returned to a location where they fear harm and fear trafficking, he said.\n\nbut reichlin-melnick said the proposed legislation would allow the government to deport migrant children from central america without giving them the option to apply for asylum, unless immigration officers determine that it is more probable than not that they would be eligible for asylum or more probable than not that they would be trafficked in their native countries.\n\nthis would allow children to be sent back to their home countries if there's a 49 percent chance that they're going to be trafficked, he said.\n\nthe bill would also fundamentally change tps programs for el salvador, honduras, haiti and nicaragua, which the courts have blocked the trump administration from terminating. sarah pierce, a policy analyst at the migration policy institute, said the white house's proposal would bar undocumented immigrants from being eligible for these tps protections — a criteria which has not been in place before. the idea that they are permanently changing the temporary protected status program to make it so you have to be lawfully present unfortunately really guts the purpose of that program, pierce told cbs news.\n\nthe provision in the proposal to grant daca recipients provisional protected presence differs from the obama-era program which has been kept alive by the courts, attorneys said. the proposal would allow those who are currently enrolled in the program to apply for a three-year nonrenewable immigration relief. daca permits are renewable every three years.\n\ndaca recipients would also not be automatically protected by the proposed legislation and would need to provide the government more evidence to be approved for this new protection, which reichlin-melnick said would also cost more to apply to for. he added that the bill would give the government more leeway to reject applications.\n\nthey've increased the burden of proof on applicants, reichlin-melnick said.\n\nthe bill would implement a minimum income requirement for the new provisional protected presence, as well as a public charge consideration. like another proposed rule being crafted by the department of homeland security (dhs), under the public charge rule, the government would take into account the amount of federal assistance used by immigrants when processing change of status applications. although daca recipients, who are undocumented immigrants, are barred from most government welfare programs, some states like california, new york and new jersey offer so-called dreamers certain benefits, like in-state tuition and state financial aid for college.\n\nsenators are scheduled to vote on the president's proposal — as well as on the funding bill passed by the democratic-controlled house which does not include mr. trump's border wall funding demand — on thursday afternoon. both proposals currently lack enough support to pass.
los angeles -- ed heinlein surveys the steep mountainside that has repeatedly unleashed tons of mud into the backyard of his southern california home since a 2014 wildfire and still hopes the drought-stricken state gets more rain.\n\nwe have to have the rain, said heinlein, whose home east of los angeles has become a poster child for the region's cycle of fire and flood. it's bad for us but it's desperate for the state.\n\nresidents had hoped that el nino would drench california with enough water to end the drought that is now in its fifth year.\n\nbut so far, the periodic ocean-warming phenomenon has left much of the state in the dust, delivering a few quick storms but not yet bringing the legendary rain linked to past el ninos.\n\nwinter, especially in the southern half of the state, has been dry with summerlike heat suitable for a day at the beach or patio dining.\n\nthe national weather service says last month was the warmest february in san diego since record-keeping began in 1875. in los angeles it was the second-warmest on the books.\n\ntemperatures hit 80 degrees or higher on 11 days during the month in downtown los angeles.\n\nlack of precipitation has been similarly extreme: only .79 inch fell downtown, just 21 percent of february's normal 3.8 inches. since oct. 1 only 4.99 inches have fallen, nearly 6 inches less than the 10.96 inches normally accumulated by this time.\n\nrain and snowfall in the weeks ahead would have to be extensive to make up lost ground and ease the drought - even with the current forecast of a series of early march storms heading directly toward california.\n\nscientists say a dome of high pressure has kept the el nino storm track well to the north, helping build vital snowpacks in the sierra nevada and elsewhere in west but leaving the southern half of the golden state mostly hot and very dry.\n\nthe lack of rain has made it easy to think of el nino as having come and gone.\n\nwe were ready for it, said megan mcateer, 32, as she pushed a stroller carrying her 4-month-old son through the los feliz neighborhood of los angeles on a sunny day. i was looking forward to (rain) because it's nice to be inside and be all cozy sometimes.\n\nskiers celebrated a long-awaited coating of snow in southern california's mountains earlier this year but have since watched it melt away.\n\ntemporarily closed. waiting for new snow, the mountain high ski resort northeast of los angeles posted sunday on facebook, two days after mount waterman to the west stopped running its lifts.\n\nthe wait for fresh snow may not be long, however.\n\nthe national weather service predicts a major change in the pattern by week's end as the jet stream finally takes aim at california with a series of storms expected to bring extensive rain, mountain snow, high winds and big surf.\n\nmarch has come in like a lamb but it's going to show its teeth and transform into a lion by the time we get into early next week, meteorologist mark moede said in a video briefing from the san diego office of the weather service.\n\nauthorities responsible for preparing citizens for bad weather, especially vulnerable populations such as the elderly and homeless, haven't been idle during the dry period.\n\nwe're hosting seminars, workshops, training, and we hope that people will find the time to get prepared because when these disasters hit there's no advance notice, said ken kondo, spokesman for the los angeles county office of emergency management.\n\nheinlein, the azusa resident plagued by debris flows, noted on a hot afternoon early this week that el nino may still prove to be a bust.\n\nbut if i had to bet money i would just say it's the calm before the storm, he said.
you may remember the pictures from the water crisis five years ago in flint, michigan. hundreds of angry residents holding up bottles of rust-colored water and demanding answers. months of protests were waved off by officials who denied anything was wrong. the turning point came when a local pediatrician found conclusive proof that the children of flint were being exposed to high levels of lead in their water and prompted the state to declare an emergency. now, that same doctor is working to solve a mystery that still worries parents in flint: what lasting damage did the water do to their kids? tonight, you will hear her initial findings which she says are worse than she feared. but we begin with the legacy of flint's water crisis.\n\ncars line up for bottled water in flint, michigan. cbs news\n\nonce a week, hundreds of cars line up for bottled water at the greater holy temple church of god in flint.\n\nsandra jones is in command. she is a pastor's wife with the voice of a four-star general. jones keeps the cars moving and the water coming. each family is allowed four cases of water. on this day, they gave away 36,000 bottles.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: it just strikes me. it's been five years and you're still doing this.\n\nsandra jones: five years. and-- and the thing about it is it's not lightening up. i could see it if it was lightening up. but it isn't.\n\nit is not. the state stopped giving away bottled water two years ago because it said the water is safe. sandra jones relies on donations of water.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: what's it been like?\n\nlarry marshall: it's been kinda hard…\n\nlarry marshall was second in line. the widowed father of four got here at 5 a.m. he's been waiting five hours for water.\n\nlarry marshall: water should be a basic necessity that -- we shouldn't have to wait or stand in line for, you know. this is not a third world country. but we're living like one.\n\nmarshall, like many in flint, still refuses to drink tap water.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and if they come to you the city or the state and they say, you're drinking water's safe. are you gonna believe them?\n\nlarry marshall: no. they lie so much and we know they lie, and i-- when they say something, it's like-- talking to the wind, you know. i don't believe nothing they say. none of the politicians, none of them.\n\nflint, once a prosperous hub of the american auto industry was nearly bankrupt back in 2014. officials hoped to save money by switching the city water source from the great lakes to the flint river.\n\nalmost immediately, residents began noticing something wasn't right. the water was rust colored and many people had rashes.\n\nbut michigan's department of environmental quality and the city insisted the water in flint is safe. later, a state investigation found those officials hid the fact that the river water was not treated with chemicals that would prevent the pipes from corroding. so, for months the water ate away at flint's old pipes, releasing lead into residents' tap water.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: they were poisoned. i mean they were poisoned by this water. they were all exposed to toxic water.\n\npediatrician dr. mona hanna-attisha fought for answers to the city's water crisis. cbs news\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha is a pediatrician in flint, who her patients call dr. mona.\n\ndr. mona is a bit of a superhero herself here because she was the first to link the water to high levels of lead in the children of flint.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: so within a few months of-- of being on this water, general motors, which was born in flint, and still has plants in flint, noticed that this water, our drinking water, was corroding their engine parts. let's pause. like, the drinking (laugh) water was corroding engine parts. so they were allowed to go back to great lakes water.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: didn't anybody at that point say, if it's corroding an engine, maybe this shouldn't be going into our bodies, into our kids?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: i mean that should have been like fire alarm bells. like, red flags.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: so what did it take before your-- it-- your eyes opened about this?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: yeah. it-- it-- it was the word lead.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: because the word lead, when you're a physician or a pediatrician signals what in your brain?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: there is no safe level of lead. we're never supposed to expose a population or a child to lead. because we can't do much about it. it is an irreversible neurotoxin. it attacks the core of what it means to be you, and impacts cognition-- how children think. actually drops iq levels. it impacts behavior, leading to things like developmental delays. and it has these life-altering consequences.\n\nin 2015, dr. mona and a colleague started digging through blood test records of 1,700 flint children. including the kids she sees at the hurley children's clinic.\n\nthe non-profit clinic serves most of flint's kids. the city is 53% black and has one of the highest poverty rates in the country.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: so we looked at the children's blood lead levels before the water switch. and we compared them to the children's blood lead levels after the water switch. and in the areas where the water lead levels were the highest, in those parts of the city, we saw the greatest increase in children's lead levels.\n\narmed with the first medical evidence that kids were being exposed to lead from the water, dr. mona did something controversial. she quickly held a press conference to share the blood test study, before other doctors reviewed her work.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: so it was a bit of an academic no-no. kind of a form of academic disobedience. but i l--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and you knew that?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: i-- i knew that. but, like, but there was no choice-- there was no way i was going to wait to have this this research vetted.\n\nsamples of flint's drinking water proved to be filled with disease-causing bacteria, carcinogens, and lead. cbs news\n\ntwo weeks later, michigan governor rick snyder ordered the water switched back to the great lakes and declared a state of emergency.\n\nrick snyder at state of the state: i say tonight as i have before i am sorry and i will fix it.\n\nbut the damage was done. dr. mona estimates 14,000 kids in flint under the age of six may have been exposed to lead in their water.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: i never should have had to do the research that literally used the blood of our children as detectors of environmental contamination.\n\nthree years after the crisis began, the percentage of third graders in flint who passed michigan's standardized literacy test dropped from 41% to 10%.\n\nkenyatta dotson: i'm very concerned about my children. and not only my children, but i'm concerned about the children of flint.\n\nkenyatta dotson is still fearful of the water, even though the state is spending more than $300 million to fix the water system.\n\nthe city promised to replace all 12,000 supply lines that may have been contaminated with lead by last fall. now, they say the work won't be done until summer.\n\ndotson says she and her daughters will continue to use bottled water for cooking and brushing their teeth.\n\nkenyatta dotson: i need time to come back to a place where i feel whole again.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: you don't feel whole right now?\n\nkenyatta dotson: oh no.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: would this have happened in a rich, white suburb?\n\nkenyatta dotson: maybe it would've happened in-- in a rich, white suburb. would it have continued for as long as it has? i don't believe so.\n\nflint resident gladyes williamson (c) holds a bottle full of contaminated water, and a clump of her hair, alongside jessica owens (r), holding a baby bottle full of contaminated water, during a news conference after attending a house oversight and government reform committee hearing on the flint, michigan water crisis on capitol hill february 3, 2016 in washington, dc. getty\n\nwe found many parents in flint still bathe their young children with bottled water -- first warmed on the stove then brought to the tub.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: when i'm in clinic-- almost every day-- a mom asks me, is my kid gonna be okay? so that's a number one kind of anxiety and-- and concern right now--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: how do you answer that?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: oh, i-- i sit down. i sometimes hold their hand. and i reassure my patients and their parents just as i would before the crisis… to keep doing everything that you're supposed to be doing to promote your children's development.\n\nin january of 2019, she launched the flint registry, the first comprehensive look at the thousands of kids exposed to lead in flint. the goal of the federal and state-funded program is to track the health of those kids and get them the help they need.\n\nthe registry refers hundreds of kids to specialists who conduct 8 hours of neuro-psychological assessments of their behavior and development.\n\ndr. mona shared her preliminary findings with 60 minutes.\n\nbefore the crisis, about 15% of the kids in flint required special education services. but of the 174 children who went through the extensive neuro-exams, specialists determined that 80% will require help for a language, learning or intellectual disorder.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: what are you gonna do?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: so there's not much we can do. so there's no magic pill. there's no antidote. there's no cure. we can't take away this exposure. but incredible science has taught us that there's a lot we can do to promote the health and development of children and that's exactly what we're doing.\n\nthrough the registry, already 2,000 flint children who were exposed to lead have been connected to services such as speech and occupational therapy, which some may need for the rest of their lives.\n\nthe city of flint water plant is illuminated by moonlight on january 23, 2016 in flint, michigan. brett carlsen / getty images\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: but we also realized that our research, our science, this data and facts was also an underestimation of the exposure.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: why underestimated?\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: because we were looking at blood lead data done as part of these surveillance programs, which are done at the ages of 1 and 2. lead in water impacts a younger age group. it impacts the unborn.\n\nto determine that impact, dr. mona turned to a novel technique developed by dr. manish arora at new york's mount sinai hospital. he examines baby teeth. baby teeth begin to grow in utero.\n\ndr. manish arora: and just like growth rings in trees, every day a tooth forms a ring. and anything that we're exposed to in our diet, what we eat, what we breathe, what we drink gets trapped in those growth rings.\n\na laser cuts through the tooth to analyze whether lead is embedded in the growth rings of teeth. dr. mona has sent teeth from 49 flint kids to be analyzed. this was a scan on the tooth of a child who was 6 months old when the water source switched in flint.\n\ndr. manish arora: as we hit that six month mark where the--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: oh, my gosh--\n\ndr. manish arora: --water-- the water supply was change, you can see how--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: look at that.\n\ndr. manish arora: you can see how the lead levels go up and then they just keep-- keep going up as more and more lead's entering the body.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: it shoots straight up.\n\ndr. manish arora: exactly.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: wow.\n\nfor the first time, researchers can pinpoint to the day, even before birth, when a child was exposed to lead from the water and at what levels. those early years are a critical time for brain development.\n\nas we were following dr. mona's work in flint, another american city was forced to hand out cases of water. testing on the drinking water in newark, new jersey, found lead levels four times higher than the federal limit. in some places, higher than flint. newark officials were warned about it's water more than two years ago.\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: newark, new jersey is like living flint all over again. if we cannot guarantee that all kids have access to safe drinking water, not just privileged kids, but all kids have access to safe drinking water. that's just one issue. like, who are we?\n\nsharyn alfonsi: this is not isolated to flint--\n\ndr. mona hanna-attisha: this is-- this is an everywhere story. this is an america story.\n\nlast month, we made another visit to flint to check in with sandra jones.\n\nshe was still in command despite temperatures in the single digits. hundreds in flint are still coming to her church parking lot for their weekly supply of water, more than five years after the crisis began.\n\nproduced by guy campanile and lucy hatcher. broadcast associate, cristina gallotto.

it happened yesterday … the passing of a woman who did nothing less than change the course of american history.\n\nnorma mccorvey died yesterday at an assisted living center in katy, texas, of heart disease.\n\nand while the name might not ring a bell, it was under the pseudonym jane roe that mccorvey became involved in one of the most far-reaching lawsuits of the 20th century: roe v. wade.\n\nwe must link, arm in arm, to protect and uphold the right to safe and legal abortion, she said at a press conference.\n\nmccorvey was a 22-year-old unwed mother when she became pregnant again in 1969. abortion was illegal in texas, so she filed suit against the state, which was represented by dallas county district attorney henry wade.\n\nroe v. wade made it all the way to the u.s. supreme court, which issued its decision on january 22, 1973, legalizing abortions in a landmark ruling.\n\nby then, mccorvey had already given birth and put her daughter up for adoption. but the law gave millions of women the right to choose.\n\nas for mccorvey, she later underwent a religious conversion, and would ultimately regret her earlier position.\n\ni'm on what i call the right side of the movement now, because i'm fighting for life, instead of death, she told an interviewer later in life. when asked if she thought roe v. wade would be overturned, she replied, yes, i hope so.\n\nthe law has been a flashpoint ever since, and is sure to be front and center next month, when confirmation hearings begin for president trump's supreme court nominee neil gorsuch.\n\nnorma mccorvey, forever immortalized as jane roe, was 69.
vicksburg, miss. --even before escaping from jail on wednesday, rafael mccloud was perhaps the most well-known accused criminal in warren county, miss.\n\nlocal and federal officials are currently hunting mccloud, accused of rape, murder and other crimes, after he escaped from warren county jail wednesday. police say he used a homemade knife to corner a jail employee, stealing the person's uniform, keys and radio, before fleeing.\n\nit was a stunning turn in a story that warren county district attorney richard smith, jr., said had already garnered the most attention of just about any case that i have dealt with.\n\nkuhn memorial state hospital cbs affiliate wjtv\n\nmccloud is accused in the june 28, 2015 killing of 69-year-old sharon wilson, whose body was discovered by a group of so-called ghost hunters exploring a notorious, nearly two century old, abandoned hospital. police told 48 hours' crimesiderin june that the ghost hunters found wilson's body in tall brush just outside the kuhn memorial state hospital.\n\nthey had seen blood inside the building, and followed its path -- along which police said at the time wilson was likely dragged -- down a flight of stairs and out of the building.\n\nmccloud was arrested that day, allegedly driving mccloud's car. smith said wilson's ordeal began the night before, when mccloud allegedly showed up at wilson's house.\n\nhe entered her home at night, held her against her will throughout the night and during that period of time sexually assaulted her, smith said. authorities believe mccloud and wilson previously knew each other only in passing.\n\nhe may have done some yard work for her in the past, smith said.\n\npolice believe mccloud ransacked wilson's home, then brought her to kuhn, where she was shot and killed.\n\nthe crime shocked the small town just east of the louisiana border, along the mississippi river, and the unique circumstances of the discovery of wilson's body drew national attention. mccloud became something of a household name among vicksburg residents, which the town's police chief, walter armstrong, says may help authorities catch him.\n\nthey're very familiar with who he is around here, because the initial crime got front page news and was on tv for weeks, armstrong said.\n\nauthorities said in june that mccloud admitted some involvement in killing wilson, but he pleaded not guilty after being indicted in january on charges of capital murder, sexual battery, rape, arson, home invasion, being a felon in possession of a firearm and grand larceny auto theft, records show. his trial is scheduled to begin in june.\n\nnow, dozens of officers from local, state and federal agencies are searching for the suspect, who is believed to still be armed with at least the knife he used to escape.\n\narmstrong said thursday that authorities spent the morning following up on leads developed wednesday night. mccloud hasn't been captured, but police have recovered the green pants mccloud wore when he escaped.\n\nhe had to have gotten a change of clothing somehow. we don't know if it's through help or if he got the clothes through some other means, armstrong said. he added that police received phone calls on both wednesday and thursday from people who believed they spotted mccloud.\n\nall of the calls came from within vicksburg, and armstrong indicated he believes mccloud would need help to get out of town.\n\nrafael would not be able to go anywhere without somebody aiding him, because he doesn't have any money, he doesn't have transportation, armstrong said.
coronavirus precautions were already popping up in hollywood: no handshakes or selfies signs were posted outside the room where vin diesel was promoting his new movie. tv shows started taping without live audiences. south by southwest, the sprawling film and music festival, was canceled outright.\n\nthat was before wednesday night, when tom hanks and rita wilson told the world they had tested positive for coronavirus. by thursday morning, everything had changed.\n\nthe entertainment industry went into full retreat. productions were halted. film releases, from f9 to mulan, were delayed. more festivals were canceled. there was not a sector of the entertainment business left untouched by the unprecedented decisions made thursday to try to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nthe hanks news really marked a turning point, said richard rushfield, the editor of the entertainment industry newsletter the ankler.\n\nnot only did it make the virus seem more real to some people, rushfield said the fact that hanks was shooting a movie at the time also had a business implication.\n\nit sunk in that all production was going to have to cease, he said.\n\nnow everyone is trying to mitigate the damage and move forward, but there are challenges everywhere. there are crews who suddenly don't have jobs. some up-and-coming filmmakers now have no festival platform to debut their work and no guarantee that they'll be accepted next year. studios have spent big bucks on ads for movies that now won't hit theaters for six months or more. and frustrated theater owners, already in a precarious position, are wondering if they can survive without blockbusters, or crowds.\n\nall my clients have been touched by this at this point in varying degrees, said veteran publicist michele robertson. we're figuring out what are we able to do. phoners? what's in-person and when? basically, i've been on the phone a lot, but it's all been measured and forward thinking.\n\nfor some, it was too late to change course. movies like universal's the hunt, sony's bloodshot and the indie never rarely sometimes always are still opening in theaters this weekend. that's placed stars and filmmakers in the tricky position of promoting their films while also encouraging people to be safe.\n\nit's hard to encourage people to come, right, because you don't want to be selfish in the sense of 'i want you to come and have a good time.' but i also don't want to put you in a dangerous situation, said bloodshot actress eiza gonzález last week. it puts you in a really difficult situation.\n\nfor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nreese witherspoon and kerry washington did interviews as planned thursday for their hulu series little fires everywhere, which has the distinction (and benefit) of being a show that audiences can watch from their home.\n\nit's hard to say, 'oh, hey, watch a tv show. maybe, it'll make it better.' we want to be very sincere about that. we're not trying to pitch our wares, witherspoon said. but i do think there is an important time for entertainment.\n\nfor delayed and upcoming releases, studios have gone into overdrive trying to navigate the new reality of quarantines, school closures and social distancing.\n\nwe are all struggling to wrap our heads around this, said lisa schwartz, the co-president of ifc films and sundance selects. we're getting on the phone every two hours with senior management discussing what's happening and trying to be as responsible and responsive as we can in the face of a lot of uncertainty.\n\nifc films is pushing back the theatrical release of hirokazu kore-eda's the truth, with catherine deneuve, juliette binoche and ethan hawke. at the same time, it's also leveraging its own streaming service, ifc films unlimited, to provide in-home options for entertainment.\n\nit's been interesting to watch in the last two weeks an uptick in people seeking more in-home entertainment, schwartz said, adding the company is tailoring its social advertising to reflect what people are talking about. this week the conversation is about limiting travel and not being able to go to europe, so we're going to do posts about our films like 'the trip' and 'the trip to italy.' we're trying to remind people that there are ways to escape even if they are home-based.\n\nbut there are more unknowns than anything else and everyone is clinging to the hope that when the dust settles, business will return to normal.\n\nwe'll see how long it lasts and how devastating it is or isn't at the end of the day, said one major studio distribution executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. hopefully when things get a little back to normal, people will be rushing out to theaters because they haven't been there in a while.\n\nthere is the very real possibility that some theaters might not survive a few months without revenue.\n\nall this is happening in the context of an industry that was already weakened, rushfield said. there is no slack in the business to absorb this.\n\nyet in the disruption, rushfield said, we may finally get an answer to the question that has been vexing the theatrical business for years.\n\na lot of analysts have been talking about how the old theatrical model is outdated and streaming is the future of hollywood, he said. now we get a chance to see how that works out.
new york -- thursday's winter storm pummeled the tri-state area, but imagine being in the thick of it on a cruise ship in the atlantic ocean. for 21 members of the ross family, of stony brook, it was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, cbs new york reports.\n\nthey were cruising to the bahamas for their patriarch's 80th birthday. instead, they returned friday after what they called a nightmare onboard the norwegian breakaway.\n\ni thought i'd never be in a situation where i would say that's the scariest moment of my life. this was the worst moment of my life, said karoline ross, speaking exclusively with cbs new york.\n\nshe and del ross spoke with the station while they were en route to new york, after they said their 4,000 passenger cruise ship sailed right into the storm tuesday night for two harrowing days in ocean swells up to 30 feet. the seasoned boaters called it traumatic.\n\nwhen you're on a boat in the middle of the ocean and water is pouring down the stairs, you're thinking 'this is not going to end well, karoline said.\n\nour room was full on two inches of water. the elevator shafts were dripping water everywhere, del said.\n\nwater poured from the ceiling, as the ship began leaking. passengers described panic and seasickness on social media. dozens huddled in the ship's atrium to sleep.\n\nthere were people crying, everyone was throwing up. it was a nightmare, said olivia ross. it was so tilted i was shaking.\n\nthe family said there was broken glass everywhere and the showers were exploding.\n\ni'm completely traumatized. i'll never go on any type of boat again in my life after this, fellow passenger emma franzese told cbs new york once the ship docked.\n\ni was holding on for dear life. i honestly wasn't sure we were going to make it through the night. the boat was tilted like crazy, said passenger conor vogt.\n\neverything fell off our shelf, glasses broke in the middle of the night. there was no announcement made, passenger luisa franzese said.\n\ncbs new york asked norwegian cruise line why the decision was made to sail back to new york in the middle of what was forecast to be a monster coastal storm.\n\nthe cruise line initially released a statement, apologizing to travelers that were delayed for the company's next embarkment, but made no mention of those who weathered the storm:\n\ndue to winter storm grayson, norwegian breakaway will have a delayed arrival into new york today. as a result, norwegian breakaway's 14 day cruise that was originally scheduled to depart on january 5, will now depart on saturday, january 6, at 3 p.m. due to the ship's late arrival today, and the ongoing weather situation, embarking guests are encouraged to arrive to the pier on saturday morning. all guests must be onboard by 1 p.m. on january 6. guests unable to adjust their travel are welcome to board on friday evening between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. the ship will now sail a slightly adjusted itinerary, which will be communicated to guests onboard. all guests will receive a refund of one day of their cruise fare, in the form of an onboard credit. we sincerely thank our guests for their understanding of this unexpected change due to the weather and apologize to our guests for any disruption to their schedule, the statement said.\n\nthey later sent a second statement:\n\nduring the early morning hours of january 4, norwegian breakaway encountered stronger than forecasted weather conditions due to winter storm grayson during the trip's return to new york from the bahamas. all guests and crew are safe. we sincerely apologize to our guests for these stronger than expected weather conditions and any resulting discomfort they may have experienced.\n\nthe captain should've told us a little more. he kept saying, 'we're in rough seas.' well no crap we're in rough seas, passenger brenda wriedt said.\n\nelizabeth vogt, of the upper east side, praised the crew.\n\nsome of them were scared, but they put on a really happy face, she said, but added the ordeal was terrifying. i flew across the room, landed in the bathroom, and then i got up, i got into my bed and said a prayer. that's how i felt that night.\n\nback on terra firma, the ross family said they will be asking for a refund for nine stateroom, but what they really want are answers.\n\nhe took all our lives in his hands, and we were really in a bad spot. it was really horrible, karoline said.\n\nit's more about revenue. it wasn't so much about safety, said del. we were dead center of the storm, and i really think it was a poor decision.\n\nif they knew the storm was coming in, they should've already just taken us back. we'd rather get home a day early than have to go through something like this, fellow passenger barbara stevenson-felder said.\n\nthe breakaway was supposed to embark on another cruise from the west side on friday, but instead will leave saturday.\n\ncbs new york reached out to other cruise lines, including royal caribbean, which said its ships were safely south of the storm when it hit.
washington — senate minority leader chuck schumer, who will take over as the chamber's majority leader in the coming weeks, laid out tuesday the agenda the new democrat-controlled senate will pursue once president-elect joe biden is sworn into office, setting as the first priority the approval of another coronavirus emergency relief package with $2,000 checks to the american people.\n\nschumer detailed the issues the senate will take up in a letter to his democratic colleagues, which include legislation to address climate change, improve the health care and child care systems, and fix income inequality. the new york democrat also said the senate will also pursue immigration, democracy and criminal justice reforms.\n\nbut topping the agenda for the democrat-controlled senate will be coronavirus relief legislation that includes $2,000 direct payments to americans. congress passed another emergency package at the end of 2020 that included $600 checks, but efforts to boost the payments — pushed by president trump and democrats — failed.\n\nas you know from our work at the end of the last congress, the job of covid emergency relief is far from complete, schumer told senators. democrats wanted to do much more in the last bill and promised to do more, if given the opportunity, to increase direct payments to a total of $2,000 — we will get that done.\n\nschumer said the senate will also provide further support for vaccine distribution and assistance for american families, small businesses, school and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nmr. biden, too, has vowed that another coronavirus relief measure will be a foremost priority for him once he is sworn in january 20.\n\nworking with president-elect biden and our house democratic colleagues, the u.s. senate will finally address the major challenges facing our country that have too long been ignored, schumer said.\n\ndemocrats secured their razor-thin majority in the senate after jon ossoff and raphael warnock unseated incumbent republican senators david perdue and kelly loeffler, respectively, in georgia's january 5 runoff elections. with the senate split 50-50, vice president-elect kamala harris will be the tie-breaking vote, giving democrats an edge.\n\nschumer will take over as majority leader as the congress grapples with the effects of the january 6 assault on the u.s. capitol, during which a pro-trump mob violently pushed its way into the capitol building. the deadly attack led to the evacuation of both the house and senate and has given way to questions about the preparedness of u.s. capitol police.\n\nschumer said the security failures were unacceptable and pledged that the events would be fully investigated and every necessary security measure taken for mr. biden's inauguration inauguration in just over a week.\n\nthe physical and emotional damage done by these domestic terrorists to the u.s. capitol and all who lived through it was despicable. the loss of life that occurred as a result of this attack, including one capitol police officer, was needless and tragic, he said. as we continue to take action to address these events – including action to mitigate and hopefully remove the immediate and ongoing danger president trump poses to our country – we must remain vigilant against potential threats and future violence in the lead up to the inauguration.\n\nthe departments of homeland security and defense, as well as the u.s. secret service, are holding an all-senators briefing tuesday on security for the inauguration, and thousands of national guard members have been authorized ahead of the inauguration.\n\nthe core tenets of our system of government have been challenged, schumer said. 'violence descended on capitol hill, the sacred temple of our democracy. a once-in-a-century pandemic continues to devastate our nation. the work of the 117th congress will begin in the wake of a devastating attack, on the heels of a devastating year. \n\nthe senator said last week's riots underscore the need for mr. biden's nominees to key national security posts to be swiftly confirmed, including his picks to lead the departments of defense, homeland security, state and justice.
president-elect joe biden outlined his covid-19 relief proposal in wilmington, delaware, on thursday. the massive stimulus bill is expected to cost roughly $1.9 trillion to fund vaccinations and provide immediate, direct relief to working families and communities bearing the brunt of the crisis.\n\na crisis of deep human suffering is in plain sight, and there's no time to waste. we have to act and we have to act now, mr. biden said.\n\nthe president-elect said his plan is two-pronged — a rescue plan, which he outlined thursday night, and a recovery plan, which he will outline after he's in office. the vice president claims his rescue plan will lift millions of out poverty. mr. biden was expected to announce his vaccine rollout plan thursday night too, but said he will do so soon.\n\nincluded in mr. biden's relief plan are the following things:\n\n$1,400 checks to american adults (on top of the $600 congress already passed)\n\nboosting child tax credit to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for children under 6\n\nimplementing a $15 federal minimum wage\n\n$25 billion for child care centers\n\nexpanded paid sick, family and medical leave\n\nextend moratoriums on evictions\n\nthe relief push will also include $160 billion for a national vaccination program, funding to expand covid-19 testing, $170 billion for schools, $15 billion for the hardest-hit 1 million small businesses and $20 billion for the hardest-hit public transit agencies, among other things.\n\nu.s. president-elect joe biden speaks as he lays out his plan for combating the coronavirus and jump-starting the nation's economy at the queen theater january 14, 2021 in wilmington, delaware. alex wong / getty images\n\ni know what i just described does not come cheaply, the president-elect said, adding that failure to do so will cost us dearly.\n\nmr. biden took no questions from reporters after his speech.\n\nthe package is likely to pass congress, as democrats control the house and, once the georgia senate election results are certified, there will be a 50-50 party split in the senate, with vice president-elect kamala harris breaking any ties. some elements of the legislation, like the $1,400 stimulus checks, already have bipartisan support, but lobbying from congressional members and special interests could affect the package's overall price tag.\n\nmr. biden is also taking steps to accelerate the distribution of covid-19 vaccines once he takes office. the trump administration pledged to vaccinate 20 million americans by the end of 2020. however, two weeks into the new year, only over 10 million people have received their first dose of vaccine, according to the centers for disease control and prevention's covid data tracker.\n\nlast week, eight democratic governors sent a letter to health and human services secretary alex azar and army general gustave perna, who is in charge of overseeing vaccine distribution for operation warp speed, requesting that they accelerate the distribution of vaccines and not hold back doses in reserves while awaiting further shipments. on tuesday, azar announced several major changes to the federal government's vaccine distribution plan, including its decision to release a large supply of doses it had been withholding to ensure that vaccinated americans got their second dose.\n\nazar said the change was made possible because manufacturing capabilities are now in place to meet demand. we now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, with second doses being supplied by doses coming off of manufacturing lines with quality control, the secretary said. going forward, each week, doses available will be released to first cover the second doses and then cover additional first vaccinations.\n\nmr. biden has set a goal to vaccinate 100 million people during his first 100 days as president. i'm absolutely convinced that in 100 days, we can change the course of the disease and change life in america for the better, the president-elect said last month.\n\nmichael osterholm, an epidemiologist and member of biden's coronavirus advisory board, told cbs this morning on tuesday that he'd view it as an aspirational goal.\n\ni'd call it an aspirational goal and one i think we must strive for, osterholm said. we know right now that every day we don't have vaccine in people's arms, people are getting sick and dying. and so, i think every effort must be made to do that, and the team is behind him in every way they can to help make it a reality.
africa's richest fossil hominin site has revealed more of its treasure. it's been a year and a half since scientists announced that a new hominin species, which they called homo naledi, had been discovered in the rising star cave outside johannesburg.\n\nnow they say they have established and published the age of the original naledi fossils that garnered global headlines in 2015. homo naledi lived sometime between 335 and 236 thousand years ago, making it relatively young.\n\nthey've also announced the discovery of a second chamber in the rising star cave system, which contained additional homo naledi specimens. these include a child and the partial skeleton of an adult male with a well-preserved skull. they have named the skeleton neo – a sesotho word meaning a gift.\n\nthe conversation africa's science editor natasha joseph asked professor john hawks, a member of the team, to explain the story behind these finds.\n\nto an ordinary person, 236 000 years is a very long time ago. why does the team suggest that in fact, homo naledi is a young species?\n\nthe course of human evolution has taken the last seven million years since our ancestors diverged from those of chimpanzees and bonobos. the first two-thirds of that long history, called australopiths, were apelike creatures who developed the trick of walking upright on two legs.\n\naround two million years ago some varieties of hominins took the first real steps in a human direction. they're the earliest clear members of our genus, homo, and belong to species like homo habilis, homo erectus and homo rudolfensis.\n\nhomo naledi looks in many ways like these first members of homo. it's even more primitive than these species in many ways, and has a smaller brain than any of them. people outside our team who have studied the fossils mostly thought they should be around the same age. a few had the radical idea that h. naledi might have lived more recently, maybe around 900,000 years ago.\n\nnobody thought that these fossils could actually have come from the same recent time interval when modern humans were evolving, a mere 236 to 335 thousand years ago.\n\nhow do you figure out a fossil's age?\n\nwe applied six different methods. the most valuable of these were electron spin resonance (esr) dating, and uranium-thorium (u-th) dating. esr relies on the fact that teeth contain tiny crystals, and the electron energy in these crystals is affected by natural radiation in the ground over long periods of time after fossils are buried.\n\nu-th relies on the fact that water drips into caves and forms layers of calcite, which contain traces of uranium. the radioactive fraction of uranium decays into thorium slowly over time. so the proportion of thorium compared to uranium gives an estimate of the time since the calcite layers formed. one of these calcite deposits, called a flowstone, formed above the h. naledi fossils in the dinaledi chamber. that flowstone helps to establish the minimum age: the fossils must be older than the flowstone above them.\n\nfor these two methods, our team engaged two separate labs and asked them to process and analyse samples without talking to each other. their processes produced the same results. this gives us great confidence that the results are reliable.\n\nwhat does the discovery of homo naledi's age mean for our understanding of human history and evolution?\n\nfor at least the past 100 years, anthropologists have assumed that most of the evolution of homo was a story of progress: brains got bigger over time, technology became more sophisticated and teeth got smaller as people relied more upon cleverness to get better food and prepare it by cooking.\n\nwe thought that once culture really got started, our evolution was driven by a feedback loop – better food allowed bigger brains, more clever adaptations, more sophisticated communication. that enabled better technology, which yielded more food, and so on like a snowball rolling downhill.\n\nno other hominin species could compete with this human juggernaut. you would never see more than one form of human in a single part of the world, because the competition would be too intense. other forms, like neanderthals, existed within regions of the world apart from the mainstream leading to modern humans in africa. but even they were basically human with large brains.\n\nthat thinking was wrong.\n\nafrica south of the equator is the core of human evolutionary history. that's where today's human populations were most genetically diverse, and that diversity is just a small part of what once existed there. different lineages of archaic humans once lived in this region. anthropologists have found a few fossil remnants of these archaic populations. they've tried to connect those remnants in a straight line. but the genetic evidence suggests that they were much more complex, with deep divisions that occasionally intertwined.\n\nh. naledi shows a lineage that existed for probably more than a million years, maybe two million years, from the time it branched from our family tree up to the last 300,000 years. during all this time, it lived in africa with archaic lineages of humans, with the ancestors of modern humans, maybe with early modern humans themselves. it's strikingly different from any of these other human forms, so primitive in many aspects. it represents a lost hominin community within which our species evolved.\n\ni think we have to reexamine much of what we thought we knew about our shared evolutionary past in africa. we know a lot of information from a few very tiny geographic areas. but the largest parts of the continent are unknown – they have no fossil record at all.\n\n2017 explorers inside the rising star cave system. standing, left to right: mathabela tsikoane, maropeng ramalepa and dirk van rooyen; seated, left to right: steven tucker and rick hunter. wits university/marina elliott\n\nwe're working to change that, and as our team and others make new discoveries, i'm pretty sure we are going to find more lineages that have been hidden to us. h. naledi will not be the last.\n\nthe first homo naledi discoveries were made in the dinaledi chamber. what led researchers to the second chamber? and what did you find there?\n\nthe dinaledi chamber is one of the most significant fossil finds in history. after excavating only a very tiny part of this chamber, the sample of hominin specimens is already larger than any other single assemblage in africa.\n\nthe explorers who first found these bones, rick hunter and steven tucker, saw what the team was doing when they were excavating in the chamber. the pair realised that they might have seen a similar occurrence in another part of the cave system. the rising star system has more than two kilometres of mapped passages underground. in another deep chamber, accessed again through very tight underground squeezes, there were hominin bones exposed on the surface.\n\nour team first began systematic survey of this chamber, which we named the lesedi chamber, in 2014. for two years marina elliott led excavations, joined at times by most of the team's other experienced underground excavators. they were working in a situation where bones are jammed into a tight blind tunnel. only one excavator can fit at a time, belly-down, feet sticking out. it is an incredibly challenging excavation circumstance.\n\ngeologist dr hannah hilbert-wolf studying difficult to reach flowstones in a small side passage in the dinaledi chamber. wits university\n\nthe most significant discovery is a partial skeleton of h. naledi, with parts of the arms, legs, a lot of the spine and many other pieces, as well as a beautifully complete skull and jaw. we named this skeleton neo. we also recovered fragments of at least one other adult individual, and one child, although we suspect these bones may come from one or two more individuals.\n\nis there a way for people to view these discoveries in person?\n\non may 25 – africa day – maropeng at the cradle of humankind world heritage site outside johannesburg will open a new exhibit with the discoveries from the lesedi chamber and the dinaledi chamber together for the first time.\n\nfor people outside south africa, the data from our three-dimensional scans of the new lesedi fossils are available online.\n\nanyone can download the 3d models, and people with access to a 3d printer can print their own physical copies of the new fossils, as well as the fossils from the dinaledi chamber. it's a

minka kelly is about to make a big change: the friday night lights actress is looking to move from her home in west hollywood and buy a house. kelly, who is a spokesperson for real estate website trulia, talked to cbs news about her search for a new home and upcoming projects.\n\nread on to find out what the culinary school graduate and hollywood star has to say on the possibility of a 500 days of summer sequel, her favorite neighborhood spots and how she gets her culture fix.\n\non her search for a new home: i use trulia. i think it's important to educate yourself before making such a big purchase and trulia makes it easy for you to find all the facts before you move, like what the school district is like. even if you don't have kids, you want to know that for resale value. crime history -- whatever is particular to you. for me, i want to live near a dog park and walking distance to a coffee shop.\n\non her favorite los angeles spots: i drive to the santa monica farmer's market. i love the griffith park hike. i love kings road cafe for coffee, i love intelligentsia in silver lake for coffee. i'm all over the place.\n\non her arts and culture picks: i highly recommend david foster wallace's commencement speech. i've listened to it a few times because every time i hear it, i hear something different. i think he's one of the most brilliant thinkers. it makes me so sad he wasn't ever able to find peace, so i'm reading 'consider the lobster' right now, which is really really good. i'm also watching 'house of cards' right now, which is so good.\n\non foodie life: my favorite thing is to have cooking parties at my house with my girlfriends. we like to have pizza parties. i love to make meatballs and lasagna and roasted chicken and salmon. salmon is the most impressive but also the easiest thing to make, so i whip that out a lot. and roasting vegetables. i just learned about nutritional yeast and it's like cheese but it's so good for you. a little nutritional yeast, red pepper flakes, lemon juice and salt over vegetables is so good.\n\non if she would do a 500 days of summer sequel: of course! sure! if marc webb directs it, yes! i felt so lucky to have my little part in that.\n\non upcoming projects: we have 'the path' coming out on the 30th on hulu. i'm developing a project with my friend gaby dalkin, so that's exciting.
san juan, puerto rico — award-winning playwright and musician lin-manuel miranda is widely revered in many parts of puerto rico, where the new york city-born hamilton creator traces his roots. his family's hometown of vega alta, west of the capital, is adorned with several colorful murals of him and even a museum dedicated to his artistic and philanthropic work.\n\nbut after planning a three-week run of his broadway hit on the island, miranda and his musical encountered some unexpected hostility. as a result, miranda and his team announced in december — just three weeks before the show's opening on january 11 — that the production would relocate from a historic theater at the university of puerto rico's río piedras campus to another theater in san juan.\n\nthe university has a policy of limiting police presence on campus, which the hamilton team believed was necessary because of potential protests during the production.\n\nin recent months, the university has been roiled by student demonstrations against educational cuts, faculty layoffs and tuition hikes that were ordered by the federal fiscal board, which congress established through the 2016 puerto rico oversight, management, and economic stability act — known as promesa.\n\nalthough hamilton ticket sale proceeds will go to a charitable arts fund established by the miranda family, some puerto ricans seized on the musical's symbolism as a celebration of american government to continue their criticism of the unpopular federal oversight board, which miranda supports.\n\nthe protests reflect the student and local discontent with america's foreign policy, which affects us negatively, carlos ariel ortiz, a 43-year-old business administration professor at ana g. méndez university, told cbs news. it is a communal cry of protest.\n\nortiz said many puerto ricans feel like they have no voice and no vote to stop austerity measures imposed by the board, known locally as the junta. since it was established in 2016 to deal with the growing debt-crisis in puerto rico, the board has directed the island's government to make budget cuts to several welfare programs, as well as the educational system.\n\nthe relationship between the islands's residents and the junta, ortiz said, resembles a colonial system.\n\npuerto rico has been under the control of the fiscal board for some time. it's a federal entity which governs local politics. this highlights our colonial status. we are the only colony in the world, he said.\n\nlin-manuel miranda's father, luis miranda, who studied at the university of puerto rico, said he supports students' right to protest, mainly because he's a longtime activist.\n\ni do it all the time — i did it all my life, he told cbs news' david begnaud on wednesday.\n\nbut miranda said the venue change was warranted.\n\nwe had security concerns because the university doesn't have its own police, it's difficult for police to go in, he said. so, if anything were to happen — even if the possibilities were remote — we didn't want to run that chance.\n\nmiranda said one of his and his son's foremost goals was nevertheless achieved.\n\nbut we leave behind what we set to do, which is to leave a first-class theater on the island, he said.

brennan in washington and this week on face the nation, the coronavirus has now claimed the life of an american within the u.s. and the number of infected has increased and now includes cases of unknown origin. meanwhile, the trump administration scrambles to calm fears of americans concerned with the spread of coronavirus and its impact on the economy as the stock market has its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. plus, it's a big win for former vice president joe biden in south carolina. as the candidates head to super tuesday, can he stop vermont senator bernie sanders?\n\njoe biden: we are very much alive.\n\nmargaret brennan: former vice president joe biden won south carolina and won it big.\n\njoe biden: you launched bill clinton, barack obama to the presidency. now you launched our campaign on the path to defeating donald trump. this campaign has taken off.\n\nmargaret brennan: with fourteen states up for grabs in just two days, biden's victory gives a boost to establishment democrats hoping to deny bernie sanders the nomination.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: there are a lot of states in this country. nobody wins them all.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll talk with vermont senator bernie sanders about the race.\n\nplus, as the coronavirus crisis prompts questions of whether or not the u.s. is ready to handle a pandemic, the politics of preparedness becomes a big issue.\n\npresident donald trump: i don't think it's inevitable. it probably will. it possibly will.\n\nmargaret brennan: now the trump administration faces a crisis of its own: calming and reassuring the american public.\n\npresident donald trump: we are preparing for the worst. we are ready. we are ready.\n\nthis is no reason to panic.\n\nmargaret brennan: but it's been a rough week of mixed messages and attacks on familiar targets.\n\nmick mulvaney: the press was-- was-- was-- was-- was-- was covering their-- their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the president.\n\npresident donald trump: now the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. this is their new hoax.\n\nmargaret brennan: health and human services secretary alex azar and former fda commissioner scott gottlieb will both be here.\n\nthen the trump administration signs a peace deal with the taliban to end the war in afghanistan. secretary of state mike pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the taliban, and we will talk to him.\n\nall that and more is just ahead on face the nation.\n\ngood morning and welcome to face the nation. it was a knockout win for former vice president joe biden last night in the south carolina primary. he got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor, senator bernie sanders. cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto is here to tell us more. so, anthony, how did joe biden do this?\n\nanthony salvanto: good morning, margaret. big keys for him. first of all, overwhelming support from black voters. that was key and they make up most of the electorate in south carolina. that was really helped by an endorsement from representative jim clyburn, the most influential african-american politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. and then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat donald trump in november. the question now, margaret, is can joe biden parlay that argument into super tuesday?\n\nmargaret brennan: and we'll get details and forecasts from you on super tuesday ahead, anthony.\n\nwe turn now to senator bernie sanders. he is on the campaign trail in norfolk, virginia. good morning to you, senator.\n\nsenator bernie sanders (i-vermont/@berniesanders/democratic presidential candidate): good morning, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: is this now a two-man race?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, all i can say is we have won the popular vote in iowa. we won the new hampshire primary. we won the nevada caucus. we lost last night. we're looking forward to super tuesday. i think we got a great chance to win in california, in texas, in massachusetts, and a number of states around the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: south carolina is the first southern state. does that indicate anything to you about your prospects in places like virginia and-- and north carolina? will joe biden really challenge you there?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, we're going to see. i mean i think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in virginia. i think we got a shot in north carolina. all i can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. those are ideas, margaret, that i think are resonating all across this country. i think we have an excellent chance to do well on tuesday and to win the democratic nomination.\n\nmargaret brennan: joe biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. we know from your campaign that you raised forty-six million dollars in february. that's a significant number. what do you think that does for you going into super tuesday? what edge?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. we don't have a super pac like joe biden. i don't go to rich people's homes like joe biden. i think joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. what we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more americans than any candidate in the history of the united states, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. this is a campaign of working people and by working people. and i'm extraordinarily proud of that. but we have enough money now not only to take us through super tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country.\n\nmargaret brennan: your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that michael bloomberg has offered. he said he'd extend it to any party nominee. do you really want to turn down his bankroll?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, look, mister bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his sixty billion dollars and that's legal. all i can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working-class and middle-class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. look, one of the things that upsets people--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you would accept it?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: --whether conservative or progressive, is-- i didn't say that. what i would say--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: --is that he has the right to do anything he wants. right now, we are confident, margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you are a democratic socialist. you have never officially entered the democratic party. in fact, you constantly criticize democratic establishment. so, how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify democrats and challenge president trump?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, two points. i am a member of the democratic leadership. i have been in the democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of vermont, where i live, i am supported by democrats that have won the democratic primary. but we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to democrats, and to more than a few republicans. look, we are living at a time when the american people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in america. all over this country, margaret, and i have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. they can't afford childcare.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: they can't afford health care. they are scared to death about their retirement. they want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. that's how you win. you put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. that is what we're doing. no campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. that's how you beat trump. and, by the way, almost all of the national polls out there, you know, i've had last seventy polls, sixty-five of them, i think, have us beating trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: we're beating them in battleground states like pennsylvania, wisconsin, and michigan. we can beat trump.\n\nmargaret brennan: you have rallies planned out in california. there is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the west coast. is it safe for you? have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, actually, we have. i mean that's a very fair question. and my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. and right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in california, but in utah, minnesota, and other states around the country.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've been sparring with the pro-israel lobby known as aipac. you said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at prime minister netanyahu. today, israel's ambassador to the u.n. says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool, or both. do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-israel lobby in this way?\n\nsenator bernie sanders: yeah, i do. i mean they have a lot of money. they have a lot of power. look, i'm jewish and i'm very proud of my jewish heritage. as a kid i spent time in israel. i am not in-- anti-israel. i will do everything i can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the israeli people. but what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects israel but deals with the suffering of the palestinian people as well. you got seventy percent youth unemployment in gaza. people can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. it is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the middle east until the united states develops an even-handed policy.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: so, i am pro-israel; i am pro-palestinian. i want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you on foreign policy. the president just authorized a deal with the taliban. what do you think of that? because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of u.s. troops.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: well, i don't have enough details and the-- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the afghan government. we don't know what's going to happen. one of the difficulties, to be very honest, margaret, in dealing with trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in afghanistan. but it is my view that the united states and i-- i speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in iraq. it is my view that we got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in america sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator bernie sanders: --we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. senator sanders, thank you for joining us.\n\nformer new york mayor michael bloomberg has not yet appeared on a ballot, but that will change tuesday. he sat down with our scott pelley yesterday in an interview for tonight's 60 minutes. here's a preview.\n\n(begin vt)\n\nscott pelley (60 minutes): how do you view this emergency?\n\nmichael bloomberg (60 minutes): i find it incomprehensible that the president would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did last night in south carolina.\n\nscott pelley: he-- he said the-- the democrats making so much of it is a democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.\n\nmichael bloomberg: this is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. they all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. and it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure, and the knowledge to deal with it.\n\n(end vt)\n\nmargaret brennan: scott's interview with mayor bloomberg will air tonight on 60 minutes.\n\nface the nation will be back in one minute. stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we want to take a closer look at the growing fears over covid-19, commonly referred to as the coronavirus. last week the world health organization said the global risk of the virus spreading is now very high. here in the u.s., there are now seventy-one cases of coronavirus and worldwide the death toll is almost three thousand. there are also concerns about the global economy. here in the u.s., the stock market took its biggest hit last week since the 2008 financial crisis. we begin today with health and human services secretary alex azar. good to have you here.\n\nalex azar (secretary of health and human services/@secazar): glad to be here. thank you for having me.\n\nmargaret brennan: so we just had the first american death on u.s. soil out in washington state. what do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread?\n\nalex azar: so this individual and we just want to express our sympathy, certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus, this individual was in the hospital out in calif-- out-- out in washington. we do not know how he contracted the virus, yet. and so that's why we and the state of washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus. that's why we call it right now a potential community case, meaning we don't have a discernible connection to any travel to korea or china or any other impacted area.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, at this point, you don't know if this person came into contact with anyone. he just showed up sick at the hospital?\n\nalex azar: we have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. and so we do not know how he contracted the virus. that's really what we do. that's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. we're going to trace the other cases. there is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. and there are cases in that nursing home. but who spread to whom? we do not know yet.\n\nmargaret brennan: the president yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. it is a man.\n\nalex azar: it-- yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: how is a mistake like that made? because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust.\n\nalex azar: well, i understand that. it's a very fast-moving situation. our centers for disease control and prevention were up late at night, very earl-- early in the morning, working with the washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female. that's what the president was briefed on. they've apologized for incorrectly briefing on that. but it's a very fast-moving situation. obviously, we regret the error.\n\nmargaret brennan: given that it is so fast moving, what are your projections now? how many americans do you expect to come down with this virus?\n\nalex azar: so what your viewers need to know is the risk to average americans remains low. we are working to keep it low. we will see more transmission of cases in the united states. we've got the finest public health system in the world here. this is what we do. we cannot make predictions as to how many cases we'll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases. it's simply just a matter of math.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, you have to have a number you're working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply, things like testing kits, right? so--\n\nalex azar: we- we don't--\n\nmargaret brennan: --how are we on shortages? you may not want to tell me the number, but you have one in your head--\n\nalex azar: no we don't--\n\nmargaret brennan: --you're using for planning.\n\nalex azar: no we don't. we- we don't-- we do not use-- because it is an unknown, the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with-- at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the united states. it is unknown how that will spread. in terms of testing kits, we've already tested over thirty-six hundred people for the virus. we now have seventy-- the capability in-- out-- in the field to test seventy-five thousand people. and within the next week or two we'll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that's available.\n\nmargaret brennan: in washington state, in places that have declared emergencies, even shutting down schools i mean they are projecting numbers themselves.\n\nalex azar: they might make projections of numbers themselves, but we are not. we'll take aggressive public health measures. it's what we call community mitigation steps. so depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nalex azar: --the state and local government will take measures appropriate to contain the spread of the disease.\n\nmargaret brennan: so in france, they shut down the louvre museum. they're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. in japan, they're closing schools for a month. canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. in the u.s. there are closures, as we just said, in washington and in oregon. they've declared a state of emergency out there. and the cdc said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe.\n\nalex azar: might. might. that's--\n\nmargaret brennan: what does that mean? i mean americans hear this and they are concerned. there's about a two-percent fatality rate.\n\nalex azar: and i-- i appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. and that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the united states like travel restrictions or closures. state or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. but, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the united states that would indicate those measures. but we're not taking any of them off the table. the full range of options will always remain on the table.\n\nmargaret brennan: in a crisis you need public trust.\n\nalex azar: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: an inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back americans who had been evacuated from wuhan, china. and those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact. have you personally looked into these allegations?\n\nalex azar: yes, we are-- we are looking into these allegations. i am personally involved in doing so. first--\n\nmargaret brennan: so, can you say that this wasn't something that tipped off the spread on the west coast?\n\nalex azar: that is absolutely not the case. so, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. we are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. but what the american people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any hhs employee had contact with the individuals involved. they are not-- nobody is symptomatic. nobody has a disease. even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm.\n\nalex azar: and we have offered, even though it is not medically indicated, we have offered to test any hhs employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind. we want to do that for our employees.\n\nmargaret brennan: there are cases of the coronavirus in mexico and in canada. yesterday, the president said he is considering and looking at closing the southern border.\n\nalex azar: well--\n\nmargaret brennan: what will decide that? are you looking at that?\n\nalex azar: that's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because mexico only has a couple of cases. canada's epidemiology is similar to the united states right now. what the president's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. we will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the american people. but we don't forecast doing that anytime soon.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you expect drug shortages, as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain?\n\nalex azar: so, we're very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with china, in particular. we-- the fda has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in china. and so we're working aggressively with the-- with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages. we are aware of one drug which has many, many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time. but--\n\nmargaret brennan: what drug is that?\n\nalex azar: --i'm not able to because it's commercially confidential information that's submitted voluntarily to us, i'm not able to discuss that. but this is a drug in a class where there are many, many, many alternatives available. it's a generic drug. very available.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. mister secretary, thank you for your time.\n\nand we will be right back with another cabinet official, secretary of state mike pompeo, so stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: yesterday, the u.s. signed a deal with the taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of u.s. troops from afghanistan. since it began in 2001, the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred american troops. secretary of state mike pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in doha. he got off the plane just a short while ago. and thank you for being here, mister secretary.\n\nmike pompeo (secretary of state/@secpompeo): thank you.\n\nmargaret brennan: so this is significant. and according to the deal that was released, the u.s. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. and then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. but the president said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. what's the benchmark there?\n\nmike pompeo: yes, ma'am. this was a historic day. american blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. we went there after 9/11. no one still feels the anger of that day any more than i do. but it was time. and the taliban knew it was time. president trump has allowed us to take the fight to the taliban these last two years. and we have done so. it's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the united states of america. you can see, go read the document, the taliban have now made the break. they've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the united states, from afghanistan. this is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the trump administration. you can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-baghdadi, qassem al-rimi--\n\nmargaret brennan: how long will it take--\n\nmike pompeo: --the work that we did against qassem soleimani. this is a president who is committed to defending and protecting the american people. we'll do that every place we battle against terror whether that's afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day.\n\nmargaret brennan: how long would it take to get u.s. troops out? because you're saying this is based on conditions. that means the taliban has to follow through on a few things.\n\nmike pompeo: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: what would make the president hit the brakes and stop the withdrawal?\n\nmike pompeo: look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. we are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-afghan negotiations that commence as well. that has not happened before. it's going to be rocky and bumpy. no one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. but that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the afghan people. and that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. we're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep america safe. we've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the afghan national--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmike pompeo: --security forces and the taliban.\n\nmargaret brennan: but president trump said he's going to meet with the taliban in the near future. when? where? is that camp david?\n\nmike pompeo: i don't know when. i don't know where. i-- i'm very confident. president trump wants to make sure that everyone in afghanistan understands that the united states is committed to making sure that this conversation take place. we have been at this for an awful long time. you recounted the loss of american life. there's a better path forward. the taliban now know this because of the work that we've done. and president trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in doha yesterday.\n\nmargaret brennan: we're going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it. please stay with us. we hope you will, too.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: secretary pompeo is here for more on ending america's longest war, and then a look at politics and super tuesday.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. and we are continuing our conversation with secretary of state mike pompeo, who is just back in the u.s. after signing a deal with the taliban in doha. and-- and-- just that statement alone is kind of amazing. you were the first u.s. cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the taliban. i think you actually met with one of the founding members of the taliban who is involved in this.\n\nmike pompeo: i met with a senior negotiator yesterday, yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: you-- you called them terrorists in the past. do you still consider the taliban terrorists?\n\nmike pompeo: they have an enormous amount of american blood on their hands.\n\nmargaret brennan: and, apparently, in a partnership still with al qaeda?\n\nmike pompeo: yep, they said yesterday, signed a document. the gentleman whom i met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and to have al qaeda depart from that place.\n\nmargaret brennan: and you trust that?\n\nmike pompeo: don't trust anything. we're going to deliver. it's about actions. the agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. but, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. it has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. we'll do that. it's not about trust. it's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow.\n\nmargaret brennan: the u.s. pledged in this agreement, which is public, as you say, that it will help to get up to five thousand taliban prisoners released. the president of afghanistan, ashraf ghani, says no way, no how. he-- nothing like that was agreed to. all of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days. did the u.s. agree to help release five thousand prisoners?\n\nmike pompeo: you saw what the document says. it says, we will work with all relevant--\n\nmargaret brennan: so ghani-- what he is saying is wrong?\n\nmike pompeo: it says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence, to create confidence-building measures amongst all of the parties, the afghan government, non-taliban, and others in the afghan. we-- we want this to be an inclusive process.\n\nmargaret brennan: but it's a process--\n\nmike pompeo: we want-- we want women--\n\nmargaret brennan: --this would be a spoiler in just--\n\nmike pompeo: we want-- we want--\n\nmargaret brennan: --the first ten days.\n\nmike pompeo: we want women to be involved. they-- there will be lots of people say things. there will be lots of noise. everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. what matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. we have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. while i was in doha, secretary of defense was in kabul, along with nato secretary general stoltenberg. they made a declaration. there was a commitment from the afghan government, too. we've made a lot of progress. no one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. we've built an important base where we can begin to bring american soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any american in afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is, obviously-- would have a significant impact on-- on any of the implementation, one would think. so, are-- are--\n\nmike pompeo: so, there have been-- there-- there-- there have--\n\nmargaret brennan: --do you expect this to actually happen?\n\nmike pompeo: --there have been prisoner releases from both sides before. we have managed to figure our path forward. we'll know who these people are. we are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for america what president trump has committed: reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep america safe from terrorism. i don't think any american can doubt president trump's seriousness in that.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman liz cheney, republican, and about twenty allies--\n\nmike pompeo: who i know well.\n\nmargaret brennan: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the taliban is still allied with al qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of congress--\n\nmike pompeo: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: --she suggested wouldn't accept a deal like this, that you raised concerns about secret side deals that the obama administration had cut with iran--\n\nmike pompeo: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --back then. so that any kind--\n\nmike pompeo: oh, i remember it well, yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --of annex-- she says there are secret annexes to this deal.\n\nmike pompeo: yes. she-- she-- i'm happy to talk with her. there-- there are--\n\nmargaret brennan: are there?\n\nmike pompeo: there are no annexes that the members of congress won't have a chance to see--\n\nmargaret brennan: meaning they are all classified details--\n\nmike pompeo: the public-- the public document--\n\nmargaret brennan: --that will be shared with congress?\n\nmike pompeo: the public document was released yesterday. there are two implementing elements that will be provided. they are secret. they are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. every member of congress will get a chance to see them. they are classified, secret. there aren't any side deals. remember, the side deals i was complaining about were deals that the american side--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmike pompeo: --never got to see. john kerry never got to see those side deals. this is-- this is not that. this is a fully transparent arrangement. and as for-- and as--\n\nmargaret brennan: so there is no deal to keep a certain u.s. military presence in afghanistan?\n\nmike pompeo: and there-- the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement. the implementing elements of that will be available for every member of congress to see. know this. i saw what congresswoman cheney said, and i have an enormous amount of respect for her. the american people should know donald trump is not going to take words on a paper. we are going to see if the taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. the bush administration and the obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the taliban would break from al qaeda publicly. we got that. that's important. now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. they have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, it's a historic agreement.\n\nmike pompeo: thank you very much, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: secretary, thank you for coming on to talk about it. we'll be right back.\n\n(announcements)\n\n(excerpt from a campaign video)\n\nmargaret brennan: that was businessman tom steyer doing a little pre-primary dance in south carolina. he did come in third, but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to super tuesday, and that's this tuesday, when fourteen states will hold contests. among them california and texas. we have some new cbs news battleground tracker numbers for both of them. out in california senator bernie sanders is up with thirty-one percent support. former vice president joe biden and massachusetts senator elizabeth warren come in behind sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent, respectively. former new york city mayor michael bloomberg has twelve percent, and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent. looking to texas, the race is tighter. bernie sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent, but joe biden close behind him with twenty-six percent and elizabeth warren comes in at seventeen-percent support. michael bloomberg is at thirteen percent, and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less. joining us once again is cbs news elections and surveys director anthony salvanto. we want to bring in cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe. ed, this was a big and much-needed win for joe biden in south carolina. what does this mean for him going into tuesday?\n\ned o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of bernie sanders to side with them instead. their hope is that by the end of tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to sanders. it's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like california. but they are hoping, the biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative.\n\nmargaret brennan: anthony, does he have the enthusiasm that you say sanders' supporters have?\n\nanthony salvanto (cbs news elections and surveys director/@salvantocbs): well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that bernie sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. that's why his numbers remain so stable. those folks turn out for him. but joe biden still has a challenge in that regard. his supporters are less enthusiastic about him. can he motivate them to turn out? i think it remains a key question. and, look, to that point, when you look at california, texas, at these big delegate hauls, the democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. and so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring.\n\nmargaret brennan: and there are a lot of delegates at stake here on tuesday. a thousand three hundred forty-four, it's about thirty percent of what's needed for the nomination. so, ed, how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold? explain some of the math here.\n\ned o'keefe: so there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on tuesday night. there's the perception number, who wins the state? who can say that they walked away winning the most states? but the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number. who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety-one delegates you need to get over the threshold and-- and win that nomination.\n\nmargaret brennan: because it's not winner take all.\n\ned o'keefe: it is not. you have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states. and so the numbers to look for are fifteen. so if you look at our california and texas numbers right now, mike bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent. this could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. but this is why, despite not winning anything so far, elizabeth warren is still in this race. because she sees that she is doing well enough in california and in texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later march and april.\n\nanthony salvanto: and that bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates, if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states, even if he doesn't win them, then that changes the math for everybody else. now he is a player. but if he falls just short of it, then all those delegates can go to other top candidates, to a-- to a biden or to a sanders and that changes the math going forward for them.\n\nmargaret brennan: ed, can four hundred million dollars in ad spending close that gap? that's a big gamble.\n\ned o'keefe: it could, potentially. look, and, tonight, he is-- he is doing something that hasn't been done in a while. he is buying three minutes of advertising on nbc and cbs to talk about the coronavirus. and trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the president. he can spend as much as he wants. but if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. certainly, they believe that they can go on into florida and arizona and illinois next and-- and try to compete in later march contests. but, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in south carolina was mike bloomberg because joe biden did so well. they needed biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative.\n\nmargaret brennan: it couldn't have felt good for tom steyer to have spent over three hundred million-- two hundred million dollars, almost three hundred million on spending on ads.\n\ned o'keefe: it's a warning sign because south carolina was his-- was his petri dish.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ned o'keefe: it was his test that if he could do it there, he could do it anywhere. he couldn't.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, anthony and ed, there are a lot of headlines after south carolina saying this is now a two-person race but there are still a lot of people on the field. so--\n\nanthony salvanto: it remains a multicandidate race. there's no question about it. and i think part of that is you look at bernie sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? can he draw people to him? and when we ask folks, most of the people supporting sanders say they've already liked him. they've liked him for a long time. but far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. so can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? that, i think, remains a key question.\n\ned o'keefe: this will not be clean. this is going to be a messy contest. it's different than what we've seen before because we have so many candidates. we are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into tuesday. will the field shrink after tuesday? probably. but, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet.\n\nmargaret brennan: it makes for some exciting political watching on tuesday.\n\ned o'keefe: and very little sleep.\n\nmargaret brennan: thanks.\n\nanthony salvanto: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: a very little sleep for (indistinct).\n\nanthony salvanto: a very long night with delegates coming as we go, as we go.\n\nmargaret brennan: all right. well, we'll-- we'll gear up for that with both of you. thank you.\n\nwe'll be right back.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: for a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the u.s., we turn to former fda commissioner and physician doctor scott got-- gottlieb. good to have you here.\n\ndr. scott gottlieb (former fda commissioner/@scottgottliebmd): thanks.\n\nmargaret brennan: you served in the trump administration. what do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus?\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: right. well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. we're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. by the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. so we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: --and-- and leveraging their capacity. these are the major medical centers. what we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic. we know when this started, but we don't know when this is going to end. and what's going to end it is our technology. our savior here is going to be our technology. and we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic.\n\nmargaret brennan: meaning a treatment?\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: a treatment or a vaccine. but a-- a therapeutic-- a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall. a vaccine is a much longer way off. and we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along, and this might be that strain, that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine. a treatment, again, we could have by september, october, potentially.\n\nmargaret brennan: but more testing means more positive results. i mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase?\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: it's going to increase. this-- right now, there's probably hundreds or low thousands of cases. everyone's--\n\nmargaret brennan: hundreds or low thousands of coronavirus cases--\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: in the u.s.--\n\nmargaret brennan: --in the u.s. that aren't reported?\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: --that aren't reported yet. it's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. but we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. we need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. there was an analysis out today by trevor bradford, very good researcher out of the hutch, looking at the genetic strains in washington state. and by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. it's an interesting analysis. there probably are more cases. we have community spread now in washington state, california, perhaps, illinois, oregon. so certainly hundreds of cases.\n\nmargaret brennan: so has the administration been slow in its response?\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: well, look, i think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. it-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. the question is what do we do with that time? i think there's some things we did that were very smart. we got the country prepared. one of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. i think what-- what we should have done and i don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the cdc. we always rely on a cdc in a public health emergency. but simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. we've done that. you know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. and that is now in place. and those labs are going to be coming online. so we course corrected. i think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? it's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. and we need to do that now in a therapeutic. we-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. we need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach. if case one doesn't work out, we have other options.\n\nmargaret brennan: so you'd suggest that's the conversation the president should have tomorrow with the pharmaceutical companies--\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: tomorrow is the vaccine manufacturers.\n\nmargaret brennan: --when he brings those--\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: i think we need to look at the companies that-- that can develop antibody-based prophylaxis as well. we did that against ebola. that is actually what we could potentially have for the fall-- fall or a small molecule drug that's currently on the shelf, trying to repurpose it for this.\n\nmargaret brennan: the nih director, anthony fauci, a doctor, said that from what he's seen, if you get infected, you likely won't get reinfected. but there seems to be so much we don't know. if someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms, how do they last? how do you know to go and get tested?\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: that's the challenge here. you don't. you know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. a lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. they can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. and so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. the other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. the time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. so they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. and it's in that phase that people are spreading it. there was a very interesting analysis in the new england journal of medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: --across a spectrum of disease. and the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that's atypical. typically, the amount of virus you have and shed to-- in-- in some diseases comports with how much-- how much of virus you have.\n\nmargaret brennan: okay. doctor, thank you very much for coming on and giving us--\n\ndr. scott gottlieb: thanks a lot.\n\nmargaret brennan: --your analysis.\n\nwe'll be back in a moment with a look at super tuesday and more.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're back with our panel. we brought in two of the big guns from the new york times today. edward wong is a diplomatic correspondent, and michael crowley is a white house correspondent covering foreign policy. good to have you both here.\n\nmichael crowley (the new york times/@michaelcrowley): thanks, margaret.\n\nedward wong (the new york times/@ewong): thanks, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to start on what we haven't mentioned thus far in the show, that the president has made a choice to run the intelligence community. he's going to renominate a congressman, john ratcliffe. is he actually going to go through and get nominated and-- and confirmed?\n\nmichael crowley: well, that's a big question. you know, president trump was getting close to nominating congressman ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior republicans in congress who said this man is not qualified. he's only been on the intelligence committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. the president pulled back and didn't do it. the question is now has ratcliffe changed any minds? there's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the president has installed richard grenell, his ambassador to germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. by nominating a new person, even if president trump doesn't think ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows rick grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. there's another theory that rick grenell is even more unpalatable to people in congress than ratcliffe. so ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. so there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, i bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons, and-- and confidence in-- in hard fact and in intelligence. ed, i know you've been following, as you always do, you lived in china for so long, and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona, when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response, what did you make of that? and what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what china is sharing with the u.s.?\n\nedward wong: well, i think that everyone agrees that full transparency or a large amount of transparency on this virus is necessary both, you know, to push forward with expertise on addressing the virus, plus, calming public fears over it. i think when an administration or government appears to be nontransparent on it then that creates problems. i think that the trump administration really grappled with that this past week when you saw president trump come out and say it was a new hoax by the democrats or when--\n\nmargaret brennan: and his chief of staff went out and-- and said the media's covering this--\n\nedward wong: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --because they think it's going to take down the president.\n\nedward wong: right. and i think that they're trying to adjust the language now from what i can tell. but i think that, you know, there's valid criticism of that. and i think if you compare that to the way beijing reacted, there are some parallels in that communist party officials, chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus, and there's a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier, and that they kept the public from learning about it. we know that one of the key whistleblowers, dr. li--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nedward wong: --tried to warn health care professionals in a private chat group about it. and then he was even taken in by the police because of that and admonished.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmichael crowley: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: michael, i mean does the president now have the credibility and-- and the trust of the public at a moment of crisis when you need it most?\n\nmichael crowley: no, that's a huge problem here, margaret. think back to what happened when hurricane dorian was hitting the united states last summer president trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane's path and was criticized for it. and then a day or two later, he's holding up a map showing the storm's forecasted path in the oval office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that president trump loves to use to sign documents. it really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the president look good, to cover up for a mistake he had made. and president trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts, including numbers of victims in the country. yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately. i will say, margaret, that i do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction. having all those health experts there--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmichael crowley: --particularly doctor fauci. there were questions about whether he was being muzzled. he said he was not, one of the nation's foremost authorities on these things. and i think president trump understands he doesn't-- he wants the markets to bounce back. the markets want to see that kind of expertise in trump-- expertise and-- and-- and credibility. and at least yesterday, there was a step in that direction.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, we will see when markets open tomorrow what they thought of it. but, certainly, for the public, we'll continue to follow the details of this as we have on face the nation.\n\nthank you all today for watching and each week as you do. we'll see you tuesday night for cbs news' special coverage of the super tuesday results. we go on the air here on cbs at 8:00 pm eastern, 5:00 pacific, and our cbsn

new york -- echoes of the attack that left 22 dead and 59 others injured in manchester, england, made it all the way across the atlantic.\n\nwithin minutes of the attack at manchester arena, new york city police dispatched heavy weapons teams to high-profile locations like madison square garden. in the dallas area, police also made a show of force at a john legend concert, cbs news' justice and homeland security correspondent jeff pegues reports.\n\nthe bombing at the ariana grande concert exposed the outside of arenas as potential soft targets.\n\nthe goal, obviously for these folks, 'i don't have to hurt everyone. i just have to make my mark,' said ron hosko, a former assistant director of the fbi.\n\nhosko says terrorists view people entering and exiting events ranging from papal masses to hockey games as easy targets. security is typically relaxed when an event ends.\n\nthe manchester attack shows that security teams may need to rethink strategy for when events come to an end.\n\nrethink: 'how do we push security,' and we've seen this at airports as well, how do we push those security perimeters back in a way that just doesn't make the choke point further back? he said.\n\nbut in some places it's not practical to change the perimeters.\n\nit's especially challenging in times square, where 300,000-500,000 people pass through a pedestrian plaza on any given day, cbs news correspondent don dahler reports.\n\nwith eight streets and multiple sidewalks converging there, it's a vulnerable area that police say they simply can't make 100 percent safe.\n\npolice acknowledge that they can't do it alone and that there is strength in numbers. in new york, subway posters encourage people to watch for danger.\n\npolice say tips have stopped violent attacks. the fbi has said most terror attacks in the u.s. could have been stopped -- if only someone had reported suspicious activity.
in a defeat for the trump administration, a federal judge blocked the commerce department from adding a question on u.s. citizenship to the 2020 census. the case will likely be reviewed by the supreme court.\n\nsecretary ross's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census — even if it did not violate the constitution itself — was unlawful for a multitude of independent reasons and must be set aside, u.s. district court judge jess furman wrote in a court filing made public tuesday morning. to conclude otherwise and let secretary ross's decision stand would undermine the proposition — central to the rule of law — that ours is a government of laws, and not of men.\n\nin his ruling, judge furman of the u.s. district court for the southern district of new york found that commerce secretary wilbur ross' decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census, unveiled in march 2018, could lead to a significant reduction in self-response rates among noncitizen and hispanic households and to hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of people being uncounted by the census.\n\nfurman added that the manner in which the change was rolled out violated the administrative procedure act (apa), a federal statute.\n\nkelly laco, a spokesperson for the justice department, said the agency was disappointed by the district court's ruling, arguing that a citizenship question has been included in previous federal questionnaires throughout american history.\n\nwe are disappointed and are still reviewing the ruling. secretary ross, the only person with legal authority over the census, reasonably decided to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census in response to the department of justice's request for better citizenship data, to protect voters against racial discrimination, laco wrote in a statement tuesday to cbs news.\n\nwhen ross announced that he was reinstating the citizenship question on the 2020 census questionnaire, he said it was in response to a request from the justice department for better citizenship data to assist in its enforcement of the landmark voting rights act of 1965.\n\nbut critics believe the commerce department's proposal would lead to low response rates among immigrants and distort congressional apportionment to favor republicans. they say both citizen and non-citizen immigrants would hesitate to answer the citizenship question, fearing reprisals from the trump administration and its hardline immigration agenda. if these immigrants do not participate in the census, critics argue, they will not be counted for congressional apportionment — the process through which seats in the house of representatives are distributed among states.\n\nour voice in congress lies in the balance, california's secretary of state alex padilla told cbs news.\n\npadilla said the proposal would particularly affect diverse and populous states with many congressional seats like california. he said it's already difficult to encourage everybody, especially immigrants, to participate in the census, and that a citizenship question would make the task even more arduous.\n\nthis is a thinly veiled attempt by the trump administration to intimidate diverse communities from participating, he added.\n\npadilla dismissed ross' premise that the change is designed to better equip the federal government to enforce voting rights. it's absolutely laughable to think that the trump administration is interested in protecting voting rights for communities of color, he said. every other action by their administration relative to voting rights has been hostile.\n\nthe trump administration is expected to appeal the district court's decision to a circuit court, and ultimately, to the supreme court — where a conservative-leaning bench could rule in its favor.\n\nthe high court has already agreed to review a case centered on what evidence can be considered for the several lawsuits against the administration and whether ross can be questioned under oath by the plaintiffs' lawyers.\n\nin addition to the case in new york, five more lawsuits were filed by several states and cities which oppose the inclusion of a citizenship question in the census.\n\npaula reid and zachary hudak contributed to this report.
tonight on the cbs evening news, we spoke with the surgeon general dr. jerome adams. the nation's top doctor told us the next 15 days are a critical inflection point in slowing the spread of coronavirus in the u.s. we have a choice to make, he said. are we going to continue to see cases rise precipitously and deaths increase like italy has or are we going to try to go the way of south korea and china, where they really leaned into mitigation efforts and everyone pitched in to stop transmission?\n\nhere are our top takeaways from the interview:\n\n1. children's playdates are not worth the risk\n\nwe wanted to know – based on the new guidelines to limit social contact: are playdates safe? dr. adams advised against it for the time being: it's not worth the risk of our kids being spreaders and potentially taking it to someone else.\n\n2. you can be a transmitter of covid-19 without showing symptoms\n\ncommon symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, but some people don't exhibit symptoms at all. dr. adams says that even if you're asymptomatic, you could absolutely still transmit the virus to others. we know that the people who are most at risk are those with underlying medical conditions, especially seniors, people over the age of 60. we need to understand that the folks who are transmitting the virus across the planet and in our country are younger people.\n\n3. the nation's top doctor says he wouldn't fault any mayor or governor for shelter-in-place policies\n\nmore than seven million people in the san francisco bay area have been advised to shelter in place, and on tuesday, new york city mayor bill de blasio said the city was considering a similar policy there. dr. adams told us, as [dr. tony fauci] says, 'if it seems like an overreaction right now, then you're probably about where you need to be.' again, it's why the administration put out these guidelines for all of america — not just for certain areas, but for all of america — to look at the ways that they can prevent transmission of disease in their communities. i wouldn't fault any mayor, any governor for what they're considering in their communities. but at the very least, limit social gatherings to less than 10, stay at home if you can from work and avoid non-essential travel.\n\n4. if you're experiencing symptoms, a negative test result shouldn't change the way you behave\n\nas tests for covid-19 become more widely available, dr. adams cautions that a negative test shouldn't stop someone with symptoms from self-quarantining, because you could test negative, and still have coronavirus. you could still be early and you could still transmit it; so if you have symptoms, you should still isolate.\n\n5. health care professionals see a decrease in blood donations across the country\n\ndr. adams told us there has been a decrease in blood donations across the country since the outbreak began. while the cdc has cautioned against non-essential travel, they don't want to discourage people from visiting blood donation sites. we don't want people to not be able to get blood because they're scared of coronavirus.
mary oliver, the pulitzer prize-winning poet whose rapturous odes to nature and animal life brought her critical acclaim and popular affection, died thursday. she was 83.\n\noliver died at her home in hobe sound, florida, her literary executor, bill reichblum, said. the cause of death was lymphoma.\n\nfans on thursday remembered her online, sharing some of their favorite works and lines of her poetry. others thanked her.\n\nthank you, mary oliver, for giving so many of us words to live by, hillary clinton tweeted.\n\nthank you, mary oliver, for giving so many of us words to live by. tell me, what is it you plan to do\n\nwith your one wild and precious life? — hillary clinton (@hillaryclinton) january 17, 2019\n\nmadonna called her one of her favorite poets.\n\ni raise a glass and shed a tear to the passing of one of my favorite poets...........mary oliver, madonna tweeted. her words were a bridge from nature to the spiritual world................♥️ god bless you mary!\n\noliver — author of more than 15 poetry and essay collections — wrote brief, direct pieces that sang of her worship of the outdoors and disdain for greed, despoilment and other human crimes. one of her favorite adjectives was perfect, and rarely did she apply it to people. her muses were owls and butterflies, frogs and geese, the changes of the seasons, the sun and the stars.\n\nin my outward appearance and life habits i hardly change — there's never been a day that my friends haven't been able to say, and at a distance, 'there's oliver, still standing around in the weeds. there she is, still scribbling in her notebook,' oliver wrote in long life, a book of essays published in 2004.\n\nbut, at the center: i am shaking; i am flashing like tinsel.\n\nin this nov. 18, 1992 file photo, mary oliver appears at the national book awards in new york where she received the poetry award for her book new and selected poems. mark lennihan/ap\n\nlike her hero walt whitman, whom she would call the brother she never had, oliver didn't only observe mushrooms growing in a rainstorm or an owl calling from a black branch; she longed to know and become one with what she saw. she might be awed by the singing of goldfinches or, as in the poem white flowers, overcome by a long nap in a field.\n\nher poetry books included white pine, ''west wind and the anthology devotions. she won the pulitzer in 1984 for american primitive and the national book award in 1992 for new and selected poems. in 1998, she received the lannan literary award for lifetime achievement. her fans ranged from fellow poets stanley kunitz and rita dove to hillary clinton and laura bush.\n\nalthough few poets have fewer human beings in their poems than mary oliver, it is ironic that few poets also go so far to help us forward, stephen dobyns wrote of her in the new york times.\n\noliver was a native of maple heights in suburban cleveland, and endured what she called a dysfunctional family in part by writing poems and building huts of sticks and grass in the nearby woods. edna st. vincent millay was an early influence and, while in high school, oliver wrote to the late poet's sister, norma, asking if she could visit millay's house in austerlitz, new york. norma millay agreed and oliver ended up spending several years there, organizing edna st. vincent millay's papers.\n\nwhile in austerlitz, she also met the photographer molly malone cook. the two were partners until cook's death, in 2005. much of oliver's work was dedicated to cook.\n\noliver studied at ohio state university and vassar college, but never graduated and later scorned much of her education as a pre-established collection of certainties. she did teach at case western university and bennington college among other schools, although much of her work drew upon her childhood and the landscape around provincetown.\n\ni am not very hopeful about the earth remaining as it was when i was a child. it's already greatly changed. but i think when we lose the connection with the natural world, we tend to forget that we're animals, that we need the earth, oliver told maria shriver during a 2011 interview for oprah winfrey's o'' magazine.\n\nif i have any lasting worth, it will be because i have tried to make people remember what the earth is meant to look like.\n\nshe wrote often of mortality, but with a spirit of gratitude and completion. in circles, she pronounced herself content not to live forever, having been filled by what she saw and believed. in when death comes, she hoped that at the end of life she could look back and see herself as a bride married to amazement.
rome -- a founding member of a three-year-old commission set up by pope francis to protect minors from sexual abuse in the catholic church has quit, accusing the vatican of stonewalling the commission.\n\nas cbs news correspondent seth doane reports, it is a very public blow to the vatican on a very sensitive issue, and at the center of it all is a victim of sex abuse who says there's cultural resistance to change in the church.\n\nmy feeling was, at this point, it was better for me to come out and speak about it because these men thrive on silence and cover-up, marie collins told cbs news on thursday morning at her home in dublin, ireland. i felt i could do more outside than inside.\n\ncollins, who was sexually abused by a priest at the age of 13, had grown tired of what she says were constant setbacks in her work on the panel set up by francis to protect minors.\n\nto find that there's still a group of men in this level of the church who do not see child protection as a priority, that do not get it in 2017, is just unacceptable, she said.\n\nin her resignation letter collins said she believes pope francis is sincere in his efforts, but the resistance by some members of the vatican curia (the central administration), has been shameful.\n\nmonseigneur anthony figueiredo is a cbs news consultant on the catholic church, and asked by doane whether americans might hear in collins' resignation letter a message that the catholic church still is not serious about dealing with this issue of sex abuse, he was adamant: it's very, very serious -- perhaps more than any other organization in the world the catholic church has taken this on board.\n\nwe all know that perhaps the hardest thing to change is not a structure of an organization, but it's the very attitudes of certain people, figueiredo said. he suggested collins might be speaking out now, because she knows this holy father will now do something.\n\nboston cardinal sean o'malley, who heads the commission, said in a statement: we will certainly listen carefully to all that marie wishes to share with us about her concerns.\n\nthe only other sex abuse victim on the panel, peter saunders, also became critical of it and was forced out last year.
the world wildlife fund wants people to rethink what's on their plate. if you compare the planet to a company, it is in the red, and this is something that should worry everyone.\n\nthat's the sober message from marco lambertini, director general of wwf international. soon, there won't be enough land and resources to support the wasteful way we produce food today, he told cbs moneywatch at the world economic forum in davos, switzerland.\n\nwhile most people probably don't realize how what they eat affects the environment, that mindset must change if the nations of the world are to feed their growing populations, lambertini said.\n\ngovernment, businesses and consumers must realize that the current food production model is unsustainable, said lambertini, who started his nearly three decade-long career in conservation as a youth volunteer with wwf. before being named to lead the organization in 2014, he was chief executive of conservation group birdlife international.\n\nglobal food production today consumes 70 percent of fresh water and creates more than 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions. lambertini also said that commercial fisheries are overfishing, killing as many as 10 kilos of sea creatures for each kilo of fish caught for seafood.\n\nthis is a completely wasteful approach that we cannot afford anymore, he said, adding that food production challenges will only increase given that the global population is projected to grow by more than 2 billion in the next quarter of a century or so.\n\nwwf is a 50-year-old global conservation group devoted to protecting the environment. at this year's confab in davos, where the theme is creating a shared future in a fractured world, the organization is stressing the importance of biodiversity, improving the health of oceans, and and transforming food production.\n\nunprecedented pressures by humans is altering the earth is profound ways, lambertini said, including acidification of oceans, deforestation and biodiversity loss. yet those problems are not yet triggering the response that is needed, in his view.\n\nanother threat revolves around modern beef production, which is an inefficient way to produce protein in terms of emissions created, water used and resulting deforestation. among the possible solutions are technologies and other sources of protein, such as seaweeds and insects.\n\ntechnology that maximizes the use of water, and changing how humans consume protein provide some of the answers, lambertini said.
blacksburg, va. -- two engineering majors at virginia tech university carefully planned the kidnapping and killing of a 13-year-old girl, buying cleaning supplies and a shovel at separate wal-mart stores, and then hiding her body in the trunk of a lexus, a prosecutor alleged on thursday.\n\nmontgomery county commonwealth's attorney mary pettitt described how authorities believe college freshmen david eisenhauer and natalie keepers plotted the stabbing death of 13-year-old nicole lovell.\n\ndavid eisenhauer, left, and natalie keepers, in their booking photos blacksburg, va., police department\n\npettitt did not suggest a possible motive, or describe the killing itself, but she said they planned for eisenhauer to cut the girl's throat at a remote location.\n\nkeepers is adamant that she was not present at the killing, but she is in the same position as the person who carried out the murder, the prosecutor told judge robert viar jr.\n\nmessages on the missing girl's phone led police to eisenhauer, who initially denied his involvement, pettitt said.\n\neisenhauer later said he drove to the girl's home and watching her climb out of her window the day she vanished. he said he greeted her with a side hug and then brought her to keepers, pettitt said.\n\neisenhauer, an 18-year-old freshman and distance runner at virginia tech, is jailed without bond on charges of kidnapping and first-degree murder.\n\nkeepers, 19, was denied bail thursday on charges that she aided eisenhauer before and after the crime, and helped hide the body.\n\nnicole, whose body was recovered in north carolina, two hours south of campus, was being remembered thursday at a private funeral.\n\nthose who knew the students beforehand reacted to the allegations with a uniform sense of shock.\n\nsome of the most pointed comments came from a facebook post attributed to gaige kern, a friend of eisenhauer and a fellow distance runner at virginia tech.\n\nthe david i knew had his faults, but this is beyond the scope of imagination, said the note, which was addressed to eisenhauer. did something happen to you that would cause a complete change, or was this newly surfaced personality always there, lurking in the shadows, hiding amidst lies? and if it was, how did you hide it so well?\n\nthe post also mentioned that eisenhauer had a goal of working for the defense advanced research projects agency, which develops technology for the military. kern told the associated press he wasn't ready to discuss the post or his friendship with eisenhauer.\n\neisenhauer and keepers went to high schools five miles apart in columbia, a planned community between baltimore and washington that's known for highly rated public schools and competitive athletics. it's not clear when they met.\n\neisenhauer, however, spent much of his childhood in washington state, where he attended a small christian school. his father was transferred to maryland after his sophomore year, and his parents bought their $620,000 home in columbia in 2013, property records show.\n\nhe started running competitively in middle school at riverside christian school in yakima, washington, which has just 320 students in preschool through 12th grade. excelling in the classroom and on the track, he had an apparently seamless transition to wilde lake high school, which has 1,200 students.\n\nhis coach at wilde lake, whitty bass, raved about him in a feature for wmar-tv, which aired last march.\n\nthese are the ones you take a deep breath when you realize what you've got and say, 'don't mess this up,' bass said.\n\neisenhauer was redshirted for his freshman year in track at virginia tech, according to a sophomore teammate, andrew eason. in the wmar feature, eisenhauer said he hoped to redshirt so he could run in college for five years.\n\nkeepers played junior varsity soccer at hammond high school but wasn't a standout athlete like eisenhauer. she joined the math team and model united nations, became a member of the national honor society and the national science honor society, helped direct the musical seussical and taught science at a summer bible camp.\n\nin 2014, she interned at a nasa facility in maryland, and planned to double-major in aerospace and ocean engineering and naval engineering.\n\nmy field of study is due to my fascination in the foundations of aircrafts, boats, and submarines. after college, i plan to hopefully get a job with the government or an aerospace or ocean company, she wrote in her linkedin profile.\n\nat virginia tech, she joined a program for freshmen called the hypatia women in engineering learning community. according to the school's website, participants live in the same dorm and are required to enroll in a semester-long seminar class where they talk about professional and personal development, academic success strategies and issues related to being women in male-dominated fields.\n\nthose who knew her said she seemed like a normal teenager in every way.\n\nshe was talkative, she had a lot of energy, said mindy niland, a 21-year-old student at howard community college. she said they were close in middle school, and that keepers had slept over at her house. we went shopping. she was really interested in guys. i don't remember her having any violent behavior.
medical testing company co-diagnostics said monday that its coronavirus test kits are now available for sale to laboratories in the u.s., an announcement that sent its stock soaring nearly 35%\n\nthe tests from co-diagnostics, which has also developed screening technology for zika and tuberculosis, said the tests are available for purchase by labs in the u.s. that are certified under food and drug administration guidelines called the clinical laboratory improvement amendments (clia).\n\nthe fda over the weekend changed its policies to address the coronavirus outbreak and speed up the diagnosis of people who may be infected. the increased testing is expected to reveal more positive covid-19 diagnoses across the u.s.\n\nthe coronavirus has infected at least 87 people in the u.s., six of whom have died. the disease has killed more than 3,000 people globally and infected 89,000, mostly in china.\n\nthe new guidelines allow fda-approved labs to start using the diagnostic tests before the agency has assessed them. that could speed testing and, health experts hope, help contain the spread of the virus. previously, labs had to wait for fda approval before ordering tests.\n\nwe believe this change will allow the diagnostics industry to respond to the developing situation much more rapidly and effectively, co-diagnostics ceo dwight egan said in a statement.\n\nco-diagnostics has already sold thousands of tests to labs in europe, where they are approved for sale, egan told cbs moneywatch. the salt lake city-based company is in discussions to sell its test kits to labs across the u.s.\n\nprevious to the fda announcement, we could already sell our test in europe and many other countries. the change makes it so we can make test kits available to clia labs in the u.s. for use under the fda guidelines, egan told cbs moneywatch.\n\nusing a person's fluids taken from a nasal or other swab, the company's ce-ivd logix smart covid-19 test kit employs a mathematical algorithm and ai to detect the disease. it delivers results in about 90 minutes, egan said.\n\nco-diagnostics said it's maintaining what it calls a compassionate pricing model that's used to set the cost of other drugs. the test kits typically sell for less than $10, depending on the quantity of kits and where they're sold.\n\nif you have a test but its price is out of range, it's irrelevant for a population. we haven't tried to jack up the coronavirus test price because it's a public health emergency, egan said.\n\nthe company's utah facility can produce about 50,000 test kits a day. we can certainly handle whatever kind of demand is foreseeable in the u.s., egan said.\n\nco-diagnostics kits are being used in italy, where there are more than 2,000 confirmed case of the virus. fifty-two people in italy have died from covid-19.\n\nthe centers for disease control and prevention have also developed a test that's being used to evaluate patients in the u.s. u.s. secretary of health and human services alex azar has said the u.s. has tested 3,600 people, and has also called for a radical expansion of testing capacity in the u.s.\n\negan said his company is ready to provide the government with its tests as needed. we aren't in competition with the cdc. we are supportive of what they are doing. we are just raising our hand and saying we are here as well and ready to supply tests if you need them.\n\nkelly wroblewski, director of infectious diseases at the association of public health laboratories, told cbs moneywatch that as of monday morning, roughly 40 of its members had ordered test kits from the cdc. she expects 100 of its member labs — all those that qualify — will order kits from the cdc.\n\nwe are more optimistic than we were last week, and we are excited about the fda guidance that allows for greater expansion of drug testing, she said.\n\nit's unclear if any of those labs will use tests manufactured by co-diagnostics.
a day after treasury secretary steve mnuchin suggested economic growth could pay for a majority of president trump's tax reform proposal, debt hawks are sounding the alarm, warning that any tax overhaul must not add to the federal deficit.\n\nconservatives are eager to do tax reform, but they're also eager to address the massive debt and deficit, a top aide to one key gop senator told cbs news. tax reform that adds to the 10-year debt projection is pretty much dead on arrival with most republican members of congress.\n\nif it's just pure tax cuts and no revenue-raising provisions, we don't predict that any tax cut will pay for itself. there's just no federal tax that's bad enough to raise sufficient revenue by eliminating it, explained alan cole, an economist with the conservative tax foundation. it means you're punting on the question of how the revenue will eventually be raised to pay for this.\n\nthe committee for a responsible federal budget (crfb) added friday in a release, not paying for tax reform is extremely misguided, would explode the federal deficit and end up harming long-term economic growth prospects.\n\non thursday, mnuchin acknowledged that eliminating loopholes and deductions will finance only a portion of mr. trump's ambitious plan to overhaul the nation's tax code.\n\nthe deal will pay for itself, mnuchin declared during a question-and-answer session at the institute of international finance's washington policy summit. the secretary added, however, that the administration fundamentally believe[s] in dynamic scoring and will judge the proposal's impact on the deficit accordingly.\n\nsince a rule change in 2015, the congressional budget office has gauged the cost of various proposals using two distinct methods: traditional scoring and dynamic scoring. the traditional scoring method looks only at the text of legislation to determine its impact on the deficit -- specifically, the money a bill proposes to spend, and the methods the bill proposes to pay for it. the dynamic scoring method, by contrast, adds to that calculation an estimate of the bill's impact on the broader economy.\n\nsome conservatives have long argued that the cost of tax cuts should be evaluated using dynamic scoring, rather than traditional scoring. they don't believe tax cuts must be fully paid-for in legislative text, clalming that the economic growth they create will counterbalance any additional money the tax cuts add to the national debt.\n\nsome deficit watchdogs, however, argue that past tax cuts haven't yielded the economic growth that proponents have promised. they believe dynamic scoring encourages fiscally irresponsible proposals that will blow up the deficit.\n\nthere is no evidence that broad-based tax cuts can pay for themselves completely, and economic studies from across the spectrum have found that deficit-financed tax cuts only pay for a fraction of their cost, the cfrb said in a blog post. even if tax cuts could generate more growth than estimated, no plausible amount of economic growth would be able to pay for the tax plan, let alone reduce deficits.\n\ncfrb president maya macguineas added in an email that the administration must decide how it wants to spend any revenue accrued through growth.\n\nthe administration has been saying they were going to use economic growth to deal with our fiscal challenges and reduce the debt. now they want to use growth effects to pay for tax cuts, she explained. you shouldn't assume growth effects before they occur, and you sure shouldn't count them twice.
when you're ready to search for professional money help, a smorgasbord of options will appear before you: financial planning; credit counseling; money coaching; burdening your nightstand with a teetering pile of self-help books.\n\nfinancial therapy is one of the newest additions to the field, emerging from a small forum for mental health and financial planning professionals in 2008. while certified financial planners help you develop and implement concrete financial strategies, and mental health professionals help you recognize and change thought patterns that aren't serving you, financial therapists straddle both worlds. they focus on your relationship with money and how it affects your behavior so you can realize your financial goals.\n\nmoney comes with a lot of emotional baggage, and there just aren't many places to talk about it openly and constructively, says dr. mary gresham, a financial psychologist in atlanta.\n\nif you struggle with saving, budgeting, paying off debt, severe frugality or other money issues, financial therapy could help. here's how to assess whether it makes sense for you, and how to evaluate any professionals you may work with.\n\nwhen to go to a financial therapist\n\nfinancial therapy can help you understand why you're stuck in the same patterns, such as overspending, even if you've tried to change. it also can help you explore the feelings that bubble up when you think about money. gresham and derek lawson, a doctoral student in personal financial planning with a focus on financial therapy at kansas state university, say financial therapy might be the right call if:\n\n1) your finances make you feel depressed or anxious\n\n2) you're consistently spending more than you earn or aren't saving any money\n\n3) you've tried to change those behaviors, with no luck\n\n4) you want to understand the root of your money troubles\n\nin some cases, other experts could better suit you. try traditional financial planning if you want straight money advice you're fairly certain you can implement on your own. if you're dealing with a mountain of debt and urgently need an action plan, try credit counseling. gresham says she refers her clients to these financial pros when necessary.\n\nwhat financial therapy looks like\n\nat your first few sessions, a financial therapist might ask you, what are your best hopes for your financial future? and how would you know if these hopes were realized?\n\ni might have a couple of meetings with clients before i analyze their financials, says lawson, who is also a financial planner at priority financial partners in durango, colorado.\n\nlawson says he'll ask clients who have trouble saving to focus on a time in the past when they did save and how they felt. that positive emotional memory may encourage clients to integrate saving into their lives more frequently.\n\nhow to find a financial therapist\n\nbecause there are few formal places to study financial therapy, practitioners today typically have either a mental health background and an understanding of financial issues, or a financial planning background and further training in mental health counseling. (kansas state university and the university of georgia offer financial therapy studies, and the financial therapy association plans to develop a certification in three to five years, says president-elect sarah asebedo, who is also assistant professor of personal financial planning at texas tech university.)\n\nyou can use the financial therapy association's member directory or do a general online search to find financial therapists or financial psychologists near you. the xy planning network lists financial planners who work with clients in their 20s and 30s. it's best to work with fee-only financial planners, who charge flat or hourly fees and won't earn commissions on insurance or investment products, like mutual funds, that they might recommend you buy. this type of planner may be more affordable than one who charges based on a percentage of your assets he or she is managing.\n\ncheck each professional's background and training: ideally, they'll have both the certified financial planner designation and licensure as a mental health counselor, marriage and family therapist, social worker or psychologist.\n\nthis article originally appeared on nerdwallet.
electric cars covered with solar panels. solar-powered laptop and smartphone chargers. an ai-driven system to cut the energy use of a home or a factory. this year's annual consumer electronics show puts environmental sustainability and self-reliance front and center.\n\nthe increase in eco-friendly gadgets at the largest consumer electronics event in the u.s. continues an improbable trend begun during the coronavirus pandemic. despite a broad economic decline, many green industries — from rooftop solar to bicycling — have thrived. once the pandemic is curbed, environmentalists say keeping these green habits going will be key if humans are to stave off another existential crisis: climate change.\n\nfrom the mundane to the fanciful, these ces technologies could help humans leave a lighter footprint.\n\npowering down the home office\n\nthe shift to work-from-home could have long-term environmental benefits — the equivalent of taking 14 million cars off u.s. roads every year, according to one estimate. but there's also a downside for those white-collar workers, mainly in the form of their work-from-home power bill.\n\nrich korthauer, vice president of final distribution business at the energy-management company schneider electric, said the pandemic has galvanized customers' desires to use power more sustainably.\n\nbefore [covid-19], you spent from eight to five in an office. your heating and cooling was taken care of, your power for your computer was taken care of, you left the lights on, he said. now that consumers can see those costs, they want them lowered, he said.\n\nto help, schneider is rolling out its wiser energy center, a home power management system that can analyze which appliances are using the most power and when, and can be programmed to turn certain circuits off at certain times of day. for $299, plus added costs to add smart switches or integrate solar or battery power, schneider is pitching the system as a cheap alternative to upgrading your home appliances.\n\nthere's so many smart products out there; you could end up with a dozen or more apps for each of the smart components, korthauer said. with wiser… you've got one app that literally will connect your entire electrical system with everything that you plugged into it.\n\na rendering of schneider electric's wiser energy-management system. schneider electric\n\nindustry, too, is looking to cut its power use. home and kitchen appliance maker bosch on monday unveiled an energy-management platform for factories that use artificial intelligence to cut factory emissions. the system is in use in hamburg, germany, and charleston, south carolina, said the company's chief technology officer, michael bolle. at the same event, bosch pledged to reduce emissions along its supply chain by 15% within the decade.\n\nthe sun goes mainstream\n\nelectric vehicles are getting plenty of play at ces, with exhibitors including lightyear one, an electric car covered with solar panels that is being developed in the netherlands; and geotab energy, a fleet-management system that promises to manage charging for large numbers of electric vehicles.\n\ncars with solar panels on them might seem like science fiction, but this year's ces has all manner of solar-powered gadgets. solar breeze, a company that sells a solar-powered pool cleaner, said it can barely keep up with demand since the pandemic began.\n\nfolks are spending more time around their swimming pool due to isolation, and so our rate of customer inquiries have doubled, the company writes on on its site.\n\ngosun, which sells solar-powered camping stoves, says its business has doubled during the pandemic. the company also sells solar-powered ovens and portable solar panels; this year it is introducing a solar-powered coffee brewer.\n\nthe main selling point for these items is resilience, not eco-friendliness.\n\nwe have this term, 'off grid,' gosun ceo patrick sherwin told reporters at a virtual press conference ahead of ces. we define that as something that begins as soon as you leave your house. your backyard is off grid. your barbecue. the event that you go to, the soccer field, the tailgate. and of course, it extends to the boat, the beach, the barbecue.\n\ngosun introduced a coffee maker to a solar-powered lineup that includes portable panels, a power bank and solar cooking implements. courtesy gosun\n\nsherwin even nodded to disaster preparedness becoming more accepted in the u.s.\n\ni don't see prepping as something that's all about bullets and bunkers. it's more about, you know, beans and band-aids and proper products that can fill you in, in these funny times and these less secure times, he said.\n\nhow do we want to live?\n\n\n\nof course, simply replacing our electronic gadgets with solar-powered versions won't stave off the climate crisis. even with the record drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, 2020 tied for the hottest year on record. the year began with record-setting wildfires in australia and ended with rolling blackouts in california just to keep the state's power grid from being overloaded.\n\nbuying solar-powered stuff without reconsidering one's lifestyle is a gimmick, according to mike berners-lee, an authority on carbon footprints and director of small world consulting, which helps companies reduce their climate impact.\n\nthe good news, he said, is that the technology to dramatically decarbonize the global economy doesn't need to be invented — it already exists. equally important is for consumers to understand that less-polluting ways of living can make a major difference, coupled with finding the will to maintain some of those lifestyle changes, such as flying and driving less, after the pandemic ends.\n\nberners-lee sees such budding social consciousness as a silver lining in a year filled with chaos and tragedy.\n\nfor people of my generation, especially in europe, life's just always carried on, he said. and the pandemic has really shaken that. the lovely stable world that we've known, for all its problems that we go on about, is fragile and precious, berners-lee said.\n\nwe've had so many shocks to the system, he said. people have had a chance to reflect, to say, 'when we do get our lives back, where do we want to live and how do we want to live?'
president obama announced monday that he plans to deliver a farewell address next week as his two terms in the white house come to an end this month.\n\n\n\ni'm just beginning to write my remarks. but i'm thinking about them as a chance to say thank you for this amazing journey, to celebrate the ways you've changed this country for the better these past eight years, and to offer some thoughts on where we all go from here, mr. obama said in a blog post on the white house website.\n\nthe president will deliver the address next tuesday from chicago, which is where he lived before becoming president.\n\nsince 2009, we've faced our fair share of challenges, and come through them stronger. that's because we have never let go of a belief that has guided us ever since our founding—our conviction that, together, we can change this country for the better, he added.\n\nthe announcement comes as the first family returns from their annual two-week holiday vacation in hawaii.\n\nmr. obama is set to deliver the address 10 days before donald trump's inauguration. the obamas plan to stay in washington, d.c. until sasha, their younger daughter, graduates from high school.\n\nit's unclear if mr. obama plans to do a final press conference. the last one he held with the white house press corps was at the end of december, just before he departed for hawaii.
bernie sanders' latest high-profile endorser on monday predicted that if a progressive doesn't win the presidency, the u.s. will have to deal with another donald trump down the road. washington representative pramila jayapal warned that a moderate like former vice president joe biden would not go far enough in transforming the country.\n\neven if it is a democratic president, if we don't address these issues we will end up with another donald trump down the road, the democratic congresswoman told cbs news. because people are suffering. and our job has to be to fix that suffering.\n\njayapal endorsed sanders for president sunday, a notable win for the sanders campaign over fellow progressive senator elizabeth warren. jayapal told cbs news that she chose sanders over warren because of a shared history of organizing she has with the vermont senator.\n\nat the end of the day, i think for me it came down to the fact that bernie sanders is like me: an organizer, jayapal explained. he believes the change that we need is bold and big, and institutional, but it doesn't happen without building a broader movement.\n\njayapal said sanders understands the urgency of the moment and used the occasion of martin luther king jr. day to compare sanders' vision to that of the civil rights icon.\n\nhe understands ... that tranquilizing drug of gradualism is not the way forward, jayapal said, referencing a quote from dr. king's famous i have a dream speech.\n\nasked if she informed warren about endorsing sanders over her, jayapal confirmed that she called warren before making her official announcement.\n\ni am endorsing fully bernie sanders. but if there comes a time when we have to come together behind elizabeth warren, of course we're gonna do that, and of course we're gonna back any democrat that is running against donald trump, she said. but this is our moment. this is our chance to turn this country around, and i really believe that bernie sanders is the guy that's gonna do that with us.\n\njayapal, the co-chair of the house progressive caucus, said biden is a much different kind of candidate than either sanders or warren.\n\ni don't think the [former] vice president would call himself a progressive, she said. it's about understanding that while it might sound more comforting to people to have gradual change, and just do small tweaks because it feels...less disruptive, the truth is, we have deep structural inequities in the system today.
in this episode of intelligence matters, michael morell speaks with will wechsler, the director of middle east programs at the atlantic council, about why the region is still of strategic importance to the u.s. wechsler discusses the perception in the middle east that the u.s. is withdrawing, the influx of young men in the region and the potential for more negotiations after the abraham accords.\n\nhighlights:\n\nwidespread perception of u.s. withdrawal in the middle east: if i was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of american withdrawal. now, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of iraq or afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. but if you compare it more historically, the united states really hasn't withdrawn. we still have a lot of military forces. our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. but this perception remains. the perception is not without merit. the perception comes from actions that consecutive u.s. presidents have taken. it comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the united states.\n\nthe most dangerous people in any society: when you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. there are very few things that are true for every country in the world. but one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. testosterone is a hell of a drug. there are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. they are attracted to destructive avenues.\n\nties between israel and the gulf: what can be done right now are smaller achievements. what can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some palestinian misery. i think actually over the long run, the abraham accords and growing ties between israel and the gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune.\n\ndownload, rate and subscribe here: itunes, spotify and stitcher.\n\nphoto provided by will wechsler, director of atlantic council's middle east programs\n\nintelligence matters: will wechsler transcript\n\nproducer: paulina smolinski\n\nmichael morell: welcome to intelligence matters, it is great to have you on the show.\n\nwill wechsler: thank you very much for having me.\n\nmichael morell: i should mention that i am on the board of the atlantic council, which is where you currently serve. full transparency here to my listeners. i think that's important. will, this episode is part of a series of episodes that we're doing between now and the inauguration on the key national security issues that we are facing as a nation and that president-elect biden will face. we started the conversation with h.r. mcmaster, who gave us an overview of what's going on in the world. we've now done episodes on both china and north korea. today with you, we turn to the middle east.\n\nlet me start by by asking you to explain why the middle east is still important to the united states, even though we are now, as a nation, energy independent?\n\nwill wechsler: u.s. policies change and presidents change, but our interests remain stable or at least long lasting until there are deep changes. one of those deep changes that has happened is that the united states, thanks to a fracking revolution, has become an exporter of oil instead of an importer of oil. that's a real change and that has important implications. however, that change can be overstated as well.\n\nwhat it really does mean is that, in the absolute worst scenarios, nobody can do to us what we did to japan before world war two, which is cut off our source of energy in context of a war. if worse comes to worse, we can go to autarchy. we can produce the energy that we need, at least the oil that we need, in the united states. that's a really good thing. but that doesn't mean that the united states is isolated from the world. it doesn't mean that the price of oil and energy and gas in the world doesn't affect the united states. the reality is that price is a global price and that price is not just dependent on us production. us energy producers do not give americans a discount for being americans. american consumers do not pay more for gas when it's produced in the united states. this is a global market.\n\nthe reality is that a very significant proportion of all that energy still comes out of the middle east. because of the nature of the sources of energy in the middle east. saudi arabia still is the swing producer and has very disproportionate impact on those global energy prices. we saw that recently when because of a dispute between saudi arabia and russia, saudi arabia decided to push energy prices into negative territory. something that we have never seen. thus, demonstrating their clout and their power in the world. these are realities in the world and realities that the united states policies have to take account for.\n\nmichael morell: are there other reasons why the middle east is important? one of our key allies, israel, sits right in the middle of it. sources of extremism, refugees. are there other reasons why we need to pay attention?\n\nwill wechsler: absolutely. the counterterrorism challenges that we all face are at a low ebb at the moment. but we've seen them be at the low ebb previously and we've seen them get much larger and more powerful and more directly threatening before. there's no reason to expect that can't happen again. we have a real concern about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, especially nuclear weapons in this region, especially iranian nuclear weapons.\n\nwe have a real concern about israel. israel is more secure and more prosperous than it's ever been before. but that doesn't mean that there are no threats to israel anymore and a lot of which come from iran and its proxies. we generally, ever since really the eisenhower administration, have acted as a status quo power, trying to return the region to the status quo when it's been upset in order to build a foundation for general security and general prosperity in the region. because we believe that overall serves us interests. we have a variety of those interests which aren't going away. despite the very popular view out in the american public- that's expressed by people on both sides of the aisle in the congress and almost everyone that was running for president that the united states- that we should do less in that part of the world. that doesn't mean that we should be doing nothing in that part of the world.\n\nmichael morell: do you find yourself more and more having to explain why the region is still important?\n\nwill wechsler: absolutely. there's a lot of reasons for that and very understandable reasons for that. for the last 20 years, starting with george w. bush's war in iraq, the united states really changed its policy that it had been following for roughly five decades before that. instead of supporting the status quo, it became one of the most important threats to the status quo. on top of that, the failures and mistakes in the implementation of that policy has led a lot of people in the region and a lot of americans to ask why are we still in this part of the world? why should we be spending our treasure? why should we be having our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines die for this part of the world? what's really in it for us? the president of the united states, president trump, says this repeatedly, even when probably at the high point of his administration, at least in this part of the world, when he was announcing the recent abraham accords between the united states and the united arab emirates, from the oval office, he couldn't control himself. he went off script and said, 'i don't know why we have any of our forces there protecting the energy resources anymore.'\n\nmichael morell: big picture. why has the middle east been such a mess for so long?\n\nwill wechsler: there are lots of reasons why the region is unstable. the most important of which is that the countries themselves are not natural countries in terms of aligning towards ethnic, tribal, religious lines. they have a lot of internal incohesion to them. they are relatively new countries. many of them have not too distant colonial pasts, where there were lots of dysfunctions that were built into the colonial architecture that was created. the lines were drawn by european powers, and the minority groups were promoted by those colonial powers intentionally. that is still a destabilizing factor. almost all these countries are fundamentally nondemocratic, which in the short term sometimes might have some advantages when it comes to stability, but over the longer term is inherently unstable.\n\nmichael morell: there seems to be a long-term struggle with governance in many of the countries in the region.\n\nwill wechsler: indeed, many of the leaders did not for many decades see their chief objective as improving the well-being of their populations. that's changed in some of the countries and the region. it will have to change if the region is going to become less stable over time. but when you look at the poor economic growth, when you look at the very high demographic growth, what you see is as a region that has a lot of challenges ahead of it. there are very few things that are true for every country in the world. but one of those is that the most dangerous people in any society are young men. testosterone is a hell of a drug. there are lots of young men in this part of the world that don't have avenues to channel their innate aggression into productive, constructive forms. they are attracted to destructive avenues.\n\nmichael morell: how important is the strategic competition between iran and its sunni rivals with regard to stability in the region?\n\nwill wechsler: it's very important right now. i can take one step back. i believe that today and actually for the last 5 or 10 years, there are a lot of different factors that are affecting trends in the region, lots of different micro factors that affect individual countries, lots of local rivalries. but if i was going to put my finger on the single most important factor that explains the largest number of actions that are taking place in the region today, it is the widespread perception of american withdrawal.\n\nnow, the reality is that unless you compare it to the high points of our occupation of iraq or afghanistan, in which case the numbers of troops have gone down from then. but if you compare it more historically, the united states really hasn't withdrawn. we still have a lot of military forces. our diplomatic presence is second to none, our intelligence efforts, our economic engagement. but this perception remains. the perception is not without merit. the perception comes from actions that consecutive us presidents have taken. it comes from the rhetoric that one hears from the united states. if you're a country in the region whose security architecture has depended for many decades on the united states, are you going to depend on that in the immediate future? of course. but looking ahead, 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, these countries are not going to bet the existence of their country on the united states staying the course as it has. they already experienced this. their fathers, in some cases, experienced this when the british left in the early 70s after promising that they would not leave.\n\nthis widespread perception exists and that perception itself is creating a vacuum that other actors are moving into. china is moving in economically, politically, to a degree. but not yet from a geostrategic point of view, china is very actively not trying to take the united states position, and they would much rather free ride off of our security guarantees for as long as as possible. but they're an important actor to note.\n\nbut aside from them, there are three other non-arab powers that all have historical legacy aspirations in the region and have all been moving very actively, very aggressively into the region. those are iran, turkey, and russia. all of whom have advanced their position quite significantly and materially in the last number of years. if you look back historically, when any of those actors have tried to move into this region, they've had to confront the historic arab powers in the region, those powers in cairo, in damascus and in baghdad. the leaders in those cities were the ones that had the ear of the arab street. they had the armies. they had disproportionate interest, disproportionate power, not only in their countries, but around the region. all of those places are at very weak moments in time right now. cairo, damascus, and baghdad are unfortunately each closer to being a failed state than they are to being regional leaders.\n\nthe historical european powers with interests in the region are similarly either not capable or not willing largely to play any types of roles with the exception of france. but even france is limited in what it can do and wants to do, mainly to lebanon and to some degree in north africa. what's left is a coalition that should have emerged a while ago, but for a number of reasons didn't. but it's finally emerging now between states, israel and the gulf, that have largely been interested in their own defense, but not been larger regional players. they are coming together now to position themselves to be able to protect the region against massive encroachment from these non-arab powers. quite frankly, that's a good thing because a region that ends up being dominated by iran or turkey or russia is not a region that serves our interests.\n\nmichael morell: let's start with iran- its nuclear program, its regional ambitions, its malign behavior. how would you think about a strategy of dealing with the iranians?\n\nwill wechsler: i think the american strategy of dealing with the iranians has to look really hard and learn the correct lessons from both the obama administration and the trump administration. in my view, the obama administration was absolutely right to consider diplomacy with iran on its nuclear program. the results of that diplomacy contributed indisputably to positive outcomes on the nuclear file. but there were some weaknesses with that approach. one of the key weaknesses was the division between the united states and its traditional friends and partners in the region, in particular israel and the gulf. a sustained approach to diplomacy has to bring those partners along with it rather than being perceived to be cutting them out. the trump administration took a very different approach to this, a maximum pressure approach to to iran. they got out of the nuclear deal formally, which i think was was a mistake. i don't think it was a mistake to add sanctions on iran at all. in fact, the nuclear deal very specifically allowed for such sanctions to be increased on iran as long as those sanctions weren't on the nuclear file. unfortunately, iran has a lot of other malign behavior in the region that merit sanctions. but the trump administration decided to go a different path.\n\nthe big strategic problem with the trump administration's approach was that internally it never really came to a conclusion about what the purpose of its maximum pressure campaign was. at the outset, there were groups in the trump administration, some groups that just wanted to increase sanctions in order to make it more difficult for iran to conduct its malign behaviors. there were other groups in the administration, i include the president of the united states in this group, that wanted to increase sanctions in order to get to a 'better negotiated outcome.' there were other groups that really saw this as an opportunity to promote regime change. unfortunately, the devil is in the details. the way one goes about constructing a sanctions regime differs depending on which outcome you desire. the way that the sanction regime was constructed appears to be most in line with the people who wanted regime change and not in line with people who wanted to facilitate additional negotiations. what i think we should do now, what i hope an incoming biden administration does, is opens the door for diplomacy, but use the leverage that the trump administration gives it with the existing sanctions to try to drive a hard bargain that would bring our partners along with it.\n\nour partners in the region, the arab countries on the western side of the of the persian gulf and israel, they only one year ago all sent emissaries rushing to washington because they were terrified that the maximum pressure campaign was driving them in a direction of a regional war with them on the front lines. they want to de-escalate as well. so i hope the goal is de-escalation. i hope the goal is confidence building measures. i'm a little skeptical, quite frankly, about whether or not a new nuclear agreement can be reached. i think that iran has turned much more hard line. in the interim, windows of opportunity open and close for such things. i hope i'm wrong on that. but i don't see a downside in trying.\n\nmichael morell: second issue is extremism, isis in syria and iraq, and al-qaida in syria. what should the u.s. role be here?\n\nwill wechsler: the salafi jihadist terrorist groups are different from other kinds of terrorist groups, are different from other kind of islamic terrorist groups, are different from other kinds of sunni islamic terrorist groups. we find that with terrorist organizations that have this particular kind of ideology, wherever they are able to achieve a degree of physical sanctuary where they believe that they can act with impunity, they have a one hundred percent record of doing external attacks. that's just a sad reality. our goal should be to deny them that kind of sanctuary.\n\nthe united states has tried a lot of different approaches to achieving that goal. we've tried invading and occupying countries. we've tried dropping hell fires from the sky to take out high value targets. what we've learned is that the most effective way of combating these kinds of terrorist adversaries is indirectly, is working by, with, and through the local actors who can themselves conduct these kinds of counterterrorism missions. sometimes these are through military channels. sometimes through intelligence channels. sometimes these are through law enforcement channels. sometimes that effort involves the united states doing nothing more than passing information and allowing our friends and partners to take action. but sometimes it takes more. sometimes it takes efforts to equip these partners, to train these partners, to advise these partners, to assist them in what they do and sometimes even to accompany them on their missions.\n\nall of these are different fundamentally than direct action, where the united states has to do it on its own and and has to do the finish against these terrorist actors. what i hope is that the united states doesn't look at the world as it is today where al-qaida and the islamic state have, thanks to great work that people like you were doing for quite a long period of time, has been diminished. and imagine that current state will be the state in the future. as long as there are underlying sunni grievances in so many of these places, we will find young men who will be attracted to this salafi jihadist ideology and we'll need to work with our partners to disrupt their external attacks. at the same time, we need to do the kind of work to prevent the extremism from catching on. helping our partners change their educational system, provide more economic opportunities. here, the united states isn't the the largest actor, the most important actor at all. we're not going to be the ones that are going to win the ideological battle for the heart of of islam. but we can do things to avoid making it more difficult for our partners, and we can assist our partners. that's necessary.\n\nmichael morell: next is the two-sided coin. that is mohammed bin salman in saudi arabia. one side of the coin being the reformer, the other side of the coin being the autocrat.\n\nhow should the united states should approach saudi arabia?\n\nwill wechsler: we can't write off saudi arabia, let's just say that out front. we have interests. there are a number of countries around the world where there are challenges to working with them. turkey is another one. it'd be a mistake to write off any of these countries. i include saudi arabia in that category. however, there are real challenges with with mohammed bin salman. if i can take one step back, right now, saudi arabia, no matter who's running saudi arabia, they really have three existential threats. i don't use the word existential lightly. the first threat is from a transition in leadership that is not yet finished. saudi arabia, like it or not, is a monarchy. anybody who has watched game of thrones knows the particular dynamics that come into effect when a transition in the monarchy is not finished. this is a particularly challenging transition as compared to other transitions that have happened in saudi arabia, because it's a transition to a new branch of the family. it's a transition to a new generation in the family. it's a transition in the fundamental way of doing business in saudi arabia from a very consultative, collaborative model to a more centralized model. that's the first existential challenge. until that's complete, that will continue.\n\nthe other challenges, the need for reform on virtually every aspect of saudi society. this one, mohammed bin salman has recognized in a way that none of his predecessors had. that's a really good thing. it's a really challenging set of problems that they have economically, socially, politically and so forth. when franklin roosevelt met with mohammed bin salman's grandfather, i think saudi arabia had about three million people and now it has roughly ten times that. saudi arabia is a rich country, but it's a country that has lots of poor people in it. we've already talked about the challenges of having young men that are aimless. there's a massive need for reform in saudi arabia.\n\nthe third one is iran. if you're sitting in riyadh as compared to 20 years ago, you see iran vastly expanding its placement and access and encircling you. it trying to- whether it's in iran, iraq, syria or in yemen- trying to build in yemen the kind of threat against saudi arabia from the south that they've been able to build over the decades against israel from its north. so these are really huge issues. the person that has to deal with them, mohammed bin salman, is somebody who was not trained all his life to deal with these problems. most americans know the story of the murder of jamal khashoggi. that was a horrible crime. in the old line in war and peace, 'it was worse than a crime. it was a mistake.' it really set saudi arabia back, but it was not isolated. it was the end to a year and a half of poor, rash decision makings by mohammed bin salman on a series of of issues. it wasn't like mohammed bin salman was inventing problems, but the the way that he chose to deal with these problems made the individual problem worse. one hopes that mbs, if he is able to move from crown prince to king, that he has learned from that experience because we could all be living in a world where he's going to be the king for many decades to come and our interests will remain there for quite a long time. if he has not learned from that experience that he's had, then we're in for a very bad situation.\n\nmichael morell: i have two more issues i want to cover. the first is the israeli-palestinian issue. how do you think about that?\n\nwill wechsler: there is not a very high probability of a solution for the israeli-palestinian problem today. the only real solution, the only lasting solution is a two state solution. that's really clear to anybody who's looked at it. unless you want to imagine solutions that are really horrific. the challenge is that the circumstances are not set at the moment for those kinds of negotiations to continue. i suspect it's going to require generational change. we've had three u.s. presidents in a row, bill clinton, condi rice under george w. bush, and john kerry under barack obama, who spent a wildly disproportionate amount of their time trying to get to a holistic solution to this problem. all of which have failed. i don't think a fourth attempt is going to do any better in these circumstances. what can be done right now are smaller achievements. what can be done are limited agreements on individual topics that can alleviate some palestinian misery. i think over the long run, the abraham accords and growing ties between israel and the gulf can actually help potentially set the stage for better negotiations when the circumstances are more opportune.\n\nmichael morell: what's the one piece of advice that you would give to president-elect biden on the region?\n\nwill wechsler: the one piece of advice is to really understand how much the perception of american withdrawal is affecting the region and how much his personal relationships with leaders there will be able to impact their continued thinking on that subject.\n\nmichael morell: will, thank you so much for joining us. it's been a real education on the region, which i think is absolutely necessary at this time.\n\nwill wechsler: thank you so much for having me.
by sean bryan/credit.com\n\nif you're struggling with credit card debt that you just can't seem to get out from under, one of the best ways to break free from that debt is to use a 0% balance transfer card. doing so saves you money in the long run since you won't be paying interest charges while you work on paying down that balance.\n\nwhat you need to know\n\nfirst, applying for a new credit card of any kind can end up dinging your credit just a little. that's because credit card issuers do what's known as a hard inquiry to determine if you qualify for their product. that check of your credit can have a small and temporary effect on your credit scores, but it's typically more than offset when you're approved for the new card because your credit utilization improves with the new line of credit. and as soon as you start whittling away at your outstanding debt with your new balance transfer card, your credit is likely to improve even more.\n\nthe five big factors in determining your credit score include your credit utilization, payment history, types of credit, credit inquiries and the age of your accounts. here's an explanation of each and how they are potentially affected when you apply for and use a balance transfer credit card:\n\nthe 5 components of your credit score\n\n1. credit utilization\n\nwhat it is: this is basically the amount your currently owe on your revolving credit accounts, and makes up 30% of your total score. if you keep your balances to less than a 30% of your limit, and preferably 10%, you'll be doing your credit scores a huge favor.\n\nhow it's affected: suppose you owe $10,000 on card a, which has a limit of $12,000. you're using 83% of your available credit. but now you open card b and move all $10,000 onto it (it has a limit of $10,000). you are now using a total combined available credit of 45% (a combined $22,000 on both cards). the new lower credit utilization could help boost your credit score.\n\n2. payment history\n\nwhat it is: this is the most important part of your credit scores and counts for 35% of your total. that's why it's so important to make your payments on time and avoid having your accounts go into collections at all costs.\n\nhow it's affected: if you made regular, on-time payments on the old card, and continue to make regular, on-time payments on the new card, you shouldn't see any change here.\n\n3. types of credit\n\nwhat it is: this is worth 10% of your score and in this area, diversity is key, so having a good mix of credit cards, auto loans, mortgage loans and even personal loans will help give you a good score.\n\nhow it's affected: since you probably already have a credit card if you're looking to transfer a balance to a new card, you likely won't see much, if any, difference here.\n\n4. credit inquiries.\n\nwhat it is: this area makes up 10% of your credit scores. too many credit inquires at the same time can drop your score.\n\nhow it's affected: applying for a new card will put an inquiry on your credit. as long as you're not applying for multiple cards, a single inquiry will have a very small effect. probably only dropping your score by less than 5 points.\n\n5. age of credit\n\nwhat it is: the longer you have been responsibly using credit, the better your score in this area. it accounts for 15% of your total score.\n\nhow it's affected: once you get your new card, hang on to your old one. don't cancel it. here's why: you want to keep your oldest cards open so that your active credit has as long a history as possible. plus, if you close the old card, you won't get the benefit of a score boost in your credit utilization, as explained above.\n\nyour credit & balance transfer cards: the bottom line\n\nopening a new account and transferring the balance over should save you money in the long run, and have a positive impact on your credit score — so long as you don't transfer your old balance and then turn right away and charge up a new one. don't expect a huge jump at the very beginning, but as you continue to pay down your balance by making timely payments, you should see some incremental improvement.\n\nbut is a balance transfer right for you? there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. it depends on the size of your debt, the interest rate, your income, your current credit score, and how soon you think you can wipe out your debt.\n\none consideration is whether you can pay off your debt during the 0% introductory apr period. if you feel your debt is too big to pay off in 15, 18 or even 21 months or you're worried about running up a balance on both cards, you could consider taking out a personal loan to pay it off. you won't get the 0% interest offer, but you will likely get a significantly lower overall interest rate than the credit card will offer after the introductory period ends and you'll have a set date that your debt will be paid off by.\n\nwhatever decision you make, you can rest assured that applying for an using a balance transfer credit card won't severely damage your credit so long as it used it as intended. and, if used properly, there's a very good chance your credit score will improve.\n\nmore from credit.com
president-elect joe biden will no longer take an amtrak train to washington ahead of inauguration day next week, according to a person familiar with the plans. it is not yet clear how mr. biden will travel to the inauguration.\n\nas of tuesday, the biden team was still planning the train arrival event, cbs news was told. but the sudden change in plans came as the president-elect was briefed on wednesday by the federal bureau of investigation and the secret service about security concerns surrounding inauguration day, following the attack on the capitol on january 6.\n\na spokesperson for biden's inaugural committee declined to comment on the change of plans.\n\nthe team is engaging with the current administration to gain as much information as possible on the threat picture, and on the preparations being put in place to deter and defend against violent disruptions or attacks, the biden transition team said in a statement on wednesday.\n\nthe transition of power from one administration to another is a touchstone of american democracy, the statement added. president-elect biden's team will be receiving daily briefings on the security and operational preparations to ensure the transition unfolds smoothly.\n\nbiden's arrival by amtrak train would have mirrored his decades-long commute to washington from delaware as u.s. senator. biden was quick to boast about his approximate millions of miles traveled by train over the years.\n\ncnn was first to report about the change of travel plans.\n\na biden transition spokesperson confirmed to cbs news that lisa monaco, former homeland security adviser to president obama, will serve as a temporary advisor to the transition on homeland security surrounding the inauguration.\n\nms. monaco will assist the president-elect and work with the incoming national security advisor, the incoming homeland security advisor, and current security and law enforcement officials, including with the united states secret service on their plans for the inauguration. given the existing threats, ms. monaco's temporary role will be focused solely on the period leading up to the inauguration, a transition spokesperson said.\n\nmonaco has been nominated by mr. biden to serve as deputy attorney general. the transition said monaco will pause activities and engagement related to her nomination to serve as deputy attorney general. this is an all-hands-on-deck period, but the goal is to quickly and seamlessly turn full responsibility to the incoming homeland security advisor and team as soon as possible. \n\nthe spokesperson also reiterated that the transition continues to press for a swift confirmation after alejandro mayorkas' january 19 confirmation hearing to be the next secretary of homeland security.
super bowl liii will be a clash of the coasts, with the new england patriots facing off against the los angeles rams. in both massachusetts and california, the use of medical or recreational marijuana is legal.\n\nacreage holdings, a so-called seed-to-sale cannabis company, wanted to air an ad about the benefits of medical marijuana during the game, but cbs rejected it.\n\nthey said, 'we're not taking advertisements for cannabis.' i think it was categorical, said ceo george allen.\n\ncurrently 33 states and washington, d.c., have legalized medical marijuana. but marijuana is a banned substance in the nfl.\n\nin a violent sport, polls show a majority of players support using medical marijuana to manage their pain, including nate jackson, a retired tight end with the denver broncos. he was flattened in a game in 2008 and a team doctor prescribed vicodin, an opioid, for his pain. jackson smoked marijuana instead and wants the nfl to change its policy.\n\nit's not about getting high. it's not about becoming a stoner. the nfl doesn't have to worry about that. the football is a lot worse for them than the marijuana, he said.\n\narthur blank owns the atlanta falcons and will host this year's super bowl. he is against allowing players to using medical marijuana.\n\ni probably would not be in favor of it because i am concerned about the gateway affect that it has on other drugs, blank said.\n\ncbs news asked to see the ad but the company didn't provide it. in a statement, cbs said, under out broadcast standards, we do not currently accept cannabis-related advertising. the nfl also has the right to reject super bowl commercials.
as the coronavirus pandemic spreads across the u.s., president donald trump last friday said he had a plan to help the 43 million americans with federal student loans to repay: a waiver on their interest payments. but experts say the plan may not offer much immediate relief because monthly payments could remain unchanged.\n\nour understanding is that this will mean monthly payments won't go down meaningfully (if at all) for borrowers, but payments will go entirely toward paying down the principal of the loan, michele streeter, a policy analyst for the institute for college access & success, a think tank for higher education, said in an email.\n\nthere's much that is unknown about the president's call for an interest waiver on student loans, such as when the waiver will end or if a loan's mix of principal and interest owed will be recalculated (or re-amortized) at the end of the waiver period. but the bottom line is that the interest waiver is unlikely to provide immediate relief to graduates if they lose their jobs or their income is reduced as the coronavirus tramples the u.s. economy. instead, bigger measures are needed, such as a pause payment on all federal student loans for at least six months, streeter said.\n\nto be sure, the interest waiver will help some college grads, but it's most likely to benefit those who continue to hold their jobs and can continue to manage their monthly payments through an economic downturn. borrowers will also pay down their loans faster by putting more toward principal.\n\nbut it doesn't help low-income workers who are already struggling to pay back their loans, noted charlie javice, the founder and ceo of frank, a company that helps students fill out the free application for federal student aid.\n\nthis helps upper and middle-income families, she said. it will be the higher segment that says, 'this is the best opportunity ever because i don't have interest to pay.' a lot of mba students and med school students should be helped.\n\nthe department of education said it's still working out the details of the plan, and didn't provide information about how the waiver would or wouldn't change monthly payments. the interest rate on all federally held student loans will be set to zero, a spokesman added. it won't include commercial loans or loans held by other parties, he added.\n\ncancelling student loans would provide a massive stimulus to our economy, which has been slammed by coronavirus. and it would help millions of families stay afloat financially while helping close the racial wealth gap. https://t.co/rb4ateqonk pic.twitter.com/fruh2qe0or — elizabeth warren (@senwarren) march 13, 2020\n\nthe waiver is effective immediately, according to the education department, which said it plans to release more details as soon as it is able to do so.\n\neven if it doesn't lower monthly payments, the interest waiver will impact many of the roughly 43 million borrowers who owe the federal government about $1.4 trillion. student loan debt in the u.s. now stands at more than $1.6 trillion, with the remainder held by private lenders. state loans and loans from lenders such as sallie mae won't be covered by the waiver, according to the new york times.\n\nborrowers who can't pay because of financial hardship may need to go into forbearance. the good news: the interest that normally accrues during forbearance will be waived, which means the borrower's balance won't grow as they put their loan repayment on pause.\n\nas the impact of the coronavirus deepens, there may be more calls on the federal government to take bigger action., especially if troubled industries like airlines and hotels seek multi-billion-dollar bailouts.\n\non friday, senator elizabeth warren, d-massachusetts, said canceling all student loans would provide a massive stimulus to our economy, which has been slammed by coronavirus.
after dropping for three years in a row, u.s. carbon emissions spiked in 2018, demonstrating how hard it can be to move away from fossil fuels while the economy is growing.\n\npreliminary data from the rhodium group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. that's even as americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low.\n\nwhile a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand, the report said.\n\nnatural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change.\n\nthe trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the paris climate accords play a role in the increase. but the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. between 2007 and 2015, u.s. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the great recession dampened demand for power. in 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace.\n\nso long as the economy is growing, that dynamic isn't going to change without a lot of breakthrough technology innovations or federal policy actions, john larsen, one of the report's authors, told greentech media.\n\nthe transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to rhodium. in this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one.\n\nthe largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: industry and buildings. the industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. the sector is predicted to grow its gassiness and to become the leading carbon emitter in texas within three years, according to rhodium.\n\nabsent a significant change in policy or a major technological breakthrough we expect the industrial sector to become an increasingly large share of us greenhouse gas emission in the years ahead, the report found.\n\nemissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. that's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector.\n\nthe prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the u.s. would be required to do under the paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. it would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. that prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, rhodium found.\n\nthe u.s. was already off track in meeting its paris agreement targets. the gap is even wider headed into 2019, it said.
shrugging off four launch delays over nine days, an upgraded falcon 9 rocket finally boosted a 5.3-ton communications satellite into orbit friday, blasting off from cape canaveral on a high-energy trajectory that will help the new relay station enter service about 45 days earlier than originally expected.\n\nunder a crystal clear sunset sky, the 229-foot-tall rocket's nine merlin 1d first-stage engines flashed to life just after sunset, at 6:35 p.m. (gmt-5), throttled up to 1.5 million pounds of thrust and pushed the falcon 9 away from launch complex 40 at the cape canaveral air force station.\n\nlaunch tries feb. 24 and 25 were called off because of problems super cooling the rocket's liquid oxygen propellant, a key feature in the upgraded booster's design. a third launch try sunday was scrubbed after a boat wandered into the off-shore danger zone, triggering a delay. spacex attempted to launch later in the window but but a low-thrust warning triggered a dramatic engine shutdown on the pad. a fourth launch attempt tuesday was scrubbed because of high winds aloft.\n\nthis time around, there were no propellant problems, the weather cooperated and the countdown hit zero right on time. initially climbing straight up, the falcon 9 quickly arced over and shot away to the east, putting on a spectacular show as the vehicle rose into the glare of the westering sun.\n\na spectacular shot looking back from the falcon 9's second stage, showing the cooling nozzle of its single engine with the booster's exhaust contrail visible against the limb of the earth. spacex webcast\n\nafter boosting the rocket out of the dense lower atmosphere, the engines shut down as expected about two minutes and 36 seconds after liftoff. the first stage then fell away for a planned descent to a landing barge some 400 miles offshore while the second stage continued the climb to space under the power of a single merlin engine.\n\ntwo second stage engine firings were required to boost the 11,620-pound ses-9 relay station into a slightly super-synchronous transfer orbit with an initial high point, or apogee, of around 24,420 miles and a low point, or perigee, of around 180 miles.\n\nthe satellite separated from the falcon 9 second stage 31 minutes after launch. on-board propulsion will be used to raise the perigee, lower the apogee slightly and align the plane of the orbit with the equator, eventually circularizing the orbit 22,300 miles up at 108.2 degrees east longitude.\n\nin such geosynchronous orbits, satellites take 24 hours to complete one trip around the world and thus appear to hang stationary in the sky, allowing the use of low-cost fixed antennas on the ground. ses-9 will serve southeast asia, the indian and pacific ocean regions.\n\nses's initial agreement with spacex called for guidance-controlled engine shutdown and satellite separation at a lower apogee, around 16,155 miles. from that point, ses expected the satellite to take 93 days to work its way to an operational orbit.\n\nbut spacex agreed to burn the falcon 9's second stage engine a few extra seconds to boost apogee by some 8,000 miles, allowing ses to reduce the time to final orbit by about 45 days. that will let the company put ses-9 into service earlier than originally expected.\n\nand that's important to ses because the company has waited more than six months for a falcon 9 launch opportunity after a spectacular in-flight failure last june.\n\nwe met with spacex and said guys, how can you improve our mission profile? how can you get us to orbit a little bit quicker? martin halliwell, ses chief technology officer, told reporters before the first launch try. and so we've agreed with spacex that we ought to change the mission from a guidance-controlled shutdown of the second stage to what we're calling a minimal-residual shutdown.\n\nto de-technify that, what it really means is quite simple, he said. we're going to burn the motor on the second stage for a few more seconds. that's all it really means. the big deal about that is, we're going to reduce our time to orbit by about 45 days. ... we should be in operational service at the end of may or the very beginning of june.\n\nthat's a big deal for us, it's a very big deal for our customers as well.\n\nbecause of the heavy weight of the ses-9 satellite and the required high-energy boost to a super-synchronous transfer orbit, the falcon 9's first stage did not have enough left-over propellant to slow down and fly back to a landing at the cape canaveral air force station. instead, spacex attempted a landing on a barge stationed some 400 miles off shore.\n\nbecause of the rocket's trajectory and high speed at stage separation, company engineers were not optimistic. a brief video feed from the barge showed what appeared to be the rocket's exhaust plume nearing the landing platform, but it was off center and the television signal cut off before the rocket came into view.\n\nspacex founder elon musk tweeted later that the stage landed hard on the droneship. didn't expect this one to work (v hot reentry), but next flight has a good chance.\n\na time exposure captures the climb to space of a falcon 9 rocket carrying the ses-9 communications satellite, march 4, 2016 spacex\n\nthe company hopes to perfect its landing techniques with incremental improvements and to eventually re-launch recovered stages, even those from high-energy trajectories, greatly reducing costs. halliwell said ses would have no problem buying a used rocket if it's flight worthy.\n\ni did throw out a challenge to spacex, that we would be the first satellite operator that would use the same rocket twice to get to geo orbit, he said. we discussed that with our investors and they really liked that. that's something i'd really like to do.\n\nspacex advertises a $60 million price tag for a new falcon 9. halliwell would not speculate about the eventual cost of a used rocket, but said that when discussing the possibility with spacex president gwynne shotwell, she joked it should be more expensive because it was flight proven.\n\nses-9 is the first of three ses comsats scheduled for launch this year aboard falcon 9 rockets with two more on tap next year. ses currently operates a fleet of 53 communications satellites with seven more under construction and four more in the development phase.\n\nequipped with 81 transponders, ses-9 will serve the asia-pacific region, providing video, data relay services, maritime and aviation communications and government services.\n\nwe're going to be developing the video marketplace there, we reckon we'll be extending our usage by around 22 million homes in indonesia and the philippines developing the high definition marketplace there, halliwell said.\n\nwe'll also be putting in support for enterprise-type data services. we have a mobility package on board, predominantly this is for maritime services, so we have an indian ocean beam ... and also we'll be looking at aero mobility for the regional marketplaces in asia.\n\nand finally, the institutional marketplace, government-type services as well, he said. all of these will be supported by ses-9. so this is really a very, very big deal for us.
americans have been killed by prisoners released from the detention center at guantanamo bay, cuba, a senior defense department official told lawmakers wednesday, triggering sharp criticism from republicans opposed to shuttering the facility in the wake of deadly attacks by the islamic state group in brussels and paris.\n\npaul lewis, the pentagon's special envoy for guantanamo detention closure, declined to provide the gop-led house foreign affairs committee with details. he would not say whether the incidents occurred before or after president barack obama took office in january 2009.\n\nwhat i can tell you is unfortunately there have been americans that have died because of (guantanamo) detainees, lewis said during an exchange with rep. dana rohrabacher, r-calif.\n\nwhen anybody dies, it is tragedy and we don't want anybody to die because we transfer detainees, lewis said.\n\nan obama administration official said lewis was referring to an incident that involved an afghan prisoner released from guantanamo while george w. bush was president. the official was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.\n\nduring the bush administration, 532 prisoners were released from guantanamo, often in large groups to afghanistan and saudi arabia - the two nationalities that made up the greatest number of prisoners.\n\nthe obama administration has released 144 detainees after a screening process that involves representatives from six government agencies and departments who must make a unanimous decision to release.\n\nlewis testified before the committee along with lee wolosky, the state department's special envoy for guantanamo closure. they argued the prison is a powerful propaganda tool for the islamic state group and keeping it open damages u.s. national security.\n\nrepublicans and a few democrats in congress have repeatedly thwarted obama's effort to close the prison and blocked any attempt to move detainees to u.s. prisons in legislation the president has signed into law.\n\nwolosky said the guantanamo prison did not prevent tuesday's attacks in brussels that killed at least 34 people and wounded more than 200 or the november 13 attacks in paris.\n\nthere are unfortunately going to be acts of terrorism, probably whether the facility is opened or closed, wolosky said. the proper analysis is, 'what are the risks of keeping it open in light of the very obvious use of that facility as a propaganda tool,' which, frankly, you should not have to question.\n\nthe committee's hearing marked the first open exchange between the obama administration and congress over the utility and future of the prison since obama sent his plan for shutting it down to capitol hill last month. the proposal was greeted with firm opposition from republicans, who declared his proposal to deliver an unfulfilled campaign promise a non-starter.\n\nrepublicans see the prison at guantanamo as more essential than ever. with the islamic state group carrying out deadly assaults in europe and expanding its base in libya, they said, there needs to be a place to hold terrorist suspects. republicans have refused obama's request that congress change the law that prohibits moving detainees accused of violent extremist acts to u.s. soil.\n\nthe committee's chairman, rep. ed royce of california, and other gop lawmakers have also criticized the obama administration for moving detainees to countries that are probably unable to ensure they don't resume the behaviors that got them locked up in the first place.\n\ncountries like ghana and uruguay aren't typical security and intelligence partners, but they are being asked to shoulder a heavy burden and responsibility, royce said.\n\nthere are 91 men held at guantanamo, down from nearly 250 when obama assumed the presidency. those left include 36 who are cleared for release if security conditions can be met in the countries where they will settle. seven face trial by military commission, including five charged with planning and supporting the terrorist attack of sept. 11, 2001. three others have been convicted.\n\nthe director of national intelligence reported this month that 5 percent of guantanamo prisoners released since january 2009, when the u.s. began using the multi-agency screening process, have re-engaged in terrorism and 8 percent are suspected of it. that compares to 21 percent confirmed and 14 percent suspected under the earlier system.
vienna -- iranian nuclear activities that could be turned into making weapons have remained at agreed reduced levels since a deal between tehran and six world powers was implemented last month, a u.n. agency reported friday.\n\nthe report by the international atomic energy agency did not specifically say that iran was honoring its commitments. but that conclusion could be drawn from the report, which essentially ticked off the major obligations that it said iran already met on jan. 16, noting no change from that time until now.\n\na senior diplomat said however that there could be some debate between the sides on some less significant activities noted in the report, including iranian manufacture of some components used in advanced centrifuges - machines used to enrich uranium, a potential pathway to nuclear arms. he demanded anonymity because he is not allowed to comment on the confidential report obtained by the associated press.\n\nkicking off implementation of the agreement, the agency said then that iran had met its commitments by greatly reducing its centrifuges. it also reported that tehran had re-engineered a reactor that in its original state could have produced large amounts of plutonium - like enriched uranium a potential pathway to an atomic bomb, and was honoring other obligations meant to reduce or eliminate its ability to make nuclear arms.\n\nthe july 14 deal with six world powers puts iran's various nuclear activities under iaea watch for up to 15 years, with an option to re-impose sanctions should tehran break its commitments.\n\nit aims to increase the time iran would need to make enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon from several months to a year, primarily by capping tehran's ability to enrich uranium, which can create material ranging from reactor fuel to warhead material. under the deal, iran committed to reduce its operating centrifuges enriching uranium by two-thirds, to just over 5,000 machines.\n\niran denies any interest in nuclear weapons and says its programs are meant only to generate energy, scientific research and medical applications.
washington -- as he honored four people on wednesday for risking their lives to protect jews, president barack obama warned that anti-semitism is on the rise and that an attack on any faith is an attack on all faiths.\n\nmr. obama spoke wednesday evening at the israeli embassy in washington, the first sitting president to speak at the embassy. he was introduced at the event by steven spielberg, the oscar-winning director of the holocaust film schindler's list and the founder of a holocaust history foundation.\n\ntoo often, especially in times of change, especially in times of anxiety and uncertainty, we are too willing to give in to a base desire to find someone else, someone different, to blame for our struggles, mr. obama said. so here tonight we must confront the reality that around the world anti-semitism is on the rise. we cannot deny it.\n\nthe united nations has designated wednesday as international holocaust remembrance day to commemorate the anniversary of the liberation of the auschwitz death camp in 1945. six million jews were killed by nazis and their collaborators during the holocaust.\n\nrecognized posthumously for protecting jews from harm during the holocaust were roddie edmonds of knoxville, tennessee; lois gunden of goshen, indiana; and polish citizens walery and maryla zbijewski of warsaw. the honors were bestowed by yad vashem, the world's holocaust education and research center, based in jerusalem.\n\neach was designated righteous among the nations, an official title awarded by yad vashem on behalf of israel and the jewish people to non-jews who risked their lives to save jews during the holocaust.\n\nmr. obama said the holocaust is unique, a crime without parallel in history, but he also sought to extend his concerns about confronting intolerance toward other faiths as well.\n\nit means taking a stand against bigotry in all its forms, and rejecting our darkest impulses and guarding against tribalism as the only value in our communities and in our politics, he said. it means heeding the lesson repeated so often in the torah: to welcome the stranger, for we were once strangers, too.\n\nedmonds, a master sergeant, participated in the landing of u.s. forces in europe and was taken prisoner by the germans. when the germans ordered all jewish prisoners of war to report, edmonds defied the order by figuring out how to keep the jewish pows from being singled out for persecution. we are all jews, he told the germans.\n\ngunden, a french teacher, established a children's home in southern france that became a haven for children, including jews she helped smuggle out of a nearby internment camp. she protected the children when french police showed up at the home.\n\nthe zbijewskis hid a jewish child in their warsaw home until the girl's mother could take her back.\n\nin televised remarks during the ceremony, israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said israel remained indebted to those being honored because of the jewish soldiers and children saved by their bravery. he also praised the u.s. and said there was an unbreakable bond between the two countries.\n\nwe know we have no better friend than the united states of america, netanyahu said.\n\nthe president's appearance at the israeli embassy came after several months of tensions during his pursuit of a nuclear deal with iran, which netanyahu vigorously opposed. the two leaders met at the white house in november as they attempted to reset ties for the final year of the president's tenure.\n\namerica's commitment to israel's security remains, now and forever, unshakeable, mr. obama said wednesday.
astronaut scott kelly set a record for the longest single spaceflight in u.s. history, and now, two years later, nasa has released new research about what the nearly yearlong stay in orbit did to his body. it confirms preliminary findings that kelly experienced changes to his gene expression -- although experts say reports that kelly's dna changed in space are an exaggeration.\n\nkelly spent 340 days on the international space station in 2015 to 2016, along with russian crewmate mikhail kornienko.\n\nto better understand the potential health impact of a year of weightlessness in space, nasa conducted a groundbreaking study comparing kelly to his identical twin brother mark, a retired astronaut who remained here on earth.\n\nthe twin brothers underwent medical testing before, during, and after lengthy mission.\n\none of the more interesting findings of the study concerned what some have dubbed the space gene. researchers discovered that while 93 percent of scott kelly's genes returned to normal after landing, the remaining 7 percent did not. nasa called the amount of change very minimal, but said it could point to possible longer-term changes in genes related to his immune system, dna repair, bone formation networks, hypoxia (oxygen deficiency), and hypercapnia (excessive carbon dioxide in the bloodstream).\n\nderrick pitts, chief astronomer and planetarium director at the franklin institute, told cbs news that understanding these factors becomes especially important when considering the potential for longer-term human space exploration and the health effects that could have on the body. a trip to mars, for example, could mean astronauts spending at least 3 to 4 years in space.\n\nwe do not yet clearly understand how the space environment fully affects the human body, pitt said on cbsn, and of those changes, how do we mitigate them and can we see a correction if we come back to a normal earth environment?\n\nhe offers the hypothetical that if humans suffered long-term health issues because of the way the genes expressed themselves following two years in space, that would drastically impact plans for future missions.\n\nwhat that would mean would be that we would have to abandon the idea of the human exploration of the solar system because everything else is more than 600 days away, he said. so that would make a major change in how we think about exploring the solar system, exploring space, and a change in understanding who we are and what we can do as explorers.\n\nof course, we are still years away from having such knowledge, since kelly's year in space is the longest time period for which researchers have this kind of data.\n\npitts also explained that changes in gene expression aren't that uncommon even here on earth. nasa describes gene expression as how your body reacts to your environment, and a huge variety of everyday factors -- from the amount of exercise a person gets, to the type of diet they eat, to which drugs or toxins they're exposed to -- can have an impact.\n\nlet's take twins. we can have a twin on the west coast and a twin on the east coast and what will happen is that those twins will react differently to their environments, so the way their genes are expressed will be different, pitts said.\n\nnasa issued a statement thursday offering clarifications on the research after some reports claimed kelly's dna had actually changed in space.\n\nmark and scott kelly are still identical twins; scott's dna did not fundamentally change, nasa said. what researchers did observe are changes in gene expression, which is how your body reacts to your environment. this likely is within the range for humans under stress, such as mountain climbing or scuba diving.\n\nsusan bailey, a professor at colorado state university and a lead researcher of the twins study, said she was shocked to see such headlines.\n\nit was news to all of us too, bailey told cbs denver. i think it was a very innocent comment. an innocent tweet that just exploded. it really caught people's attention and imagination.\n\non march 10th kelly tweeted out an article saying his dna had changed. he joked that even he was surprised.\n\nwhat? my dna changed by 7%! who knew? i just learned about it in this article. this could be good news! i no longer have to call @shuttlecdrkelly my identical twin brother anymore. https://t.co/6idmftu7l5 — scott kelly (@stationcdrkelly) march 10, 2018\n\nbailey said her research, and nine other studies, aren't finalized yet and should be released from nasa later this year.\n\nit's really just the beginning of finding out what space flight does to people, she said. we're still trying to figure out what that means and what caused it and if there's any kind of long-term health risk associated with that.
r&b singer r. kelly on thursday pleaded not guilty to an updated federal indictment that includes sex abuse allegations involving a new accuser. attorney steve greenberg entered the plea on the 53-year-old singer's behalf in chicago federal court. kelly stood next to greenberg in orange jail garb, holding his hands behind his back.\n\nthe 13-count superseding indictment was unsealed last month and includes multiple counts accusing kelly of child pornography. it is largely the same as the original indictment — which also had 13 counts — but includes a reference to a new accuser, referred to only as minor 6. but the indictment no longer includes any reference to a sixth accuser, meaning there are still a total of five alleged victims in the chicago federal case.\n\nkelly faces several dozen counts of state and federal sexual misconduct charges in illinois, minnesota and new york, from sexual assault to heading a racketeering scheme aimed at supplying kelly with girls. kelly has maintained his innocence, including in an explosive interview with cbs news' gayle king.\n\nthe grammy-award winning musician was jailed in july and has been awaiting trial at a chicago federal jail a block from the courthouse where he attends pretrial hearings. he has participated in hearings in his new york case by video.\n\nthe federal charges in chicago accuse kelly kelly of having sex with five minors in the late 1990s and early 2000s, recording some of the alleged abuse on multiple videos. he's also accused of paying off potential witnesses in his 2008 trial — at which he was acquitted — to get them to change their stories.\n\nthe indictment offers few details about the new accuser.\n\nit says she met kelly around 1997 or 1998 when she would have been 14- or 15-years-old. it says kelly engaged in sexual contact or sexual acts around that time and several years before she turned 18.\n\nthe new york indictment alleges kelly for two decades ran a racketeering enterprise comprised of managers, bodyguards, drivers, personal assistants and runners who recruited women and girls for sex with kelly and transported them around the country. it outlines allegations by five unnamed victims.\n\nprosecutors said during the hearing thursday that it was likely there would be another superseding indictment against kelly in the coming weeks, though they provided no details.\n\nalso thursday, u.s. district judge harry leinenweber moved the trial date from april to october 13. prosecutors revealed they very recently executed a search warrant in the case and seized at least 100 electronic devices, the chicago tribune reports, and wouldn't object to a trial delay to give them time to search the ipads, cellphones and hard drives.
ancient spanish shipwrecks and tree-ring data have revealed an unusual low in hurricane activity during the golden age of piracy, new research suggests.\n\nthis lull in hurricanes, which occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, may have been partly caused by a drop in sunspot activity, which reduced the solar radiation reaching the earth, the researchers found.\n\nwe're the first to use shipwrecks to study hurricanes in the past, lead author valerie trouet, a dendrochronologist at the university of arizona laboratory of tree-ring research, said in a statement. by combining shipwreck data and tree-ring data, we are extending the caribbean hurricane record back in time, and that improves our understanding of hurricane variability. [a history of destruction: 8 great hurricanes]\n\nthe new data could also help researchers understand how hurricane patterns will change as the climate warms, the researchers said.\n\ntrouet said she and her colleagues first got the idea while at a conference for tree-ring researchers. at that meeting, trouet mentioned that the national hurricane center began tracking caribbean hurricanes only in 1850, making it hard to understand how climatic change had affected hurricane season. but one of her colleagues, dendrochronologist grant harley of the university of southern mississippi in hattiesburg, noted that in the florida keys, people kept tree-ring data going back to 1707. and because hurricanes can stunt trees, hurricane intensity can be gleaned from those tree rings.\n\nthen another colleague, marta domínguez-delmás of the university of santiago de compostela in lugo, spain, noted that she dated old shipwrecks by analyzing the tree rings in the wood found underwater. the team wondered whether perhaps tree-ring data from caribbean shipwrecks could push the region's hurricane history further back in time.\n\nthe researchers dug up classic books -- such as shipwrecks in the americas: a complete guide to every major shipwreck in the western hemisphere (dover, 2011) and shipwrecks of florida: a comprehensive listing (pineapple press, 2015) -- to amass a detailed record of caribbean shipwrecks.\n\nfrom there, the scientists analyzed the ship logs to identify spanish ships that wrecked during hurricanes between 1495 and 1825.\n\ncombined, the hurricane data from historical accounts, as well as tree ring data from actual caribbean shipwrecks, revealed the same trend: a 75 percent drop in the number of hurricanes between 1707 and 1825. this was a period when few sunspots occurred, known as the maunder minimum. without these sunspots, earth received fewer rays of sunlight, leading to a cooler northern hemisphere, the researchers reported march 7 in the journal proceedings of the national academy of sciences.\n\nunderstanding how changes in heat affected the hurricane seasons in the past could help with regional hurricane-prediction models in modern-times, the researchers said.\n\nwe're providing information that can help those models become more precise, trouet said.\n\nfollow tia ghose on twitter and google+. follow live science@livescience, facebook & google+. original article on live science.
with super tuesday only two days away, bernie sanders leads in both california and texas, the two states that will award the most delegates when 14 states go to the polls on tuesday. in california, sanders holds a 12-point lead over his closest rival, joe biden. polling in these two states concluded before biden's victory saturday night in south carolina, though few voters said those results would impact their decision.\n\nsanders also leads the field in texas, though in this state he enjoys just a four-point edge over the former vice president. about half of voters in both states say they have definitely made up their minds already, and many have already cast their ballots.\n\nthese support levels would translate into a substantial delegate lead for sanders. we estimate that his current support in california would yield nearly half of the state's massive delegate prize, with biden and elizabeth warren splitting the rest. in texas, voters' current intentions translate into a narrower delegate lead for sanders over biden, with warren trailing them. and mike bloomberg, who is just under the 15% delegate threshold statewide, is in position to pick up delegates in specific districts, as many as a few dozen in his better simulations.\n\nin both states, sanders is seen as best able to address the issues and concerns of young voters, hispanics and working class voters. biden is seen as best able to address the concerns of black voters, while warren is seen as best able to address the concerns of women. voters in california and texas trust sanders best to handle a number of issues, particularly health care and climate change. when it comes to sanders' plans, majorities of his supporters in california and texas think he has the right approach, even if he won't get all of his initiatives done if elected.\n\nas has been the case in other contests, sanders is boosted by solid support from younger voters. nearly half of voters under 45 in california — and more than half in texas — pick sanders as their first choice. in california, sanders is the first choice among white and hispanic voters, while he trails biden among black voters. in texas, he polls about evenly among white voters with biden and warren, but leads among hispanic voters.\n\nbloomberg comes in fourth in this poll, behind warren in both california and texas. more than four in 10 voters in these states see bloomberg's campaign spending as a sign that rich people have too much influence in politics, more than those who think it either shows his dedication to the effort, or that he is independent from big donors. in cbs news polling after the debate last tuesday, bloomberg did not impress as many voters as other top candidates did.\n\nmost of his opponents' supporters in both states think that sanders' positions are too progressive to win over swing voters, were he to become the democratic nominee. but that may not matter much: large majorities of voters in california and texas think a candidate is more likely to win in november by motivating democrats to turn out in 2020, rather than by convincing trump voters to vote democratic. over eight in 10 sanders supporters think he has the best chance to beat president trump in november.\n\nwhile sanders has come under criticism from some opponents because he identifies as a democratic socialist, majorities of democratic primary voters in california and texas have at least a somewhat favorable view of socialism, and it is viewed more positively than capitalism. this is related to vote: sanders' supporters have generally more positive views of socialism than do biden's.\n\nthese cbs news surveys were conducted by yougov between february 27-29, 2020. a representative sample of 2,200 registered voters in california was selected, including 1,411 self-identified democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the democratic primary this year. a representative sample of 1,600 registered voters in texas was selected, including 635 self-identified democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the democratic primary this year. both samples were weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based upon voter registration lists and the u.s. census current population survey, as well as 2016 presidential vote. likely voters were determined using a model that takes into account self-reported likelihood of voting, along with other individual- and aggregate-level factors. the margins of error are 4.0 points in california and 6.2 points in texas.\n\ntoplines:\n\ncalifornia\n\ntexas
los angeles -- it started on june 11, 2002, with a couple of unfamiliar hosts posing in an empty theater and making an overblown declaration to tv viewers.\n\nlive on this stage, an unknown talent will be launched into superstardom, said brian dunkleman.\n\nyou at home decide who will become the next american idol, intoned ryan seacrest.\n\nthe reasonable reaction: uh-huh, sure. but it turned out the two were underselling fox's american idol.\n\nthe singing contest, which begins its 15th and final season wednesday, was a blockbuster that invigorated its network. it made stars of kelly clarkson, carrie underwood, jennifer hudson and others, and resurrected the tv talent show as a boom industry that includes nbc's the voice and abc's dancing with the stars.\n\nit not only was a huge success for fox but impacted everyone else, said bill carroll, media analyst with katz television group. it once again underscored the fact that broadcast television is communal and an event.\n\namerican idol, from megaproducer simon fuller and based on his british hit pop idol, did even more. it breathed life into the music industry as it and network tv both grappled with technology-driven changes in consumer habits.\n\nthe show's end is the result of dwindling ratings, the inevitable fate of even durable performers. idol, which averaged more than 30 million weekly viewers at its 2006 peak and ranked no. 1 for nine consecutive years, averaged about 11 million last season (still enough by today's standards to land it in the top 20, but with fewer advertiser-favored younger viewers).\n\nwhatever its change in fortunes, the series will get a send-off worthy of a television landmark, said executive producer trish kihane.\n\nas she sees it, that means paying tribute to its past while focusing on the battle among this year's contestants to become the last idol winner.\n\nit's that tricky thing of, 'hey, it's the 15th season, let's do nostalgia, let's look back at the show's really rich history,' kihane said. but on the other hand, you've got to find an amazing american idol. so we're trying to combine both of those things.\n\nto accomplish that organically, she said, past winners and familiar runners-up will be sprinkled throughout the season, starting with the open auditions in which ruben studdard, clay aiken, taylor hicks and others were on hand to share tips with the hopefuls.\n\nplans also call for duets pairing contestants with their now-famous predecessors, who all want to be involved, somehow, kihane said.\n\na famous non-idol, kanye west, made a surprise appearance at the judges' auditions in san francisco in september, with wife kim kardashian west along as his cheerleader. his tryout is included in wednesday's episode.\n\nthe season debut is a four-hour, two-night affair, airing from 8-10 p.m. est wednesday and thursday and opening on a retrospective note with the seacrest-dunkleman '02 clip.\n\none contestant featured in the premiere demonstrates the show's impressive hold on its fans. michelle marie lecza of daytona beach, florida, recalls watching it as a 4-year-old and can recite all of the winners, in order.\n\n'american idol' is what i based my life off of. i am going to walk into the audition room and go get my dream, the braces-wearing 15-year-old says.\n\nsuch fervor made american idol a well-timed hit. with social media gaining steam, viewers wanted to get in on the real-time conversation about idol - good news for networks selling commercial airtime and the sponsors who wanted their ads to be seen, not skipped as the show was replayed on a dvr.\n\nthe live idol episodes increased that appetite and launched the networks' embrace of a variety of other live broadcasts that included nbc's musicals the sound of music and the wiz.\n\nit was a salve as well for the music business: in 2009, steve knopper, author of appetite for self-destruction: the spectacular crash of the record industry in the digital age, called american idol and its robust digital sales one of the few bright spots for the industry as consumers grew increasingly resistant to shelling out for albums.\n\nthe series became such an impressive promotional platform that established artists including steven tyler, mariah carey and prince dropped in as panelists, mentors and performers.\n\nso did harry connick jr., jennifer lopez and keith urban, returning for their third year together as judges to usher idol to its conclusion. they're joined by the savvy, unflappable seacrest, the show's on-camera linchpin who outlasted fellow original cast members simon cowell, paula abdul and randy jackson (and dunkleman, who was one-and-done).\n\nurban said he's focused less on the show's farewell than what he calls the job at hand.\n\ni more often forget it's the last season until somebody mentions it, the country music star said during a production break at the dolby theatre. it's just finding the right person and making sure we don't miss somebody.\n\nhe said the show retains its power to jump-start a beginning career. for the farewell season, some 75,000 people swarmed to auditions in atlanta; denver; philadelphia and little rock, arkansas, in addition to san francisco.\n\ni love the fact that these guys and girls still see the potency and potential of something like 'idol' to take them to places really, really quickly, urban said.\n\nit would be ideal if the final season produces another american idol pop superstar, connick said.\n\nthe show has had a lot of hits, had a lot of misses. i would love to see somebody come out and put a bookend on what kelly clarkson did the first year, which is to sell a ton of records, sell a lot of concert tickets and became a household name, the jazz musician said.\n\nthat would be a great way to end it, he said.
a congressional hearing will begin wednesday in response to a cbs news investigation that showed how a costly new cure for hepatitis c isn't making it to most of the 200,000 u.s. veterans infected with the disease, many as a result of their service. congress has given $2.7 billion taxpayer to treat veterans with hepatitis c, but only 15 percent have been treated with the drug, one that might not exist without government funding.\n\nthe drug at the center of wednesday's hearing has been called a miracle drug, reports cbs news correspondent chip reid. the problem is the drug is so wildly expensive, the department of veterans affairs can't afford to give it to all the vets who so desperately need it.\n\ndr. raymond schinazi is in the business of curing diseases -- and business is good. when his private company invented and sold a cure for hepatitis c to pharmaceutical company gilead in 2012, he personally made over $400 million.\n\nsold as harvoni or sovaldi, one treatment costs up to $84,000. the department of veterans affairs gets a 50 percent discount, but even so, it spent over a billion dollars on the drugs last year alone.\n\nbut, as we first reported in december, the va is also where schinazi has worked since 1983.\n\ni'm seven-eighth's government employee, so i'm not full time. what i do with my remaining time is up to me, schinazi told cbs news last december.\n\nso you're only spending one-eighth of your time on your private companies, reid said.\n\nwell, even less than that. i'm very efficient, schinazi said.\n\nhas anybody ever questioned the arrangement that you have that allows you to become very wealthy while working seven-eighths of your time with the government? reid asked him.\n\nnobody has questioned anything yet, schinazi said.\n\nthat is about to change.\n\ni want to ask him how other than saying he was a very efficient worker, how were you able to accomplish the things that you accomplished without doing part of it on va time? chairman of the house committee on veterans affairs jeff miller said.\n\non wednesday miller will hold a hearing into why the va can't afford the drugs its own doctors help invent. schinazi was invited to testify, but told cbs news he does not plan to attend.\n\nunfortunately, he's decided to retire before he appears. which again begs: did he want to be questioned by an oversight committee of congress? miller said.\n\nthe va approved schinazi's arrangement and told us federal employees are allowed to invest in private companies, provided all conflict of interest rules are followed. but miller wants to know if there was a conflict, and why the drug costs $42,000 for veterans, but only $900 in dozens of developing countries.\n\nit's a slap in the face to the veterans, miller said.\n\none woman cbs news spoke to, who did not want us to show her face, has had hepatitis c since she served in the military in the 1980s.\n\nit's murder to have something that will save so many lives and then withhold it...for that type of money, she said.\n\nshe got the generic form of the drugs from india. but she was lucky -- in most cases, it's illegal to import them.\n\nwe're not criminals. we're sick people who need medication that we finally have available, that costs entirely too much, she said.\n\ncongressman miller says the va spends about $2 billion a year on research, and when that research is successful, it's supposed to benefit veterans. he wants to look into whether that happened in this case.
house speaker nancy pelosi addressed the u.s. conference of mayors wednesday afternoon, hours after president trump wrote a letter to pelosi saying he would conduct the state of the union in the house chambers despite pelosi's request to postpone the speech. she did not address the state of the union in her speech.\n\npelosi, who is the daughter and the sister of two former mayors of baltimore, began her speech by addressing the government shutdown.\n\nthe senseless and prolonged shutdown is inflicting chaos across the country, she said, adding that mayors could feel the impact of the shutdown in their cities. i know as the daughter and sister of a mayor that there is no buffer between a mayor and constituents...you know the shutdown must end, and must end now.\n\nshe said that while democrats support border security, they will not support building a border wall between the u.s. and mexico -- which she called a campaign applause line. mr. trump is refusing to sign any government funding bill which does not include money for a wall.\n\nthere is serious and justified concern that the president will shut down the government any time he doesn't get his way, pelosi said, explaining why it was important to hold firm. to the republican mayors in the room, pelosi said that she urged them to take back their party from mr. trump.\n\npelosi then outlined priorities for congress and for mayors across the country, including infrastructure, public education concerns and immigration reform. he said mayors needed to address three major issues in coming years: economic inequality, climate change and housing crises in cities across the country.\n\nas she was speaking, pelosi's office released a letter saying that she would not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the president's state of the union address in the house chamber until government has opened. for the president to address a joint session of congress, the house and senate must pass a joint resolution to create the session for him to speak.\n\npelosi sent a letter to mr. trump on jan. 16 requesting that he delay the address because of potential security concerns, as the government shutdown has affected the department of homeland security (dhs) and the secret service. however, mr. trump said in his letter on wednesday that dhs and the secret service had told him there would be absolutely no problem regarding security with respect to the address. therefore, mr. trump said he would fulfill pelosi's original jan. 3 invitation for him to speak and appear in the house chamber to deliver the address on jan. 29.\n\nit would be so very sad for our country if the state of the union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! mr. trump said.\n\nwednesday marks the 33rd day of the partial government shutdown, the longest in american history. mr. trump offered a deal to democrats over the weekend extending temporary protections for the deferred action childhood arrivals (daca) program and the temporary protected status (tps) program. while the senate will vote on the deal this week, democrats have already expressed opposition due to the temporary nature of the extended protections, and the $5.7 billion border wall funding request.\n\naccording to a cbs news poll released wednesday, 7 in 10 americans don't think the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown, which they say is now having a negative impact on the country. but partisans don't want their own side to budge: 65 percent of republicans say president trump should refuse a budget unless it includes wall funding, and 69 percent of democrats think congressional democrats should keep refusing to fund it.
for almost two years, joe biden has been telling americans what he plans to do on his first day in office — and the next 99 — if elected to be the nation's 46th president.\n\nin speeches, interviews, and in at least 49 published plans throughout his presidential campaign, mr. biden talked about the actions he'd take in the earliest days of his administration — what he would do if he triumphed in what he saw as a battle for the soul of the nation against president trump.\n\nincoming white house chief of staff ron klain distributed a memo saturday that reiterated mr. biden's intention to fulfill several of his promises — some geared toward immediate action to arrest the surging coronavirus pandemic, some to roll back the actions taken by president trump in the last four years, and others to address problems that have persisted over several administrations.\n\nthe initiatives include around a dozen of executive actions he can enact alone as president on the first day in office, january 20. here are a few of the highlights:\n\nresponding to covid-19\n\noverturning trump actions\n\nrejoin the paris climate agreement;\n\nend so-called muslim ban on travel, which in 2017 restricted travel and immigration to the u.s. from syria, iran, iraq, sudan, libya, somalia and yemen, before adding eritrea, nigeria, myanmar, kyrgyzstan, and tanzania in 2020.\n\n\n\nklain said the president-elect would continue to roll out other executive actions throughout the first two weeks of the new administration.\n\nin his 562-day presidential campaign, mr. biden made other day-one promises, too — here's the list:\n\nday-one promises\n\ncovid-19 response: rejoin the world health organization;\n\nrejoin the world health organization; immigration: send bill to congress for legislative immigration reform that will modernize our immigration system and give nearly\n\nsend bill to congress for legislative immigration reform that will modernize our immigration system and climate change: sign executive order to formulate plan to achieve 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050;\n\nsign executive order to formulate plan to achieve 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050; transgender rights: repeal transgender military ban enacted by president trump; mr. biden would also restore obama-era guidance for transgender students in schools, to protect students' access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity; and\n\nrepeal transgender military ban enacted by president trump; mr. biden would also restore obama-era guidance for transgender students in schools, to protect students' access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity; and environment: enact an executive order to conserve 30% of america's lands and waters by 2030.\n\n\n\nfirst 100 days\n\nmr. biden will be relying on congress to approve many of the initiatives he aims to accomplish for his first 100 days, which could potentially be difficult, even with the slight majority that will be held by democrats. here are some of those promises:
editor's note: since 60 minutes brought you our story on the plastic plague, highlighting the work of a young dutchman named boyan slat and his ambitious plan to clean up the world's ocean plastic, he's encountered a series of major setbacks. in november, slat revealed that the device he'd deployed in the great pacific garbage patch wasn't collecting plastic at all. then, just before new year's eve, there was more bad news: a 60-foot chunk of his 2,000-foot ocean boom broke off, and began floating away. engineers managed to salvage the runaway piece, and have begun towing the entire device back to shore where they will try to solve the problems. we are, of course, quite bummed about this, slat wrote in a post announcing the most recent malfunction.at the same time, we also realize that setbacks like this are inevitable when pioneering new technology at a rapid pace.\n\ntake a look around, odds are you're surrounded by plastic. it's in our kitchens and in our bedrooms, it keeps our food fresh and our medicine safe. it is, in many ways, a miracle product, cheap to produce and virtually indestructible. yet plastic's blessings are also a curse. that water bottle we use once and throw away will be with us for generations. there are campaigns to limit this plastic plague with bans on bags and straws and yet around the world, it continues to pile up, seeping into our rivers and streams and turning our oceans into a vast garbage dump. but one mop-haired young dutchman has come up with a plan which he says will save our seas. his name is boyan slat, he has no formal training and his much-hyped, multi-million dollar device has made him something of a sensation. so we decided to see what all the fuss is about.\n\nin an old naval base just outside san francisco, engineers have spent months assembling a curious contraption, the brainchild of a driven 24 year-old dutchman named boyan slat who dropped out of college to take center stage in a grand new venture.\n\nboyan slat's ocean cleaning device\n\nit's just 2000 feet of plastic piping, affixed to a 10-foot nylon screen, but slat's lofty promise? that he can clean up the world's oceans.\n\nhis idea, as he lays out in this animation, is to tow his device out to an area known as the great pacific garbage patch, the largest of five ocean whirlpools where much of the world's plastic accumulates. despite what you may have heard, the garbage patch isn't an island and it's even difficult to see with the naked eye. it's a vast soup of floating debris, much of it tiny and below the surface.\n\nif all goes according to plan, it's designed to use the wind, waves and water currents to skim the plastic, and corral it into an area where it can be removed, the first phase of an ambitious goal.\n\nboyan slat: i hope to deploy say around 60 of these cleanup systems in the-- in the next two to three years.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: sixty?\n\nboyan slat: yeah, which if we are successful with that, we should be able to remove half this great pacific garbage patch every five years.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and what about the other half?\n\nboyan slat: so of course we don't stop after five years. the eventual goal of this cleanup is to get to a 90 percent reduction by the year 2040.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: that's pretty aggressive?\n\nboyan slat: yeah.\n\nboyan slat with correspondent sharyn alfonsi\n\nwe first joined slat in early september just before he was due to take his system out to sea. it's fitted with an array of gadgets to alert ships to its presence and to allow slat and his team to monitor its progress in the middle of the pacific ocean. critics were already calling slat's multimillion-dollar moonshot misguided.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: there are a lot of people, as you know, who said, oh, this can't work, it won't work. it's a waste of time. is there a part of you that is waiting for that i told you so moment?\n\nboyan slat: i try not to lower myself to that level.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: how's that going? (laugh)\n\nboyan slat: yeah, it's going all right. (laugh)\n\nslat came up with the idea as a teenager eight years ago on a diving trip off the coast of greece. he was horrified by how much plastic he saw in the water and began collecting and analyzing it, and thinking of ways to clean it up.\n\nhe laid out his vision to clean up the ocean at a tedx talk when he was 18. it went viral and a self-styled savior of the seas was born.\n\na slick silicon valley-style roadshow followed and slat raised more than $30 million for his ocean cleanup, money he used to market his message and carry out research including an aerial survey to map the great pacific garbage patch. for the past five years, a team of engineers and scientists have been feverishly modelling, testing and revising slat's idea.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: but can technology solve a complicated problem like this?\n\nboyan slat: i think it's pretty much the only thing that ever has. thanks to human ingenuity and the human ability to work together, we do have a good shot at solving it.\n\ningenuity, well maybe, but for many researchers it's downright fanciful, given that eight million tons of new plastic flows into the ocean every year, mostly from places that have no way of dealing with their trash. this is a fetid river in manila. these are the shores of the dominican republic, but the problem is everywhere. this is los angeles last month. over time, that plastic disperses, disintegrates into smaller pieces, and often gets eaten by fish, making its way up the food chain. scientists still aren't sure what all that means for human health, but it's tightening its grip on marine animals and their habitat.\n\ndenise hardesty with contributor sharyn alfonsi\n\ndenise hardesty: on the most remote, most pristine beach, in the middle of the ocean, on a little, tiny island, you will find trash there, too.\n\ndenise hardesty is a research scientist for the australian government, and a leading authority on ocean plastics, who studies the problem around the world.\n\ndenise hardesty: i was even just in antarctica a couple years ago, and even there we're finding the refuse of human society.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and what does that tell you?\n\ndenise hardesty: the ubiquity of plastics has really made its mark. you know, humans are really good at creating things, and we're really good at making things that last forever, clearly with plastics. and they are everywhere.\n\nand that's been the case ever since plastic filled our homes in the 1950s. it was revolutionary. television commercials billed it as the material of the future.\n\nsusan freinkel: i think the flood of plastic products in the years after world war ii helped make the sort of american dream possible for people.\n\nsusan freinkel is a san francisco-based science writer whose book plastic: a toxic love story chronicles its history.\n\nsusan freinkel: it's kind of a technological miracle. i mean we've created this family of materials and figured out how to make them do pretty much anything that we want them to do, you know. you want it to be bendy, you want it to be transparent, you want it to be squishy? you want it to keep lettuce fresh for two weeks?\n\nsharyn alfonsi: there are a lot of things that are made of plastic that we don't really think of as plastic. where is plastic in our lives?\n\nsusan freinkel: how long have you got? i mean-- (laughter) i did a thought experiment at the start of my book where i said, okay i'm gonna go a day without touching anything plastic. i thought it was a great idea until i walked into the bathroom and looked down at the plastic toilet seat, and my plastic toothbrush, and-- so i said, okay i'm gonna spend the day writing down everything that's plastic. and by the day's end, i had this, you know, enormous list.\n\nsusan freinkel\n\nsharyn alfonsi: you look back at some of those old commercials, and it's really-- you know, plastic is sold as something that is life-changing.\n\nsusan freinkel: yes.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: i mean, one of the things you see in these early ads is, it will last forever.\n\nsusan freinkel: yes, yes, it will last forever. and-- unfortunately nobody really thought about what that meant.\n\nthere are really only three things you can do with plastic: put it in a landfill, burn it or recycle it. for decades, we thought recycling was the best answer, and we were told to throw our plastic, our paper and our aluminum cans into those familiar bins, to be picked up and carted away.\n\nbut according to roland geyer, an environmental scientist at the university of california, 90 percent of the plastic we used never made it into one of those bins at all. the other ten percent ended up in places like recology, a recycling facility in northern california.\n\nbut you'll be surprised to hear what they and many other plants across the country have been doing with that plastic.\n\nroland geyer: until recently, in california, and probably much of the rest of the u.s., two thirds of the plastic went straight to china.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: china. why china?\n\nroland geyer: china was accepting it and-- it appears that china found a way to recycle it economically which-- the-- the u.s. has trouble with.\n\nbut last year, all that changed when china decided it didn't want to be the world's trash dump and shut the door to our plastic, leaving plants like recology scrambling.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: where is all that recycling going now?\n\nroland geyer: a lot of the plastic has been diverted to other countries like vietnam, indonesia, malaysia, bangladesh, thailand.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and of those countries, do we know that what we're sending to them is ultimately being recycled?\n\nroland geyer: we hope it gets recycled.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: we hope--\n\nroland geyer: so we--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: --but do we think?\n\nroland geyer: we don't know. there's no real audit trail or anything like that so it's very difficult. and we know that a lot of plastic in southeast asia and other countries ends-- ends up in open dumps.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: this is discouraging, i think, to most people. is the idea of recycling a myth?\n\nroland geyer: i wouldn't call it a myth.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: but it's not working.\n\nroland geyer: for plastic, it's currently not working. so we need-- we need to change it. we need to try different things.\n\ncorrespondent sharyn alfonsi with roland geyer\n\nthere are campaigns across the country to ban straws and bags and try to reduce the amount of plastic we consume in the first place. but susan freinkel says it's simply not enough.\n\nsusan freinkel: i know all the problems about plastic, and if you open my kitchen, you know, cabinets, i've got a box of ziploc baggies there because it's easier. so you know, we have to really wrestle ourselves with-- what conveniences are we willing to give up, what kind of cons-- consumption are we willing to sort of pull back on in order to change.\n\nit is a big ask that would require a major overhaul in the way we live our lives, which may be why boyan slat and his big idea have been getting breathless coverage from the world's media, nearly all of whom seemed to turn up for the spectacle this september, as his system was towed under the golden gate bridge, 1400 miles out to the great pacific garbage patch.\n\nboyan slat: (laughter) it's five years of work and planning coming together, in one nice shot.\n\nboyan slat: it's-- it's overwhelming, exciting to see, going through the golden gate bridge right now. it's a beautiful sight.\n\nboyan slat's ocean cleaning device\n\nbut since its deployment, its performance has been less enchanting. the plastic it has managed to corral ends up floating right back into the pacific; a major design flaw slat's trying to fix. but even if he does get the device working, scientists we spoke to have serious doubts about just how effective it can be: for one thing, its ten foot screen can only skim the ocean's surface, missing plastic that's much deeper. it could also end up trapping marine animals. but their biggest criticism is that it's pointless to spend millions of dollars trying to clean the middle of the ocean when more and more plastic is flowing into it from the coastlines. for researcher denise hardesty, slat's device is certainly no silver bullet.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: you're skeptical?\n\ndenise hardesty: i would love to be wrong.\n\ndenise hardesty: what i'm suggesting is that we use our resources wisely and focus on the items close to source, where we can clean them up.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: get it earlier?\n\ndenise hardesty: get it early.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: get it closer to the shore?\n\ndenise hardesty: get it close to shore. and if you really wanna focus it, be smart, have-- have these big trash booms near the city centers. because that's where we lose much more of it as well. and if you wanna be even smarter, stop it before it gets to the coast. you know, have some rubbish traps at rivers that feed out into the mouth of the ocean or further upstream, even.\n\ndenise hardesty: you know, i think the analogy that you hear often is, if you've got a flood in the bathtub you're not gonna go just get a bunch of towels and try to keep cleaning it up, because it's still flooding over. you really need to turn off the tap, right?\n\nsharyn alfonsi: people that we spoke to said, this is like trying to mop up a flooded bathroom but leaving the tap on.\n\nboyan slat: i think humanity can do more than one thing at the same time. and-- you know-- if your bathroom is over-flooding, i'm still pretty happy that the mop exists. (laugh) eventually we need to mop it up, right?\n\nplastic is everywhere. it's not unusual to see water bottles or grocery bags wash up on our beaches. but surely, if you travelled far enough away from people and cities you might be able to find a pristine beach, untouched by the plague of plastic, right? well, we decided to find out. this summer, we travelled to midway atoll, a small group of islands midway between the u.s. and asia. it's an american territory best known as the site of one of the most important battles of world war ii. today, the islands are closed to the public and home to a host of exotic animals including a charismatic sea bird called the laysan albatross.\n\nit's not easy to get to midway, visiting involves a long permitting process and a chartered plane from honolulu to the middle of the ocean.\n\nafter three hours, tiny slivers of light appear. a postage stamp in the vast pacific.\n\nalbatross at midway atoll\n\nas soon as we landed, it felt like we'd tumbled down the rabbit hole, into a curious wonderland. there are so many birds on the atoll we could only get here after dark, once they'd settled down for the night. as we made our way inland, the albatross chicks were oblivious to our caravan.\n\nbut by daybreak, it seemed like we'd found paradise, a tiny atoll surrounded by turquoise waters. spinner dolphins patrol the coastline, endangered monk seals and giant sea turtles bask on its white beaches and of course the birds, so many birds. over a million flapping, snapping, chattering laysan albatross. the largest colony anywhere in the world.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and they just don't get out of the way\n\namanda boyd: some are friendlier than others. just like people.\n\namanda boyd works with the u.s. fish and wildlife service, which oversees midway. everyday, its beaches are the scene of small acts of courage and clumsy crash and burns.\n\nonce they're off, the albatross can spend months at sea venturing thousands of miles, but returning to the same spot, and the same partner. a relationship that begins with more preening and chest pumping than a miami nightclub.\n\namanda boyd: oh my gosh, (laugh) to watch them dance. and as they're court-shipping and-- when you find a pair that has actually been together and they're in sync, it's mesmerizing. they know each other's cues. it's like art. it's beautiful. it-- it's inspiring to watch that.\n\ninspiring and loud. honking lovers who are mostly ignored by their neighbors.\n\nif any place should be unspoiled, it's midway. the atoll is blissfully-isolated, off-limits to the public, and protected as part of one of the largest marine reserves in the world. so it was disturbing to see this.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: what are those orange and yellow things?\n\nkevin o'brien: harbor booms.\n\ncorrespondent sharyn alfonsi speaks with kevin o'brien\n\nkevin o'brien oversees marine debris removal in the region for the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration. hundreds of tons of plastic have been retrieved from midway in the last two decades. he showed us this year's pile, a veritable department store of discarded debris.\n\nkevin o'brien: here an intact crt-tv screen here.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: a whole screen.\n\nkevin o'brien: yeah. a whole screen--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: oh, look at this. so, you got enough things you can sort it, i guess.\n\nkevin o'brien: toothbrushes. we find an incredible amount of toothbrushes.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: tires.\n\nkevin o'brien: tires.\n\nwhat is unique about midway is that none of this plastic you see on the beaches here originates here. it's a problem that doesn't know borders.\n\nkevin o'brien: these can be dangerous because the young monk seals often will get curious and stick their snout into these eel cones.\n\nkevin o'brien: sometimes we'll find jugs full of chemicals with the lid still on which we have to treat pretty carefully. 'cause we're never sure what-- what's in it--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: what's in there.\n\nkevin o'brien: you know, the label's gone and…\n\nkevin o'brien: we found car bumpers, motorcycle helmets, firemen's helmets, golf clubs, bowling balls.\n\nall this trash ends up here because midway sits at the edge of the great pacific garbage patch, a vast ocean whirlpool that draws in plastic from coastlines around the world.\n\nkevin o'brien has been coming to midway for a decade to survey and retrieve the debris. this is some of what he hauled away last month.\n\nkevin o'brien: these nets are almost always made of some sort of plastic.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: uh-huh (affirm).\n\nkevin o'brien: once they've been weathered in the environment, they can become very brittle.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: whoa.\n\nkevin o'brien: and can easily break down into.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: little--\n\nkevin o'brien: microplastics.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: wow. so it looks like-- so this looks like it's breaking apart and going away.\n\nkevin o'brien: right.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: but it's not.\n\nkevin o'brien: but it's not.\n\nlong before plastics invaded midway, u.s. forces repelled a japanese assault in the second world war. the japanese had hoped to use islands as a bridge to the mainland. the american victory there in 1942 was a turning point. today there's a monument to the americans who died in the battle of midway and if you tour the islands you find relics everywhere, decaying artillery, derelict hangars, and beneath the water the rusting skeletons of old warships and of course, evidence of the new battle underway here.\n\nkevin o'brien: we've been cleaning it up for years.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and it keeps coming.\n\nkevin o'brien: and it keeps coming.\n\non a walk along one of the beaches we found a shoreline strewn with bottles and buoys, crates and canisters.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: is this a problem that's unique to these islands?\n\nkevin o'brien: it's really not. there are beaches like this all over the world.\n\nkevin o'brien: what is unique about midway is that none of this plastic you see on the beaches here originates here. it's a problem that doesn't know borders.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: i think a lot of people see this on their beaches. and it kinda looks like sea glass at first.\n\nkevin o'brien: yeah, it's-- it looks like a mosaic. it's really colorful, actually kinda beautiful.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: yeah, but what is it really?\n\nkevin o'brien: but a lot of this is really plastic. you know, and we can-- we can sift it here and see what we come up with.\n\nkevin o'brien: little pieces of--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: sure. this is a bottle cap you can see. and what's the harm with this? are fish eating this?\n\nkevin o'brien: yeah, and the smaller the piece of plastic and the smaller the animal that can consume it.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: do we know that they definitely have effects on fish?\n\nkevin o'brien: we don't know that for certain. these plastics become a magnet essentially for toxic chemicals that are found in the environment, pcbs, pesticides, fire retardant chemicals.\n\nkevin o'brien: and so the longer a piece of plastic stays in the environment, the more toxic it becomes.\n\nkelly goodale\n\nstudies have found these microplastics in everything from supermarket seafood to drinking water, but scientists don't yet know what all that means for our health.\n\nkelly goodale: when an adult comes in they'll make a couple of noises saying 'hey i'm back.'\n\nbut the effects on birds are easier to see. kelly goodale a u.s. fish and wildlife biologist, took us on a ride around midway to show us the impact all this plastic is having on them.\n\nkelly goodale: so the adults have been coming back every few days to a couple of weeks to feed them.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: what's happening right now?\n\nkelly goodale: it's-- it's regurgitating up more food. (laugh)\n\ndinner time here might make you lose your appetite.\n\nboth: oh. ooo.\n\nkelly goodale: did you see that squid?\n\nsharyn alfonsi: yeah. (laugh) that was a whole squid.\n\nkelly goodale: yeah. (laugh)\n\nsharyn alfonsi: that ought to keep you happy for a while.\n\nfor all the fish and squid they catch, the albatross bring back plastic too, from that great pacific garbage patch. goodale showed us their nesting grounds.\n\nkelly goodale: and so here, we do have a chick that did die. and as you can see, if you want to take a look at it.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: oh my goodness. (rustling) oh geez. look at that.\n\nkelly goodale: in here, you see there are so many pieces of plastic--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: plastic.\n\nkelly goodale: look at the amount of--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: plastic bag. and they eat the plastic bags why?\n\nkelly goodale: you know, these can look like-- food sources. it can look like a squid to them.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: so they think this is food?\n\nkelly goodale: they do think it's food. and, you know flying fish, they can lay eggs on-- on floating debris. and so they will absolutely lay eggs on pieces of floating plastic. so if the adults are out there foraging, they pick up those eggs as well as pieces of plastic in there.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: so it's the serving dish for the egg.\n\nkelly goodale: yes.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: and of the birds that you end up looking at and dissecting, what percentage of them has-- have plastics in them.\n\nkelly goodale: every single bird has plastic in it--\n\nsharyn alfonsi: every bird?\n\nkelly goodale: yes.\n\nu.s. fish and wildlife scientists estimate the birds carry five tons of plastic back to midway in their stomach every year, some of it kelly goodale collects and catalogues.\n\nkelly goodale: --a comb.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: --a comb? geez.\n\nkelly goodale: this one is probably one of the most disturbing ones.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: oh my goodness--\n\nkelly goodale: you have bottle caps in here.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: this looks like trash from a drugstore.\n\nkelly goodale: it pretty much is.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: okay, all this was inside one bird?\n\nkelly goodale: yes.\n\nparts of this atoll can look like the site of a disaster and while goodale says it's impossible to pinpoint the cause of death in every case, there's no question plastic can be fatal to these birds, either by filling up their stomachs and leaving little room for food or by tearing up their insides. as these photos from fish and wildlife show, that plastic, which scientists say can take a hundreds of years to decompose, is often the only thing left after the birds have gone.\n\nkevin o'brien: everyone, no matter where you live, has a role in this problem. even someone in south dakota, for instance, who has a river near their home and doesn't dispose of their plastic bottle appropriately might be contributing to this problem.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: all the way out here?\n\nkevin o'brien: all waterways lead to the ocean. and once this stuff gets into the ocean, the ocean currents can take it anywhere.\n\nanywhere and everywhere, it's hard to find a place not plagued by plastic. just then we got a reminder of what else is at stake as an endangered monk seal paddled by.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: what's this guy doing, you think? is he coming in to eat or is he gonna--\n\nkevin o'brien: he's coming in, he's checking it out. these are the locals.\n\nkevin o'brien: and whether or not you care about all of these incredible species that live up here in this very remote place, it does necessarily matter. because there are so many other things that rely on the ocean. people rely on the ocean for their livelihood. fishermen. people rely on the ocean for recreation, tourism. and right here, we have an indicator of the health of our ocean.\n\nsharyn alfonsi: you say this is an indicator. what does it tell you?\n\nkevin o'brien: it tells us that the scale of the problem is massive and it's global.\n\nproduced by michael h. gavshon and david m. levine. associate producer, jacqueline kalil.
british columbia, canada -- only on cbs this morning, national geographic adventure is revealing its eight most inspiring adventures of the year. they're chosen for embodying the spirit of adventure in groundbreaking ways.\n\ntwo of them did so as a couple. paul nicklen and cristina mittermeier are photographers. they met in the cafeteria of national geographic's headquarters. their dramatic images of the natural world have won millions of social media followers, turning them into conservation superstars.\n\ni think this year, we've been home less than two months, mittermeier said. but, you know, because we work together, home is wherever we are.\n\ni think there was a song about that, nicklen said jokingly.\n\nfrom pole to pole, and just about every place in between, nicklen and mittermeier have used their cameras to give nature a face -- whether human or otherwise. all of their photographs are taken to serve the same three goals.\n\nart, science and conservation, nicklen said. it's gotta be beautiful, it's gotta teach you something and it's gotta make you care.\n\nthose three elements came together in heart-wrenching fashion this past december when the couple released a video of a starving polar bear on social media. they photographed it on a recent arctic expedition and it was viewed more than 30 million times on national geographic's social media and web platforms.\n\nyou can keep reminding people of data and science that climate change is happening and that polar bears are going to ultimately disappear, but at some point, you have to slap people in the face and just say, 'this is what's happening, this is what climate change looks like,' nicklen said.\n\neverybody that saw that video, that saw those photographs, we recognize the fear and the pain that we're feeling about climate change in this animal and that's why it probably galvanized public attention, mittermeier added.\n\nalong with the serious intent that drives their work, their photographic expeditions are filled with inspiring encounters.\n\nit's one of my, probably, my favorite things on this planet to do, is to swim with leopard seals, nicklen said. i took christina down there last year and she jumped in the water, and that's when i knew christina was the girl for me 'cause there are not many people who are going to stick it out with that animal!\n\nasked what it was like facing the jaws of the beast, mittermeier responded: she's just letting you know that this is her territory, you know, and if you wanna be here, you're going to play by her rules.\n\naccording to nicklen, a seal tried to feed him during their expedition.\n\nrealizing that i couldn't catch a live penguin, she started to bring me tired penguins, exhausted penguins, he explained. and she's just staring at me with this dejected look on her face that i'm this useless animal in her ocean who's going to starve to death. she's trying to feed me penguins and take care of me.\n\nnicklen and mittermeier take care of each other in the field, but they also complement each other. while nicklen specializes in wildlife at the frozen ends of the earth, mittermeier captures the lives of indiginous people all over the world.\n\nyou just know that they have been watching the same place, the same tide, the same sea ice form for hundreds of years and so they know things that even the best scientists don't know, she said.\n\nthe pair comes away with more than just images. they see each expedition as an opportunity to learn something new as they did on a recent trip to remote parts of hawaii.\n\nsitting there with these powerful polynesian, hawaiian surfers on the beach and, you know, they would be out looking across the water and they said, 'you know, we never realized that we were poor until somebody from the mainland came over and told us,' nicklen said.\n\nfor nicklen and mittermeier, that perspective makes life richer and makes the job worth every moment.\n\nit's failing 98 percent of the time, being miserable most of the time, and being patient. believing in yourself, believing in the process and chasing that story, nicklen said. and that makes it rewarding.\n\nand you have to love the adventure of it, mittermeier added.\n\nlove and adventure. this couple has plenty of both.
facebook users can once again expect to see a change to their news feeds. the social media company is tweaking its algorithm to sift through and weed out posts you might not be as interested in at the top of your feed.\n\nnews feed will begin to look at both the probability that you would want to see the story at the top of your feed and the probability that you will like, comment on, click or share a story, facebook stated in a blog post. we will rank stories higher in feed which we think people might take action on, and which people might want to see near the top of their news feed.\n\nthe social media network said it gathered user feedback from surveys before deciding on the change.\n\nwe ask over a thousand people to rate their experience every day and tell us how we can improve the content they see when they check facebook -- we call this our feed quality panel. we also survey tens of thousands of people around the world each day to learn more about how well we're ranking each person's feed, the blog post said.\n\nthose who manage public facebook pages might be curious how these changes will affect traffic to their content. facebook asserted that this update will not impact the reach or referral traffic meaningfully for the majority of pages.\n\nthe impact of these changes on a story's distribution will vary depending on the composition of your audience and your posting activity, facebook said. pages might see some declines in referral traffic if the rate at which their stories are clicked on does not match how much people report wanting to see those stories near the top of their news feed. this update helps rebalance those two factors, so people are seeing relevant stories to them.\n\nthe site added that page administrators should avoid actions like encouraging lots of clicks, for instance, because that will cause temporary spikes in metrics that might then be rebalanced by feed's ranking over time.
airlines and airports say they are stepping up security before next week's presidential inauguration, with delta and other major airlines saying they will prohibit passengers flying to the washington area from putting guns in checked bags.\n\nthe move follow the january 6 riot at the u.s. capitol by supporters of president donald trump and politically tinged confrontations on some flights.\n\ndelta air lines was the first to announce thursday that it will prohibit checking guns to washington-area airports and was followed later in the day by united, alaska, american and southwest. all said their bans will start saturday and run through inauguration day until january 23.\n\nwe are all on high alert based on the events over the last couple weeks up in washington,″ delta ceo ed bastian said thursday on cnbc.\n\nspirit and jetblue did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nthe airlines also announced other measures. american airlines is bringing back a ban on serving alcohol on flights to and from the washington area — flights go dry starting saturday through next thursday. several airlines are moving crews out of downtown washington hotels for their safety.\n\nno more warnings for violators\n\nearlier this week, the federal aviation administration announced it will raise enforcement of rules against interfering with or assaulting airline crew members or other passengers. the faa said that for the next two months it will stop giving warnings to violators and will instead refer their cases to law enforcement for potential charges, fines and jail terms.\n\nfaa administrator stephen dickson cited recent disturbances on planes, adding there has been a trend after the breach of the capitol last week.\n\nkey lawmakers and the head of the nation's largest union of flight attendants have asked the fbi to place capitol rioters on the federal no-fly list. an fbi spokesman declined to say whether any rioters have been added to the watch list, although an fbi official said tuesday that such a move was being considered.\n\nso far, it has fallen on the nation's airlines to prevent an in-flight incident from getting out of control by threatening to ban people who refuse to wear masks or ignore flight attendants' orders.\n\nearly last week, several trump supporters in an airport and on a delta flight from salt lake city to washington heckled sen. mitt romney, a utah republican who has criticized trump and voted last year to remove him from office. bastian said the hecklers were identified with help from airline employees and other passengers.\n\nthere are six people, and they will never fly delta again, bastian told the associated press. they have already been notified.\n\nflight crew safety\n\na few days later, another republican senator, lindsey graham of south carolina, was harassed in the terminal at reagan washington national airport after voting, in effect, to certify president-elect joe biden's victory over trump. around the same time, alaska airlines said it banned 14 passengers who harassed crew members and refused to wear masks during a flight from the d.c. area to seattle.\n\nanother in-flight disruption captured on video occurred on an american flight earlier last week from texas to washington, d.c., with passengers screaming at each other after one person projected a trump 2020 image onto the aircraft's ceiling.\n\nbastian said delta has significantly increased our security both seen and unseen onboard planes and in airports leading up to the biden inauguration next wednesday.\n\namerican said it too is adding more security staff at washington-area airports for inauguration week and will change its gate-area announcements to remind passengers to follow crew instructions and wear face masks, said spokesman curtis blessing.\n\nthe airline is also moving flight crews from downtown hotels to ones closer to the airports and hiring private transportation for them. last week, passengers on an airport shuttle bus to reagan airport made racial slurs against a black flight attendant, according to the union representing american's flight attendants.\n\ntravelers going through reagan national or dulles international airport outside washington should expect to see more police presence through the inauguration, said micah lillard, a spokesman for the metropolitan washington airports authority. he declined to give details.\n\njeffrey price, an aviation-security expert at metropolitan state university in denver, said the federal government needs to deploy more air marshals and other personnel on planes flying to and from the d.c. area.\n\nthere have been too many incidents of flight disruptions, and flight crew should not be expected to handle these, lest they turn violent, he said.\n\na homeland security department spokesman declined to discuss staffing decisions thursday, although an announcement could be made soon.\n\nprice also said that it is a good idea to prohibit passengers from putting guns in checked bags if they are flying to washington. after inauguration i think we can lift the ban on checked firearms, he said.\n\nfederal law allows passengers to put guns in checked baggage if they are unloaded and in a locked, hard-sided case, although airlines have the discretion to ban guns. federal law prohibits guns or ammunition in carry-on bags.\n\ntwo days after the capitol riot, tsa screeners at reagan airport stopped a departing passenger who had 100 bullets in his carry-on bag. it is not unusual for people to pack guns or ammunition in bags they intend to bring on planes — they usually say they forget it was there, and they are rarely prosecuted — but the timing of the incident drew notice.
a teenager part of one of the largest indigenous tribes in the amazon has died after testing positive for covid-19, according to brazilian health officials. there are fears the coronavirus, which has already devastated much of the world, could wipe out remote indigenous tribes in south america.\n\nalvanei xirizana, 15, died on thursday in a hospital in the state of roraima, reuters reported, citing local health authorities. he belonged to the relatively isolated yanomami tribe, whose more than 38,000 members occupy rainforests and mountains in northern brazil and southern venezuela, according to human rights group survival international. advocates say deforestation and development by miners and loggers, encouraged by brazilian president jair bolsonaro's policies, have threatened indigenous people's territory.\n\nso far, two other indigenous people — an 87-year-old woman from para and a man from manaus — have died from coronavirus. brazil has had more than 19,600 confirmed cases and over 1,000 deaths from covid-19.\n\npaula vargas, the brazil program manager at amazon watch, an organization focused on protecting the amazon and advancing the rights of indigenous people, told cbs news that covid-19 is a huge threat to the over 850,000 indigenous people in brazil.\n\nif we are able to close our homes and shut off our offices and be safe at home from the virus, those communities are not having the same safety because the government and the authorities are not able to take from their territories the invaders, she said friday. the miners and illegal loggers — they don't do home office, so they're in their territories.\n\nshe added some indigenous organizations have reached out to amazon watch about groups of missionaries that are trying to reach them, even though they're in isolation.\n\nwhile all the world is telling people to stay at home, those indigenous people are suffering from people trying to invade their forest, she said. and if that happens, we already know that boy... he's from the yanomami people. miners are all over the place. they have people who are in contact with them.\n\nwe are seeing the possibility of genocide happening, vargas said.\n\namid the worldwide pandemic, many indigenous peoples quickly organized to self-isolate, cancel big events, and translate health guides into native tongues, according to vargas. however, hunger during the quarantine also poses problem, forcing indigenous people to ask for donations of food and clean water.\n\nmany of them sell their products, she said. if they're not able to go to the cities, there's a big crisis.\n\nbolsonaro, who took office at the beginning of 2019, has pushed for development over the conservation of the rainforest. experts have linked the staggering number of fires in the amazon last year to the rush to exploit the resources in the rainforest.\n\nvargas stressed that it's in the whole planet's best interest to keep indigenous peoples safe.\n\nwe also understand on a global level that they are the guardians of the forest that keep our planet healthy, she said. we don't want climate change. if they disappear from their land, we know the level of deforestation has gotten worse.
the elfstedentocht is the longest, most punishing outdoor speed skating race in the world. and it's been an essential part of dutch life since 1909. held in the northern province of friesland, the 125-mile race links 11 cities over frozen canals and waterways. but climate change has changed all that, and now the race is under threat. bill whitaker reports on an alternative race in the austrian alps that's drawing thousands of dutch skaters on the next edition of 60 minutes sunday, march 8, at 7 p.m. et/pt on cbs.\n\n\n\nit hasn't been cold enough to hold the elfstedentocht in the netherlands since 1997. a group of enthusiasts in 1989 began holding an alternative event 750 miles away in the tiny austrian mountain lake town of weissensee. it's now attracting several thousand skaters, nearly all dutch, and making for one heck of a party in a town that swells to about 6,000 for the event.\n\n\n\n60 minutes cameras capture the excitement of the race, the different kinds of skaters and the exuberant crowds drawn to the hamlet for perhaps the biggest skating party in the world. the boisterous celebration after the race is called the blister ball.\n\n\n\nit starts before dawn with skaters wearing helmet lights and ends well after dusk. for the top-notch racers skating 125 miles, it takes about seven hours to finish. others aim to skate half that distance or a personal best. many skaters start in the dark and end in the dark. there was even one veteran skater who fixed blades to his walker.\n\n\n\nwhitaker spoke to the blom family who drove 11 hours from the netherlands to get to weissensee. twenty of them skated. the youngest, 10-year-old jenrique, toughed out 60 miles. it took over nine hours.\n\n\n\nwhitaker also found an american who'd made the trek from the united states to austria. howard morris, a librarian from minnesota, dreamt of skating the elfstedentocht when he began speed skating. a dutch friend told him he'd have to go to austria to find ice. it's the reality of the times, says morris. i know some people fear that the whole tradition of skating will die out because of the change in winters.\n\n\n\neven in weissensee, there are worrying signs. high in the mountains, there was almost no snow in the village and ice wasn't thick enough in some parts of the lake to use its entire surface for the race.
blue apron's next big delivery will be to serve up its own shares.\n\nthe meal-kit delivery service has filed to go public, five years after it was founded with the idea of sending the ingredients and recipes for three home-cooked meals within one box. the company said it has delivered more than 159 million meals since then.\n\nthe new york company is one of the best-known of a wave of companies that sell boxes of ingredients for home-cooked meals. it has a host of competitors, including hellofresh and purple carrot. blue apron said in a regulatory filing thursday that it had 1 million customers in the first quarter of this year.\n\nblue apron co-founder matt salzberg told cbs sunday morning last year that its subscribers order some eight million meals every month.\n\nit's not a fad to cook at home, he said. and what we think we're doing is just making cooking at home more affordable, more efficient, higher quality, and better for the environment than the way that people cook at home today, which is going to a grocery store.\n\nblue apron's revenue has grown fast, from $77.8 million in 2014 to $795.4 million last year. but it is not profitable, and posted a net loss of $54.9 million in 2016.\n\nit says it plans to raise $100 million, but that is subject to change as bankers gauge demand. its stock ticker would be aprn.
detroit - the final destination is a mystery, but general motors (gm) is taking another step on its fast-moving journey into new ways of getting around.\n\nthe company on thursday announced that it's formed a brand called maven that will run its car-sharing ventures, including a new one that will begin competing with zipcar next month in ann arbor, michigan, and spread to other metro areas later this year.\n\ngm executives said they expect their main business model of selling cars to people will continue to be large, but they also see big changes coming with ride- and car-sharing.\n\nwe see significant opportunity as that change occurs, gm president dan ammann said. we very much as a company want to make sure we're at the forefront of that.\n\nthe unveiling of maven comes on the heels of two new mobility deals announced by gm this year: a $500 million investment in ride-hailing company lyft and the purchasing of the remnants of defunct ride-hailing company sidecar.\n\nmaven already has 21 parking spaces and new gm vehicles assigned to the area around the university of michigan campus in ann arbor, including spots in dormitory lots. it's also expanding a residential car-sharing project to more apartment buildings in new york city and to chicago.\n\nthe ann arbor project will let people rent cars for as little as $6 per hour through a smartphone app that connects to the cars' onstar system. customers will be able to sign up for the cars and remotely unlock them through the app.\n\nthe service is recruiting customers and is in testing now, but it should be open to the public in february, said julia steyn, gm vice president of urban mobility.\n\nas recently as last year, gm executives seemed nonplussed by trends toward a transportation-sharing economy, but ammann said plans were in the works long ago with the 200-mile chevrolet bolt electric car and deals in the works.\n\nthe company doesn't expect a huge boost in revenue initially, but with 5 million to 6 million people worldwide already sharing vehicles, we see it as a real commercial opportunity, ammann said.\n\nfor now, lyft will remain outside the maven brand, but gm sees it as a way to deploy self-driving bolts in limited geographic areas, ammann said, declining to estimate just when that will happen.\n\nautomakers have been poking around new mobility for a while. in 2008, daimler ag started car2go, a car-sharing service that now operates in 29 european and north american cities. last year, daimler bought ridescout, an austin, texas, app that shows the fastest way to get somewhere using buses, bikes and other transportation.\n\nbmw operates its own car-sharing service, drivenow, in nine european cities. toyota motor (tm) is part of a program in grenoble, france, that lets people take short trips in tiny electric cars. honda motor (hmc) partnered with zipcar, providing a fleet of honda fits for one-way rental.\n\nford motor (f) last year started a car-sharing service called godrive in london, which lets people use 50 cars across 20 locations. drivers can book and access their cars through a mobile phone app. in bangalore, india, ford is testing the idea of a small group of co-workers or families sharing one vehicle.\n\nford executive chairman bill ford said the company understands some of its experiments will fail, and others could change dramatically. he also said ford will likely find partners or acquire companies just like gm has done, along with doing some projects on its own. but he says it's no longer enough to just make and sell cars without addressing those who want to share vehicles or hail rides.\n\nwe have to do both, ford said last week. one thing we can't afford to do is put our head in the sand and wish it weren't so. it is so.
the wisconsin hospital employee accused of tampering with hundreds of covid-19 vaccine doses told investigators that he believed the vaccine could harm people and change their dna, according to a probable cause statement obtained by cbs affiliate wdjt-tv. experts have said there is no evidence that the vaccine can change dna.\n\nthe employee, identified in the statement as pharmacist steven brandenburg, is accused of intentionally removing 57 vials of the moderna vaccine from a pharmacy refrigerator at the aurora medical center and leaving them out overnight. the company said it fired the employee after he admitted to intentionally removing the vials. he was arrested last week by grafton police.\n\nthe probable cause statement, written by a grafton police detective, alleges brandenburg told investigators that he believed the vaccine was not safe for people and could harm them and change their dna. it also alleges that brandenburg admitted that the tampering was an intentional act.\n\nthe detective who wrote the statement also called brandenburg an admitted conspiracy theorist, but did not elaborate.\n\nsteven brandenburg seen in a booking photo dated january 4, 2021. ozaukee county sheriff's office via ap\n\naurora medical center originally said it had been forced to throw out more than 500 doses of the vaccine because of the incident, estimating the cost to be between $8,000 and $11,000. but ozaukee county district attorney adam gerol said during a virtual hearing on monday that the vials had been retained and would be tested by moderna, according to the associated press. gerol added that he planned to wait to see if the doses had actually been rendered ineffective before filing charges.\n\ngrafton police said some people had received vaccine doses that had been removed from refrigeration — but the department said it did not believe any of those people were at medical risk.\n\na judge set brandenburg's bond at $10,000 and ordered him to have no contact with aurora employees and submit his firearms to the sheriff's office, wdjt-tv reported. his next hearing will take place on january 19.
michael kors made a name for himself designing clothes for celebrities. but he's made his fortune with clothes that are ready to wear by anyone. he shares his secrets with rita braver:\n\nbackstage, the models are frantically prepping to walk the runway. but out in the house where the show will start in just minutes, one man is surprisingly serene:\n\nover 35 years of putting on fashion shows, and i don't get nervous, said michael kors. but i guess i'm kind of like the expectant dad, you know? this thing has been a long time coming and you want to see that gorgeous baby.\n\nand indeed, even hardened fashion critics agreed, it was gorgeous! rufus wainright sang his heart out, a-listers like emily blunt and sienna miller studded the first row, and models of the moment (like kendall jenner and bella hadid) strutted their stuff.\n\nmodels walk the runway at the michael kors spring 2017 show during new york fashion week. dimitrios kambouris/getty images\n\nfifty-seven-year-old michael kors took a victory lap, and why not? it's been quite a journey.\n\nhe showed his first season when he was 21 years old, and by the time the clothes arrived in the stores, i was 22, he told braver. i knew nothing, i have to tell you. i don't know what ups was. i mean, i didn't know how you actually delivered the clothes to the stores!\n\nborn on suburban long island, he started out as karl anderson. but his mom let him change both his first and last names when she remarried.\n\nand that wasn't all: at age 5, she brought him to a fitting for her wedding gown.\n\nand i just sat in the corner making a face, he recalled. and my mom said, 'what's wrong?' and i said, 'i don't know, it's just way too busy -- it had a lot of bows.' and i said, 'you know what? i think it would look better without the bows.'\n\nwithin a few years of graduating high school, he was working at a manhattan shop where the owners gave him a chance to design his own creations.\n\nmichael kors. cbs news\n\nthe response to the pieces the boutique started having made based on his designs was amazing, he said. i mean, it was crazy. we'd put it in the window and you know (snaps his fingers) you immediately knew a woman would come in and say, 'oh, can i try it on?' and you'd say, 'wait, i'm on to something here; let's do more of that.'\n\nhis fledgling line caught the eye of one of fashion's most powerful prognosticators: anna wintour, then at new york magazine:\n\ni took the collection and i kind of packed it into these big, messy garment bags, and i jumped on the subway, and i went off to see anna. and i remember it was her fall issue of new york magazine, and i was her fashion thing to look forward to.\n\ntoday, as editor-in-chief of vogue, wintour still cares enough for kors to step out on the red carpet with him at a fundraiser he's hosting for his favorite charity, god's love we deliver, which provides meals to the sick. and yes, she's wearing michael kors.\n\nbraver asked, what is about his work that you like? what gets you into a michael kors?\n\ni think michael has always understood the modern american woman, that he is trying to make her look the best that she can, wintour replied. he's less concerned about clothes wearing a woman. he wants the woman to wear the clothes.\n\nand it doesn't hurt that some of those women are celebrities: michelle obama (in her first official portrait), viola davis (at this year's golden globes), and kate hudson (on many occasions).\n\nwhen a woman puts something on, and her whole body changes and her energy changes and her confidence changes, he feels like he's succeeded, hudson said. and he really, really lives and breathes it.\n\nthere are a lot of boldface names in the world of michael kors, such as the outfit blake lively wore while pregnant: she wore it during the day and threw, like, a grey hoodie over it.\n\nat his flagship store on madison avenue, kors proudly shows off his couture line: sumptuous fabrics, with prices to match.\n\nthe handwork, all of this, is all done by hand, kors said.\n\nthis dress must cost thousands of dollars, said braver.\n\nit does. it does. but you'll have it forever. and the stretchy fabric will keep fitting.\n\nbut the bulk of his sales -- and most of the almost 800 other michael kors stores -- are devoted to his lower-priced lines. he also designs clothes for men. but, kors says, his clients all have similar aspirations: they want to look fashionable and current. they want to feel powerful but sexy. they want to feel youthful but not ridiculous.\n\ndesigner michael kors with correspondent rita braver. cbs news\n\nit seems hard to imagine, but at one time, kors almost lost it all. in the early 1990s, the chief backer for his lower-priced line suddenly ran out of money.\n\ni remember thinking, 'well, if this doesn't work, like, will i still be me? will i still be michael kors? what will i do?'\n\nit must have been so scary for you.\n\nscary. and what i learned from it is, you really have to stick to your guts. you know, you've got to stay focused.\n\nhe rebuilt the brand, and then in 2004 he got a call that would change his life: certainly, reality television and fashion had not merged, kors said of project runway. and i knew 'survivor.' and i said, 'are designers gonna be, you know, eating bugs and killing each other? what are they gonna be doing?' i thought it was insane!\n\nthe show, which judged the work of aspiring designers, took off, in part, because of now-legendary quips by kors like, it's tablecloth-y to me.\n\nbut after 10 years, kors left the show to spend more time on his business, and his marriage with lance lapere, his one-time intern who is now creative director of the company.\n\nbraver asked lapere, do you ever tell him, 'i don't think so, that's not a good idea'?\n\noh, yeah. all the time, he replied. it's always a back and forth.\n\nand these days, with a net worth estimated at $1 billion, life is very bright for michael kors:\n\ni am still so curious about what is next, and what's new, he said. i think when you lose that curiosity, you know, quite frankly, then you need to do something else. but i feel more juice today than i did when i was 21.\n\n\n\ngallery: michael kors' red carpet looks\n\n\n\nfor more info:
health and human services secretary alex azar announced two major changes to the federal government's covid-19 vaccine distribution plan on tuesday. states are now directed to vaccinate anyone 65 or older, as well as anyone below 65 with comorbidities, and the government will now release a large supply of doses it had been withholding to ensure that vaccinated americans got their second dose.\n\nwe are calling on our governors to now vaccinate people aged 65 and over, and under age 65 with a (health condition) because we have got to expand the group, azar said. and while the newly released doses can now be used as a first or second dose of the vaccine, azar stressed that operation warp speed is 100% committed to ensuring a second dose is available for every american who receives a first dose.\n\nbecause we now have a consistent pace of production, we can now ship all of the doses that had been held in physical reserve, with second doses being supplied by doses coming off of manufacturing lines with quality control, the secretary said. going forward, each week, doses available will be released to first cover the second doses and then cover additional first vaccinations.\n\nthe changes are meant to help address a disparity in distribution compared to actual vaccinations.\n\nthe trump administration pledged to vaccinate 20 million americans by the end of 2020. over 25 million doses have been distributed, but only about 9 million people have actually received their first dose of vaccine so far, according to the centers for disease control and prevention's covid data tracker.\n\nexpanding eligibility to all of the vulnerable is the fastest way to protect the vulnerable, azar said. it's simply much easier to manage allocating vaccines and appointments to everyone 65 and over, rather than narrower more complex categories, and it enables states to use much more diverse administration channels. he added that there was never a reason why states needed to complete vaccinating all health care providers before opening vaccinations to older americans and other vulnerable populations. states should not be waiting to complete 1a priorities before proceeding to broader categories of eligibility.\n\ncdc director dr. robert redfield said tuesday there is more vaccine available than is being requested by states, allowing for more liberal guidelines of who can be vaccinated.\n\nthe doses allocated exceeds the priority populations in group 1a, including frontline health workers and seniors living in long term care facilities. which means that supply now exceeds demand from those groups, azar said. he added that with manufacturing capabilities at pfizer and moderna now in place, officials would rather have lower-priority individuals vaccinated along with high-priority people if it means that vaccine is not wasted. use every channel, get the vaccine out there, he said.\n\npresident-elect joe biden has set a goal to vaccinate 100 million people during his first 100 days as president. michael osterholm, an epidemiologist and member of biden's coronavirus advisory board, told cbs this morning on tuesday that he'd view it as an aspirational goal.\n\nwe know right now that every day we don't have vaccine in people's arms, people are getting sick and dying, he said. and so, i think every effort must be made to do that, and the team is behind him in every way they can to help make it a reality.\n\nosterholm said the main issues slowing down vaccinations are coordination with private companies and equitable distribution among health care workers who are simultaneously battling a surge in coronavirus patients.\n\nright now we have had a real challenge getting vaccine into long term care facilities because the two private pharmacy companies that had the contract with the trump administration to do that have been very slow in getting it done, he said. second of all, in the health care setting it's been a challenge because many of these hospitals right now themselves are overrun with cases of covid-19, and it's very hard to coordinate both getting vaccine into these health care workers at the same time they're working 16 hour shifts day after day.\n\nmore than 22,000 americans died from covid-19 last week — america's deadliest week yet, for the second week in a row.\n\naccording to azar, the u.s. is on track to vaccinate one million people per day in 10 days time, and 95% of all long term care facilities will have had their first visit with vaccine doses by the end of next week. all of this means it's time to move on to the next phase of the vaccination campaign, as we had planned to do when the data showed we could, he said. this next phase reflects the urgency of the situation we face.\n\ndr. scott gottlieb, the former director of the food and drug administration, told face the nation on sunday that the current strategy for administering vaccines is not working and encouraged public health officials to take up a new approach to inoculate americans faster.\n\nwe really need to get this vaccine out more quickly because this is really our only tool, our only backstop against the spread of these new variants. if we can get a lot of people vaccinated quickly, we might be able to get enough protective immunity into the population that this stops spreading at the rate that it is, gottlieb said. so, we need to acknowledge that it's not working. we need to hit the reset and adopt a new strategy in trying to get out to patients.\n\nosterholm echoed gottlieb's criticism, but said that state and local health departments, which he called the air traffic control towers of distribution, will be newly engaged under the biden administration. i think you're going to see that all changing in the days ahead, and all i can say is we have to change it, he said.\n\nin addition to expanding the eligible vaccination group, azar also directed states to open more vaccination locations. hospitals made sense as the early distribution sites when the focus was on health care workers, but they are not where most americans go to get vaccines, he said. states should move on to pharmacies, community health centers, and mass vaccination sites as desired or needed.\n\nlastly, azar announced a fourth change in the vaccination program made under his authority that is slated to go into effect after president-elect biden has taken office. effective two weeks from now, allocation of vaccine will no longer be determined by state population, per capita, but instead based on the pace of administration as reported by states, and by the size of the 65 and older population in each state, he said. we're giving states two weeks notice of this shift to give them the time necessary to plan and to improve their reporting if they think their data is faulty.\n\nasked if the incoming biden administration supports the changes, azar did not provide a straightforward response. while we will certainly brief the biden team on those changes, we operate with one government at a time, he said.
palm beach county, florida — in between the usual super bowl ads, there will be a public service announcement featuring a former nfl star. anquan boldin's cousin, corey jones, was shot by a police officer in 2015.\n\nthe officer was eventually sentenced to 25 years in prison but the case opened boldin's eyes.\n\nyou're happy that justice was served, but then i soon found out that he was actually the first officer that was convicted in the state of florida on an on-duty shooting in the last 30 years, boldin said.\n\nin 2017, boldin decided to retire after a stellar 14-year nfl career. i stepped away to focus on the players coalition. i felt like something was more important than scoring a touchdown, he said.\n\na new psa highlights the death of corey jones, who was shot by a police officer in 2015. nfl/players coalition psa\n\nboldin co-founded the players coalition with eagles star malcolm jenkins. the group of former and current nfl players was formed in the midst of player protests. its $90 million partnership with the nfl seeks to improve social justice issues around the country.\n\nevery guy that is a part of the coalition is dedicated. you see guys going to meet with different lawmakers, senators and congressmen, boldin said.\n\nthe coalition helped pass legislation in florida to allow 1.4 million former convicts to vote. in massachusetts, it helped raise the legal age for juveniles from 7 to 12.\n\nwe are concerned about our country and as citizens in this country, we want to do something about it, boldin said.
pyeongchang, south korea -- canadian figure skater meagan duhamel is hoping to win a gold medal in south korea this month - though no prize could be more life-changing than her previous pyeongchang souvenir.\n\nnot after last year, when the two-time world champion pairs skater brought home moo-tae - an affable miniature dachshund mix with big ears, bowed legs and the bad luck of being born into the korean dog meat trade. duhamel, a vegan and animal lover, helped rescue moo-tae by accompanying him on his flight from south korea to canada last february. the 2-year-old pup has been living with her and husband/coach bruno marcotte in montreal since, spending his days doing yoga with duhamel and making friends at the local dog park.\n\nhe's like a saint, duhamel said.\n\nit's been a different life for moo-tae. like roughly 2 million dogs each year, he was supposed to be raised on a korean dog meat farm, where conditions are often poor. moo-tae may have been locked in a cage, beaten or left without food or water. certainly, he would have been sold and slaughtered, then probably served in soup at one of many restaurants still popular among korea's elderly population.\n\nkoreans have been eating dog for thousands of years, though the practice has waned recently and most in the country don't do it regularly. many older koreans believe dog meat aids virility, though younger citizens are largely either against the practice or indifferent to it. the country has begun shifting away from dog consumption as pet ownership has increased, with one in five households owning either a dog or a cat as of 2016. some major dog meat shops - like the moran market in seongnam - have been shuttered, and president moon jae-in even made a campaign promise to adopt a shelter dog if he won last year's presidential election. he welcomed a 4-year-old mixed breed named tory in july.\n\nstill, the industry persists, and despite pressure from animal rights groups - particularly from western countries - pyeongchang won't completely shelter olympic visitors from the trade this month. area restaurants were offered government aid if they stopped selling dog meat, but some declined to change their menus, fearing they'd spurn regular patrons and be left without customers once the tourists left town.\n\ni have been selling dog meat for decades. it is really difficult for me to change my menu just because of the olympics, said park young-ae, 60, whose young hoon restaurant is nearly in the shadow of the olympic stadium.\n\nin a dec. 12, 2017, file photo, park young-ae, owner of young hoon restaurant, arranges dog meats at her restaurant in pyeongchang, south korea. ap\n\na gangwon province official told the associated press there were no plans to relocate dog farms situated near olympic areas. there is one farm near pyeongchang; six near jeongseon, where the downhill skiing course is located; and 10 in gangnueng, the coastal town that will host events like figure skating and hockey. gangwon has 196 registered dog farms, though most are closer to seoul.\n\ngroups like humane society international want south korea to ban the slaughter of dogs entirely, while smaller groups have established volunteer systems to rescue dogs and close farms.\n\nmoo-tae's adoption was organized through one such group: free korean dogs. founder ek park was born in south korea and now lives in toronto, and she oversees adoptions that bring dogs to canada and the united states. she worked on moo-tae's adoption personally.\n\nbuddhists in the southern part of the country helped rescue moo-tae from a farm as a puppy, and park found him living on a monastery.\n\nhe loved to sit with the buddhas during meditation and yoga, said duhamel, who meditates daily. i thought, 'oh my god, maybe this dog has some special spiritual energy.' that was really why i chose him.\n\npark picked up moo-tae last year and drove eight hours north to meet duhamel in pyeongchang, where she and partner eric radford were competing at four continents in a test run for the olympic rink. moo-tae met his new parents in a parking lot outside the venue, calmly curling up in duhamel's arms shortly after being introduced.\n\nmost of the time, he just wants to sit in everybody's arms, duhamel said. he doesn't even care to play, he just walks up to everybody and wants to be held.\n\npark, moo-tae and a second dog, sara, met duhamel at the airport in seoul days later so that duhamel could fly the dogs back to toronto. moo-tae went home with duhamel and marcotte, while sara was united with another eager family waiting for her in canada. duhamel's parents, heidi and daniel, adopted their own pup through park's organization a few months later.\n\nduhamel and park hoped that other athletes might serve as flight volunteers coming back from the olympics, but air canada was too tight on space for that many dogs. free korean dogs handles most everything related to adoptions, including paperwork, vaccinations and crates for transportation, but the organization can't afford the thousands of dollars necessary to ship each dog without those travelers.\n\nwe have to really rely on flight volunteers flying from korea to canada, park said. that's like 90 percent of what we do.\n\nkorean rescues routinely have a hard time adjusting to their new homes, and free korean dogs monitors adopted dogs after they've been paired with families.\n\nmoo-tae, though, took right to life in canada. he's inseparable from his new brother, a 4-year-old rescued beagle named theo. the family also has a rescued cat, zara, living in its small montreal condo.\n\nhe brings a very special energy, duhamel said. i meditate every day, and he sits beside me patiently while i meditate. i don't know if he was trained to do that.\n\nthe only remaining mark from moo-tae's past is physical -- his front legs are a bit misshapen, possibly from abuse as a puppy.\n\notherwise, he's happy as could be.\n\nmoo-tae was so strong and calm, duhamel said. that's a funny way to describe a dog, but that's exactly how i'd describe him. he's so content.\n\nwe have a lady that walks our dogs every day while we're training, and she says moo-tae is the most popular dog in the dog park.\n\nduhamel, a sochi silver medalist in the team event, is planning to do more to undercut the dog meat industry on this trip to korea with humane society international. she, american skier gus kenworthy and american snowboarder lindsey jacobellis have appeared in a public service announcement about the dog meat trade, and duhamel is also hoping to assist in shuttering a farm or two once she's done competing in south korea.\n\nshe's also arranged with park to fly home another rescued dog when she returns to canada. this one, though, won't be coming all the way home with her.\n\ni don't have the luxury of keeping another dog in my small condo, she said. as much as i would love to.
starbucks customers may no longer use their own cups at the coffee chain, which cited concerns about the coronavirus outbreak in announcing the change in policy.\n\nalthough that could change, there's no set date for when the personal cup opinion will return. starbucks said it will continue to offer a 10 cent discount to people who bring in a cup or request for here ware.\n\nin an open letter posted on the company's blog, a starbucks executive said the retailer is also taking other steps to halt the spread of the coronavirus. those include sanitizing company-owned stores and restricting all business travel, both within the u.s. and abroad, until march 31. in addition, large meetings of starbucks employees scheduled in the u.s. and canada have been changed or postponed.\n\nas part of communities worldwide, we are navigating this situation with nimbleness, learning and adapting as new information is made available, wrote rossann williams, president of u.s. company-operated business and canada at starbucks.\n\nthe announcement comes two months after starbucks said it would temporarily close 2,000 restaurants across china — roughly half of its shops in the country — due to the outbreak centered in the city of wuhan. starbucks has more than 4,100 stores in 168 chinese cities, making china the company's second-largest market.\n\nat least 11 people have died in the u.s. from the covid-19 disease caused by the coronavirus. globally, 93,000 cases have been confirmed, with 3,200 deaths.\n\neditor's note: this story was initially published with a photo of a starbucks in china. it has been updated with a photo of starbucks beverage containers, as that is the subject of the company's policy change in the u.s.
some progressive democrats have announced that they will vote against house democrats' rules package, which was rolled out tuesday evening. although the package includes bills which would create a committee on climate change and implement ethics reforms, some representatives are basing their opposition on the inclusion of the pay as you go rule.\n\nthe pay as you go rule, commonly known as paygo, requires that any increase in entitlement spending be offset by cuts in other entitlement programs, or by new revenue raisers, in order to prevent the deficit from increasing. the deficit jumped by 17 percent in 2018, after the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul passed in 2017. while managing a yawning deficit may be a priority for presumed incoming house speaker nancy pelosi, it angers progressives who oppose cutting some entitlement spending in order to increase funding for other programs.\n\nafter the new house is seated, one of the first orders of business will be approving the new rules package governing the house for this term. assuming none of the 197 republicans vote to approve the rules package, the 234-member democratic conference cannot afford to lose more than 16 votes in order for it to pass.\n\ncalifornia rep. ro khanna was the first democrat to announce his opposition to the rules package based on the paygo provision wednesday.\n\nit is terrible economics. the austerians were wrong about the great recession and great depression. at some point, politicians need to learn from mistakes and read economic history, khanna tweeted, referring to austerity measures, which are focused on reducing a deficit due to risks of budget default.\n\nincoming new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, who has quickly become a leading progressive voice in the freshman class, also said that she would not vote for the package on twitter. in her tweet, ocasio-cortez said that the paygo rule is a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\n\nso far, khanna and ocasio-cortez are the only democrats to announce opposition to the package. other notable provisions include reviving the gephardt rule, which automatically raises the debt ceiling when the house passes a budget. members would be required to have additional ethics training, and would be prohibited from serving on corporate boards. one provision would also amend the rule against wearing hats on the house floor to have religious exceptions, so that incoming rep. ilhan omar, a muslim, may wear her headscarf.\n\nanother notable provision would change the process to vacate the chair, a process to force out the speaker. instead of only one member being able to trigger the process, the new rule would require motion to vacate to only be offered on the house floor if a majority of either party conference agrees to do so.
the environmental protection agency has completed one of its last major rollbacks under the trump administration, changing how it considers evidence of harm from pollutants in a way that opponents say could cripple future public-health regulation.\n\nepa administrator andrew wheeler is expected to formally announce completion of what he calls the strengthening transparency in regulatory science rule in an appearance before a conservative think tank on tuesday. the epa completed the final rule last week, but so far has declined to make the text public.\n\nthe new rule would require the release of raw data from public-health studies whose findings the epa uses in determining the danger of an air pollutant, toxic chemical or other threat. big public-health studies that examined results from countless people, who were kept anonymous, have been instrumental in setting limits on toxic substances, including in some of the nation's most important clean-air protections.\n\nsome industry and conservative groups have long pushed for what they called the transparency rule. opponents say the aim was to handicap future regulation.\n\npresident looks on as epa administrator andrew wheeler speaks during an event at the white house on january 9, 2020. drew angerer / getty images\n\nin an opinion piece in the wall street journal on monday night, wheeler said the change was in the interest of transparency.\n\nif the american people are to be regulated by interpretation of these scientific studies, they deserve to scrutinize the data as part of the scientific process and american self-government, wheeler wrote.\n\nbut critics say the new rule could force disclosure of the identities and details of individuals in public-health studies, jeopardizing medical confidentiality and future studies. academics, scientists, universities, public health and medical officials, environmental groups and others have spoken out at public hearings and written to oppose the change.\n\nthis really seems to be an attempt by wheeler to permanently let major polluters trample on public health, said benjamin levitan, a senior attorney with the environmental defense fund advocacy group. it ties the hands of future administrations in how they can protect the public health.\n\nthe change could limit not only future public health protections, but force the agency to revoke decades of clean air protections, chris zarba, former head of the epa's science advisory board, said in a statement.\n\nwheeler, in his wall street journal piece, said the new limits wouldn't compel the release of any personal data or categorically exclude any scientific work.\n\nthe epa has been one of the most active agencies in carrying out president trump's mandate to roll back regulations that conservative groups have identified as being unnecessary and burdensome to industry.\n\nmany of the changes face court challenges and can be reversed by executive action or by lengthier bureaucratic process. but undoing them would take time and effort by the incoming biden administration, which also has ambitious goals to fight climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions and lessen the impact of pollutants on lower-income and minority communities.
detroit -- the justice department is suing a detroit suburb, alleging that it violates the voting rights act by denying black residents an equal opportunity to elect city council members of their choice.\n\nthe lawsuit, which was filed tuesday in detroit, says no black candidate has ever served on the eastpointe city council and that white voters have consistently opposed and defeated black voters' preferred black candidates. it seeks a court order that would force eastpointe to change how its city council is elected. it currently consists of the mayor and four council members who serve staggered four-year terms.\n\nof the 32,000 people living in eastpointe in 2010, nearly 10,000 were black, according to the u.s. census. current estimates place the city's black population at closer to 40 percent.\n\neastpointe's black voters consistently vote for black city council and school board candidates, however none of them have ever been elected, the lawsuit contends.\n\na review of elections shows the black population of eastpointe is politically cohesive and that the white population votes sufficiently as a bloc to usually defeat the preferred candidate of black voters, the lawsuit argues.\n\nif eastpointe had four voting districts, the black community is sufficiently numerous and geographically compact to constitute a majority of the citizen voting-age population in one single-member district, the lawsuit contends.\n\nsection 2 of the voting rights act prohibits practices such as eastpointe's at-large city council system where they improperly dilute the ability of citizens to elect the candidates of their choice, barbara mcquade, u.s. attorney for the eastern district of michigan, said wednesday in a news release. we filed this lawsuit to ensure that all voters in eastpointe have a fair opportunity to participate in their local government.\n\neastpointe city manager steve duchane told the associated press on wednesday that city officials have known since november that the lawsuit was coming and that they hope to enter into a consent judgment with the justice department to settle it.\n\nduchane, who is named in the lawsuit along with the city council, said the city charter requires at-large elections, in which voters throughout the city vote for all council seats rather than voters electing members by districts. he said a charter change would have to go before voters in the fall.\n\nwe don't necessarily have a philosophical difference, he said.
meghan trainor and james corden want everyone to know their plan for the new year.\n\nthe singer appeared on the late late show and created a music video with the host, set to the tune of all about that bass, but this time, they talked about their new year's goals, which included working out. the adorable pair wore matching outfits with pink bows on their heads.\n\nyeah it's pretty clear, i ain't no size 2, sang corden. but i just joined a gym like i'm supposed to do.\n\ncause i got that boom boom, i'm walking up the staircase, and all the wrong junk in all the wrong places.\n\ntrainor sang about her vices afterward.\n\nafter work, i come home and i have a glass of wine, and when i say a glass, i really mean four or five, she said.\n\nthe two sang that they've resolved to drink more water and stop drunk-dialing their exes. the chorus of their song goes, i'm all about that change, 'bout that change this year.\n\nit turns out, though, that they may not be so sincere. trainor claims she's been doing great with her goals so far, and then sings, ah just playin' -- i went out last night, and the two confess, we're not about that change; we're quitting.
this little piggy went to work, work, work, work, work.\n\nin an adorable viral video circulating around the internet, a tiny piglet dances to rihanna's hit song, work.\n\nthe fuzzy little spotted pig shakes its booty in sync with the pop song, though to be honest, it seems as if the song was added after the video was taken.\n\neven so, that doesn't change the fact that this is the cutest video to get us ready for the weekend. we bet rihanna would approve.
intelligence matters - tony blinken\n\nhost: michael morell\n\nproducer: olivia gazis\n\nmichael morell:\n\ntony, great to have you on the show.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthanks, mike. great to be with you.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ntony, you have a particularly interesting story about how you came to be interested in foreign policy. can you share that with us?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nyes. you know, i think we're all sort of products of the conversations we hear around the dining room table, the kitchen table in our families. and in my family, a lot of the stories were about the fact that so many of the people that came before me were refugees or immigrants of one kind or another. i had a grandfather who came here at the turn of the last century fleeing pilgrims in what's now ukraine, was welcome to the united states, built a life for himself, for his children, a stepmother who fled communism, literally, in the dead of night on a train, made her way, at a very young age with her mother, to the united states.\n\nshe, too, was welcome here. and, then, finally, my stepfather who passed away a few years ago, he was one of 900 children in his school in bialystok, poland before world war ii, the only one of those 900 to survive. his entire immediate family was wiped. bialystok was the center of jewish living in poland.\n\nhe wound up in virtually all of the concentration camps one can remember from history, auschwitz, dachau, majdanek. at the very end of the war, he made a run for it. they were on a death march out of one of the camps in bavaria. and he made a run for it with some of his friends. and somehow, they made it into the woods.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nhow old was he at the time?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nat this point, he was 16. so he was in the camps from age 12 to 16. and somehow, they made it to the woods. and they hid out during the day and moved around at night. and after a few days of this, one day, they heard this rumbling sound. and as he looked out from their hiding place, what he saw was a tank.\n\nbut instead of having the dreaded iron cross or a swastika on it, he saw something else. he saw a five-pointed white star. and in a kind of crazy way, he ran to the tank. and the hatch opened up. and an african american gi looked down at him. and he got down on his knees. and he said the only three words that he knew in english that his mother had taught him before the war, god bless america. and at that point, the gi lifted him into the tank into freedom, in effect, into the united states. that was kind of the image that i had of my country growing up, what it represented to people around the world. and i think that's what motivated me as much as anything else to get into foreign policy.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso i don't want to jump too far ahead. but what we're seeing in our country now with the feelings about immigrants and refugees must cut to the core with you.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nit does. and, you know, on the one hand, look, i think we all get it. people feel a tremendous sense of confusion right now and chaos and a loss of identity. they don't recognize themselves. they don't recognize the country. and it's deeply, deeply, deeply confusing.\n\nat the same time, we know from our own history that we've gone through successive waves of migration each of which has made the country stronger but each of which, at different points in history, had a counterweight whether it was irish, whether it was italians, whether it was jews, whether it was asians, whether it's latinos.\n\nand we know that this is incredibly disruptive. and it takes some time to sort it all out. each time, it's made the country stronger. but during these periods of transition, it's tough. and we have to find a way forward that works for all of our communities as well as working for the people that want to come here.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso in those previous moments of backlash, how did we emerge from them?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nyou know, in these previous moments, there was a transition period. and it was challenging. and i don't want to minimize the disruptions that took place. but there was a recognition the economy might improve as we saw success, as we saw what immigrants were bringing to the country. there was a recognition that this made sense for america. now, when we look across the broad swath of the economy, look at every pursuit. who are the folks who are picking our crops?\n\nwho are the folks serving food at our tables, cleaning our homes and, then, as you move up the ladder, nursing the sick in underserved communities, doctoring them and, then, at the highest end, half of our fortune 500 companies foundered or co-foundered by immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants, half of the startups in silicon valley, the same thing.\n\nso we see the success time and time again. but now, in this particular moment, these disruptive forces are more intense and more acute than they've been. and you get a feeling things are just moving in fast motion. and it's very hard for people to be grounded and have a sense that they're going to come out okay on the other side.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso with this historical understanding, are you confident that we're going to come out the other end here?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nlook, this could be the exception that breaks the rule. it's hard to be fully confident. you know, i'm reminded of the late john mccain who said, it's always darkest before it goes completely black. but all of that said, i don't believe that.\n\ni think that most of us have a sense of optimism based on our history because we've been through incredibly tough periods before. the 1960s, to take a recent example, the late 1960s were far more disruptive than the period that we're going through now. the dawn of the progressive era, to me, this is maybe most closely approximate to that.\n\nwe had, before the progressive era, capitalism fully unleashed in this country producing tremendous wealth and, in many ways, tremendous progress but also in a way that was not evenly distributed, that was leaving too many people out, too many people behind.\n\nand thankfully, we had a progressive era in which the rough edges of capitalism were rounded off. more people were brought into the mix. we made major investments in education, in healthcare, in infrastructure, progressive taxation. now, in a sense, we need a progressive era but on a global scale. that's really the change of the moment to figure out how we can take these incredible forces that are at play, bringing tremendous advantages globalization, but in way that doesn't leave too many people out of the deal.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyeah. so i heard warren buffet say not long ago, you know how there's things that people say that stay with you for the rest of your life, this was one of those moments, he said, i believe that capitalism was the greatest force for good in the history of mankind, which i believe, too. and, then, he said, but i fear we're going to lose it unless we take care of the people that it leaves behind.\n\ntony blinken:\n\ni couldn't agree more. there is a crisis of legitimacy for capitalism that we're going through now. and, again, we've been through it before. this is what happened before the progressive era. it happened before the new deal. and in a sense, it's happening now but, again, on a global scale.\n\nand we figured out how to get through these periods before. now, could this be different? absolutely. at each big transformation there was a transitional period. and somehow, we wound up on the other side in a better place. that may still happen. but you still have to get to the other side. and that's the challenge we're in now.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nokay. then, the impact of all of this on our foreign policy and our role in the world, how do you think about that?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nwell, i think there's increasingly recognition that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it actually has to work for people here at home. and if it doesn't, then, it's going to be very difficult to sustain it. and so, for example, if we have a foreign trade policy, an economic policy that's not also working to materially improve the lives of the people here, it's not going to be sustained.\n\nif we have a foreign policy that people perceive is somehow getting us into problems that we shouldn't be involved in, that may be difficult to sustain as well. so being clear with our fellow citizens explaining what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the objectives are, how it's going to actually make their lives better is usually important. but, mike, i'd say another thing, we shouldn't be a prisoner to history. but we should at least be informed by it. and i think the period after world war ii was hugely instructive and remains very instructive because that was a period in time when, after the war, we could've retreated as we did after world war i.\n\nwe could've pulled back. or we could've used the tremendous power that we had to, basically, lord it over others. and we didn't do either of those things. famously, we spent time building the institutions, developing the norms, the rules that others live by but also ourselves. and that seemed counterintuitive.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nand spending a tremendous amount of money rebuilding our enemies.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nabsolutely. but here's what we got out of it, we did, we invested in their prosperity. we invested in their security. but we got new markets for our products. we got new partners to deal with global challenges. we got new allies to deter aggression. those investments, we got ten, 20, 100 times over in return. and that's why, as we think about today, we shouldn't be blind to what we did in the past because it does hold lessons.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso, tony, one of the things that i worry about is that we national security folk, foreign policy folk, have a hard time articulating for the average american why america's role in the world is so important to them. i mean, i've been places in the country where people say to me, mr. morell, why does it matter what vladimir putin does in ukraine? or why does it matter what the chinese do in the south china sea? how does that affect me? how do you answer that question?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nyou know, i spent about 25 years in government. and one of the things i took away is this, the world doesn't govern itself. and over the past 70-plus years, the united states has played a lead role in helping to govern the world, again, establishing the institutions but also defending them, helping to put in place the rules and the norms.\n\nand we know this, if we're not doing it, if we're not playing a lead role, then, one of two things: either someone else will and probably not in a way that advances our interests and values or even worse, perhaps, no one does. and, then, the forces of anarchy and chaos prevail. and in the past when that's happened, that's created big global conflagrations world war i, world war ii.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhich we get sucked into.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nwhich we get sucked into.\n\nmichael morell:\n\npay now or pay later.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nit's pay now or pay a lot more later. and the other thing i'd say is this, we have extraordinary resources in this country. and with those resources, with that wealth, with that success i think comes a certain amount of responsibility to at least do our part in advancing the common good. but it's also something called enlightened self-interest. yes, it's doing right by others. but, ultimately, that does well by us.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nokay. let's do an around the world kind of hotspots approach. and as we do these, tony, i would ask you to kind of assess the situation, assess the trump administration's approach to that issue. and if you disagree with it, say what would you recommend to the president instead. okay. so let's start with saudi arabia.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nsaudi arabia, i think the administration has missed a tremendous opportunity to use a horrific, terrible event, the murder of this journalist, khashoggi, to use that as a way to influence saudi behavior and saudi policies in a way that better reflect our interests and our values. there was a moment to go to saudi arabia and say a few things. one, your new leader or de facto leader, the crown prince, acts in impulsive and sometimes reckless ways.\n\nwe're not telling you who should lead your country. but we are telling you he needs to be reined in in some fashion. you choose how. second, this horrific war in yemen that is doing extraordinary damage to tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands, of innocent civilians, that needs to end.\n\nyou need to actually take the first step in helping to end it. we're here to defend you. we will defend you from any aggression by the houthis in yemen. but you need to take steps to end this war. and we won't be complicit in it anymore.\n\nthird, this crazy division with qatar, that needs to end. you need to resolve it. and you also need to demonstrate to the world that the things you're talking about in terms of liberalizing your country you mean. and that means letting people who've been simply trying to advance and advocate for their rights out of jail.\n\nthere was a moment to do all of that. that moment seems to have been squandered. saudi arabia seems to have a blank check. this is not about ending the alliance or the partnership with saudi arabia. it is making sure that the alliance actually reflects our interests and our values not just saudi arabia's.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nyour view on the likelihood that mohammad bin salman is going to change, because, i mean, there's been such a pattern here of reckless behavior. right? and it seems to flow from both an arrogance and a paranoia. and people who have paranoia, as they get older, it tends not to go away. so i'm really wondering here about how likely he is to change, ultimately.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nlook, i'm skeptical, which is why i think saudi arabia needs a governor on his impulsiveness and his recklessness of their choice -- whether it's a regent, whether it's a council, something. but look, he is whatever he is, 33, 34 now. i don't want to rule that out either.\n\nyou know, i met him when he was 29. he had just become defense minister. and this was just after the houthi aggression taking over sana'a and yemen and then, moving on the rest of the country. and then, the saudis and the emirates intervened with our backing. and i was dispatched to saudi arabia to say two things. one was to make it clear that we were committed to saudi arabia's defense if they were attacked in any way by the houthis, we would be there.\n\nbut two was to ask them, 'what are you trying to accomplish in yemen? what's the strategic objective?' and the answer i got from mohammad bin salman in the meeting with him was, immediately, 'to remove every last vestige or iranian influence in yemen,' to which i responded, 'good luck, not going to happen.'\n\nmy hope is that with experience, including the experience of what he has brought on himself through this horrific, horrific action and murder of a journalist, that if he's going to remain around, that he learns something from it. but the jury's out.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwe'll see. just across the persian gulf, iran.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nlook, i think the irony with iran is that we have a lot of problems and challenges posed by iran including its support for terrorism, including its meddling in various countries in the region, including, of course, its abysmal record at home on human rights. the irony is this: the one thing we got right, actually curbing its nuclear weapons program and putting a check on it, is the one thing we just tore up -- which makes no sense. and now, it actually makes it more difficult to deal with the other challenges posed by iran.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nwhy more difficult?\n\ntony blinken:\n\ntwo reasons, first, i think the reason the obama administration focused like a laser on trying to deal with the problem that was an urgent problem, which was iran having the capacity to move to a nuclear weapon very, very quickly, to have the capacity to have enough fissile material on very short order to build a weapon was urgent, because of the immediate threat that that would pose if they actually developed a weapon -- but also because it would allow them to act with even greater impunity in these other areas where they posed a threat to our interests and to what we were trying to achieve in the region. now, i think we have the worst of both worlds. iran, for the time being, continues to abide by its obligations under the deal. it's trying to see if it can get the economic benefits it bargained for from europe and from other countries. and we'll see if that's sustainable.\n\nwhat i worry about it this, given the administration's efforts to squeeze iran economically and to use the leverage that we have with our economy to force other countries to abandon any kind of economic relationship with iran, at some point, those in iran who are against the nuclear deal from the beginning will reassert themselves and say, we're no longer abiding by our obligations. and, then, mike, we'll be right back where we were before we got into the deal which is iran on the threshold of having enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon. and we'll be faced with the binary choice that we tried to avoid.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright. right. and we're sending a signal, a very strong signal, whether it's the policy or not, i don't know. but we're sending a signal that we're all about regime change. and if you're the iranians, why would you ever negotiate with people who want you to go away?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthat's right. that's right. the idea that iran is now going to do more and get less under duress doesn't make any sense.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nafghanistan -- we've been there for 17 years.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthis is one of the toughest problems and i think one of the most enduring frustrations that i've had. and i have to acknowledge here that i actually think president trump's instincts are probably right on this, which is, it's time. it's time to cut the cord.\n\nand this goes against a lot of, i think, instincts that a lot of us have because we know what the taliban regime meant to the people of afghanistan -- and not in a good way. we know that real progress has been made in improving the lives of people in afghanistan. at the same time, the position we're in is not sustainable.\n\nand where i'm particularly frustrated is this --and you'll remember this well -- virtually every year, we would hear from our colleagues, we just need one more year, just one more year. and it will be self-sustaining. the afghans will be able to fend for themselves.\n\nthe military will be able to control the security situation along with the police. and year after year, it was just one more year. i think our finger's been in the dyke in afghanistan for a long time. i, obviously, worry what will happen when we take it out. but i also think that, at this point, it's just not sustainable.\n\nand we also have to remember why we were there in first place. as much as one can appreciate some of the successes that the international community had in improving the lives of afghans, the bottom-line, hard reality is that we were there because of 9/11 and because of al qaeda. and that threat has been, if not eliminated, significantly reduced to the point where i think it can be contained without having 15,000 americans in afghanistan.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ni mean, one of the ways i think about it is to ask if we weren't there now, would we go? and the answer to that is no.\n\ntony blinken:\n\ni think you've got it right.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nabsolutely. russia, putin's aggression on a number of fronts, right, whether it's with his neighbors, whether it's what he's doing in syria, whether it's what he is doing in terms of weaponizing social media, a whole bunch of issues. how do we deal with that?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nputin is playing a losing hand brilliantly. russia, by virtually every metric, is actually in decline. and, yet, he succeeded in reasserting russia on the world stage, to some extent to distract from problems at home, to some extent to try to realize a vision that he has of a greater russia, but mostly i think for this reason -- the biggest threat to putin's continued leadership in russia is really the success of democracy.\n\nand that's true, by the way, for just about any autocrat. and he has a profound strategic interest in trying to demonstrate to his own people that democracies are failing, that our system is no better than his. it's not delivering better results. to the contrary, it's chaotic, not stable. and so, unfortunately, whether we like it or not and even if we pull back and didn't engage russian aggression, i believe he would continue to try to create trouble in europe, in the united states, within our societies and between them. so this is a huge challenge for us.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nhow do we engage him in a way that makes this much better?\n\ntony blinken:\n\na few things. first of all, let's take ukraine and let's take russian aggression with regard to some of its neighbors. first, i think it's a good thing that we expanded nato. there's a big argument over whether nato expansion actually has provoked russian behavior.\n\ni asked myself where would the baltic states be right now if they were not in nato? where would poland, hungary, the czech republic be in their own ways? i think that's proved to be a tremendous deterrent to russian aggression. but states like ukraine that are not in it, there's a reason that we got involved in leading the effort to put pressure on russia to stop its aggression, and, we hope, actually return sovereignty to ukraine. and it's not because on a basic level ukraine, itself, is that critical to the united states or to countries in europe. it's because the norms that were violated in terms of aggressing a democratic country on russia's borders, changing its borders by force, trying to dictate to people their choices about with whom they would ally or associate, if you allow that to stand, it is an open invitation to aggression and anarchy throughout the world.\n\nso we have to stand up against that. and i think sustaining that is important. and we've sustained it. and the trump administration, despite what the president says, the administration, itself, has sustained it. but at home, we have to do a much better job, of course, at defending our democratic institutions from the kind of meddling not only in the elections in 2016 but everything that's followed since.\n\nand i think we've got a couple of big challenges there. first, we're not properly defended. second, we don't have a clear and effective deterrence policy. we need to actually be very clear about what we'll actually do if we're attacked, and mean it and actually do it. and, then, we probably have to look at how we would use these tools ourselves, and also what the right responses would be. and they may well be asymmetric, responding tit for tat, for example, against some kind of cyber--\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthe problem, of course, is that politics has got in the middle of this issue, right, and has not allowed the discussion that you want to have on this to actually occur.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthis should've been a unifying issue. this should've brought people together because the attack is not on democrats or on republicans or anyone else. it's on our democracy. and that's the one thing that should unite us. and, unfortunately, that's what we're losing right now.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nnorth korea.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nso on north korea, look, i think that there was some merit in president trump throwing the deck of cards up in the air and seeing what came from it, because the fact of the matter is the policy that successive administrations have pursued over the last decades has not worked.\n\nnorth korea's gotten more dangerous, not less dangerous. its arsenal has gotten bigger, not smaller. and so, at some point, you say, maybe it's worth trying something new. and i don't object to direct diplomacy even with someone as heinous kim jong un. but, unfortunately, thus far at least, the art of the deal has really been the art of the steal and all in north korea's favor.\n\ni think the president in having the meeting with kim jong un gave kim jong un something that he deeply, deeply valued and that none of his predecessors were able to get. and that was the legitimacy that comes from meeting with the leader of the free world being on the same stage.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthat was the questioned they always asked, he and his father, when can i meet with the president? when can i meet with the president?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nso president trump would say, see, i did something that no previous president did. well, there was a good reason that previous presidents didn't do it. or if you're going to do it, at least make sure you're getting something. and, unfortunately, thus far at least, we haven't.\n\nnorth korea's program has continued. we continue to see reports in the press from our intelligence agencies and others showing that far from pulling back, they're moving forward. at the same time in elevating kim jong un, in declaring success and even saying, at one point, that the nuclear problem was resolved, the president gave a green light to other countries, starting with china, to go back to something approaching business as usual. what had been working and where the administration deserves credit was it not only continued, but it actually deepened the pressure program that the obama administration put in place to cut off every economic tie that north korea had, diplomatic ties, political ties. and that was starting to have an effect.\n\nchina, of course, is a key to that. now, the president has, basically, said to china, hey, if the problem's resolved, why should china have to continue doing this?\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthe chinese, the russians and the south koreans have all loosened up.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthat's exactly right. that's exactly right. you know, again, i give him some points for trying a different playbook, the way he's played it, i think, is making things worse, not better.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nhow would you fix that? i mean, if you could say to mike pompeo, here's what i think you need to do?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nlook, i think we were on the right track. and we need to figure out a way to get back to it, which was a sustained pressure campaign that's internationally coordinated but that has an objective not of regime change but conduct change. the hard reality is it's, if not impossible, highly unlikely that we will achieve in any near term the complete denuclearization of north korea. i just don't see that as realistic in the near term.\n\nwhat i think we can get is an arms control and, over time, disarmament process put in place. but that requires enough pressure, sustained and comprehensive to get north korea to the table. and that requires china. it requires south korea. it requires russia. it requires others. it's doable. but it takes time. it has to be sustained. and it has to be comprehensive. so there's a play there. but we haven't seen signs of the administration being willing to do it.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nokay. the toughest one of all, china. right. what should our strategic approach to china be?\n\ntony blinken:\n\nwe had an approach for decades that sought to bring china more and more into the international system starting with the international economy on theory that this would actually liberalize china at the same time. and thus far, at least, that theory has not borne out.\n\nnow, history is long -- especially chinese history. so maybe we're assessing the situation too soon. but clearly, the consensus that had developed over the right approach, the responsible stakeholder approach right now, at least, is in serious doubt. but i still think the basics of what we were trying to do, which was work to cooperate with china where we can, compete with it where we must but compete in a way that has a level playing field and basic fairness, is still the right approach.\n\nbut now, we're stuck in a different dynamic. and that is a veering wildly between confrontation on the one hand and abdication on the other hand. so on the one hand, a very confrontational approach over trade and related issues which is not wrong in the sense that the lack of reciprocity in the commercial relationship was totally un-sustained.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nthese are real issues.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthese are real issues. the president was right to confront the issue, i think profoundly wrong in the way he's doing it; throwing out the trans-pacific partnership, a huge strategic mistake. this was our best lever to change chinese behavior. 40% of world gdp with us in it represented, something that china would want to get into, not stay out of, that's gone. not making common cause with our allies who are similarly situated when it comes to china, who are aggrieved in the same way with technology transfer, the theft of intellectual property, the lack of transparency, unfair competition from state-owned enterprises.\n\nwe should've been on the same team with them. instead, of course, starting a tariff war against our closest partners has made that more difficult. but that needs to be dealt with. but i think that as we're doing that, we can't abdicate our leadership in the region.\n\nand, again, out of tpp is an abdication of our leadership. telling our allies, 'you know what, you're going to be on your own. we don't want to pay for this anymore,' that's an abdication of leadership. and if there's a vacuum, look, what have we seen? a profound irony.\n\nwe've seen xi jinping try to assert himself as a leader of the global community who is in favor of a free and open trading system, who supports globalization, who supports the united nations, peacekeeping, whose voting shares are increasing in the international financial institutions at the same time when we're pulling back from all of that. and that means that, again, in the absence of american leadership, in the absence of an american model, a chinese model could win by default not because it's better.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nso one of the two outcomes you talked about earlier.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nexactly.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nright. right. tony, you have been fantastic with your time. i just want to ask you one final question. you worked very closely with two people who may run for president in 2020, joe biden and john kerry. what i'd love to hear you talk about a little bit is how would a biden foreign policy or a kerry foreign policy be different from an obama foreign policy because i think most people think it would be exactly the same. and i'm just wondering what you think.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nlook, i can't speak for either secretary kerry or vice president biden when it comes to what policies they would pursue if they, you know, were to continue in public life in some fashion. i think, in fact, in either case, the basic principles were the same.\n\nbut we're also in a different moment. and it's the moment we talked about at the very outset, a moment in which there are people in our own country, people in allied countries, people around the world who are feeling a sense of chaos, confusion and vulnerability because of the rapidity and profundity of change, technological change, the flow of information, at the same time, a paradox when, by so many metrics, we're better off than we've ever been in history and, yet, too many people left out and left behind in that situation.\n\nthe best way to look at it is, on the one hand, over the last 30 to 40 years extraordinary success in alleviating poverty around the world. and, yet, inequality is growing at the same time. and those two things put together create a lot of disaffected people either economically or culturally and, then, finally, huge power shifts not only among countries but beyond them, between them, the rise of china that we talked about but also super empowered groups and individuals, corporate chieftains, the mayors of megacities, all of these new actors making it more difficult for nation states to get the results that they would get in the past. that's an increasingly new reality. and technology's driving a lot of it.\n\nmichael morell:\n\nbut the next president's going to have adjust to.\n\ntony blinken:\n\nthe next president, whoever it is, has to deal with that. and i think that, again, this comes down to a president who understands that whatever foreign policy we pursue, it has to actually work for people here at home. it has to show them that it's making their own lives safer, more prosperous. and, ultimately, that's the test.\n\nmichael morell:\n\ntony, thank you for being with us.\n\ntony blinken:\n\ngreat to be with you, mike, as always.
california governor gavin newsom said the state would be stepping up its coronavirus vaccination efforts this week, opening mass vaccination sites at dodger stadium in los angeles, petco park in san diego and cal expo in sacramento. the move announced in a monday briefing comes as the state reported a record number of deaths from covid-19 over the weekend.\n\nthe state saw 1,163 deaths in a two-day period this weekend, and revealed in the briefing there were an additional 264 deaths on monday and 22,633 people were hospitalized. the state saw nearly 40,000 new cases monday.\n\nthe numbers are just a sober reminder of the deadliness of the disease, how deadly this pandemic remains, newsom said.\n\nthe state, which has struggled to cope with the increase in cases, is still pressed to care for covid-19 patients who need intensive care.\n\nboth the hospitals and the icus experiencing a rate of increase that is more modest than what we have seen over the course of the last many, many weeks, for that matter, many, many months, he said.\n\nseveral regions have zero intensive care capacity, though northern california has 35% capacity.\n\nsouthern california, san joaquin valley continue to be the hot spots for the state, he said, along with san bernardino, the bay area and the riverside and los angeles area.\n\nnewsom said the state's goal was to vaccinate 1 million more people by the weekend. the state wants to expand the types of health care professionals who can give vaccinations to include dentists, pharmacy technicians and national guard teams.\n\nnew: ca will be opening mass vaccination sites this week including dodgers stadium, padres stadium, and calexpo. our goal continues to be fast, equitable, and safe vaccinations statewide. — gavin newsom (@gavinnewsom) january 11, 2021\n\nthe uptick has slammed hospitals, which are struggling to care for covid-19 patients amid concerns among health care workers about rationing care. the new, reportedly more infectious variant of the virus first documented in the u.k. has been confirmed in the state.\n\ncbs los angeles reported 1,000 people in los angeles county died from the virus in a four-day period, and military personnel have arrived in the area to assist in the wake of a surge that has resulted in a record number of cases. the county surpassed 900,000 cases and 12,000 deaths, officials said saturday. in orange county, there were 3,121 new cases of covid-19 and 50 additional deaths, health officials reported sunday, bringing the county's totals to 188,602 cases and 2,092 fatalities.\n\nas of monday, the state has more than 2.7 million reported cases of coronavirus and nearly 30,000 people have died since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nnewsom also shared some news from the san diego zoo, which said two gorillas had been affected.\n\nwe have two gorillas at the san diego zoo that have tested positive for covid-19, two that have been tested positive and we have another that is symptomatic, he said, though officials were working to confirm the strain and if the cases were a result of human-to-animal transmission.\n\nit's an area that's long been of concern, human-to-animal transmission, he said, but our beloved gorillas we are concerned about.
olympia, wash. -- a man whose legal name has made headlines in recent years is accused of assaulting a college officer and a deputy, according to cbs affiliate kiro.\n\nbeezow doo-doo zopittybop-bop-bop was arrested on sunday. citing court documents, the olympian reported that the wisconsin man was seen tearing down fliers at the evergreen state college and a confrontation ensued with a campus officer.\n\nduring the struggle, he allegedly grabbed the officer's gun, but then bit the officer's ring finger several times. he also attempted to stab the officer with a pen, according to the newspaper.\n\nthe newspaper also reported that after punches were thrown, zopittybop-bop-bop allegedly fled on foot. a thurston county deputy saw the suspect and chased him into a wooded area, where he allegedly threw rocks and a brick at the deputy. afterwards, another deputy joined the pursuit and used a taser on the suspect.\n\nzopittybop-bop-bop was then tackled, handcuffed and arrested, according to the court documents.\n\nin court on monday, a prosecutor reportedly deferred to the suspect's original name, jeffrey drew wilschke, adding that he was unable to verify the name change.\n\nzopitty-bop-bop had reportedly legally changed his name in 2011.\n\nthe suspect's bail was set at $50,000 with an arraignment set for feb. 16, according to the olympian.\n\nthis is not the man's first brush with law enforcement. zopittybop-bop-bop was first arrested in 2012 on a concealed weapon charge and drug charges in wisconsin, with his name gaining national attention.\n\nhe was also arrested on drug charges a year later in iowa.
on a street corner in gotham, a black, modified ford galaxy has the power to freeze people in their tracks.\n\nit's one of four batmobiles created for the 1960s batman tv show, and it's the bait to pull you into an exhibit at the new-york historical society called superheroes in gotham, reports cbs news correspondent mark albert.\n\nthis would stop traffic anywhere, said nina nazionale, the exhibit's co-curator. it's great to see them line up and just ogle it. it's beautiful!\n\ngenerations of fans have fallen in love with not just the caped crusader and his ride but with the whole universe of superheroes. gotham may be a made-up world, but its hold on us is real.\n\ntwelve-year-old zachary fisco and his seventh grade class are some of the 4,000 students who will be whisked through the exhibit during its four-month run.\n\ni thought, 'wow! am i really going to see these comics?' fisco said.\n\nnazionale said she wanted school groups to tour the exhibit because while kids may know who all the superheroes are, they don't know the history.\n\nand i think it will give them ideas. i mean, i hope it will, in terms of creating some of their own comic books or art, nazionale said. we definitely want them to be inspired.\n\nthat inspiration comes from seeing the humble beginning of extraordinary characters and the men who created them, including batman's solo debut in may 1939, or original sketches of superman from the first action comics series.\n\nthe exhibit also showcases the 1938 royal typewriter made of steel that gave birth to the man of steel and the wool and cotton costume worn by actor george reeves in the 1950s television show adventures of superman.\n\nthe truth behind how the fiction began is as fantastical as the tales these men would tell.\n\nmany of the original creators were the first in their families to be born in the u.s., looking not to save the world but just to survive in it during the great depression and world war ii when the country desperately needed heroes.\n\nthey were very young, and they were looking for work. they were often discriminated upon because they were the sons of immigrants, nazionale said. most all of them the sons of jewish immigrants.\n\nso some creators cloaked themselves, changing their names to fit in and get published, like stanley lieber, who became stan lee, the co-creator of spider-man, iron man and the hulk.\n\njacob kurtzberg transformed into jack kirby, collaborating with lee after he co-created captain america, and robert khan disguised himself as bob kane, co-creator of batman.\n\njerry siegel, who conceived of superman with joe schuster, even reportedly used more than one pseudonym.\n\nfrom the first superman cartoon in 1941, superheroes would eventually take flight as the gravity-defying media juggernaut we know today.\n\ncomics have proven so commercially indestructible, disney bought marvel entertainment for $4 billion in 2009 and has kept an endless line of superhero films coming.\n\nrival dc comics has five television shows on right now, including supergirl on cbs about superman's cousin, which debuted as the season's most-watched new show.\n\nand the comic conventions known as comic con attract a rabid faithful, fueling a booming market.\n\none estimate from comichron.com puts physical sales of comic books and graphic novels in 2015 at a record of about $875 million.\n\nwe want younger people who will become artists at some point to realize that it's possible, nazionale said. and everyone has to start somewhere.\n\nlike one daydreaming 9-year-old who drew batman in his hebrew school book.\n\nseventy-five years later, that book is being showcased in the exhibit.\n\nthe only way i could compensate for being a one-foot, bespectacled, skinny jewish little kid who got beaten up all the time ... was to draw, become a superhero in my own way, said a grown-up mort gerberg.\n\nhalf a century after his doodle of the dark knight, gerberg used batman again for a memorable new yorker cartoon in 1997.\n\nyou never lose that initial fascination with cartoons, gerberg said.\n\nand those adults are passing that fascination onto their kids, who, perhaps for the first time, realize you don't need superpowers to change the world.\n\ni'm like, 'wow, is this really how they first started off?' said fisco. i do feel more inspired by them in that kind of way, that you could become bigger than you think you are.

smartwatches and other wearable devices that continuously measure users' heart rates, skin temperature and other physiological markers can help spot coronavirus infections days before an individual is diagnosed.\n\ndevices like the apple watch, garmin and fitbit watches can predict whether an individual is positive for covid-19 even before they are symptomatic or the virus is detectable by tests, according to studies from leading medical and academic institutions, including mount sinai health system in new york and stanford university in california. experts say wearable technology could play a vital role in stemming the pandemic and other communicable diseases.\n\nsubtle heartbeat changes\n\nresearchers at mount sinai found that the apple watch can detect subtle changes in an individual's heartbeat, which can signal that an individual has the coronavirus, up to seven days before they feel sick or infection is detected through testing.\n\nour goal was to use tools to identify infections at time of infection or before people knew they were sick, said rob hirten, assistant professor of medicine at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york city and author of the warrior watch study.\n\nspecifically, the study analyzed a metric called heart rate variability — the variation in time between each heartbeat — which is also a measure of how well a person's immune system is working.\n\nwe already knew that heart rate variability markers change as inflammation develops in the body, and covid is an incredibly inflammatory event, hirten told cbs moneywatch. it allows us to predict that people are infected before they know it.\n\nindividuals with covid-19 experienced lower heart rate variability, or, in other words, little variation in time between heart beats, in contrast to covid-negative individuals, the study found.\n\nhigh heart rate variability does not reflect an elevated heart rate: it indicates that an individual's nervous system is active, adaptable and more resilient to stress.\n\ninvestigators followed nearly 300 mount sinai health care workers who wore apple watches between april 29 and september 29.\n\napple did not participate in or fund the study, but is aware of its watches' capabilities. tim cook in september touted the watch's role in the mount sinai study.\n\nthe data collected by smartwatches could be instrumental in helping tame the virus, given that more than half of coronavirus cases are spread by asymptomatic carriers, according to a centers for disease control and prevention model published last week.\n\nright now, we rely on people saying they're sick and not feeling well, but wearing an apple watch doesn't require any active user input and can identify people who might be asymptomatic. it's a way to better control infectious diseases, hirten said.\n\nearly warning\n\n\n\na separate study from stanford, in which participants wore a variety of different activity trackers from garmin, fitbit, apple and other makers, found that 81% of coronavirus-positive participants experienced changes in their resting heart rates up to nine and a half days prior to the onset of symptoms. an extremely elevated heart rate was indicative of symptom onset, the study reported.\n\nresearchers used smartwatch data to identify nearly two-thirds of covid-19 cases four to seven days before people showed symptoms, according to the study, published in nature biomedical engineering in november. the study examined data from 32 people who tested positive for the virus from a pool of more than 5,000 participants.\n\nthe team also has created an alarm system that alerts wearers that their heart rate has been elevated for a sustained period of time.\n\nwe set the alarm with a certain sensitivity so it will go off every two months or so, said stanford university professor michael snyder, who led the study. regular fluctuations won't trigger the alarm — only significant, sustained changes will.\n\nit's a big deal because it's alerting people not to go out and meet people, he added. when snyder's alarm recently went off, for instance, he cancelled an in-person meeting in case he might be infectious.\n\nsuch technology could also help compensate for some of the shortcomings with coronavirus testing, snyder said. the problem is you can't do it on people all the time, whereas these devices measure you 24/7. the smartwatch gives you back the data right away, in real time, whereas if you're lucky you'll get your test back in a few days.\n\nwearable device makers also are looking at how the technology could be used to combat the virus. oura health, which makes a smart ring that tracks health data, helped fund a university of california san diego and university of california san francisco study that found the device can detect subtle symptoms, like the early onset of fever, that may indicate covid-19.\n\nwhoop, which makes a sleep-tracking device, partnered with australia's central queensland university to author a peer-reviewed paper indicating that its technology can help predict coronavirus infections based on deviations in users' respiratory rates during nighttime sleep. healthy individuals experienced little variability in their respiratory rates, while deviations suggested compromised respiratory tract health.\n\nall of these studies are jibing in that markers of physiological function collected from devices allow us to identify these conditions and diseases in a non-invasive way, hirten said. they all have limitations but they complement one another.
support for clean energy in the u.s. has risen to record highs in recent surveys, but adoption of those clean energy sources is lagging far behind.\n\nwhile a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, their energy production was mostly replaced by natural gas instead of renewable energy like wind or solar, according to a report by independent research provider rhodium group. the report estimates that in 2018 the u.s. posted the largest increase in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions since 2010, up 3.4 percent.\n\nbefore 2018, the u.s. had three straight years of emissions declines despite economic growth. but last year the economy grew faster, illustrating the difficulty of kicking our addiction to fossil fuels when our economic engine revs up. rhodium group explains, some of this was due to unusually cold weather at the start of the year. but it also highlights the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies.\n\nmany americans support making that transition. a march 2018 study, politics and global warming, by researchers at yale and george mason universities, finds majority support across party lines for developing cleaner energy.\n\nin that survey, 87 percent of registered voters (94 percent of democrats and 79 percent of republicans) favor funding more research into renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.\n\nthese views are echoed in a recent pew research center study which found large majorities of americans favor expanding at least two types of renewable sources to provide energy: solar panel (89%) and wind turbine (85%) facilities.\n\nat a time when political polarization divides americans on so many issues, these points of agreement may seem surprising. but agreement is not enough. for an energy transition to happen, policy and incentives are needed.\n\nfor people, corporations, and governments to take action they're going to have to have incentives, william nordhaus, winner of the nobel prize in economics for his work on putting a price on carbon, wrote in a recent yale alumni magazine article.\n\nincentives require specific government policy action. we can find clues to why this is tough to come by deeper in the pew study. while democrats are generally supportive of policies to combat climate change, most republicans are skeptical. nearly three-quarters of republicans or republican-leaning voters say these policies either make no difference or do more harm than good, and 57 percent think such policies harm the economy.\n\nbut there are signs of growing support for market-driven solutions among younger conservatives. according to the pew study, republican millennials are less inclined than their elders in the gop to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. for example, 75% of republicans in the baby boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling, compared with 44% of millennial republicans.\n\nformer congressman ryan costello (r-pennsylvania) just left the u.s. house of representatives and is now the new managing director of americans for carbon dividends, an advocacy affiliate of the climate leadership council. in a wall street journal op-ed this week he laid out the case for a republican plan to tackle climate change, citing, in part, the need to keep younger republicans on board.\n\nin his new work, costello is aiming to advance a plan by former gop secretaries of state james baker and george shultz, fine-tuning the details of a bill which would put a fee on carbon dioxide emissions and return the proceeds to individuals and families on a quarterly basis.\n\nthe plan claims, over two-thirds of american households would be financial winners under a carbon dividends program, including the most vulnerable. the aim is to increase the cost and disincentivize use of products that generate carbon pollution, encouraging industries and consumers to opt for greener alternatives instead.\n\neven though the group says its carbon fee plan would return money to americans' pockets, it may still be seen as a tax. in reply, costello says, i learned in congress that no major policy solution comes without simplified rebuttals, which often aren't accurate. if families are receiving a check every three months and carbon emitters are transitioning to the cleaner energy, everyone comes out ahead.\n\ned maibach is a professor at george mason university's center for climate change communication and co-author of the politics and global warming study. commenting in general on policy, not specifically on the climate leadership council plan, he says his public opinion research finds strong support for a range of climate solutions policies, even when we mention the costs explicitly. sometimes, policy support actually increases when we mention the estimated cost per household, for example, about 50 cents per day, probably because the projected costs strike people as a good deal.\n\nbesides work on the bill, costello plans to spend his time on education, advocacy and building

ambitious solutions. that's what this seeks to do.
you've probably tasted laotian flavors and not even realized it. anthony bourdain and chef james syhabout want to change that. syhabout is the force behind two michelin-starred restaurants, commis and sister eatery hawker fare, which focuses on the laotian cuisine of his childhood. bourdain is the host of the popular travel and food show parts unknown. he calls hawker fare one of the most important restaurants he's ever visited.\n\nafter fleeing laos once it fell to the communists in 1975, syhabout's family made their way to oakland and his journey from refugee to culinary rock star began. now, he's out with a new book published by bourdain's imprint, called hawker fare: stories & recipes from a refugee chef's isan thai & lao roots.\n\nthe pair joined cbs this morning to discuss how thai food as it's known in the u.s. has been borrowing from laotian flavors for years, what sets the little-known cuisine apart from others, and why it's the kind of food that bourdain says chefs increasingly crave.\n\ni think we've been eating a lot of lao cuisine but in thai restaurants. so much of the thai food we love is, in fact, ethnically laotian coming from isan region. so we're familiar with at least a general outline of a lot of those flavors and a lot of those dishes and chances are already deeply love them, bourdain said.\n\nin the preface of the book, bourdain writes that syhabout has done more than any other person in the world to get the word out about this unfairly, unnecessarily secret country and cuisine. for syhabout, it's the details that make the flavors unique.\n\nthe spice levels, the preservation of using fermented fish sauce that's unfiltered. it's not the clear fish sauce you typically see on the supermarket shelves and that's where the flavor bombs and that's what makes laos food really separate and different, syhabout said.\n\nthe first time the chef tried thai food was actually at his mom's own restaurant. he said there wasn't even a resemblance between what they ate at home and what she served.\n\nwhat we used to cook for ourselves and what we serve on the menu, i was like, 'mom, what's the deal here?' he recalled.\n\nsyhabout would go on to work in fine dining restaurants all over the world but eventually, wanted to go back to his roots.\n\ni need to pay homage to how i got started and it's kind of a shame that i didn't know how to cook this food i grew up on, he said.\n\nfor bourdain, who's eaten in almost every corner of the world, it's the spice and funk that he says has captured the attention of fine dining chefs.\n\nlook, this is deeply, richly satisfying food with deep, interesting flavors and, interestingly, increasingly the kind of flavors that fine dining chefs crave after work, he said.\n\nwhat's exciting about this book and so many of the really great cookbooks and chef stories is that story of cultural identity you know who's – the history of the world as one chef told me is in this plate. it's telling a story, often a very personal one, a very old story. so to me this is very much a book about what it means to be american, who's cooking in america now, what is american food, all these things that we value and care about. a story of a struggle to find and reconnect with ethnic and cultural identity. these are really relevant questions given current times.
berlin — after years of debate, the german cabinet has approved a new law that will force all large, publicly listed companies in germany to have at least one woman on their executive boards. if passed by the parliament as widely expected, the law will mean that from 2022, any publicly listed company with an executive board of at least three members must include a woman on that board.\n\nqualified women enrich working and economic life, said federal family minister franziska giffey as the approval was announced. federal justice minister christine lambrecht said, women had a positive charisma, a role model function and an effect on the promotion of young women. both ministers had long campaigned for mandatory quotas on corporate boards.\n\nfranziska giffey (center) germany's federal minister for family affairs, senior citizens, women and youth, talks to saskia esken, federal chairwoman of the spd party and norbert walter-borjans of the spd during the executive committee's retreat, on february 9, 2020. michael kappeler/picture alliance/getty\n\nthe time for voluntary measures is finally over, said vice chancellor and federal finance minister olaf scholz, heralding the end of the era that has seen half the population go unrepresented in the boardrooms of many major german companies.\n\nthere's already a requirement, in place since 2015, for the broader, supervisory boards of large german companies to be made up of about 30% women. supervisory boards include members appointed by shareholders and employee representatives.\n\nthe new law will ensure that management teams include a female voice, but it will only apply to around 70 germany companies that meet the criteria for size and being publicly traded.\n\nhiltrud werner is the lone woman on volkswagen's board of management, serving as the head of integrity and legal affairs. as a public advocate for equal pay and equal opportunity for women, she told cbs news that the pending legislation will be a good start.\n\ngroup board of management member at german automaker volkswagen, hiltrud werner, who is responsible for integrity and legal affairs. volkswagen/handout\n\nthe fact that the law only affects around 75 companies sounds minimal, but it sends a very strong signal, she said. what we have to keep in mind is that the new law also includes regulations for the public sector, including universities, hospitals etc. they will now have to figure out as well how to ensure equal opportunities for women.\n\nseven companies listed on germany's blue-chip dax stock exchange, which includes the country's 30 largest corporations, currently have no women on their executive boards. sports giant adidas and drugmaker bayer have very recently removed themselves from that list, announcing appointments of the first women — one in the case of each company — to serve on their boards.\n\nbut women are far less represented in the many smaller, but still major companies traded on germany's other exchanges. according to data compiled by the organization fidar, almost half of all listed german companies currently have no women their executive boards. their data suggest that 73 companies will have to comply with the new quota from 2022.\n\nvw's werner told cbs news that corporate selection criteria and application processes will have to change fundamentally.\n\nwe need a more anonymized recruiting and application process, to begin with, to prevent bias. as is very common in other countries, age and a photograph shouldn't be part of an application, she said. another factor is equal pay. it goes hand-in-hand with equal opportunities for women.\n\naccording to the swedish-german allbright foundation, the proportion of female executives on the boards of dax-listed companies actually fell to 12.8% last year — the lowest level since 2017.\n\nin the u.s., by contrast, the proportion of women on the top floor of the 30 stock market giants rose to 28.6%. in sweden it was 24.9%; in the u.k. women held 24.5% of management positions and in france it was 22.2%.\n\nwerner told cbs news that germany has catching up to do: compared to other european countries, germany was late with a law for equal opportunities, and lags behind in gender equality for corporations.\n\nbut progress is coming, even before the new law is made official by germany's parliament. spaniard belen garijo will soon take the helm of pharmaceutical and chemical group merck, becoming the only female ceo at a dax-listed company.\n\nstudies have long proven that diversity pays off for corporations. according to an analysis by mckinsey, companies with high gender diversity are 25% more likely to be profitable.
san francisco — a trial will begin monday in federal court in san francisco over the trump administration's decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 u.s. census.\n\njudge richard seeborg is scheduled to hear a week of testimony from experts and other witnesses. the judge will decide whether to allow the question.\n\nseeborg is presiding over lawsuits by california and numerous cities in the state that argue the citizenship question was politically motivated and would discourage immigrants and latinos from participating in the census.\n\nthe plaintiffs say that would result in an undercount that would jeopardize their federal funding and the state's representation in congress. data from the census are used to determine the distribution of congressional seats to states and billions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nthe lawsuits want seeborg to keep the citizenship question off the census.\n\nthe u.s. department of justice argues census officials take steps to guard against an undercount, including making in-person follow-up visits, so the final numbers will be accurate. households that skip the citizenship query but otherwise fill out a substantial portion of the questionnaire will still be counted, justice department attorneys said in court documents.\n\nseeborg is the second federal judge to hold a trial on the issue. a ruling in a trial in new york that ended in november is expected soon.\n\nthe commerce department announced the addition of a citizenship question in march, saying the justice department had requested it and it would improve enforcement of a 1965 law meant to protect minority voting rights. the move sparked an outcry from democrats, who said it would disproportionately impact states that favor their party.\n\nall households were last asked whether individuals were citizens of the u.s. or not in the 1950 census.\n\ndocuments unearthed as part of the litigation in new york appear to show that commerce secretary wilbur ross was pursuing the addition of the question well before the doj's request and spoke about it in spring 2017 with former senior white house adviser steve bannon and then-attorney general jeff sessions.\n\nthere was enough evidence to infer that secretary ross was motivated to add the citizenship question for the partisan purpose of facilitating the exclusion of non-citizens from the population count for congressional apportionment, california and other plaintiffs told seeborg in court documents.\n\nthey plan to use testimony from academics to support their claim that the citizenship question would result in a costly undercount. that would violate the constitutional requirement that the census include everyone in the u.s., even non-citizens, they argue.\n\nthis week we'll bring in witnesses who will demonstrate just how critical an accurate 2020 census count is for our state and people, california attorney general xavier becerra said in a statement.\n\nthe doj plans to rely on its expert, stuart gurrea, to argue the citizenship question would cause no change in congressional apportionment in any state and only a negligible dip in the distribution of federal funds to california.\n\nin a court filing, they said the plaintiffs had failed to show ulterior motives for the question. ross's request that his staff look into adding it to the census does not show he acted improperly nor does the fact that other officials might have supported it for different reasons, doj attorneys said.\n\nit is unremarkable for an agency head to enter office with predispositions toward certain policy choices, they said.
washington — vice president mike pence said he believes americans are safer today after president trump ordered a strike that killed iranian major general qassem soleimani. pence addressed fears of an increasing conflict with iran during an interview with cbs evening news anchor and managing editor norah o'donnell.\n\ni believe we are safer today than before president trump ordered our military to take out qassem soleimani, pence said.\n\nthe president on wednesday said iran appears to be standing down, after the country launched a missile strike on the al asad and erbil bases in iraq, which houses u.s. forces. no american or iraqi troops were killed in the attack, which came in response to a strike last week that killed soleimani, the head of iran's elite quds military force.\n\nsupreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei vowed to exact revenge and on wednesday, he called tuesday's strike a slap to the americans. he also said the real revenge would be forcing the u.s. to leave the region, a sentiment echoed by iran's president hassan rouhani.\n\nread o'donnell's full interview with pence below:\n\nnorah o'donnell: joining us now for his first interview since the attack, vice president mike pence. mr. vice president, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nvice president mike pence: thank you. good to be with you.\n\n\n\no'donnell: iran's supreme leader called the attack a slap in the face. but are you worried a punch in the gut may be around the corner?\n\n\n\npence: well, i think the american people can rest easier tonight thanks to the leadership that president donald trump provided and the extraordinary and courageous professionalism that our military demonstrated over the last several weeks. despite missile attacks yesterday, again because of the professionalism— of our military personnel and their preparedness— there were no american casualties, no iraqi casualties, and our information as of this afternoon continues to be that iran is standing down.\n\n\n\no'donnell: i heard that. and the president saying that iran is standing down. but— how concerned are you that iran is now gonna begin a covert war?\n\n\n\npence: well, we're dealing with a country that's been the leading state sponsor of terrorism for more than 20 years. and so we'll continue to be prepared. we'll continue to confront iran in the way that president trump has done since early in this administration.\n\n\n\no'donnell: so what is the strategy in iran? and is regime change the ultimate strategy?\n\n\n\npence: we don't seek regime change in iran, but we want to see the regime change its behavior.\n\npresident trump and vice president mike pence in the situation room with national security advisers on tuesday night. official white house photo by shealah craighead\n\n\n\no'donnell: you were there in the situation room last night with the president and other top national security officials. thankfully, no american lives were lost. did we get lucky? or did the iranians intentionally miss?\n\n\n\npence: well, let me say that the fact that no american lives were lost was a great relief i know to the president, to myself, to our entire national security team, as it is to every american.\n\n\n\no'donnell: were we warned in advance?\n\n\n\npence: we had received intelligence over the previous several days that there may be attacks coming. we heard the threats. the world heard the threats from iran. we moved forces. we provided a level of force protection at the president's direction. and in a very real sense, we had the early warning systems that allowed us to move americans and our allies out of harm's way.\n\n\n\no'donnell: everybody who's related to one of those soldiers stationed in the middle east is worried. are we safer now?\n\n\n\npence: i believe we are safer today than before president trump ordered our military to take out qassem soleimani. this was a man who had been leading a terrorist state-sponsored organization in the region sowing violence. but what president trump, our commander in chief, demonstrated was we have a president who's also willing to use american military might to protect american lives.\n\n\n\no'donnell: one might say that taking out soleimani is like taking a baseball bat to a hornet's nest. and those hornets are iranian proxies, proxy groups. are you convinced that they won't come after americans?\n\n\n\npence: well, the challenge we face now is that qassem soleimani was in fact the primary leader of those iranian-sponsored militias across northern iran and their influence in syria as well. but we're sending a very clear message as we did with those five airstrikes to militia bases—\n\n\n\no'donnell: he didn't act alone, as you know, and he act—\n\n\n\npence: but we'll not tolerate violence.\n\n\n\no'donnell: and he acted at the blessing and with the blessing, i should say, of the ayatollah, the supreme leader.\n\n\n\npence: there's no question. and frankly, we're receiving some encouraging intelligence that iran is sending messages to those very same militias not to move against american targets or civilians. and we hope that that message continues to echo.
while sears' immediate fate remains uncertain, as former owner eddie lampert tries to pull off a last-ditch bid to buy the bankrupt retailer, its epitaph is already being written.\n\nsears will now act as a case study in how not to run a retail operation, said neil saunders, managing director of globaldata retail. it also serves as an example that even the once most powerful and cutting-edge of brands can easily fail in a retail environment where change and evolution are the order of the day.\n\ncertainly it's not the legacy that company founders richard warren sears and alvah curtis roebuck might have predicted when they opened the store in 1893. so what laid sears -- a survivor of depressions, recessions and other economic calamities for more than a century -- low?\n\nincredibly poor strategic decisions, chronic underinvestment and continuous financial machinations designed to keep the company afloat, saunders said.\n\nmore time?\n\nthe 126-year-old retailer on tuesday was set to ask a bankruptcy court's permission to move forward with a planned liquidation, but chairman eddie lampert has been granted more time to advance his $4.4 billion takeover bid, according to media reports.\n\nlampert's hedge fund, esl investments, now has until 4 p.m. wednesday to pony up a $120 million deposit on his offer, cnbc reported. with its future hanging in the balance, sears shoppers are asking exactly went wrong. for its part, sears tweeted that it's not out of the race just yet. don't count us completely out.\n\nwe would say that as well, but we are marathon runners, and we are still running. we may be slowing down, but we are not out of the race just yet. don't count us completely out. happy shopping! -smt — sears (@sears) january 7, 2019\n\nfailing to adapt\n\nunderstanding how sears got to this point goes back to 2004, when kmart announced it would buy sears for $11 billion. sears was already troubled, but hedge fund king eddie lampert engineered the merger, arguing that the two retailers could somehow make each business stronger.\n\nby 2009, lampert said he believed an overhaul of sears' culture was necessary to keep up with amazon and other online rivals, he recently told the new york times in an interview. but his digital transformation was marred by store leaders and managers who failed to embrace the efforts, he said.\n\nat the same time, reports surfaced about lampert's management style, which was reportedly based on the ideas of novelist ayn rand. division heads competed for resources and money, leading to infighting, according to bloomberg news.\n\nin 2013, lampert took over as ceo, a role he told the new york times he only expected to remain in for a few months. he said he attempted to be the company's catalyst, not its operating person.\n\nbut sears clearly needed a strong operations chief at the helm. the retailer lost a massive $1.4 billion in 2013, while its same-store sales in the u.s. declined by $600 million. at the same time, the store decreased its inventory levels in order to cut back on expenses, but that meant fewer merchandise choices for its customers.\n\nthose decisions fed into a vicious cycle of declining revenue and mounting losses, with consumers getting fed up with empty shelves and poor service. by 2016, a survey of women shoppers found they preferred to shop at goodwill to sears.\n\nwith dwindling sales and mounting losses, debts ballooned, paving the way for a credit crunch and sears' bankruptcy in october.\n\nneglecting the brand\n\nafter filing for bankruptcy, sears said it would close more than 140 stores and focus on winning back customers. the store's chief brand officer acknowledged to cbs news that the chain faced significant hurdles in convincing customers to shop there over the holidays.\n\nwe have to leapfrog off many years when we weren't investing in the brand, to let people know that sears and kmart are relevant again, sears brand chief peter boutros said.\n\nbut the effort may have been too late. sears had a 2 percent share of visits during the holiday season, the lowest among major retailers studied by cuebiq, a location-data company. and four out of five sears shoppers never returned to a sears after their first visit, which means the company struggled to lure repeat shoppers, cuebiq said.\n\nthis is a tale of avarice, greed, incompetence and stupidity, mark cohen, former sears canada ceo, told cnbc on tuesday, who added he blamed lampert for the company's demise. creditors see right through the fact that there's no future for this company.
little rock, ark. -- delicious isn't always a word we use to describe hospital food, but one chef is changing perceptions of what cafeteria food can be. three days a week at the arkansas heart hospital, chef coby smith dishes out what's arguably the most authentic japanese ramen in town.\n\nsince we've been doing this, we've had thousands and thousands of people come to this hospital for one reason only and that's just to eat our food, smith said.\n\ncustomer jenna rhodes told cbs news correspondent adriana diaz she works across town at arkansas children's hospital.\n\nso you came from another hospital? diaz asked.\n\nanother hospital to this hospital to have lunch, yes, rhodes responded.\n\n\n\nfor a few years, smith has been turning around the hospital's kitchen after dr. bruce murphy, the hospital's ceo, said the food was too institutional.\n\nchef coby smith cbs news\n\nfood that has been prepared elsewhere, canned, and you open a bag and you serve to people after you warmed it up… not fresh food, not vibrant food, murphy said. it's hospital food and we wanted to change that.\n\nhe demanded that ingredients be fresh, the food delicious, and one more thing: he wanted to have authentic japanese ramen, smith said.\n\ni was being a little bit selfish because i love ramen noodles and i figured everybody else would love ramen noodles, murphy said.\n\nhe discovered his love for the dish while traveling in asia.\n\n\n\ni didn't even think twice about where the best place in the world was for him to learn how to cook ramen. it's tokyo. we've got to go to tokyo, murphy said.\n\nso for a week, smith visited the doctor's favorite ramen shops and met with their chefs.\n\n\n\nthese guys do the same job every day over and over again for 30, 40, 50 years, smith said. they take their craft so literally and they're so – it's an honor for them.\n\nonce back in arkansas, he spent eight months trying to turn his research into ramen, starting with the all-important broth.\n\n\n\nit's like a small child. you have to nurture it and watch it and make sure all the ingredients are the same, smith said.\n\ncan you even learn how to make authentic ramen in one week? diaz asked.\n\nno, you can't do it, but you do the best you can with what you have, smith said. we're in the south so you know we have a southern twist to a lot of our ramen dishes.\n\ntwists like crawfish and okra. on the day we visited, it was pork belly day.\n\na bowl of chef coby smith's ramen. cbs news\n\nlittle rock food critic kevin shalin was very skeptical of the concept of hospital-made ramen – until he tried it.\n\n\n\nif a restaurant was serving this kind of ramen, would you rate it as highly? diaz asked.\n\nyeah, he responded. just because it's being served in a hospital, i don't rate it any differently. it is good ramen.\n\nso good that on ramen days parking becomes a problem.\n\nit's been so successful that i can't get to my ramen shop because there are other people in line, murphy said.\n\na rare problem in the realm of hospital food.
beijing - the u.s. and china gave no indication of their next step after wrapping up talks aimed at resolving a tariff fight that threatens to chill global growth.\n\nthe two sides will maintain close contact, china's ministry of commerce said thursday. but they announced no agreements or date for meeting again during the 90-day truce declared on dec. 1 by presidents donald trump and xi jinping in their fight over beijing's technology ambitions.\n\nthat uncertainty dampened investor sentiment. stock markets in germany, france, japan and china fell back after rising wednesday, following trump's comment on twitter that the talks were going well!\n\nnegotiators focused on china's pledge to buy a substantial amount of american agricultural, energy, manufactured goods and other products and services, the u.s. trade representative said.\n\nhowever, a ustr statement emphasized u.s. insistence on structural changes in chinese technology policy, market access, protection of foreign patents and copyrights and cybertheft of trade secrets. it gave no sign of progress in those areas.\n\nit also said the negotiations dealt with the need for ongoing verification and effective enforcement. that reflects american frustration that the chinese have failed to live up to past commitments.\n\na ministry of commerce spokesman, gao feng, said the talks enhanced mutual understanding and laid the foundation for addressing each other's concerns.\n\npushing china to change\n\n\n\npresident trump hiked tariffs on $250 billion of chinese goods over complaints that beijing steals or pressures companies to hand over technology.\n\nwashington also wants changes in an array of areas including the ruling communist party's initiatives for government-led creation of global competitors in robotics, artificial intelligence and other industries.\n\namerican leaders worry those plans might erode u.s. industrial leadership. chinese leaders see them as a path to prosperity and global influence, and are reluctant to abandon them.\n\nthe two sides might be moving toward a narrow agreement, but u.s. trade hawks want to limit the scope of that agreement and keep the pressure up on beijing, eurasia group analysts michael hirson, jeffrey wright and paul triolo said in a report.\n\nthe risk of talks breaking down remains significant, they wrote.\n\nwhite house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders expressed optimism to fox business network. she said wednesday the timing was unclear, but the two sides are moving toward more balanced and reciprocal trade.\n\nquick political win\n\n\n\nbeijing has tried to mollify washington and other trading partners by promising to buy more of their goods and open its industries wider to foreign competitors. mr. trump has complained repeatedly about the u.s. trade deficit with china, which last year likely exceeded the 2017 gap of $336 billion.\n\na report from height analytics said the focus on near term ag and energy purchases also reflects trump's need for a quick political win, and bolsters our view that china can successfully buy goodwill with these one off concessions to potentially keep talks going past march 1.\n\neconomists say the 90-day window is too short to resolve all the conflicts between the biggest and second-biggest global economies.\n\nwe can confidently say that enough progress was made that the discussions will continue at a higher level, said craig allen, president of the u.s.-china business council. that is very positive.\n\nbut that doesn't necessarily mean a full agreement will be reached by the march deadline. bnp paribas asset management put the odds of the talks continuing beyond march with no further tariff escalation at 70 percent. it also warned that rising costs to us firms, a cooling economy and falling equity markets suggest that us leverage in negotiations may not be as high as the president had thought.\n\nrushing to fill orders\n\n\n\nchinese exports to the u.s. have held up despite tariff increases, partly due to exporters rushing to fill orders before more increases hit. forecasters expect american orders to slump this year.\n\nchina has imposed penalties on $110 billion of american goods, slowing customs clearance for u.s. companies and suspending issuing licenses in finance and other businesses.\n\nu.s. companies want action on chinese policies they complain improperly favor local companies. those include subsidies and other favors for high-tech and state-owned industry, rules on technology licensing and preferential treatment of domestic suppliers in government procurement.\n\nbeijing is unhappy with u.s. export curbs on dual use technology with possible military applications. chinese officials said their companies are treated unfairly in u.s. national security reviews of proposed corporate acquisitions, though almost all deals are approved unchanged.\n\nthis week's talks went ahead despite tension over the arrest

ed o'keefe contributed to this report.\n\nalbuquerque, n.m. - top republican party leaders on wednesday began sensitive discussions over the scope of support the gop can give now to president trump's re-election campaign, amid talk of potential primary challenges, fresh evidence of sagging approval ratings and multiple ongoing government investigations.\n\nmembers of a republican national committee (rnc) panel responsible for considering formal resolutions and changes to party rules on wednesday affirmed their support for the president by passing a resolution offered by oklahoma committeewoman carolyn mcclarty that stated the party's unequivocal support of the president — a step that a president's own party has never before taken.\n\nbut the ongoing special counsel investigation and intra-party squabbles could threaten mr. trump's standing as the presumptive nominee. maryland governor larry hogan, former senators bob corker and jeff flake, utah sen. mitt romney, and former ohio governor john kasich have all been mentioned as potential challengers to trump for the 2020 gop presidential nomination — although none of the men have taken formal steps to begin a campaign.\n\nall 168 members of the rnc will vote on the resolution during its general session here on friday.\n\nthe resolution follows a commitment the rnc is already making to share its data, polling, and infrastructure with the trump-pence reelection campaign. but members of the rnc resolutions committee decided not to consider another potential resolution that would express support for the re-nomination of trump and vice president pence.\n\njevon williams, an rnc member from the virgin islands, said in an email obtained by cbs news that he had submitted the resolution explicitly supporting re-nomination because words matter, and the party should have no doubts about working for mr. trump's reelection. but his resolution did not receive a motion in the committee and was never voted on.\n\nno resolution passed during the annual rnc winter meeting will change the rules of the 2020 gop primary and nomination process, because those rules were finalized in 2016. also, it's the state parties that mostly set the rules of how they hold their primaries. for example, the new hampshire gop had been considering changing its primary rules to prevent a challenger, but a proposed change ultimately wasn't formally submitted for consideration by the deadline.\n\non the sidelines of the rnc winter meeting in albuquerque, members are also performing an autopsy of the 2018 midterm elections with state executive political directors, digital firms, and lobbying groups that are already thinking about the 2020 battle for congress.\n\nrepublicans are already closely monitoring developments in upcoming senate races in georgia, kentucky and tennessee. sen. david perdue, of georgia, who is a close trump ally, could face a challenge from democrat stacey abrams, who narrowly lost a bid for governor while amassing a national political network. national republicans are trying to convince secretary of state mike pompeo, a former kansas congressman, to run for the seat of retiring sen. pat roberts, r-ky., partly in hopes of keeping former kansas secretary of state kris kobach — an outspoken proponent of strict immigration controls who upended the state's gubernatorial race last year — from seeking the seat. and in tennessee, republicans are still sorting out who might run to succeed retiring sen. lamar alexander.\n\neditor's note: an earlier version of this report said that kris kobach was kentucky secretary of state, rather than kansas secretary of state. the story has been updated.
kenyan investigators have identified one of the extremists involved in the attack on a hotel and shopping complex in nairobi as the son of a kenyan military officer. there were conflicting reports on friday about whether the extremist was among the five attackers who died in the assault, or one of 11 people who have been detained by police since the tuesday attack.\n\nkenyan authorities have said 21 people, including one police officer, were killed by the attackers. the al-shabab extremist group, which is linked to al qaeda and based in neighboring somalia, claimed responsibility.\n\nintelligence officials in the east african nation confirmed to cbs news on friday that the al-shabab cell had been scouting the upmarket dusitd2 hotel complex since at least december 2016. cbs news has obtained security camera video from that month which shows three of the attackers walking through what looks like a parking garage at the complex.\n\nan image of video from a security camera at the dusitd2 hotel and business complex in nairobi, kenya, taken on dec. 28, 2016, shows three of the al-shabab extremists who would return to attack the complex in january 2019, walking through a parking garage.\n\ncbs news also obtained on friday a leaked letter sent by kenya's intelligence community to the national police, warning officers in the capital to be alert as al-shabab was known to be plotting an attack in nairobi. the october letter warns that a cell of six al-shabab militants was believed to be planning to attack two sites, including the treasury, in the capital between oct. 28 and nov. 4.\n\nthe two buildings mentioned in the intelligence brief are about three miles from the dusit hotel complex.\n\nfive of the suspects arrested in connection with the attack appeared in court on friday, and a judge said police could continue to hold them for 30 days to allow investigators to complete their work. two of the five suspects were arrested on wednesday, soon after the 20-hour siege came to an end.\n\ndirector of criminal investigations george kinoti said on wednesday the suspects were arrested in nairobi. he said they were being treated as key suspects because they were in contact with the gunmen killed at the dusitd2 complex.\n\ninvestigators said they found bomb-making material at the house of one of the suspects.\n\nson of an army officer\n\nthe military officer, who is not believed to have been involved in the attack, was summoned for questioning about when he last saw his son and any other details, a senior police official said. the official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nthe official said the suspect earlier was thought to be dead because his car was found at the dusitd2 hotel that was attacked on tuesday. however, authorities now believe he may be among those detained, the official said.\n\nwe are seeking further to know if he was at the scene and escaped, or he did not go there at all, the official said.\n\nthe daily nation, a kenyan newspaper, said the alleged extremist's father is a sergeant with the kenya defence forces. his mother was detained in isiolo town and taken to nairobi for questioning, the newspaper said.\n\nkenya's government announced on friday that security guards manning public places would be licensed to carry fire arms on duty after a new training and vetting process.\n\njason spindler remembered by friends and family\n\none american, jason spindler, was killed in the terror attack. his parents were due to arrive friday in kenya to collect their son's body. cbs news correspondent debora patta reported that the couple was also planning to spend time in the country celebrating his life with the diverse community of friends spindler had built around him.\n\na former investment banker who survived 9/11 because he was late for work that day, spindler later gave up a high-powered wall street career for the chance to make a difference. he was, his parents say, one of the good ones.\n\njason, once you met him, you knew this guy was going to change the world. he had a way about him that everyone would like him, his father, joseph, told cbs news.\n\nhis passion for change led him to kenya where, with co-founder patricia chin-sweeney, he started a company that aims to reduce poverty through investing in developing economies.\n\nhe believed you could invest, you could build businesses and they would be a means of stabilizing economies and reducing the need for terrorism, chin-sweeney said.\n\nthe company's offices are housed in the complex that was stormed by al-shabab gunmen on tuesday afternoon. jason was having a late lunch there when a suicide bomber blew himself up just a few meters away.

[cries] and i could see them talking. and i could see the tears just start streaming down her face.\n\na horrific discovery\n\nnews reports: the brutal murder of the pelley family … shot to death in their home sunday morning … it thrust a small town into the national spotlight ...\n\njessi toronjo: i had just found out that my whole family was gone. … i had just lost everything. … i pretty much became an orphan in a day.\n\nstephanie fagan | jessi's childhood friend: lakeville, indiana, was never the same for me and it was never the same for anybody, to be honest with you, that lived there. it was hard on the whole community. because that family was loved dearly, and nobody could understand it.\n\nreverend robert pelley, his wife dawn, and dawn's daughters janel and jolene [all pictured in the front row] were murdered in the attack in their home on april 30, 1989. three of the pelley children jacque, jeff and jessica [back row from left] were not home that night. lifetouch church directories and portraits\n\njamie collins | jessi's cousin: jessi and i … we were three years apart in age … it wasn't too hard for me to try to put myself into her shoes and to know what it must be like to lose everyone.\n\njamie collins: the funeral was on may 3, 1989 … in the church where bob pelley preached every sunday next to the house where they were murdered.\n\njamie collins: it was … standing room only. … there was media everywhere. … news anchors running around with cameras, pointed at us as we walked in.\n\nalso at the funeral were jessi's stepsister, jacque, and stepbrother, jeff. both had not been home the weekend of the murders.\n\njamie collins: i remember seeing jacque visibly, emotionally upset and shaken. … jeff, he was just flat and distant. it's like he was there, but he wasn't there.\n\njessi toronjo: the only thing i remember about my family's funeral was the caskets. i don't remember who all was there. i couldn't tell you what i was doing. i just remember the four caskets.\n\njamie collins: we were toward the front of the church in a pew. … and all at once, the chords to the piano began to play the song amazing grace. … and i just remember being so devastated to realize … the reason that the caskets were closed is because of the horrific way that they had died.\n\nmark senter | former indiana state police detective: no one should have seen what we saw that morning.\n\nmark senter: we walked in through the garage door and upstairs robert pelley was in the hallway, his glasses next to him and he had two gunshots on his body. and then we went downstairs and saw dawn and janel and jolene. and that was what really put a face to this crime.\n\njohn botich | former st. joseph county detective: to see the young girls in that position the way they were with their mother trying to protect them was just something that was etched in my mind forever. … they were all shot in the head. … it was devastating. it stuck with me my whole life. i mean, 30 years later i can still see- if i close my eyes, the three people in the basement\n\nmark senter: as a detective i saw the worst of the worst that morning, but we had a job to do. so immediately started talking about suspects. … it did not look like a burglary. it did not look like a home invasion.\n\nthe police spoke to all of the surviving members of the pelley family, including jeff pelley:\n\ndet. botich [ interrogation]: so. do you know who killed your mother and father, or your father and stepmother? jeff pelley: no, i really don't. i don't know who would want to.\n\njessi toronjo: i didn't know who had done it or who they thought had done it. it was like a hush hush thing with me.\n\njessi toronjo: in my own mind, i had to come up with something. so, i thought my stepdad had killed my mom and my two sisters and then killed himself. … he was not very nice to me. … spanked me a lot so i thought, you know, at 9 that he could have been capable of that.\n\nbut police had dismissed that possibility almost immediately.\n\njohn botich: after seeing the extent of the injuries of bob pelley and no murder weapon or no weapon laying around him, i ruled the suicide part out in my mind.\n\na month after the funeral, relatives sent jessi away to camp with her friend stephanie, in an effort to restore some normalcy to her life.\n\nstephanie fagan: it ended up to not be normal. jessica was a very changed person after that and when i say the million-mile stare, like, she had it a lot. it was almost as if she was there, but she wasn't there.\n\nstephanie fagan: when i look at those pictures it's just so weird and strange to me because we both have smiles on our faces but … those little girls weren't right. those little girls were hurting.\n\nafter camp, jessi says her relatives thought it was best for her to start over.\n\nstephanie fagan: they didn't want her to communicate with the people that she had shared this tragedy with.\n\njessi toronjo: after the murders we really didn't have a close relationship — my stepbrother and my stepsister and i.\n\njessi toronjo: they went with family members on their dad's side and i went with a family member on my mom's side.\n\njessi toronjo: i ended up in michigan because i went and stayed with my grandfather.\n\njessi toronjo: they just wanted me to forget and move on. … it's like they wanted me to be in this bubble to protect me, but it wasn't really protecting me. it was isolating me and hurting me.\n\njessica pelley, left, and stephanie fagan during their time together at camp. stephanie fagan\n\nstephanie fagan: i had sent letters … and i was told not to send any more letters\n\nstephanie fagan i just would sit at night and think to myself i can't imagine what she's going through.\n\njessi toronjo: i ended up running away and then they placed me in a foster home.\n\njessi toronjo: i didn't really have a place to call my own … i felt like a drifter.\n\njessi toronjo: i didn't know where i was going to stay. … i felt like i didn't belong anywhere.\n\nas time passed and jessi tried to regain her footing, the investigation dragged on without any arrests.\n\njessi toronjo: at the age of 13, i did try and take control of my life. … and i actually pushed down all the feelings that i was feeling … i was happy and outgoing and had friends and didn't think about the past.\n\nbut five years after the murder of her family, someone from her past life came calling.\n\njessi toronjo: my stepbrother jeff … he did call me when i was 15 … and asked me to come down to florida to visit him. … when i went to visit him, he did have a really good job with a computer business. he had a wife, kim, and you know had his own house, so he was doing pretty good.\n\njessi toronjo: and the first thing that he asked me was, who do you think did it? … so, i looked at him and said, i think your dad did it. and then it was dropped.\n\nunbeknownst to jessi, police had been focusing on someone else from the very beginning.\n\njessi toronjo: looking back on that time visiting jeff … it could have gone way worse than it did.\n\nsearching for answers\n\nstephanie fagan: after the pelleys were gone and after they were buried… there was no more laughing. there was no more running. there was no more playing. there was just no more of anything.\n\nstephanie fagan [at cemetery]: … and they're right over here. … when i was 16 … i got my driver's license. the first place i went was to the cemetery. i would just sit and talk to them.\n\nstephanie fagan: it was a huge way to cope with the loss.\n\nstephanie fagan: and then i started kinda tending their graves. … and just making sure that … they were clean and scrubbed and that there wasn't any moss and stuff on them.\n\nstephanie fagan: my mind just wonders why? i mean they were so young.\n\nas soon as she got her driver's license, stephanie fagan would go to the cemetery to clean the pelley family gravestones. i would just sit and talk to them, she said. it was a huge way to cope with the loss. cbs news\n\nfor years, stephanie fagan grieved the loss of the murdered pelley family, but also the loss of jessi.\n\nstephanie fagan: she was gone, i couldn't figure out why they wouldn't just let me, you know, keep in contact with her.\n\nstephanie fagan: when i was a teenager, i did start doing research about the murders and that's when it became kind of an obsession for me to find her.\n\nstephanie fagan [at cemetery]: every time i came out, i was always thinking, i'll run into her someday — if i just come out here enough, she'll be here.\n\njessi toronjo: i did not realize anybody was out there looking for me. i pretty much thought everybody forgot about me and had moved on with their lives because it wasn't their family that they lost.\n\nin 1998, when she was 18, jessi tried to move on as well.\n\njessi toronjo: the first chance that i got to purchase my own home, i did. … i used some of the inheritance to purchase it. i had not had a home since i was 9. … it was an amazing feeling. … i felt like i belonged there, that i had a place.\n\njessi finally had a home, and a family would soon follow\n\njessi toronjo: when i first met tyson, it was love at first sight for him. me, it was not. i was with someone else. so, when we reconnected a couple of years later … we just started hanging out. and ever since then we've been together\n\njessi toronjo: i have two children.\n\njessi toronjo: when my children were younger, they did know that i had a family and that they were gone. i did not go into detail. i did not really give them any explanation on what had happened, they just knew they were gone.\n\njessi toronjo with husband tyson and their children jessi toronjo\n\nbut in 2002, 13 years after the murders, keeping her past buried would become more difficult.\n\njessi toronjo: there was a knock on my door … and there were two detectives standing there.\n\nthey told her the case was being reopened.\n\njessi toronjo: they said, well, we're here to talk about, you know, your family's murder case. and we just want to know who you think did it.\n\njessi toronjo: when i told them it was my stepfather, they looked at each other and then, you know, looked at me, and said, well, there's no way it could have been him. and then that's when they asked me, well, who do you think could have done it? and in that moment, jeff came to my mind.\n\njessi toronjo: my older stepbrother, jeff, liked to do things that, just scared me … he was so quick to getting angry. and he would use his fists. he would fight.\n\njessi toronjo: and they said, yep, that's exactly who we think did it. … i got a pit in my stomach. … and then they started telling me … a little bit about the case.\n\napril 30, 1989\n\nmark senter | former indiana state police detective: i know there was … a lot of angst in that family between him and his dad — between bob and jeff. i know a situation where bob punched him one time. i think the neighbors saw a lot of that same thing as well.\n\njust weeks before the murders, senter had handled a case in which jeff pelley had burglarized a home.\n\nmark senter: bob pelley grounded jeff for the burglary case … he could not go to the prom without his dad taking him. he couldn't go to dinner before the prom. he couldn't go to the after prom.\n\nmark senter: the embarrassment of his dad driving him … not having to do any of the other activities, was crushing to jeff pelley\n\njohn botich | former st. joseph county detective: i interviewed jeff with his grandparents may the first, 1989.\n\ndet. botich [interrogation]: did you have anything to do with it? jeff pelley: no, i didn't. me and my father didn't get along sometimes and sometimes i'd be really upset with him, but we always worked things out\n\nbut investigators didn't believe him.\n\njohn botich: when you're talking about the death of your family, you think, you know, every once in a while, he'd tear up or he'd cry. he never did any of that.\n\nthe main evidence against jeff was the timeline. the pelley's were last seen alive shortly before police believe jeff left for prom.\n\nmark senter: who else could have done it, who else would have done it? who else had the motive? … i believe he killed his family and then was able to go to the prom.\n\nyet back in 1989, the case against jeff was thin.\n\njohn botich: we didn't have any forensic evidence. we didn't find a murder weapon. … no eyewitnesses. we had circumstantial evidence and the timeline. very tough case to prove very tough case to prosecute.\n\nmark senter: the prosecutor's office chose not to file charges on jeff pelley.\n\njohn botich: at the time, the prosecutor did not think we had enough. in my mind, i thought we had enough.\n\nbut 13 years after the slaughter of the pelley family, a new prosecutor thought there was enough evidence. jeff pelley was arrested and charged with four counts of murder.\n\nin 2002, a new prosecutor took a look at the case and decided to charge pelley with four counts of homicide, even though there was no new evidence. he was arrested at los angeles international airport on his way home from a business trip. south bend tribune\n\njessi toronjo: when i heard jeff was arrested … i was just waiting until the trial to see, you know, what was gonna happen. … i was scared that he was gonna get out, come after me. … when he's angry, he's not a nice person.\n\nthe case against jeff pelley\n\nseventeen years after the murder of her family, jessi returned to the place she once called home.\n\njessi toronjo: when i came back to indiana for the trial, it was like coming back a stranger. … i felt like it had never been my home. i couldn't remember a lot about it. i couldn't remember a lot about the past.\n\njessi toronjo i: and when i went to trial, people were asking who i was. and that's when it hit me that wow, i really was lost.\n\njessi toronjo: i was scared to see him. i was scared to have all these memories come back up.\n\nstephanie fagan: i did hope to have a reunion with jessica at the trial.\n\nstephanie fagan: my anxiety was very high because i thought, ok. here's my chance. … i'm going to be able to see her because we're all gonna be in the same courtroom. … and that never happened.\n\nthat's because fagan was a witness and only in court the one day she testified.\n\nstephanie fagan: i was not allowed to see her. i was not allowed to contact her.\n\njuly 11, 2006\n\nnews report: tuesday lawyers laid out their cases to the jury in opening statements.\n\nfrank schaffer | former chief deputy prosecutor: this was a totally circumstantial evidence case.\n\nfrank schaffer: it was … a very, very small window when the family could have been murdered, and it was very clear the only person who could have done this was jeff.\n\nthe prosecution's theory was that jeff killed his father in an argument over prom and then had to get rid of the surviving witnesses. the prosecutor took the jury through the timeline.\n\nfrank schaffer: on saturday april 29th, the pelley house was definitely buzzing. … many of the individuals going to the prom wanted to come by and show bob their prom dress, their prom tux.\n\nfrank schaffer: his home was always open. … he wanted to be someone the community could depend on, someone who could be trusted by his parishioners\n\nfrank schaffer: so up until roughly 5 o'clock there was a lot of traffic in and out of the home.\n\nbut the prosecution says by 5:30 p.m., no other visitors could get into the house.\n\nfrank schaffer: the house was locked up as tight as a drum. … it became very clear that the murders had to happen between say 5 and 5:20.\n\nfrank schaffer: the biggest thing was jeff said he wasn't there.\n\njeff told investigators he left before 5 p.m., but witnesses testified they saw jeff's car parked outside the pelley home after that.\n\nfrank schaffer: the witnesses saw when the car was at the house and when the car left the home. he was clearly at the house.\n\njeff's prom date also testified. she said when jeff showed up at a nearby friend's house at 5:30 p.m., he wasn't wearing his tux.\n\njeff pelley attended the laville high school prom the night of saturday, april 29, 1989. eric king\n\nfrank schaffer: the idea that he had to take the prom outfit down to his girlfriend's and there was no pictures taken with his parents … said a lot about what he had done in the house. he had to get out of there.\n\njeff's prom date also recalled something jeff told her at an amusement park the day after prom – shortly before news broke of the murders.\n\nfrank schaffer: jeff had seemed troubled … when she asked him what was the matter? jeff had told her he thought something bad had happened at home. … it seemed to come out of nowhere for this whole situation, unless he knew something had happened back in lakeville, indiana.\n\neven though jessi had not been home the weekend of the murders, she was also called to testify.\n\njessi toronjo: the day comes to where i have to testify. and i was very nervous because i knew i was gonna see jeff. … and at this point i did want to say something to him. … that he took my whole family from me. he destroyed my life in one split second [cries].\n\njessi toronjo: as i sat on the stand and looked at him he didn't even look at me. … i did not get what i wanted. it's like he just pretended like i wasn't there.\n\nfrank schaffer: i was always concerned that she would break down on the stand just because of the emotion involved in this. she did not. she stayed very, very solid the whole way.\n\njessi testified she saw something important before leaving for that sleepover.\n\njessi toronjo: i let them know that when i said goodbye to my mom that the gun rack was on the wall and there was a bow and a shotgun on it.\n\na shotgun was missing from this gun rack which police believed was the murder weapon. indiana court of appeals\n\nfrank schaffer: the bow was in the rack when officers came that sunday morning because we had photographs of it, but the firearm was not there.\n\npolice never found that gun, believed to be the murder weapon. but they were convinced they didn't need it. they testified jeff made a seemingly damning statement in an untaped interview.\n\nfrank schaffer: if i tell you what happened would i get the death penalty. … who would say something about that … unless they'd done something wrong?\n\nalan baum | jeff's defense attorney: there was no motive. there was no opportunity. there was no murder weapon. there was no case.\n\nalan baum: from the very beginning, the police basically assumed that jeff had committed this crime without any evidence. … what they didn't investigate in the case was any possibility that someone else for other reasons had committed these murders.\n\nnews report: after calling more than 50 witnesses, prosecutors say all the facts point to jeff pelley.\n\nalan baum: it's preposterous to think that in the short amount of time that jeff's presence was unaccounted for somewhere around 20 to 30 minutes he could have killed his family, disposed of the murder weapon, driven over to his date's house … there's no possible way that he could have done all of those things in the amount of time he had.\n\nas the trial drew to a close, jeff's fate – and jessi's sense of security – were hanging in the balance.\n\nalan baum: there's no doubt in my mind … that jeff is innocent. he did not commit these murders.\n\nalan baum: he's not a killer.\n\njessi toronjo: do i think the evidence points to jeff? yes, i do.\n\na verdict and a reunion\n\nnews report: the prosecutor started his closing argument letting the jury know it was his burden to prove the case.\n\nthe prosecution had no murder weapon, no confession and no forensic evidence. the case the jury had to consider rested mainly on the timeline and jeff pelley's motive: his anger over prom.\n\njessi toronjo: waiting for a verdict was very nerve-wracking.\n\nnews report: but now the burden of deciding jeff pelley's fate is theirs.\n\njessi toronjo: i didn't know what was gonna come out of this. i hoped he was going to be put in prison,

was guilty. my family's killer was put away. … jeff does have a wife and a child. … so, i did feel for his son because he was losing a dad, and i know how that feels.\n\nalan baum: but i remember to this day. … the image of jeff being handcuffed is burned in my in my mind … jurors were quoted as saying, well, if he didn't do it, who did? … that is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nfrank schaffer: jeff was sentenced to 160 years in prison for the four murders in this matter.\n\nthe case, however, was far from over.\n\napril 2008\n\nalan baum: so, after the conviction, we, of course, filed an appeal and we were successful. the convictions were set aside on a number of procedural grounds\n\njessi toronjo: i actually had someone call me and tell me that. and i remember being at save-a-lot actually, and i was sitting in my car. and i just started crying because i was afraid it was all going to start again. and i didn't want have to look over my shoulder.\n\nbut jeff remained

… she told me that … they had been killed when she was 9. … it made me sad, 'cause i was like, well that's your family. that's my family. … i had never actually witnessed her cry like that.\n\nthat same year\n\nstephanie fagan: so, i would google pelley, pelley murders, jessica pelley … you know, any two words that i could put together to figure out where she was … well, i had found one clipping of one article that said jessi toronjo. … so, i went on a search bar typed in her name. … boom. this eye came up just this part of her eye. … i knew it was her. i knew. … part of me was scared because i thought … maybe she didn't want me in her life. but i said to myself, you know what? i've come this far. there's no stopping now.\n\nstephanie fagan [reading letter on her computer]: i don't know if you remember me or not, my name is stephanie we were close when we were younger.\n\nstephanie fagan: … i'm just gonna write her a letter. i'm gonna tell her how i feel. i'm gonna i tell her who i am.

do.\n\njessi toronjo: so, one day i log into facebook … and there's a message from a stephanie fagan. well, i don't recognize the name. … but i click on it, and i read it.\n\njessi toronjo [reading stephanie's letter on her computer]: i have huge tears in my eyes right now just knowing that you are actually going to get my letter this time. \n\nstephanie fagan: i just … told her i'd been looking for you my whole life. and i told her … i took care of your parent's graves. and i've thought about you. and i've talked to you in my sleep. i've talked to you when i wake up.\n\nstephanie fagan [reading letter on her computer]: i've gone through my life and never lost sight of finding you.\n\njessi toronjo [reading stephanie's letter on her computer]: i never in a million years though i would ever see you again.\n\njessi toronjo: and i'm bawling as i'm reading it and just crying hysterically. and the feeling i got was someone reached out to me and has been looking for me this whole time and wants to get to know me again and wants to be around me and remembers everything.\n\nstephanie fagan: and at first she didn't remember me. but then i then i started kind of telling her stories about camp. and it clicked immediately.\n\njessi toronjo [reading stephanie's letter on her computer]: i've missed you for many years, much love stephanie. \n\nstephanie fagan: and the rest is kind of history.\n\nstephanie fagan never stopped searching for her childhood friend. cbs news\n\njessi toronjo: stephanie and i call each other sisters. … from the moment that we reconnected we bonded in such a way that i've never had a bond like that.\n\njessi's cousin, jamie collins, also came back into her life.\n\njamie collins: reuniting with jessie, she was this fierce, vibrant kind of bold, free-spirited person with this hot pink hair.\n\njamie collins: she had told me a lot of her deepest darkest secrets and about her past and her thoughts and her fears and her dreams. and we talked about so many things that in a lot of ways i felt like i knew her better than maybe i've ever known anyone.\n\njessi toronjo: so, jamie … said to me, you know you should write a book about your life. and i told her, i said, well everybody tells me that, but i definitely could never do that and i probably couldn't talk to a stranger about everything. and she said, well, what about me? could you tell me? and i told her, yeah, i could probably do that.\n\nthough she came across as outgoing and positive, the trauma of jessi's childhood was never far below the surface.\n\njamie collins: we were actually … writing the book at the time that jessica kind of had a downward spiral. and it was a very scary time for both of us. … she lost a close family friend to cystic fibrosis. … and for her, it had triggered these elements from her past … once the triggers hit her, that was that was it.\n\njessi toronjo: i hadn't lost anybody since my family. and i never realized that it would hit me like that. so … i have a whole week where i don't remember a whole lot. … i trashed my living room. i was angry. … it was like i wasn't even there.\n\njessi toronjo: i could feel myself being sucked into the darkness and i just couldn't bring myself out.\n\nstephanie fagan: that week i knew something was going on. … i got a call. … and she was crying. … all i could hear was you know i need you. i need you … i was like, ok, you calm down. there was no calming her down. ... i was like, maybe you just need to take an anxiety pill. maybe you just need to calm down … she's like,  i took all of them. i said, oh this is not good. …. and the phone went silent. and i couldn't hear her anymore. and i thought that's it. this whole time i waited for her and i looked for her and now this is it. this is it. she's gone.\n\na survivor's path\n\ndakota toronjo | jessi's daughter: that week when she was spiraling, the last thing i remember was an ambulance at our house … and i was watching them take my mom out on a stretcher.\n\njessi toronjo: i ended up waking up in a hospital and i didn't know how i got there, i didn't know what had happened. but the doctor asked me if i tried to kill myself. and i was floored. … i guess i had taken a bottle of pills and tried to kill myself. i later found in a notebook a goodbye note.\n\nstephanie fagan: at that point in time that was rock bottom for her. … she called me. i was one of the only people that knew. she said i'm done. i've got to get help.\n\njessi toronjo: i was scared for my life- that i wasn't gonna make it. and i did not come this far not to make it. so, i ended up admitting myself in the hospital and started getting some help.\n\njessi toronjo: i've learned that i do have did, which is dissociative identity disorder, and i am part jessica and part jessi. so, when i pushed jessica down inside me, way down, and didn't want to feel sad, lonely, i think i lost a lot of the memories that i had in doing that. and now that i'm trying to get them back, you know, it's difficult too because i'm just now letting jessica come back.\n\nwhen i think of jessica, i don't think of just a lonely, scared little girl anymore. i realize she is me, and together we can overcome anything, jessi toronjo explained. jessi toronjo/jamie collins\n\njessi toronjo: a survivor's path is very messy. there is no clean line. there is no straight path. you have your ups and downs…. but when you get help, it's a little bit easier\n\njessi toronjo: i do not consider myself fully healed, but i am definitely on the way to recovery.\n\njessi toronjo: when i think of jessica, i don't think of just a lonely, scared little girl anymore. i realize she is me, and together we can overcome anything.\n\nanything. including a

later there's still a legal process going on.\n\njessi toronjo: it really is a form of slow torture. … but i fully believe that he's not getting out.\n\njessi is trying not to dwell on it and instead focusing on helping others. i am jessi[ca], the book she wrote with her cousin jamie, was published on april 29, 2019 – the 30-year anniversary of the murders.\n\njamie collins: we've had a few book signing events … and it's been amazing just to see kind of the outpouring of support from the community.\n\njessi toronjo, right, and jamie collins at a book signing for i am jessi[ca]. jessi told attendees, i just appreciate everybody that's been supportive and has hung in there with me.. cbs news\n\njamie collins: it's been really an overwhelmingly positive experience for both of us.\n\njessi toronjo: when i read the book, it made me realize how strong i am [cries], and it made me realize that i have a purpose and it is to help people. and this book is one way that i'm going to do that.\n\nstephanie fagan: there's a lot i admire about jessi. … i admire jessi for her strong will. i admire her for her strength. i admire her for everything that she went through. … and i feel like she came out just this beautiful flower in a field full of weeds. that's how i feel about her.\n\ndakota toronjo: i saw her in this downward spiral … and then in just the past year or so i've seen her crawl back up … she survived it. … seeing my mom go through this has taught me to value family and to never give up and to always keep fighting no matter what's going on in my life.\n\njessi toronjo: having my family today is a blessing. … i look at them and i just realize how lucky i am to be alive.\n\nthirty years later, jessi has regained the sense of family she lost so suddenly, but she still thinks of what life would be like had things turned out differently.\n\njessi toronjo: now that i'm starting to feel again, i do think about my sisters and what they would have been like and if i would have had any nieces and nephews from them … and my mom, you know, how would she be with my kids? … would they have called her grandma? would they have called her nana?\n\njessi toronjo: i think today, my mom is looking down, and she's proud of me.\n\njessi toronjo: i know they're not here, but i know they're with me. and i still think of them.\n\njessi toronjo: i remember singing with my sisters right up there on that stage. … we would sing amazing grace.\n\njessi toronjo: thirty years ago, i did not know amazing grace would apply to me. … i know now that i survived for a reason. … i

amazon founder and ceo jeff bezos made the single-largest charitable contribution in 2020, according to the chronicle of philanthropy's annual list of top donations — a $10 billion gift aimed at fighting climate change.\n\nbezos, the world's richest person, used the contribution to launch his bezos earth fund. the fund, which supports nonprofits involved in the climate crisis, has paid out $790 million to 16 groups so far, according to the chronicle. according to the left-leaning americans for tax fairness and the institute for policy studies, from march 18 through december 7 of last year, bezos' wealth on paper surged by 63%, from $113 billion to $184 billion.\n\nthe sum total of the top 10 charitable donations last year — $2.6 billion — was the lowest since 2011, even as many billionaires vastly increased their wealth in the stock market rally that catapulted technology shares in particular last year.\n\nphil knight, who with his wife, penny, made the second- and third-largest donations last year according to the chronicle, saw his wealth grow by about 77% over the same march-to-december period. knight and his wife gave more than $900 million to the knight foundation and $300 million to the university of oregon.\n\nfred kummer, founder of construction company hbe corporation, and his wife, june, gave $300 million to establish a foundation to support programs at the missouri university of science and technology. it was the fourth largest charitable donation of the year.\n\nfifth place: the zuckerbergs\n\nfacebook founder mark zuckerberg and his wife, priscilla chan, delivered the fifth-largest donation on the chronicle's list: a $250 million gift to the center for tech and civic life, which worked on voting security issues in the 2020 election.\n\nzuckerberg, whose wealth nearly doubled to $105 billion in the march-to-december period according to americans for tax fairness and the institute for policy studies, has been widely criticized and been called to testify before congress for his company's handling of disinformation in the runup to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nin the sixth spot was a $200 million donation made by arthur blank, co-founder of home depot, through the arthur m. blank family foundation, to children's health care of atlanta to build a new hospital in his name.\n\nnos. 7 -

australia has changed one word in its national anthem to reflect what the prime minister called the spirit of unity and the country's indigenous population. prime minister scott morrison on new year's eve announced that the second line of the anthem, advance australia fair, has been changed from for we are young and free to for we are one and free.\n\nhappy new year australia, because we are one and free! 🇦🇺 — scott morrison (@scottmorrisonmp) december 31, 2020\n\nthe change took effect friday.\n\nit is time to ensure this great unity is reflected more fully in our national anthem, morrison said, adding that australia was the most successful multicultural nation on earth.\n\nwhile australia as a modern nation may be relatively young, our country's story is ancient, as are the stories of the many first nations peoples whose stewardship we rightly acknowledge and respect, morrison said.\n\nin the spirit of unity, it is only right that we ensure our national anthem reflects this truth and shared appreciation.\n\nminister for indigenous australians ken wyatt said in a statement that he had been asked about the change and had given it his support.\n\nwyatt, the first indigenous australian elected to the federal parliament's lower house, said the one-word change was small in nature but significant in purpose.\n\nit is an acknowledgement that aboriginal and torres strait islander cultures date back 65,000 years, he said.\n\nthe change comes less than two months after new south wales state premier gladys berejiklian expressed support for indigenous australians who said the national anthem did not reflect them and their history.\n\nuniversity of new south wales law professor megan davis, a cobble cobble woman from the barrungam nation in southwest queensland state, criticized the lack of consultation with indigenous people about the change.\n\nthis is a disappointing way to end 2020 and start 2021. everything about us, without us, she wrote on social media.\n\nlast month, australia's national rugby team, the wallabies, became the first sporting team to sing the anthem in an indigenous language before their match against argentina.\n\nadvance australia fair was composed by peter dodds mccormick and first performed in 1878. it was adopted as the national anthem in 1984.

locust swarms have taken over parts of eastern africa. the insects are rapidly eating the only source of food for many people in a region that is already food insecure.\n\nthe crop devastation has prompted the united nations to appeal for $76 million in aid to combat the swarms and prevent a humanitarian crisis. the un has raised about $15 million so far.\n\nlocusts are similar to grasshoppers, but differ in that they have the ability to change their behavior and can migrate over large distances. the swarms over the horn of africa are made up of desert locusts, which are known for forming swarms that can be highly dense and mobile, according to the un's food and agriculture organization desert locust information center.\n\nthe desert locust upsurge represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods and has the potential to become a regional plague that could lead to further suffering and displacement, reads the organization's appeal for aid.\n\nthe un is stressing that it needs the money immediately, reports cbs news foreign correspondent debora patta.\n\nthey're making no bones about it, they need that money now, patta said from johannesburg, south africa. it's the worst (locust outbreak) in 70 years for kenya, and a quarter of a century for somalia and ethiopia.\n\nofficials have warned that the insects could increase 500-fold by june if not contained quickly, patta said. if action isn't taken, the swarms could also migrate to other parts of africa — and even beyond the continent.\n\nthe idea is to spray the locusts aerially while they're still young, and before the population booms.\n\nwe need to act immediately because the locusts don't wait, they will come and they will destroy, said maria helena semedo, fao deputy director-general for climate and natural resources, in the appeal. we need to tackle the emergency but we need to think about livelihoods and the long-term.\n\neven before the locust outbreak, over 20 million people in east africa faced high levels of food insecurity due in part to harsh climate conditions, such as drought and flooding.\n\nthe desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world, according to the fao. a small swarm of locusts can consume enough food for 35,000 people. farmers are complaining that about 90% of their crops have already been destroyed. the locusts are now moving towards uganda and south sudan, a country that is already under significant strain from food insecurity.\n\nthis is a very rare phenomena, but once it does occur, it becomes extremely threatening to food securities, livelihoods, pastures — and of course with pastures, if herders have to move animals into new areas, this can be sources of conflict, said keith cressman, the fao's senior agriculture officer.\n\nlocusts swarm from ground vegetation near archers post in samburu county, kenya, about 186 miles north of nairobi, on january 22, 2020. tony karumba/getty images\n\nwhile the swarms appear almost biblical, there is a clear suspect for the cause of the outbreak: the changing climate. unusually wet and rainy seasons has contributed to the number of locusts, which thrive after rainy weather, patta reports.\n\nthe insects grow in size extremely fast, but only live three to five months. within that short lifespan, however, a locust population can explode if left unchecked. the swarms have grown so big that one spotted in kenya contained about 200 billion individual locusts, occupying a space in the sky three times the size of new york city.\n\nclimate experts have warned that unpredictable weather will continue in the horn of africa, making it very difficult to predict when the locusts will breed again in such quantities.\n\nthe typical locust season ends around june — when drier conditions naturally return — but action is needed sooner. by april it will be too late, patta said.\n\nswarms were first spotted about a year and a half ago on the arabian peninsula. by july of last year, they were reported in yemen. once the swarms arrived in yemen, the fao warned that if preventative measures weren't put in place, the insects would migrate to kenya next.\n\nlocusts can move about 90 miles in just one day.\n\naccording to the fao, a new generation of locusts is expected to hatch in february, and new swarms are expected in early april. if they are not controlled soon, more vulnerable countries will be targeted next.\n\nthat would coincide with the next season of planting. at that time, the seasonal winds will have shifted to the north, which is likely to allow the newly formed swarms in kenya to reinvade ethiopia and somalia as well as to migrate to new areas of south sudan and sudan, according to the fao appeal.\n\nin south sudan, where food insecurity is already at an emergency level in many parts of the country, the desert locusts could wipe out pastures and crops causing the deterioration of an already alarming situation.
the clark county black caucus said thursday that it would throw its support behind bernie sanders, the latest in a flurry of nevada endorsements this week as he seeks to shore up support in a key early contest.\n\nwhen you look at his platform and his consistency, over the years he has a long history fighting for civil rights and economic justice, yvette williams, chair of the clark county black caucus, tells cbs news.\n\nwe've interviewed him as well, and he has concrete plans in place that will address many of the inequities, inequalities, and injustices of black america, williams added.\n\nclark county includes las vegas and is far and away the most populous county in the state. racking up supporters in the county is essential for any candidate who hopes to win the nevada caucuses on february 22nd.\n\nthe clark county black caucus' endorsement comes as other nevada groups have rallied to sanders. on tuesday, the immigrant rights group make the road action made public its plans to leverage their organizing heft in nevada for the sanders campaign. meanwhile, the clark county education association, nevada's largest teachers union, announced monday that it too would back the vermont senator.\n\nsanders has invested heavily in nevada, which votes third after iowa and new hampshire. the contest is seen as a crucial test of candidates' support among hispanic and asian american voters, as well as the powerful labor unions that dominate democratic politics in the state.\n\nthe nevada caucuses could also be an early barometer for neighboring california, the mammoth super tuesday contest where the sanders campaign has also focused significant resources.\n\nsanders boasts 10 offices and over 100 staffers in nevada, the most of any candidate the state. and if not for a heart attack that sidelined the senator in las vegas more than three months ago, he would have recorded the most days publicly campaigning in nevada of any candidate in the race.\n\nthe clark county black caucus represents the diverse coalition we're building in nevada and i am proud to gain their support, sanders said in a statement.\n\ntheir voice and leadership has brought meaningful change in the lives of the communities they serve, and together, we will fight against a government and political system that have historically oppressed african americans, he added in part.\n\nthe clark county black caucus, which backed sanders in 2016, had endorsed cory booker late last year after a vote among its membership of some 400 nevadans. at the time, the group indicated that sanders was their second choice.\n\nbooker, who suspended his campaign for president on monday, suggested tuesday in an interview with cbs this morning that he was not yet ready to endorse a democratic candidate for president. however, multiple backers of booker tell cbs news they have already been aggressively courted by other campaigns.\n\nrecent polls in nevada show sanders in a tight race with joe biden this year. but while biden's team is dwarfed by the staff sanders has amassed, the former vice president has nabbed the support of key progressive leaders in the state.\n\nthe leadership of the influential nevada culinary union has remained publicly skeptical of medicare for all, the single-payer healthcare proposal at the heart of the sanders platform. and just this week, a usa today/suffolk survey showed sanders still trailing the biden among black nevada caucus-goers.\n\nwilliams hopes the clark county black caucus can help boost the senator's chances among that demographic and is planning events to support the campaign in its home stretch. early voting in nevada kicks off in just a month, on february 15th.\n\ni have no ill will with biden. but i just strongly believe that it's time for change for black america. it's time for bernie sanders and his policy that's going to provide for an america that's more racially just, said williams.
washington — the joint session of congress scheduled to occur wednesday for the counting and certifying of electoral college votes is set to be marked by high drama, as republicans in the house and senate have pledged to challenge the results from several battleground states.\n\na group of at least 12 republican senators have said they, along with more than 100 gop house members, will object to the electoral votes cast in key states, charging their elections were rife with fraud despite no widespread evidence. but as the joint session nears, a growing number of republican senators are breaking with their colleagues and plan not to sign on to their challenges.\n\nrequired under the constitution, the event has in the past been perfunctory: in 2017, the process of reading and tallying electoral votes spanned 41 minutes, and in 2013, the joint session lasted just 23 minutes, according to a report from the congressional research service.\n\nwhile the objections are not going to result in a change in the outcome of the election, it will prolong the process by which congress affirms president-elect joe biden's victory. when the house and senate separate to debate and vote on an objection, they have up to two hours to consider it, meaning the joint session is likely to stretch well into the night.\n\nthe joint session is typically a formality, but this year's event will force republicans to decide whether to back president trump in his attempts to reverse the outcome of the election or uphold the votes cast by millions of americans.\n\nonly one of georgia's gop senators will be participating in the electoral college — both senators kelly loeffler and david perdue are in runoff elections on tuesday, but because loeffler is filling the seat left vacant by senator johnny isakson's retirement and that term is up in 2022, she remains a senator until the winner in her race against democrat raphael warnock is certified. perdue supports the actions of senators who oppose counting some of the electoral votes, but his term ended on january 3, and the winner of his race against democrat jon ossoff won't be certified in time for the winner to be seated on january 6.\n\nhere is where republican senators stand, as of tuesday:\n\noppose the counting of electoral votes\n\nmarsha blackburn of tennessee mike braun of indiana\n\nted cruz of texas steve daines of montana bill hagerty of tennessee josh hawley of missouri ron johnson of wisconsin john kennedy of louisiana james lankford of oklahoma cynthia lummis of wyoming roger marshall of kansas rick scott of florida tommy tuberville of alabama kelly loeffler of georgia\n\nsupport the counting of electoral votes\n\nroy blunt of missouri john boozman of arkansas richard burr of north carolina shelley moore capito of west virginia bill cassidy of louisiana kevin cramer of north dakota susan collins of maine john cornyn of texas tom cotton of arkansas john hoeven of north dakota jim inhofe of oklahoma jerry moran of kansas lisa murkowski of alaska rob portman of ohio mitt romney of utah ben sasse of nebraska tim scott of south carolina richard shelby of alabama john thune of south dakota thom tillis of north carolina pat toomey of pennsylvania roger wicker of mississippi todd young of indiana\n\nunknown/unclear
johannesburg, south africa — the new coronavirus variant identified in south africa poses even more of a risk than the strain discovered several weeks ago in england, britain's top health official warned on monday. his alarm came as scientists warned that the new strain sweeping through south african coastal communities could be resistant to the covid-19 vaccines approved or awaiting approval in the u.s. and europe.\n\ni'm incredibly worried about the south african variant, health secretary matt hancock told bbc radio. this is a very, very significant problem... it's even more of a problem than the u.k. new variant.\n\nas the first doses of the oxford university-astrazeneca vaccine outside of medical trials were administered at an oxford hospital on monday, senior oxford immunologist professor john bell — who helped create the prestigious university's vaccine — said there was a big question mark over whether the current versions of vaccines would work on the south african variant.\n\nhe said it was unlikely the mutation would make the vaccines ineffective, but that they might need tweaks to provide as much protection against the strain as they do against the others already in wide circulation elsewhere.\n\nthe lead researcher on the trial of the oxford vaccine carried out in south africa, professor shabir madhi, told cbs news on monday that more than 13 variants of the coronavirus had been identified in the country since the start of the pandemic. he said the new one, 501.v2, which has spread like wildfire in south africa's coastal cities, is the most worrying mutation of the virus so far.\n\nit's not a given that the vaccine will not work on this variant, but it is a consideration that the vaccine might not have the full efficacy, he said.\n\nwell-timed trials\n\nboth oxford and u.s. pharmaceutical giant johnson & johnson have carried out human trials of their vaccines in south africa, including doses given since the new variant started spreading discovered.\n\nthose on our trial received the second dose during the time of this new variant, which is extremely fortunate, madhi said, adding that he expected the relevant trial results by the fourth week of january.\n\nglenda grey, president of the south african medical research council and lead of the johnson & johnson vaccine trial team, confirmed that their trial also included giving participants doses amid the outbreak of the new strain.\n\nit is fortunate that this timing will allow us to see whether there is any change with this new variant in the vaccine's efficacy, she said. her team also expects results towards the end of this month.\n\nthis new variant should not delay vaccine access, but it also means we need to keep our eye on breakthrough infections, she said, referring to the rate of infections among those who have received the vaccine.\n\njohnson and johnson's vaccine requires only one dose, unlike the oxford and pfizer vaccines approved for use in britain, or the moderna formula being used in the u.s. along with the pfizer shots.\n\nthe oxford vaccine was trialed at seven different sites across south africa in 2,100 volunteers, while some 45,000 people were involved in the johnson and johnson trial.\n\nso far immunologists have voiced little concern over the efficacy of the approved or pending vaccines against other mutations of the coronavirus, including a variant discovered late last year in the london region that has driven u.k. infection rates up sharply.\n\ngovernment scientists say that, like the south african variant, the new british strain appears to be more easily passed between people, but they expect it to respond to the vaccines in the same way as the more widespread versions of the disease.\n\nsouth africans stuck waiting\n\nmeanwhile, south africans are still waiting to learn when any vaccines might actually become available in their country outside of the trials.\n\nthe country's largest trade union has accused the government of gross incompetence with its a vaccine rollout plan. a group of eminent scientists, including glenda gray, slammed the government in an op-ed published on sunday for what they said was an astonishing lack of planning.\n\nwithin hours of the criticism, minister of health dr. zweli mkhize gave an online presentation outlining the government's plan. he said the goal was to vaccinate two-thirds of south africa's 57 million people by the end of the year, beginning in february.\n\nwe are targeting a minimum of 67% of the population to achieve herd immunity, he said.\n\nsouth africa's ministry of health has reported a total of 1.1 million cumulative covid-19 cases across the country, with a positivity rate of about 32% and almost 30,000 confirmed deaths. it's the worst national coronavirus epidemic in africa.
there was no stopping the o'jays' hit love train, which raced to the top of the charts way back in 1973. for the record, all these years later, the o'jays are still doing what they love -- and talking about it with our jim axelrod:\n\nnothing says old school like the o'jays. with hit after hit, they practically ruled the r&b radio charts in the 1970s. and while some of the outfits may have fallen out of fashion, their songs stand the test of time.\n\nstill performing after more than half a century together, their vintage days may be behind them. but listen to the o'jays sing and watch the o'jays work -- this is no nostalgia act.\n\naxelrod said, we've all seen the groups that are the name only, and they're not creating new, fresh moments.\n\nwe're still having moments, said eddie levert. those hallelujah moments.\n\nat 75 and 74 years old, levert and walter williams -- together with the new kid, eric nolan grant -- are still creating plenty of hallelujah moments.\n\nthe o'jays - eddie levert, eric nolan grant and walter williams - with correspondent jim axelrod. cbs news\n\nperfectly fitting, since williams and levert started singing together in a canton, ohio church choir more than 60 years ago. they formed a group, and had some local success.\n\nbut canton didn't change their lives; philadelphia did.\n\nthat's where, in the early 1970s, a post-motown r&b sound was evolving in a studio run by kenny gamble and leon huff.\n\ni have seen them take a song totally apart with just bass, piano, and drums, said williams. and then they add all of the sweetness to it with the other instruments, and horns, and strings, and it's unbelievable.\n\ngamble & huff's philly sound polished the o'jays' mix of sweet soul groove and romantic ballads into 11 gold and four platinum records -- two-dozen top 10 r&b singles -- and their signature hit: love train, which went to no. 1 on the pop charts in 1973.\n\nnot bad for improvising!\n\naxelrod asked, is it true you didn't step into the recording session with the lyrics fully written?\n\nabsolutely, said williams. gamble sat at the console. he didn't have a second verse! and he wrote it right there in the studio.\n\nand 45 years later they're still singing it.\n\neddie levert, walter williams and eric nolan grant. cbs news\n\nbut it hasn't been all bright lights and hit records … it never is. there have also been painful personal challenges.\n\nsince 1983, walter williams has battled multiple sclerosis: if i had gone home, probably would never come out again to work. so i wanted to work through it.\n\nwork through m.s.?\n\nyeah. i didn't have a choice.\n\nin 2006, levert's son gerald, a hit singer himself, died from a prescription drug overdose. two years later, his son sean, who'd suffered from heart and lung problems, died as well.\n\naxelrod asked, how'd you keep it going through that kind of tragedy, both the boys?\n\nthere's a lot of people depend on me; i have to stay focused. i'm no good if i fall apart, levert replied.\n\nwatching all this was eric nolan grant, who's been with williams and levert 22 years now.\n\neric nolan grant (center) joined the o'jays in 1995. cbs news\n\ngrant said, when i got in the group i thought i was a man, and they couldn't tell me nothing different. being with them, i learned how to be a man.\n\nand what happens for grant when williams and levert are done? it's done. if i don't have eddie and walt, you know, the bookends, it's a wrap.\n\nmembers of the rock 'n' roll hall of fame since 2005, the o'jays know this won't go on forever. however fine their form, it's time that always gets to close the show.\n\nthe o'jays say they've got two years left.\n\nso, let's just say it's 2020 and you're done. what do you want the legacy to be when people think about the o'jays? axelrod asked.\n\nwhen they're on their way home, they should be talkin' about you, williams laughed. on my way out, i want them to be talking about me!\n\nand they still are, all these years later … drawn to the o'jays by their music and their message.\n\nat the end of the day, said levert, what were we trying to convey? love is the only thing that matters, man.\n\nthe o'jays endure, as do their scintillating romantic ballads - blends of r&b and a sweet soul groove. cbs news\n\n\n\nfor more info:
how 5g is ushering in a new era of possibilit...\n\nhow 5g is ushering in a new era of possibility\n\nhow 5g is ushering in a new era of possibility\n\nthe new generation of wireless technology known as 5g is exciting industry leaders who believe the rapid advancements toward faster internet speeds will spur innovation in every sector of the u.s economy.\n\non monday night, verizon ceo hans vestberg spoke for nearly an hour about 5g during his keynote address at the annual consumer electronics show, or ces, which is being held virtually this year. 5g was also featured in more than a dozen breakout sessions throughout the week as industry leaders discussed its impact on businesses, government, and consumers.\n\nbut researchers caution that the promises of life-changing applications will take years and that lawmakers in washington might not be ready to lead the way.\n\nthe big bet right now is to try to get all the infrastructure in place so that the next revolutionary app and service ecosystem can spring forward in the united states before it does somewhere else, said stan adams, deputy general counsel and open internet counsel at the center for democracy and technology.\n\nattendees and workers chat beneath a 5g logo at the quectel booth at ces 2020 at the las vegas convention center on january 8, 2020 in las vegas, nevada. mario tama / getty images\n\ninstalling new cell towers or upgrading existing ones with hundreds of thousands of pizza-box-size antennas on every block, and making available more radio frequencies for those towers to connect to, are critical for the technology's growth, experts say.\n\n5g frequencies are available in the low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrums. in the past few years, the federal communications commission has opened up 5 gigahertz of spectrum for 5g use. there's an ongoing auction to open up an additional 280 megahertz of space in the mid-band spectrum, which has so far raised a record $80 billion, a senior fcc official told cbs news.\n\nthe official said opening up new spectrum space has been challenging because much of the space is already in use.\n\nindustry leaders agree that the full benefits of 5g will be unlocked with more high-band, millimeter wavelength frequencies becoming available. the high-band category provides the most bandwidth and fastest speeds, but the signal doesn't travel far and can't penetrate walls.\n\nthat means having a tower on every corner of every block and maybe on every floor of every building, according to adams. as a result, companies deploying the infrastructure often get locked into regulatory battles with cities and towns.\n\nthe issue from the industry side is the new towers they're rolling out for 5g are not the 300 foot tall metal structures, adams said, adding, they're not the same kind of thing that most of the permitting and review rules had in mind when they were developed.\n\nlocal governments want to preserve their ability to review and collect fees on new deployments in their towns, while the companies want to roll out 5g in a timely fashion and cost effective way, adams explained.\n\nthe fcc said it has adopted reforms to help speed up the deployment of 5g.\n\nin 2018, the commission prevented localities from charging more than it costs them to process and manage applications. more recently, the fcc said state or local officials must approve any request for modification of existing towers that doesn't substantially change the dimensions of existing structures within 60 days.\n\ndr. nicol turner lee, a senior fellow in governance studies at the brookings institution and director of the center for technology innovation, told cbs news that a centralized committee to help with policy while engaging all the stakeholders will reduce regulatory battles and improve rollout efficiency.\n\nhead of samsung next global, senior vice president emily becher speaks during a samsung press event for ces 2020 at the mandalay bay convention center on january 6, 2020 in las vegas, nevada. david becker / getty images\n\nwe need to sit back and figure out how to take all the post-it notes and put them all into a complete plan so we can move forward cohesively around it, turner lee said. she added that it is imperative for the incoming biden administration to think about a 5g taskforce that would bring all these pieces together.\n\nbut some, like technology consultant and ceo of the palmer group shelly palmer, say lawmakers in washington aren't tech savvy enough to usher in a new era of advancement.\n\nwe've got lawmakers and legislation that are years behind the technology, palmer said. while it's always been that way, we've never had technology accelerating at a pace like this.\n\nthe coronavirus pandemic has increased the need for connectivity as americans work and study from home. beyond a fast internet connection, experts say 5g will support advances in telemedicine, autonomous vehicles, virtual reality, and much more.\n\npalmer said the really cool stuff like mixed reality, which is the combination of physical and digital objects co-existing and interacting in real time and other applications that will rely on the fast speed and low latency of 5g, is going to take a few years.\n\nin 2010, when 4g wireless technology hit the market, it took two to three years before life-changing applications like ride-sharing and video conferencing became commonplace .\n\nadams said 5g will also bring about the ability to deploy literally millions of tiny little sensors on all kinds of infrastructure and goods that will lead to a lot more data collection across networks. additionally, cell towers on every block means more precise geolocation of individual cell phones.\n\nas you magnify and amplify your data collection mechanisms, privacy suffers. we've seen that over and over again, adams said.
amazon is asking third-party sellers to stop shipping most goods to its warehouses as the online retailer grapples with a coronavirus-fueled surge in demand for medical supplies and household products.\n\nthe ecommerce company told sellers in a note on tuesday that it will only ship household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products unless amazon already has other purchased items on hand in its warehouses.\n\nthe pause lasts through at least april 5 and will apply to amazon shipments in the u.s. and european union. products already in amazon warehouses, or those currently in transit on their way to the facilities, will not be affected, the company said.\n\nthe change affects third-party shippers that rely on amazon's fulfillment service, as well merchants who sell directly to amazon. sellers that package and ship their own goods will not be affected by the temporary change in policy..\n\nwe are seeing increased online shopping, and as a result some products such as household staples and medical supplies are out of stock, amazon told cbs moneywatchh in a statement. with this in mind, we are temporarily prioritizing household staples, medical supplies and other high-demand products coming into our fulfillment centers so we can more quickly receive, restock and ship these products to customers.\n\nproducts that amazon is prioritizing for shipment must fall into one of six categories, according to the company:\n\nbaby products\n\nhealth and household products\n\nbeauty and personal care products (including personal care appliances)\n\ngrocery products\n\nindustrial and scientific products\n\npet supplies.\n\namazon told customers last weekend that waits for some products could take longer than the usual two days. many common items, such as soap and diapers, were listed as unavailable on tuesday.\n\nthird-party businesses constitute most of the sellers on amazon's vast platform, generating more sales than even the products sold directly by amazon, according to business insider. while they are independent businesses, these sellers often heavily rely on amazon and have little say in setting the terms of their interaction.\n\nwe understand this is a change to your business, and we did not take this decision lightly. we are working around the clock to increase capacity, amazon wrote in its note.\n\nthat didn't assuage many sellers, with some writing that the change could put them out of business. others called for compassion for the workers who pack and ship amazon goods and whose jobs don't allow them to work from home during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nfor most of us, this would mean inconvenience. for those at risk, it means a matter of life and death, one poster wrote in a seller forum.\n\namazon has faced a surge in orders as coronavirus panic sets in across the u.s. and more people shop online. the company announced on monday it would hire 100,000 additional workers to deal with unprecedented labor needs.
washington — a prestigious scientific panel is recommending that states significantly lower their drunken driving thresholds as part of a blueprint to eliminate the entirely preventable 10,000 alcohol-impaired driving deaths in the united states each year.\n\nthe u.s. government-commissioned, 489-page report by a panel of the national academies of sciences, engineering and medicine released wednesday throws the weight of the scientific body behind lowering the blood-alcohol concentration threshold from 0.08 to 0.05. all states have 0.08 thresholds. a utah law passed last year that lowers the state's threshold to 0.05 doesn't go into effect until dec. 30.\n\nthe amount of alcohol required to reach 0.05 would depend on several factors, including the person's size and whether the person has recently eaten. a 150-pound man might be over the 0.05 limit after two beers, while a 120-pound woman could exceed it after a single drink, according to the american beverage institute, a national restaurant group.\n\nthe panel also recommended that states significantly increase alcohol taxes and make alcohol less conveniently available, including reducing the hours and days alcohol is sold in stores, bars and restaurants. research suggests a doubling of alcohol taxes could lead to an 11 percent reduction in traffic crash deaths, the report said.\n\nit also calls for cracking down on sales to people under 21 or who are already intoxicated to discourage binge drinking, and putting limits on alcohol marketing while funding anti-alcohol campaigns similar to those against smoking.\n\nall the proposals are likely to draw fierce opposition from the alcohol and restaurant industries. the beverage institute took out full-page newspaper ads opposing utah's new law that featured a fake mugshot under a large headline reading, utah: come for vacation, leave on probation.\n\nthe recommendations in the academies' report would do nothing to deter repeat offenders and high bac drivers, who represent the vast majority of alcohol-impaired driving deaths, the distilled spirits council said in a statement. the council said it also doesn't support the report's recommendations for tax increases and advertising bans, which will have little or no impact on traffic safety.\n\nthe report points out that alcohol-impaired driving remains the deadliest and costliest danger on u.s. roads, accounting for 28 percent of traffic deaths. each day, 29 people in the u.s. die in alcohol-related crashes and many more are injured. forty percent of those killed are people other than the drunken driver.\n\nrural areas are disproportionately affected. in 2015, 48 percent of drunken driving fatalities occurred in rural areas.\n\nthe report says many strategies have been effective to prevent drunken driving, but a coordinated multilevel approach across multiple sectors will be required to accelerate change.\n\nthe problem isn't intractable, the report said.\n\nfrom the early 1980s to the early 2000s, there was significant progress as the result of an increase in the drinking age to 21, decreases in the blood-alcohol threshold, and other measures, the report said. but since then, progress has stagnated and recently has begun to reverse.\n\naction to address drunken driving can't wait for the advent of self-driving cars immune to the lures of a cold beer or a fine wine — it will take too long for autonomous vehicles to replace all the human-driven machines on the road, said the panel's chairman, steven teutsch, a senior fellow for health policy and economics at the university of southern california in los angeles.\n\nin the meantime, we have 10,000 people a year dying and we ought to do something about it, he said.\n\nthe report cites studies that show the united states lags behind other high-income countries in preventing drunken driving fatalities. more than 100 countries have adopted the 0.05 threshold lower. in europe, the share of traffic deaths attributable to drunken driving was reduced by more than half within 10 years after the standard was dropped, the national transportation safety board said in 2013. the safety board has also recommended the 0.05 threshold.\n\nalcoholic beverages have changed significantly over the past 25 years. they are more affordable, of far greater variety, and more widely advertised and promoted than in earlier periods, the report said. the lack of consistency in serving sizes and the combination of alcohol with caffeine and energy drinks make it harder for drinkers to estimate their level of impairment.\n\nthe report was commissioned by the national highway traffic safety administration, which asked the academies to determine which strategies for reducing drunken driving have been proven effective.
a week after super tuesday, the democratic field has winnowed to two main candidates, bernie sanders and joe biden, who will be fighting for delegates in six states on tuesday. the most closely-watched of these upcoming six states is michigan. with 125 delegates, it offers the biggest prize of the night. in 2016, sanders scored a major surprise upset against hillary clinton, by winning the majority of white voters, though clinton won handily among black voters and women. it is unclear whether sanders can replicate that victory this time around against biden. like clinton, biden has so far proven he has significant support among african americans, and he is also more popular among working-class white voters than clinton was.\n\na new poll from monmouth university released on monday showed biden with a commanding lead over sanders. fifty-one percent of likely democratic primary voters said they planned to support biden compared to 36% for sanders. biden led sanders among white voters (50% to 36%), voters of other races, (53% to 36%), voters age 50 and over (62% to 24%) and women (53% to 33%). sanders led biden among voters under 50 years old (49% to 38%) and men (49% to 39%). as of last week, according to a detroit news/wdiv poll, absentee voters who had cast their votes also heavily favored biden over sanders. pollster richard czuba estimated that biden can bank an almost 150,000-vote lead on sanders just through absentees. michigan voters care most about beating president trump (39.3%). health care was a distant second (18.5%), the survey found.\n\nsanders is making a big push in michigan, having appeared at events in five different cities during the final weekend before tuesday's primary. he went to the county where he suffered his biggest defeat in 2016 by vote total, wayne county, home of detroit, and the county where he had his biggest win by vote total, kent county, where grand rapids is located. he also stopped by the liberal haven of ann arbor to try to boost support from university of michigan students at a rally with one of highest-profile supporters, representative alexandria ocasio-cortez. young voters were critical to his success in 2016 in michigan, and they're supporting him in large numbers so far in 2020. on the trail in michigan, he has been vocal about trade, continuing to hammer home the theme that biden has championed trade deals like nafta that many union voters view with suspicion. turnout among african american voters will be closely watched. though biden's ties to black voters have been proven in the contests so far, turnout in michigan, particularly in wayne county, and the level of enthusiasm for him could be a key factor on tuesday. suburban women are another key constituency for biden. sanders has promised to expand the electorate with new voters, but after a disappointing showing on super tuesday, he has admitted some disappointment that the level of turnout is not what he had hoped for or anticipated. michigan holds what's known as an open closed primary — there is no party registration requirement in the state. any person can vote in either party's primary, but voters must ask for one party's ballot when they show up at the polls and identify in writing which political party they wish to vote with in the primary.\n\n\n\ndue to a 2018 ballot measure, voters can vote absentee without providing a reason. if a person voted absentee for a candidate who has since suspended his or her campaign, that voter can change their vote if they submitted requests in writing by march 7 or appear in person by monday, march 9. as of march 6, 24,109 people had done this, according to the michigan secretary of state's office. michigan's results could take some time to tabulate. as of march 5, about 90% more absentee ballots were sent compared to five days before the primary in 2016. nearly 600,000 absentee ballots had been cast as of that day. the secretary of state has pushed michigan's legislature to change state law to allow clerks to process or count absentee ballots before election day. sanders is expected to do well in idaho and north dakota, both states with largely white and rural populations, and both states he won in 2016 against clinton. he is also polling high in washington state, the last primary to close on tuesday. but like california, most of washington votes by mail, so the results may not be known for some time.\n\nmississippi\n\nmississippi also votes on tuesday. it's a state that's expected to go big for biden, given that it has an even larger african american democratic electorate than south carolina. in 2016, 71% of the democratic primary voters in the state were african american. polls will be open between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. et. there is no early voting in the state. absentee ballots had to be received by march 9 to be counted. as of march 5, more than 15,000 voters had requested an absentee ballot for the march 10 election, according to the secretary of state's office. as of march 3, only 10,503 ballots have been received by the circuit clerks offices.\n\nmissouri\n\nin 2016, clinton had the support from key political figures and labor unions in the state, but won the state by less than 1,500 votes. exit polling said clinton won women with 54% but sanders won men with 56%. sanders also won over voters under 44, while clinton had the backing of voters in the state 45 years old and up. clinton also won 67% of black voters, compared to sanders 32%, but sanders won white voters 54% to 45%. missouri is an open primary, so voters can ask for any party's ballot on election day. delegates will be allocated proportionally to the vote, and the threshold for delegates is 15%. missouri does not have early voting but allows absentee voting. the period to request ballots ended last week, and those ballots must either be received by the time polls close tuesday or submitted in person by monday. according to the office of the missouri secretary of state, 66,374 people had requested absentee ballots as of march 6, but a spokesperson for the office said it would not have a clear sense of how many had been returned until after the election.\n\nidaho\n\nin the idaho primary, candidates need to meet at 15% threshold at the congressional district level or statewide to be considered viable. independent and unaffiliated voters are allowed to participate in the democratic primary but cannot participate in the republican primary. in-person early voting in idaho ran from february 24 through march 6. in 2018, idaho changed from a party-run caucus to a state-run primary. idaho allows same-day registration for voters at polling locations. sanders prevailed against clinton in the state in 2016.\n\nnorth dakota\n\nnorth dakota holds a firehouse caucus, which is essentially a party-run primary. the caucuses are open and anyone can participate. voting by mail took place january 20 through march 5. in the open caucuses, candidates must meet a threshold of 15% statewide to be considered viable. in 2016, sanders beat clinton in the state, winning the state's 18 delegates. its voters are also largely white and rural.\n\n***musadiq bidar, adam brewster, sarah ewall-wice & alex tin contributed to this report\n\n\n\n\n\nfrom the candidates\n\njoe biden\n\nby the end of monday night, biden in michigan will have appeared with his trio of recent, high-profile endorsers: michigan governor gretchen whitmer, senator cory booker of new jersey and senator kamala harris of california. cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson says that with the latest endorsement, booker's backing on monday morning, a total of 10 former democratic presidential candidates have endorsed biden. sanders currently has two from former 2020 rivals: new york city mayor bill de blasio and marianne williamson. while biden hopes to focus in the rust belt on his health care policy differences with sanders, coronavirus has placed both the president and the democratic candidates under the spotlight. i think there's no confidence in the president, in anything he says or does, biden told msnbc on monday. i wish he'd be quiet, just let the experts speak and acknowledge whatever they suggest to him is what we should be doing.\n\nbernie sanders\n\nsanders dodged a question today about taking personal precautions for his own health in the wake of coronavirus, says cbs news campaign reporter cara korte. well, i'm surrounded by medical personnel, sanders said referring to a panel of health care professional around him, assembled for a campaign event on coronavirus. thank you for asking. i am running for president of the united states and that requires a whole lot of work, he said. sanders' message on coronavirus is twofold: first, he said the trump administration's failure to embrace science is making the situation worse, including the appointment of vice president mike pence as coronavirus czar. during the panel discussion, sanders read a quote from the president that suggested people should work through symptoms. that might be the stupidest advice ever made by a president of the united states, said sanders. secondly, folding in medicare for all, sanders said a vaccine should be made free for everyone. he also said a single-payer system would lower the risks on contamination as people could to the doctor without fear of not affording care. earlier monday, at a rally in st. louis, sanders spoke the virus at length. and just look at the insanity dealing with this coronavirus, this very serious problem that we're dealing with in america, dealing with all over the world. think about the insanity of a system where today, somebody wakes up and maybe they think they have the symptoms of coronavirus. yet they cannot afford to go to a doctor. what does that mean? so they're gonna go to work, and make a serious epidemic even worse, he said.\n\nlife after 2020\n\nmichael bloomberg\n\nless than a week after suspending his presidential campaign, billionaire and former new york mayor mike bloomberg is spending his own money to combat voter suppression. cbs news campaign reporter tim perry confirms bloomberg gave $2 million to collective future for african american voter registration. this is not the first time bloomberg has spent his own wealth for this particular issue. in december 2019, bloomberg announced a $5 million donation to stacey abrams' new voter protective initiative. this donation expands on bloomberg's commitment to register 500,000 voters from under-represented groups in key swing states heading into november's general election. voter suppression efforts across the country have been a barely disguised effort to keep black americans and other democratic-leaning voters from the polls. i've always believed we need to make it easier for all citizens to register and vote, not harder. bloomberg said in a statement. that's why i strongly support collective future in their effort to register 500,000 black americans. these new voters could determine the november election - and the future of the country. the stakes couldn't be higher. so while our campaign for the presidency is over, our work to get america back on track is still growing. a spokesperson for bloomberg told cbs news the money was transferred last week, but the proposal had been in the works before bloomberg exited the race after a poor super tuesday showing.\n\ncory booker\n\nsenator cory booker of new jersey announced on monday he is endorsing biden for president says cbs news campaign reporter jack turman. in an email to supporters, booker explained his decision to endorse biden. joe is building the kind of campaign that will do more than remove one guy from one office, the email reads. he will lead the democratic party to victory in races up and down the ballot across the country this november. in an interview with cbs this morning, booker talked about the importance of unifying the democratic party ahead of tuesday's primary contests. it is about time we start unifying as a party and begin the work to beat donald trump and frankly, save our nation, humanity, address our common cause and our common challenges, booker said.\n\npete buttigieg\n\nin his first television interview since suspending his presidential campaign, pete buttigieg told nbc news the decision to drop out of the race was his own after being asked if the establishment pressured him to end his presidential bid. look the kind of people who run for president of the united states are the kind of people who make their own decisions, buttigieg said. it was my decision. cbs news campaign reporter jack turman says buttigieg also announced that he will be guest hosting jimmy kimmel live on thursday. he said that one of the guests on thursday is actor sir patrick stewart.\n\nissues that matter\n\ntrade\n\nthere's a trade war raging between the top two democratic presidential contenders, report cbs news campaign reporters bo erickson and cara korte. since super tuesday left two main candidates standing last week, sanders has made it a point at campaign stops to list the areas where he and biden disagree. trade has taken center stage this week, as the two men fight for delegates in the industrial midwest. though neither candidate has released a detailed trade policy, a decisive primary win in michigan on tuesday or next week in ohio could signal how the democratic party will approach trade and the nation's economic agenda. across one of the nation's most iconic manufacturing states, sanders has been taking swipes at biden's positions on trade. he slammed then-senator biden's support of the 1993 north american free trade agreement (nafta), which eliminated most tariffs between the u.s., mexico and canada and the 2000 china trade bill, which reinstated permanent and normal trade relations (pntr) with china. sanders voted against both measures as a house member and continues to rail against the policies today, a point highlighted by a sanders ad called decimated that's up in every march 10 and march 17 primary state. if we are going to defeat trump in michigan, in pennsylvania, and in wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements, sanders told a detroit crowd on friday. this playbook may seem familiar to democrats, since sanders waged a similar campaign against clinton in the 2016 democratic primaries in michigan. he skewered her at a democratic debate held in flint, michigan, two days before the primary. secretary clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate america. nafta, supported by the secretary, cost us 800,000 jobs nationwide; tens of thousands of jobs in the midwest. permanent normal trade relations with china cost us millions of jobs, he said at the time.\n\nthe argument helped sanders eke out a win over clinton in the great lakes state, in a 1.5-point upset. later, mr. trump, too, consistently criticized clinton over nafta and the trans-pacific partnership. sanders portrays his congressional votes opposing the trade deals as a matter of character. i worked with the unions as a member of the house of representative to defeat nafta and to defeat pntr with china. i can remember like it was yesterday being on a picket line in montpellier, vermont in opposition to nafta. i knew what it was gonna do. i knew that you cannot ask american workers who are earning living wages to compete against the starvation wages being paid in mexico, sanders said friday in detroit. the senator hit the same note during campaign stops in michigan over weekend. he said in flint on saturday that i heard, during that period in the '90s, i heard all of corporate america say, 'you gotta vote for these trade agreements.' and all of the media said, 'you gotta vote for these trade agreements.' i stood with the unions, the working families of this country; i voted against those agreements! joe biden voted for those agreements. the reviews of nafta are somewhat mixed, and a new version of the deal, the u.s.-mexico-canada trade agreement, is expected to be implemented soon, after canada ratifies it. in 2013, the liberal think tank economic policy institute projected that nafta caused, 20 years of stagnant wages and the upward redistribution of income, wealth and political power. at the same time, foreign affairs estimates that 14 million american jobs still depend on nafta. and a 2016 report from the u.s. international trade commission concluded the policy, had essentially no effect on real wages in the united states of either skilled or unskilled workers.\n\nbiden has rarely brought up north american trade policy on the stump since the iowa caucuses, where he would emphasize the impacts of the agricultural trade war with china. instead, he casts himself as an ally to workers and union members, even though its some workers have fallen victim to the shift of u.s. production to cheaper alternatives in mexico, as general motors did in march 2019, eliminating 1,700 hourly jobs in ohio alone. he stands by his nafta vote, arguing that no, it wasn't a mistake to vote in favor of the deal, he said last may in iowa. he has labeled himself a fair trader, rather than a free trader. he added, we should treat other countries in a way they treat us…just deciding it's all about trade deficit balancing...we need to do more.\n\nthe most recent ripple in the trade debate has been the usmca agreement, an idea then-candidate barack obama pitched in the 2008 primary. biden has said that in principle he supported the agreement due to the increased labor and environmental protections, issues that he told cbs news in summer 2019 that he believed should have been more thoroughly addressed from the beginning of the nafta negotiation in the 1990s. sanders unapologetically voted against usmca, stating that protections did not go far enough. on this matter sanders stood alone. his one-time democratic adversaries criticized him for being too purist in his pursuit. elizabeth warren, once sanders' fellow progressive in the race, promised to support the usmca and bargain for a better deal if elected. the distinction was noted by some in the rust belt. frank hammer, a retired 32-year general motors employee, participated in a panel discussion on trade with sanders friday in detroit. you were the singular, sole [candidate] that said — consistent with your past positions — that you were opposed to [usmca] and i think that speaks volumes for the stance that you have taken on behalf of working class people and especially auto workers, hammer said. and i'm so grateful. thank you.\n\non the trail biden has dismissed china's status as an economic powerhouse, pointing out basic challenges chinese leaders face, like providing enough potable water for their people, and boasting about the u.s. dominance in the future. the idea that china is going to eat our lunch, it's bizarre, he said in iowa in late january, suggesting that rather than viewing china as an existential threat, the u.s. could help china with some of its problems. the u.s. can compete with china and insist that they follow the rules, he proposed. unlike the social security ads the biden campaign is running in michigan, two biden advisers tell cbs news after reviewing their internal polling they decided to not engage sanders on the intra-party trade war. at this point i'm not sure voters are looking for a vote-by-vote analysis, one biden adviser told cbs news, they're looking for a nominee. others agree that focusing on trade — even in michigan — may not be as beneficial as sanders hopes. i think it's a miscalculation from sanders, justin wolfers, professor of economics and public policy at the university of michigan, told cbs news. wolfers cited a gallup poll that shows 67% of self-described democrats say that nafta has been beneficial for the united states. wolfers said that with the mr. trump's election everything is a little upside down in terms of trade politics because the gop incumbent has made a stronger pitch for protectionist voters than any democratic nominee is likely to make. relatively speaking, democrats are now the pro-trade party, wolfers added.\n\nbiden has a strong argument to make in michigan on manufacturing, though, since he had a leading role in helping to negotiate the obama administration's 2009 auto bailout of two of the big u.s. automakers, general motors and chrysler. just like the automobile industry came back, detroit is going to come back, biden said in 2014. it's not only an important city but it's an iconic city. it symbolizes the manufacturing might of the united states of america. according to an invitation obtained by cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster, biden is expected to attend a high-dollar fundraiser in michigan this week, co-hosted by cynthia and edsel ford, the great-grandson of henry ford.\n\nstate-by-state\n\ncalifornia\n\nthe california primary is far from over with more than 3 million ballots still left to count, according to estimates published by the california secretary of state. as of monday afternoon, cbs news estimates sanders leads with 33.9%, followed by biden at 26.6%. sanders so far is estimated to win 185 delegates while biden is at 143. cbs news campaign reporter musadiq bidar says the millions of ballots that remain unprocessed are because of last minute voters – those who either put their ballots in the mail on election day, or who voted in person but decided to change their party registration on the spot. this also includes ballots that were damaged, had typos, or required careful examination from a human election worker. in california, it typically takes counties weeks to process and count all of the ballots. according to the secretary of state's office, los angeles county, the most populous county in the state, has more than 800,000 ballots that still need to be counted. san diego county has about 350,000 remaining ballots, roughly 200,000 remain unaccounted in sacramento county while more than 100,000 need to be counted in san francisco county. state law requires county elections officials to report the final results to the secretary of state by april 3, 2020. the secretary of state has until april 10, 2020, to certify the results of the election.\n\ncongressional coverage\n\nin the senate\n\ngovernor steve bullock announced monday morning he will be running for the u.s. senate, reports cbs news political unit associate producer eleanor watson. democrats have had their eyes on bullock as a potential candidate to take on republican incumbent steve daines in november. bullock has won statewide three times and won his second term as governor of montana in 2016, the same year donald trump carried the state by about 20 points. a popular democrat in a red state would give democrats a chance at expanding the map for senate battlegrounds in 2020. bullock was reluctant to run for senate at first because he wanted a more executive role, so he launched a presidential bid in may. he told cbs news political correspondent ed o'keefe around the time of his announcement that his experience has always been executive, and i think that's where i could best apply my talents, and that's what i'm looking forward to. bullock suspended his presidential campaign after seven months without gaining traction in the polls. in the interview in may, bullock also told o'keefe, i know that we're going to have good candidates in montana to take on senator daines. however, no strong candidate emerged in the months leading up to monday's filing deadline. the deadline to submit candidacies to the secretary of state's office is monday evening. bullock plans to file with his wife and children by his side at the secretary's office in helena.
new york - walmart (wmt) is replacing a program that offered free shipping but had an annual fee with one that has a lower free shipping threshold and faster delivery. the change aims to answer amazon's (amzn) powerful prime membership success.\n\nthe retailer said it will reduce shipping time to two days on 2 million of its most popular items, including essentials like diapers and pet food as well hot toys and electronics. walmart's average shipping time has been three to five days. starting tuesday morning, it's also reducing the spending necessary for free shipping to $35 from $50.\n\nwalmart's shippingpass had allowed members to buy more than a million items for free shipping at walmart.com. last year, it trimmed its shipping time frame to two days from three, and it cut the annual fee by a dollar to $49. bentonville, arkansas-based walmart said the service worked well, but that it concluded shoppers shouldn't have to pay a membership fee for free shipping.\n\nthe strategy shift is one of the first big moves by walmart.com's ceo mark lore, who joined the company when walmart bought online retailer jet.com last year. and it's an illustration of how walmart is trying to figure out a way to compete with amazon and its dominant prime plan.\n\namazon's membership program costs $99 a year, but it includes services like streaming music and video that have created fierce loyalty. analysts say amazon prime members buy more frequently and spend more money. amazon doesn't disclose a prime subscriber total, but it's estimated to be around 65 million. walmart wouldn't say how many shippingpass subscribers it had, but all will receive a refund of their membership fee.\n\nlore declined to comment on amazon, but said lower prices, a wider assortment of eligible goods and faster shipping alone can build loyalty. lore promised more moves ahead to spur walmart's online business.\n\ntwo-day, free shipping is table stakes, he said in a conference call monday. we've upped the ante. on a very fundamental level, we don't have to charge for membership. we can save customers both time and money.\n\nlore said he believes the new approach will dramatically increase sales. walmart's online sales had been slowing over the past two years, but notably accelerated during last year's third quarter. walmart reports fourth-quarter results next month.\n\nwalmart said purchases outside the 2 million essentials will count toward free shipping, but won't get the faster delivery.
london — bárbara delgado, a trans woman and health outreach worker, was distributing food near her home in panama last week when she was detained by police for being out on the wrong day under the government's new, gender-based quarantine rules, the rights group human rights watch told cbs news.\n\nto slow the spread of covid-19, the government of panama on april 1 imposed new lockdown measures that only allow men and women to leave their homes on alternate days of the week. mondays, wednesdays and fridays are for women. tuesdays, thursdays and saturdays are for men. no one can go out on sundays.\n\nauthorities have the power to confirm a person's gender identity — and thus, whether they are in violation of quarantine — by checking their official documentation. in panama, trans people can't legally change their sex unless they have had sex reassignment surgery, so many trans people, like delgado, are stuck in limbo .\n\nshe was treated differently from the other people that were out\n\nin addition to only being able to go out on certain days determined by gender, each person has allocated times they are permitted to leave their homes that are based on their national id numbers. on the first day of the lockdown, delgado had not yet been issued a transit pass by the clinic where she worked, and was stopped by the police for being out outside of her allotted window, along with three others.\n\nthe others, who had not been doing volunteer work, were told to go home by police. delgado, however, was brought back to the station.\n\nshe was treated differently from the other people that were out, cristian gonzález cabrera, an lgbt researcher at human rights watch, told cbs news.\n\nshe was brought to the police station, and she was there for three hours, where she also suffered more discrimination at the hands of the justice of the peace, because he also accused her of not being a woman, cabrera said.\n\ndelgado was eventually released after paying a fine equivalent to $50.\n\ntrans woman bárbara delgado was detained by police for violating panama's gender-based quarantine. bárbara delgado via human rights watch\n\nyou're damned if you do, damned if you don't\n\nthat shows how trans people are treated differently in panama in the context of this gender-based quarantine, cabrera told cbs news.\n\nsince the lockdown came into effect in panama, cabrera has documented three more cases of trans people being discriminated against because of the gender rules.\n\nthey all left (their homes) on the day dictated by the gender marker on their id, but when they tried to go to the supermarket in two of the cases and the bank in one case, they were met with discrimination by either police officers or security agents, cabrera said.\n\npanama hasn't issued any guidance for what trans or non-binary people should do in the context of the gender-based quarantine rules, but cabrera hopes it will.\n\nbárbara went out on the day for women even though her id says male. the other transgender people actually went out on the day dictated by their id and they also suffered discrimination. so you're damned if you do, damned if you don't in this context, he said.
the federal reserve took emergency action sunday and slashed its benchmark interest rate by a full percentage point to nearly zero to try to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak. in another move to boost growth, the central bank also said it would purchase $700 billion in treasury and mortgage-backed securities to encourage lending.\n\nthe fed said in a statement that the effects of the outbreak will weigh on economic activity in the near term and pose risks to the outlook. policy makers said they will keep rates at nearly zero until they are confident the economy has weathered the storm, which a number of economists say could push the u.s. into recession.\n\nthese are strong measures, fed chairman jerome powell said in a rare sunday news conference, warning that growth in the second quarter would be slow. the virus will run its course and economic activity will resume. in the meantime, we will act to support the flow of credit to companies and individuals.\n\nthe fed also said that it was working with central banks around the world, including the european central bank, the bank of canada, the bank of japan and others, in a coordinated effort to make it easier for financial institutions to trade currencies and get u.s. dollars.\n\nthe fed's latest move to ease borrowing costs, which followed another emergency cut on march 3, is one of the most drastic steps the central bank has taken since the depths of the 2008 financial crisis. it is an effort to loosen up the country's monetary supply and stimulate to try to counter the coronavirus's growing damage to the u.s. economy and global financial markets.\n\npaul ashworth, chief u.s economist with capital economics, said the fed cuts resemble its actions to shore up the economy during the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.\n\nso now we have the entire crisis playbook enacted before asian markets open — with the fed doing everything in its power, not just to support economic activity, but to keep the financial system afloat and keep credit flowing to affected households and businesses, he said in a research note.\n\nthe fed had been expected to take action at its scheduled meeting on wednesday. but its preemptive move underlines policy makers' concern at how quickly the virus is shutting down key sectors of the american economy, including travel and sports.\n\npresident donald trump, who has repeatedly attacked powell for his handling of monetary policy, said in a news conference on sunday at the white house that the fed's latest cut makes me very happy.\n\ni think that people in the markets should be very thrilled, mr. trump added.\n\ninvestors, by contrast, seem less than thrilled, even with the fed taking extraordinary measures to support the economy. u.s. stock futures fell more than 4% sunday evening after the rate cut announcement.\n\nthe fed's latest move does not change our expectation that the economy will slow dramatically in the near term, rubeela farooqi, chief u.s. economist with high frequency economics, told investors in a report.\n\nwith the virus' spread causing a broad shutdown of economic activity, the fed faces a daunting task. its tools — intended to ease borrowing rates, facilitate lending and boost business and consumer confidence — aren't ideally suited to offset a fear-driven halt in spending and traveling.\n\nwe have been urging this action for some time and we're very happy that the fed did not wait until wednesday's meeting, said economist ian shepherdson, chief economist of pantheon macroeconomics. in one line: great news, but not enough on its own.\n\nshepherdson said congress and the white house may need to consider at least $1 trillion in emergency spending to help support small and mid-sized businesses, the self-employed and millions of households under varying levels of quarantine facing the prospects of months of little to no business or income. this could include financial help for the nation's travel and hospitality industries, which have seen unusual plunges in business in barely two weeks.\n\nthe fed's actions may amount to a recognition that the u.s. economy faces its most perilous juncture since the recession ended more than a decade ago.\n\ni think the fed has to bring the big guns, said gennadiy goldberg, senior u.s. rates strategist for td securities.\n\nseparately, treasury secretary steven mnuchin said earlier sunday that both the central bank and the federal government have tools at their disposal to support the economy.

edinburgh -- meghan markle and prince harry are making their first official trip to scotland this morning.\n\nthe soon-to-be-royal couple's visit will include a stop at a café that helps support the homeless. it's called social bite, and the work being done there has already attracted attention from hollywood royalty.\n\nas cbs news correspondent charlie d'agata reports from edinburgh castle, the biting north wind did little to chill the enthusiasm of scores of scots who came out to welcome the prince and his bride-to-be to the scottish capital.\n\nthe iconic castle provided the stage, and the royal marines scotland band the soundtrack to the couple's first official joint visit north of the english border.\n\ntheir next stop was to be the considerably less grand, rather unremarkable looking social bite café. but the little diner has done some pretty remarkable things for the homeless.\n\nas d'agata reports, ms. markle is not the most famous hollywood star to visit, with george clooney and leonardo dicaprio already counted among social bite's fans. but while founder josh littlejohn had courted the hollywood royalty, the request from actual royalty came as a surprise.\n\njust got an email saying prince harry and meghan markle are planning to visit edinburgh on this particular day and can they come and visit social bite, littlejohn told cbs news. his reaction? wow!\n\na staff member at the social bite cafe in scotland serves customers at the eatery where homeless people are not only fed, but given jobs, feb. 13, 2018. cbs\n\nhis restaurants not only feed the homeless, but employ them too, and all profits go toward helping people facing a similar plight.\n\ncatering assistant sonny murray used to be a heroin addict.\n\ni would still be jumping about and getting into trouble and getting put in prison, things like that, he told d'agata. so for social bite to give me a chance of having a job… it's totally changed my life.\n\nthe ability to change lives is one reason convincing george clooney to sprinkle a little stardust, to raise the charity's profile, wasn't too hard for littlejohn.\n\naccording to the café boss, clooney was just unbelievably charming and funny, and had the whole staff in stitches. i've never experienced anything like that, with all the women queuing from six in the morning, screaming.\n\nand while that spotlight helped prince harry and meghan take notice, battling homelessness is an issue the couple already held close to their hearts.
oprah winfrey delivered a much-acclaimed speech on behalf of the time's up campaign at last sunday night's golden globes. a 60 minutes special contributor since last fall, she takes stock this morning with other members of the movement. we're delighted to welcome her to sunday morning:\n\neven before the first award was handed out at last sunday's golden globes, the time's up campaign had already won the night.\n\ntime's up -- which began as a meeting of hollywood women last fall to address sexual harassment in the workplace -- has become a movement for victims everywhere. stars wore black as a sign of unity, and for one dazzling moment, the fight against harassment and gender inequality was center stage.\n\nbut now what?\n\non the rainy southern california day after the globes, winfrey gathered some of the women who helped start it all.\n\nfirst questions: who is the head of the group? and is it an organization? a movement? at this moment it's a campaign, said tracee ellis ross, star of black-ish. and we're all sort of workers among workers and women among women, sort of rolling up our sleeves and doing whatever sort of comes to the forefront.\n\noprah winfrey moderates a panel discussing the time's up campaign. cbs news\n\nwell, how do you get things done with no leader? winfrey asked.\n\nwell, we're women! ross replied.\n\nand what exceptional women they are: lucasfilm president kathleen kennedy, the force behind the star wars movies; mega-producer shonda rhimes, creator of hit tv shows including grey's anatomy and scandal; entertainment attorney nina shaw; and actresses ross, america ferrera, natalie portman, and reese witherspoon.\n\nwinfrey asked, beyond raising awareness, how is this going to help the waitress, the farm worker, the factory worker, the caregiver? how does what's happening in the room with time's up affect the people who are watching this right now?\n\nwe have to maintain the momentum of this conversation, because they can't, said kennedy. it's not only in what we're doing with a group like time's up, but it's in the content we're creating, the conversations we're having. we have to continue this work because we do have the spotlight.\n\nand they also have the money: the $16 million time's up legal defense fund can help female harassment victims get a lawyer, if they need one.\n\nwinfrey asked, there's so many men and women now who are uncomfortable in their workplaces because of all that's been uncovered and aren't just really sure how to be. what do we say to them?\n\nnatalie portman cbs news\n\nwe're humans; we're all humans, said portman. and i think it's treating people as fellow humans … it's not because you have a daughter that you respect a woman, it's not because you have a wife or a sister, it's because we're human beings, whether we're related to a man or not. we deserve the same respect. we have an instinct about how to treat our fellow human beings.\n\nwinfrey asked, were there those of you who joined because you were also a woman who could say, 'me too'?\n\nyes, replied witherspoon, who has spoken of being assaulted on one of her first movies, at age 16. i have been very open that i was assaulted.\n\nferrera had also posted a me too message: i posted vaguely about an incident of when i was nine years old being assaulted by a man who i was then sort of forced to see afterwards for a long time. and what struck me about my experience was his certainty that i would be silent. and he was right. he was right for 24 years.\n\nwinfrey asked about a series of tweets by dylan farrow during last weekend's golden globes:\n\ni thought it would make a difference. i thought things would change. i learned quickly (and painfully) that my optimism was misplaced. his time wasn't up. /2 — dylan farrow (@realdylanfarrow) january 7, 2018\n\nwhat would you want to say to her?\n\ni hope so, said rhimes. you know, i'll be honest. i don't know about anybody else, but i hope so.\n\nkennedy added, i'd like to believe that time's up for silence. we can start there.\n\nportman added, i believe dylan. i would want to say that: 'i believe you, dylan.'\n\nkathleen kennedy cbs news\n\nit should be noted that allen has denied dylan's allegations, and following two investigations, no charges have ever been filed against him.\n\nstill, the larger issues remain.\n\nferrera said, i think a big part of this, too, is not just changing the written rules but the unwritten rules. i think what we are experiencing right now is a tectonic shift underneath our feet, where women, and men, are feeling like we can no longer not say the truth. and when the truth is said, there is maybe a ripple in our culture right now that is going to allow for there to be a change.\n\ni feel like there's a constructive fury that has resulted in a resolute pursuit of equity, ross said. there's this, as you said, that tectonic shift, and then, like, something has galvanized, that we're all like, this is not just my hurt, this is more than my hurt, this is not just my anger, this is our anger. and instead of it just being a feeling, it's becoming an action.\n\ni have heard the confusion about the difference -- or people are afraid to even say there's a difference -- between inappropriate behavior [and] inappropriate comments, and sexual assault and sexual predators and rape, winfrey said. there is a difference.\n\nthere is a difference, but there's a culture [where] one part of it supports the other, ross replied. there's an understanding of consent and respect that i think has gotten very confused in our culture that has set up a space that can make all of that happen.\n\nshaw said, in my business, in my law firm, several people have come to me and said, 'i just don't know what to say. i just don't know what to do.'\n\nnina shaw cbs news\n\nand i said, 'you know the difference between right and wrong. is it a conversation that you would be comfortable going home at night and telling your wife or your mother that you had?' if you are uncomfortable in telling them about this conversation, then you shouldn't have it.\n\ndo you think some men need some re-learning? winfrey asked.\n\noh, yes, was the collective response.\n\nross added: the thing that's always surprising to me: i am a strong, outspoken, powerful woman, and there are places and ways and times that i am even afraid to speak up. there are environments that we all work in that support a culture of harassment or a culture of any of those things … inappropriateness under the guise of humor, under the guise of all these things, or, 'i'm just complimenting you,' all of those kinds of things. and it's like, 'why aren't you smilin', honey?' you know, all of those kinds of things that play into an overall idea of what the role that i'm supposed to be playing as a woman.\n\nand if it's scary for me to speak up … she laughed.\n\ntracee ellis ross cbs news\n\nwinfrey asked, the question, tracee, is: how is this measured? how do we make the punishment fit the crime for somebody who's saying, 'i was just complimenting you,' versus somebody who is actively a predator?\n\nmaybe there isn't an answer for that yet, ross replied.\n\nand once someone has been accused of this bad behavior, this inappropriateness, is there, do you believe, a path to learning and then overcoming those mistakes and doing better? is there? where is forgiveness in this?\n\nwitherspoon replied, i think there's a lot of room for reconciliation. i think there's a time to approach people and tell the truth and have them listen thoughtfully and meaningfully, and apologize sincerely.\n\nso, once somebody's been accused of sexual harassment and loses their job, should they ever work again?\n\ni'm not here to make that decision! witherspoon laughed.\n\njust having a conversation for the world! winfrey said.\n\nshonda rhimes cbs news\n\nbut this conversation, by the way, has caused a lot of arguments for me at dinner parties, said rhimes. there have been a lot of shouting across a lot of tables about this, because some people really feel like, 'no, that's it, that's it for them,' and some people feel like they're not so sure. i mean, i was raised in a world in which i believe that there has to be a belief that people can grow, change and learn and know better. i mean, not if you've committed a crime. i feel like you need to go pay, do you time for your crime. but i do believe people have to be able to grow, change and learn from their mistakes.\n\nat a certain point there has to be room for reconciliation in a world, in a weird way. but a lot of people don't think that right now -- and a lot of women have the right to not feel that right now.\n\namerica ferrera cbs news\n\nferrera said, speaking of this moment, as a culture we've gone from not listening, hearing or believing women, and how were we going to skip over the whole part where women get to be heard, and go straight to the redemption of the perpetrators? can't we live in that space where it's okay for perpetrators to be a little bit uncomfortable with what the consequences will be?\n\nwinfrey asked, can you speak to how the speaking out of your own truth and telling your story, 'cause i think i was in the room the very first time you shared your story, reese, and how has the speaking out of it actually led to a greater sense of empowerment and control over it?\n\nreese witherspoon cbs news\n\nwell, i don't know if i've gotten to that place yet, witherspoon replied. as you can see, i'm very emotional about it. but i keep going back to somebody sent me this elie wiesel quote that said, 'silence helps the tormentors, it doesn't help the tormented. and neutrality helps the oppressors, not the oppressed.'\n\nand there's moments that you have to evaluate whether silence is going to be your only option. and certain times that was our only option. but now is not that time.\n\nyou know, we have public voices. we have resources. but women who are workers in this country have nothing to gain in certain instances by coming forward. but we want to help. like, it gives me strength to hopefully help other women.\n\n\n\nfor more info:
with many u.s. cities in varying stages of shutdown for parts of 2020, travel was reduced — and so were greenhouse gas emissions. according to a report by the rhodium group, an economics and policy research provider, the drop in annual emissions was the nation's largest since the world war ii era.\n\nthe group tracked the real-time energy and emissions impact of the covid-19 pandemic throughout 2020. it estimates that the historic shock to economic activity led to a 10.3% drop in u.s. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. this finding is based on preliminary economic and energy data.\n\nthe reduction means the u.s. is now expected to exceed the target set in a 2009 u.n. agreement known as the copenhagen accord of cutting emissions 17% below 2005 levels, with 2020 instead hitting 21.5% below 2005 levels.\n\nhowever, it still falls short of the goal the u.s. set in the 2015 paris agreement of a 26% to 28% drop below 2005 emissions levels. while president trump pulled the u.s. out of the paris agreement in 2019, president-elect joe biden has vowed to rejoin it. still, even with 2020's reduced emissions levels, the u.s. does not appear to be on track to meet the agreement's 2025 goal as economic activity picks back up, according to rhodium group.\n\nthe report also notes that the decline in emissions came with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering.\n\nwe expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the us economy, emissions will likely rise again as well, the report says.\n\nrhodium group reported that three of the leading sectors for greenhouse gas emissions — transportation, electric power, and industry — were also among the sectors hardest-hit by pandemic-related shutdowns. for example, with travel far less in demand during the pandemic, emissions from the transportation sector declined 14.7% between 2019 and 2020.\n\nwhile the emissions decline was welcomed, the trend is not expected to last. unfortunately, 2020 tells us little about what we can expect to see in 2021 and beyond, the report says.\n\nif the pandemic and economic recession had never happened, the report estimates u.s. emissions would have dropped only about 3%, driven mainly by the decline of coal-fired power plants as well as lower heating demand due to a warmer winter.\n\nemissions also shrunk globally during 2020, with the world expected to see the largest yearly global decline ever — as much as 17%, according to an estimate by the world meteorological organization (wmo).\n\nbut by september 2020, the wmo was already reporting a rise back to nearly pre-pandemic levels.\n\nexperts say the short-term decline will not be enough to make a lasting impact on the acceleration of climate change.\n\nthe lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph, wmo president petteri taalas said. we need a sustained flattening of the curve.\n\nwmo also warned the shutdown's impact on the concentrations of co2 in the atmosphere was no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations.
if you've ever wondered how animals behave when humans aren't watching, spy in the wild offers a unique glimpse into the natural world. the 5-part pbs nature mini-series turns its lens on wildlife by placing incredibly lifelike animatronic cameras in their habitats and recording how members of the species interact.\n\ncbs news spoke with spy producer rob pilley about what went into making the more than 30 animal spy cams and some of the behind-the-scenes ups and downs of filming in such an unusual manner among crocodiles, hippos, elephants and other wild animals.\n\nwe've been making the 'spy' series for the past 16 years and this 'spy in the wild' is certainly the most advanced one, said london-based pilley.\n\nearly on in the series, the show embedded dung- and rock-shaped cameras in forests, fields and even icebergs, so they could secretly watch wild animals, hoping to capture behaviors the creatures might not demonstrate if they saw or sensed humans filming nearby.\n\nyou could get amazing images with the boulder and dung cameras. by being incognito, you could get under their feet and not be noticed. if we can use rocks and logs and pieces of ice and snow for penguins, we said that's all well and good, but what about if the camera was a penguin? said pilley.\n\nso they tried penguin-shaped cameras and suddenly the whole world shifted.\n\nwe weren't observing anymore, but we were part of it. suddenly we were being courted with by a male penguin, said pilley.\n\ntheir filming equipment for the current series has evolved by leaps and bounds to include animatronic orangutan, elephant, baby crocodile, meerkat, prairie dog, sloth, squirrel, baby hippo cameras and more.\n\nan animatronic spy cam in the making. © john downer productions\n\npilley said this time around, they wanted to focus on animal relationships – qualities human viewers might relate to, such as love, grieving, mischief and intelligence.\n\nall the major elements of human life. and we thought, what are animal subjects that would fit the bill the best? said pilley.\n\nscientific advisers helped them choose which species to feature, offering ethical guidance as well.\n\neach creature has been thought about a lot. we asked, what is it trying to achieve? how can it be done as ethically as possible? said pilley, who holds an undergraduate degree in zoology and a masters degree in biodiversity.\n\nwe asked them, how would the [real] animals work with spy creatures? and if the message was negative, we would not use it.\n\nfor instance, they considered creating a baby elephant camera, but elephants are highly intelligent and emotional and would have seen right through the masquerade, said pilley. a robotic baby elephant could upset a herd, the producers learned, so they created a spy egret instead, a type of bird that lives closely among elephants.\n\nrobotics experts and special effects pros collaborated with the producers to design and build the spy cams to make them appear as lifelike as possible while still able to perform their filming job. london animatronic designer john nolan played a big role, drawing on a background in model-making, prosthetic design, engineering and makeup. nolan has worked on the harry potter films and where the wild things are, to name a few.\n\nunlike working on fictional films, nolan said in a podcast on pbs.org that his team's challenge with spy was to basically cheat nature. first they studied animal movements closely, how the anatomy worked under their skin. then they moved on to sculpting the animal's naked form (free of fur and feathers) in clay. that sculpture is then used to create a fiberglass mold. they use 3-d technology to determine the metal parts they'll need to build the moving parts and then construct the robotic animal, adding motors to drive the movements. after that, the skin and feathers or fur is applied and a camera is installed in the model animal's eye.\n\ncreating an individual animal camera could take anywhere from 6 weeks up to 6 months. a worm-like grub was the easiest to make, while creating an authentic-looking orangutan was far more complicated.\n\nsometimes making it as lifelike as possible was challenging.\n\nyou can have an amazing robot that can walk well but as soon as you apply silicone glaze – the skins we use on various devices, some are made of silicone or latex – it can change the movement, said pilley.\n\nspy in the wild producer rob pilley with anamatronic hippo during a photo shoot for the pbs nature series. john downer productions\n\npilley said there was no more exciting yet anxious moment than when they went out into the wild to place their creatures in the environments where they would spy. the crew would head out before dawn or after dark – when animals were not around – to set things up and then they would retreat to a blind to watch remotely.\n\nwith the crocodiles, we were on a boat in the middle of the nile a couple of hundred meters away, he said.\n\nit's a nerve-wracking moment when the real-life animals approach the animatronic spy cams.\n\ntens of thousands of dollars were spent making the upper-end ones. as a result, when you do deploy them, you're very cautious, very wary. you always treat the spy creature as if their first deployment is their last. it's like stepping into space. what are the animals going to do to it? pilley said. a wi-fi signal sends back information telling the crew if the camera is still recording.\n\nsometimes the cameras break. one egg cam was stolen by a bird and dropped into the sea. numerous cameras shaped like crocodile eggs were destroyed in the process of filming a mother croc that was trying to help them hatch.\n\na real crocodile mother, any eggs that haven't hatched properly, the mother turns the egg inside her mouth. the eggs of a croc are like leather. so she turns it in her mouth and encourages the baby to pop out. the egg cams were made of fiberglass and carbon fiber and the mom thought they hadn't hatched and put them in her mouth and it resulted in them getting smashed. she was trying to help them hatch but it was a learning process for us, said pilley.\n\na spy cam filmed this real crocodile with baby in its mouth. richard jones / © john downer productions\n\npilley said the joy of doing this work is discovering never-before-seen behaviors in animals.\n\nwe are literally pioneering, stepping into this new world of animal behavior as if you are part of that behavior. filming this way, the whole world is our oyster. suddenly, the mind boggles and takes the viewer on this amazing journey.\n\nthe scientific community is enthusiastic about their work, too.\n\nevery series we make, we're embraced by scientists who say, hey you've just showed something we've thought about for years but have never proved before, pilley said.\n\nthe animal-inspired spy cams are not just gimmicks, he said. all are built as a filming tool to allow us to step into a particular behavior, to engage with the animals.\n\ndoes the producer have a favorite spy camera?

in a shocking upset that dramatically shifts the balance of power in washington, democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock are projected to defeat two republican incumbent senators in runoff elections in georgia, ensuring democratic control of the u.s. senate for the first time in six years. cbs news projected ossoff's win as supporters of president trump's stormed the u.s. capitol, forcing congress to delay counting the electoral college votes.\n\nossoff and warnock are the first democrats georgia has sent to the senate since 2005, another signal that georgia may be turning blue after president-elect joe biden won the state in november.\n\ncbs news projects warnock has defeated incumbent senator kelly loeffler, who was appointed to fill a vacancy in 2019 by georgia governor brian kemp. because this was a special election to replace former senator johnny isakson, who stepped down for health reasons, warnock will now complete isakson's term and run for reelection again in 2022.\n\ncbs news projects ossoff has defeated first-term senator david perdue, whose term expired on sunday, by a narrow margin after vote-counting continued into wednesday. they were two of the most expensive senate campaigns in history, with ossoff raising more than $139 million and warnock over $125 million, according to federal election commission records.\n\nossoff and warnock's victories hand democrats the narrowest possible majority in the senate, and mean the party will have control of both houses of congress and the white house for the first time in 10 years. this dynamic will make it easier for mr. biden to begin implementing his agenda upon entering office. senator chuck schumer, the current minority leader, is expected to replace senator mitch mcconnell as majority leader.\n\nas majority leader, president-elect biden and vice president-elect harris will have a partner who is ready, willing and able to help achieve a forward-looking agenda and deliver help and bold change to the american people, schumer said in a statement wednesday morning.\n\ndemocratic u.s. senate candidates rev. raphael warnock, left, and jon ossoff, right. mike segar / reuters\n\nalthough the transition period has been rocky, with president trump refusing to concede the election, a trifecta of power for democrats once mr. biden is inaugurated should smooth his way. it all but guarantees that mr. biden's cabinet nominees will be confirmed quickly, without a republican majority to delay the process.\n\nbut the democratic majority will be razor thin. democrats and republicans will each have 50 votes, with vice president-elect kamala harris casting any tie-breaking vote. democrats will have to work with republicans to pass any major legislation.\n\nfor now, republicans will still have some power because of the legislative filibuster, which means that they can kill legislation if democrats are unable to muster 60 votes to end debate on certain measures.\n\nwhen the senate majority leader or another senator seeks to end debate on a motion, he or she calls for unanimous consent to see if all 100 senators are willing to end debate and vote. if one senator objects, a cloture motion, which requires 60 votes, must be filed. if fewer than 60 senators support it, the bill fails.\n\nsome democrats have called for the elimination of the filibuster. many democrats support bills which almost certainly would not receive republican support, such as a measure to make washington, d.c., a state. however, many democrats don't want to get rid of the filibuster and fear it could set a dangerous precedent.\n\nthe senate has previously done away with the filibuster for judicial nominations, which allowed for the republican-led senate to approve hundreds of mr. trump's nominees to the federal bench without the 60-vote requirement. the republican majority in the senate had previously blocked dozens of president obama's nominations in the waning years of his term. with democrats in control of the senate, mr. biden will see his judicial nominees confirmed for the next two years at least.
dan kay, a former contestant on survivor: gabon, unexpectedly died on dec. 31.\n\nthe 40-year-old attorney, who was based in brookline, new hampshire, is survived by his two young children, reese elizabeth kay and jackson jax russell-reid kay, and his girlfriend, jennifer depietro, according to an obituary.\n\nkay competed on the season that aired in 2008, and at the time he told people that an early midlife crisis led him to the series. he had been practicing law in boston for five years and taking care of his investment properties, and he felt depleted by the hours and work.\n\ni had my midlife crisis early, he said. it was a big decision to change things up, but i think it'll be better for my life. he had sold his properties and left his job by the time he was on the show.\n\nkay led an active life. his obituary says, he enjoyed running, skiing, listening to music and attending crossway christian church. he also completed a half-marathon.
when a us army reservist found herself at the center of a conspiracy about the coronavirus earlier this year, her life was upended.\n\nhoax peddlers on the internet falsely claimed that maatje benassi was somehow the world's covid-19 patient zero. over time, conspiracy theorists posted at least 70 videos across multiple youtube channels claiming that benassi had brought the virus into the world. along with those videos came death threats, which benassi and her husband, matt, took seriously.\n\nbut at first, the couple did not know how to respond. trolls hiding behind aliases on the internet were almost impossible to find, and the benassis could not sue youtube for allowing the content to be posted because of a now-controversial law known as section 230.\n\nsince 1996, section 230 of the communications decency act has been a key legal shield for the tech industry. it protects any interactive computer service from liability for the content people post on their platforms. in other words, companies like facebook and youtube can't be sued if their users behave badly.\n\npoliticians and activists have blamed the law for enabling some of the worst activity on the internet. members of the tech industry, however, say the law is misunderstood — and a vital component for how the internet operates.\n\nstill shaken from their experience, the benassis are confident that something about the law must change.\n\nsection 230, when that was written, it was probably done with the intent that social media companies would police themselves in some manner, matt benassi told 60 minutes. and social media companies haven't done that very well. they need to police themselves quicker or the government needs to step in figure out some mechanism to make them liable, because making them liable would make them police themselves.\n\nwhy section 230 exists\n\nthe crux of section 230 amounts to one sentence: no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\n\nwhen congress first established the legislation, their goal was not for online platforms to be neutral outlets where anything goes. rather, they wanted the platforms to be able to make the judgments needed to moderate content—without risking liability. that's according to us naval academy cybersecurity professor jeff kosseff, who wrote the book the twenty-six words that created the internet, an in-depth look at the history of section 230.\n\nprior to section 230, distributors — like a newsstand or bookstore — were liable for what they sold only if they were able to know the material was illegal. companies that actually produced the material — book publishers or newspapers, for example — were liable because they controlled the content they created.\n\nin the early days of the internet, legal challenges against two service providers, compuserve and prodigy, showed the law needed to rethink that distinction when it came to the internet.\n\ncompuserve had decided not to regulate what their users posted, while prodigy employed moderators to validate content and clean up foul language. both companies were eventually sued because of content their users posted. compuserve was found not liable because it was solely a distributor, having no say over what its users posted. prodigy, however, did not receive the same immunity. because it actively moderated its content, the court decided it had taken a more editorial role, making its site more like a newspaper's letters to the editor.\n\nthe key precedent the suits set at the time was that online platforms could reduce their liability if they did not moderate users' content. section 230 was intended to change that.\n\nan addendum to section 230 known as the good samaritan clause allows platforms to remove content they find objectionable, even if that speech is protected by the first amendment. this leaves the policing of content to the discretion of websites themselves, while still protecting them from liability.\n\naccording to kosseff, congress did not want to overburden the then-fledgling internet industry with regulation.\n\nif a service just did not do any moderation, the idea, at least, was that people wouldn't really want to go to it because it would be filled with garbage, kosseff told 60 minutes. or if a site did too much moderation, consumers generally would say, 'well, i don't really want to use that site because they're deleting everything.' so, let the market decide.\n\nthe government is free to say, 'hey, this is how you should enforce hate. this is how you should enforce harassment.' we would follow those laws. but we don't see those laws. – youtube ceo susan wojcicki\n\ntoday, section 230 covers any website or app that hosts user-generated content. while this includes large, well-established platforms, such as facebook and twitter, it also applies to smaller websites, like local news websites that allow comments. as a result, kosseff argued, the law remains necessary.\n\nsection 230 is still important because the industry that's built is built around user content, he said.\n\nthe companies that want to become the next facebooks and twitters, they rely on section 230 heavily. their practices really could not exist how they do right now without section 230.\n\npoliticians on both sides want it amended\n\nmore than two decades later, the law has been linked to the proliferation of some of the worst corners of the internet, including hate speech, violent videos, foreign trolls, and revenge porn. public pressure is increasing to limit the broad leeway online platforms currently enjoy under section 230, and politicians on both sides of the aisle want to take up the charge.\n\ndemocrats say section 230 has not done enough, allowing, for example, platforms like facebook to become a place where foreign governments disseminate propaganda without consequence. republicans feel the law has gone too far, arguing that, because section 230 allows companies to judge what content violates their terms of service, they use it to censor conservative viewpoints.\n\npresident-elect joe biden last year said section 230 should be revoked, immediately should be revoked in an interview with the new york times. since then, he has not made many comments about the law, except to respond to an executive order signed by president donald trump in may. the executive order requested regulators reinterpret the breadth of section 230 and clarify when its liability protections apply.\n\njoe biden understands that no president should use executive orders as menus to abuse the power of the presidency, biden campaign spokesperson bill russo told buzzfeed news at the time. vice president biden believes that social media companies should be held accountable for disseminating content they know to be false, just as any other private company would be.\n\nhowever, while biden himself has not said much about section 230, the man he has tapped to be his deputy chief of staff has been vocal in his opposition to the law. bruce reed, who was biden's chief of staff when he was vice president, co-authored an essay calling section 230 an irresponsibility cloak.\n\nwashington would be better off throwing out section 230 and starting over, reed wrote last month, along with co-author james steyer, the ceo of common sense media. the wild west wasn't tamed by hiring a sheriff and gathering a posse. the internet won't be either. it will take a sweeping change in ethics and culture, enforced by providers and regulators. \n\nreed's perspective of section 230 will likely influence the incoming white house team. according to reporting by the new york times, reed is leading biden's team of tech advisers.\n\nthe current occupant of the white house, meanwhile, has made his disdain for section 230 known. in addition to his executive order earlier this year, president trump tweeted about the law in the run up to the election, writing repeal section 230!!! last month, he vetoed a defense spending bill because it did not include a provision to repeal the law.\n\nthe house of representatives and senate both later voted to override the veto.\n\npresident trump's ire for section 230 stems, in part, from his belief that it unfairly allows platforms like twitter to label his tweets about the election when they include unsubstantiated or false information. however, section 230 also allows twitter to host trump's tweets without the risk of being sued over their content.\n\na staunch republican ally of the president, south carolina's sen. lindsey graham last month introduced a bill that would repeal section 230 in two years, unless congress acts to change it.\n\nthe time has come for these largely unregulated big tech giants to either be broken up, regulated, or subject to litigation for their actions, graham said in a press release. it's time we put the section 230 protections these companies enjoy on the clock.\n\nwhere the tech industry stands\n\nnot everyone stands for the repeal of section 230, which the electronic frontier foundation calls the most important law protecting internet speech.\n\nsen. ron wyden and former rep. chris cox, who wrote the law's language in 1996 when they were both congressmen, wrote an op-ed in the usa today last month to defend section 230. getting rid of the law, they explained, would return us to the legal no-man's land that prohibits even good samaritan censorship.\n\nit would also force every website hosting user content to create round-the-clock legal and editorial review teams staffed with hundreds or thousands of people to continually monitor every message, video, photo, and blog, they wrote. alternatively, websites would face exorbitant legal damages at every turn. that is not realistic.\n\nleaders in the tech industry also want to see a version of the law remain. the senate commerce committee in october summoned the ceos of facebook, google, and twitter to testify in a hearing about reforming section 230, during which republican senators argued for stripping the protections granted to web companies by the law.\n\nappearing remotely, the tech giants addressed the proposed changes. facebook ceo mark zuckerberg said congress should update the law to make sure it's working as intended, while the chiefs of twitter and google cautioned lawmakers about making changes.\n\nas you think about how to shape policy in this important area, i would urge the committee to be very thoughtful about any changes to section 230 and to be very aware of the consequences those changes might have on businesses and customers, google ceo sundar pichai testified in his opening remarks.\n\ntwitter's jack dorsey highlighted that the law enables tech companies to police harmful content. undermining section 230 will result in far more removal of online speech and impose severe limitations on our collective ability to address harmful content and protect people online, he said.\n\nin an interview with 60 minutes in november 2019, youtube's ceo susan wojcicki also highlighted the importance of section 230 in shaping today's online experience.\n\nit's basically enabled the internet as we know it, wojcicki said. it's enabled us to have people upload content, not have every single comment be reviewed, not every single video be reviewed. and so, it has enabled new types of communication, new types of community, new types of content that we just wouldn't have had beforehand.\n\nthe freedom of that open platform enables users to upload some 500 hours of video to youtube every minute, according to company estimates. but with all that content, youtube's system for monitoring has come under scrutiny.\n\nduring the 2016 presidential campaign, youtube failed to detect more than 1,100 videos that russian trolls posted, almost all intended to influence african americans. when a white supremacist in march 2019 killed dozens of muslims in christchurch, new zealand, he live-streamed the video on facebook. that video was then uploaded on youtube tens of thousands of times.\n\nwojcicki said the good samaritan clause of section 230 enables her employees to remove hateful content, like the christchurch shooting video, from her site. she also said that, if congress were to pass further laws limiting what content youtube can host, the company would comply.\n\nhonestly, if there [were] laws that said, 'this is the type of content you can't have,' then we remove it… wojcicki said. we are making a decision to be responsible because we think it's important for our society right now. and we're allowed to do that because of section 230. and so, the government is free to say, 'hey, this is how you should enforce hate. this is how you should enforce harassment.' we would follow those laws. but we don't see those laws. those laws aren't out there right now.\n\nthe video at the top of the page was edited by will croxton. the embedded video was produced by brit mccandless farmer and will croxton, who edited it.
a local official is criticizing tennis players for complaining about conditions after dozens were being forced to hard quarantine after arriving in melbourne for the australian open.\n\nwhile no player has tested positive for the virus, daniel andrews, who is the premier of victoria, the home of the tournament, said in a news conference monday that they're not getting any preferential treatment.\n\ni know that there's been a bit of chatter from a number of players about the rules, andrews said. well, the rules apply to them as they apply to everybody else, and they were all briefed on that before they came. and that was the condition on which they came. so there's no special treatment here, people have been treated, because the virus doesn't treat you specially, so neither do we.\n\norganizers for the tournament said 72 players will have to face longer self-isolation periods because five people who were on separate charter flights with the athletes tested positive for coronavirus. this drew ire from some stars, including no. 12-ranked belina bencic and no. 13-ranked yulia putinseva, who claim they weren't warned prior to traveling to the country.\n\nmen's singles world number one tennis player novak djokovic of serbia sits on his hotel balcony in adelaide on january 18, 2021, one of the locations where players have quarantined for two weeks upon their arrival ahead of the australian open tennis tournament in melbourne. brenton edwards / getty images\n\nandrews also responded to an unconfirmed report that novak djokovic, an eight-time australian open champ, listed demands to change the quarantine conditions for players. djokovic reportedly wanted permission to visit a coach or physical trainer if they test negative and move players to private homes with tennis courts to train.\n\npeople are free to provide lists of demands but the answer is no, andrews said.\n\naustralian open organizers said 17 charters flights from seven international destinations brought up to 1,200 people to australia for the tournament, all arriving within a 3s6-hour period up to saturday morning. australia has some of the toughest coronavirus restrictions in the world, limiting international travel into the country and leaving around 40,0000 australians, officials say, stranded across the globe.\n\nmany voiced anger online that tennis players entered the country while many australians remain abroad.\n\nmuch of the reason we have #strandedaussies is @danielandrewsmp gov failings, one user said. if they could make room for tennis entourages, they could make a lot more room for residents & citizens.\n\nwhy are so many getting outraged about tennis players arriving and going through quarantine ahead of the #australianopen? we've had football, rugby, netball, and cricket players arrive and go through quarantine. this is what quarantine is meant to do. — charlie jackson 🖤❤🖤 (@charliejjj73) january 18, 2021
new york - starbucks (sbux) is retreating from teavana tea bars that first opened in new york city a little more than two years ago and mimicked the coffee chain's namesake stores, except with tea.\n\nthe company says it will convert the three tea bars in new york city to starbucks stores this spring and close another location in beverly hills. a fifth location in seattle near its headquarters will remain open as a way to test new ideas. the stores served made-to-order tea drinks and some food items, with places to sit much like at starbucks stores.\n\nthe closure of the tea bars will not affect the more than 350 teavana retail locations, which primarily sell packaged teas and appliances, the company said. starbucks acquired the teavana chain in late 2012, noting the rapidly growing tea market globally.\n\nwhen the first tea bar location opened in new york city about a year later, ceo howard schultz had said the store elevates the tea experience in the same way we've done for coffee. the company had said it planned to transform more teavana stores into such locations.\n\nit isn't the first time starbucks has retreated from an idea it once touted as having major potential. this past june, the company also said it was closing all its more than 20 la boulange cafes. starbucks had also bought la boulange in 2012 and said at the time it planned to give the small san francisco-area chain a national presence.\n\nstarbucks has since incorporated both the teavana and la boulange brands onto the menus of its flagship starbucks stores.\n\nstarbucks corp. representative christina mcpherson said friday the closure of the teavana tea bars does not change the company's commitment to tea. she said the idea is to instead provide tea options through starbucks stores, which have a bigger footprint.\n\nthe conversion to starbucks stores in new york city will start in april, she said. she said the beverly hills location will close later this year, but did not provide a timeline.
when high times was founded in 1974, a multi-million sale of the magazine would have seemed like a pipe dream.\n\nin a deal that values the company at $70 million, an investment group that includes legendary ganga guru bob marley's son has bought a controlling interest in high times. the magazine for decades has separated the stems and seeds from the leaves when it comes to showing people the best ways to grow, roll and consume the finest blends of marijuana.\n\ndamian junior gong marley, whose forthcoming reggae album is appropriately titled stony hill, is one of 20 investors who announced thursday they have acquired 60 percent interest in trans-high corp., owner of high times, its digital platforms and its popular cannabis cup trade shows.\n\nthc (the acronym is the same as that of marijuana's key ingredient) will be renamed high times holding co.\n\nit's an exciting day, said adam levin, the company's new ceo. we have really the largest brand in cannabis, really the trusted brand, that we've been able to acquire at a time when obviously legalization trends are burgeoning and the industry as a whole is exploding.\n\nthe purchase price wasn't revealed but levin, whose los angeles-based investment firm, oreva capital, put the deal together, said the company is valued at $70 million.\n\nwith marijuana legal in some form in 26 states and the district of columbia, levin and his partners believe it's the perfect time to acquire the company with a mainstream brand name and a colorful reputation.\n\nthey could be right, says gabriel kahn, an expert on changing media trends and a professor at the university of southern california's annenberg school for communication and journalism.\n\nthe marijuana business is increasingly becoming professionalized and mainstream, kahn said. that opens up a space for a news outfit to lay claim to being the voice of the industry and establish credibility. any publication that can pull that off can create a lasting business.\n\nalthough high times has competitors, levin says he's confident it will prevail because of its reputation.\n\nellen komp, deputy director of the california's chapter of the national organization for reform of marijuana laws, agrees the magazine has credibility in the pothead community.\n\ni respect their reporting, she said. their editors have been more aggressive about fact-checking than other cannabis publications.\n\nwhile many magazines have struggled in recent years, high times says it has retained a loyal print subscriber base of more than 200,000 with millions more following it online.\n\na recent edition contains such consumer-friendly stories as where to find the most reasonably priced pot and how to prepare the tastiest edibles. other stories offer tips on growing and pot-related political news.\n\nperhaps high times' most lucrative source of income, however, is its cannabis cup trade shows. what began as a single, somewhat clandestine meeting in an amsterdam hotel room in 1988 has grown to 11 events this year. one is scheduled for this weekend in the san francisco bay area and one in southern california in february attracted 25,000 people.\n\nlevin sees expanding those shows to include such possible revenue sources as concerts and clothing lines.\n\nthat's a dramatic change from the early years of a magazine founded in 1974 by tom forcade with seed money he'd made from selling drugs. in the early years high times was often sold in the same plastic bags newsstands used to shield the covers of porn magazines.\n\nafter forcade killed himself in 1978, the new york times reported that staffers carried his cremated ashes to the top of new york's world trade center and smoked them.\n\nit was much more of a crazy, burgeoning pot smuggler magazine when it originated, levin acknowledged thursday.\n\nbut he added it's become the trusted brand of cannabis lovers.\n\nwe're the wine aficionado of the cannabis industry, he said, referring to the popular wine magazine.
boston red sox manager alex cora, a puerto rico native who has been outspoken about its need for hurricane relief, indicated thursday he may skip the world series celebration at the white house over president trump's policies toward the island.\n\ncora previously said he would make the traditional champion's visit to washington, slated for february 15, to argue for more help for the american island that was devastated by hurricane maria. but in the wake of reports this week mr. trump tried to redirect funds from puerto rico to florida and texas, cora repeatedly prefaced his comments on thursday with, if i go ....\n\nwe'll see what happens, cora said before the annual dinner of the boston chapter of the baseball writers' association of america. there's a lot of stuff going on right now as far as the government and the shutdown and all that. if i go, i'll represent puerto rico the right way.\n\nmanager alex cora of the 2018 world series champions boston red sox holds the commissioner's trophy as the boston red sox are honored before the game between the green bay packers and the new england patriots at gillette stadium on nov. 4, 2018, in foxborough, mass. getty\n\nonce a routine, non-partisan perk of winning it all, the traditional champions' visit to washington has become especially politicized lately, with some teams declining the invitation; in other cases, individual players stayed home.\n\nthe red sox have said they will go, while leaving it up to individual members of the organization.\n\nand cora wavered.\n\nright now i can say yes. it might change tomorrow, he said. it's not that i've changed my mind. but we'll see what happens in the upcoming days.\n\ncora said one issue is whether he can accomplish more by going or by staying home. he made it clear that he would not attend to make a scene, but to represent them the right way.\n\ni don't know what kind of platform i'm going to have if i go, he said. sometimes, if you walk the other way and you get your back to whatever is going on, is it positive? i don't know. sometimes you've got to show your face.\n\ncatcher blake swihart, infielder brock holt and pitcher ryan brasier all said thursday they were looking forward to a white house tour.\n\nit's not every day you can just walk into the white house, swihart said. so it's going to be a cool experience.\n\nthe most recent honoree was clemson's football team, which won the college national championship this month and visited mr. trump on monday. because of the federal government shutdown, mr. trump ordered in and served the tigers fast food: pizza, burgers and fries.\n\nthat's all my favorite foods, brasier said.
many americans in places where sports betting is legal for the first time are beginning to make wagers on the super bowl, including some bets on the performances of individual athletes.\n\nbut if the national football league had its way, bets on things like passing touchdowns for new england patriots quarterback tom brady or rushing yards for los angeles rams running back todd gurley would be restricted — or even outlawed as too risky and vulnerable to manipulation or cheating.\n\nproposition bets — also known as prop bets — are less popular during the regular season but gain steam during the super bowl each year as a way to bet on the outcome of more than one thing at a moment the sports world is intensely focused on a single game.\n\nin testimony before a u.s. house of representatives committee on sept. 27, nfl executive vice president jocelyn moore asked congress to let professional sports leagues and gambling regulators ban prop bets that involve the performance of individual athletes over the course of a game.\n\nexamples might range from the number of passing yards by a quarterback in a football game or the number of points or rebounds by a team during a quarter of a basketball game, to the number of 'throw-ins' in a soccer match, or even how many flags a referee might throw in a contest, she testified. these types of bets are significantly more susceptible to match-fixing efforts, and are therefore a source of concern to sports leagues, individual teams, and the athletes who compete.\n\nto address concerns regarding risky betting fixtures, we encourage congress to allow professional and amateur sports organizations to identify which types of bets simply pose too significant a risk to the integrity of sports and to work with regulators not to authorize them, she said.\n\nan nfl spokesman said last week there has been no change in the league's position since the september testimony.\n\njoe asher, ceo of william hill us, the american arm of the british bookmaker that runs several sportsbooks in this country, said the league's request is a solution in search of a problem.\n\nwe've been doing this for many years, and this issue is way overblown, he said. with the exception of the super bowl, player props are a tiny portion of the business — a fingernail on the world's biggest man.\n\nhe acknowledged such bets will make up a bigger proportion of super bowl gambling.\n\nprop betting on the super bowl is quite popular and keeps people engaged throughout the game, even if it's a blowout, he said. we've never seen evidence of a player prop being manipulated.\n\nmost sportsbooks also limit the amount of money that can be bet on player props to lessen the likelihood that cheaters would try to make a huge profit by conspiring with a player or referee to manipulate the outcome of such a bet. asher said william hill's limits vary, but typically restrict such bets to no more than $500 or $1,000.\n\nin sunday's football championship games, prop bets offered by william hill included bets on who would score the first touchdown of the game, ranging from 6-1 odds for sony michel of the patriots (he did score first) and damien williams of the chiefs, to 60-1 on gehrig dieter, a backup wide receiver for kansas city.\n\nbets were taken on whether brady would pass for more or less than 291 yards (he had 348); whether michel would get more or less than 79 rushing yards (he had 113); whether julian edelman would have more or less than six receptions (he had seven); whether chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes would have more than 315 passing yards (he had 295); whether kc tight end travis kelce would exceed six receptions (he had three), and whether chiefs receiver tyreek hill would exceed 84 receiving yards (he had 42).\n\nsimilar bets were taken on whether saints quarterback drew brees would complete more than 25 passes (he completed 26); whether saints running back alvin kamara would tally more than 107 combined rushing and receiving yards ( he had 111), and whether the rams' todd gurley would rush for more than 71 yards (he gained just 10).
editor's note: in this story, as originally broadcast, footage of the 2015 freddie gray street protests in philadelphia was mistakenly used. it has been replaced with footage of the freddie gray protests in baltimore.\n\non thursday, we learned president trump's former lawyer and fixer michael cohen, who is headed for prison, will testify in a televised hearing before the house oversight and reform committee. it marked the beginning of season three of what's been called the donald trump reality show with a fresh plot, and new characters ushered in by voters in the midterm election who gave democrats control of the house of representatives. among the recently empowered is congressman elijah cummings, the new chairman of the house oversight committee. it has the constitutional authority to investigate anything it wants, creating serious problems for the trump administration and making cummings one of the most powerful people in washington.\n\nelijah cummings has been a familiar face on capitol hill for a long time, a respected 13-term maryland congressman who has served on the oversight and reform committee under four different presidents. and he was handpicked by the democratic leaders for this job.\n\ncongressman elijah cummings\n\nrep. elijah cummings: we are in a fight for the soul of our democracy. and you've got to understand that. this is serious business.\n\nyou can dismiss the congressman's statement as partisan hyperbole, but part of the government is shuttered, four of president trump's former associates are now convicted felons, ten of his original cabinet secretaries have left, four under a cloud of scandal. and there are 17 other investigations underway. not counting the ones that are about to begin in the new democratic house of representatives empowered with the legal authority to compel testimony and demand documents.\n\nsteve kroft: so how are you gonna run this committee?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna try to work with the republicans as i have in the past. you know why? because that's our job. and when it comes to subpoena, i know the power of a subpoena, having practiced laws. in order to do oversight, you gotta have documents. you gotta have emails. you gotta have information.\n\nfor the first two years of the trump administration that kind of information was beyond the reach of house democrats. the power of subpoena belonged exclusively to the republican majority. as ranking democrat on the house oversight committee, cummings made 64 requests for subpoenas on things like white house security clearances, hurricane relief efforts in puerto rico, and the justice department's refusal to defend the affordable care act. all of them were blocked by the republican chairman.\n\nsteve kroft: you've asked the white house for a bunch of things. you've asked for documents connected to jared kushner's use of private emails. child separation policy at the border. have you ever gotten anything?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: zero.\n\nsteve kroft: nothing?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: zero. --that's the point. now, i-- i don't know if any president has ever done this. none. none that has ever said, i'm not givin' you anything. for anything. nothing.\n\nsteve kroft: but you're sitting here telling me you think somehow, miraculously, he's going to change.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: it's not about miraculous. it's about-- adherence to the constitution. and the american people and the congress is insisting that he allows us to do our job. basically what the president has done and the republicans have done, they've joined hands. and the republicans have been basically not only blocking but become the defense counsel for the president. okay. but no documents? i mean, come on.\n\ncummings with his wife, maya rockeymoore cummings, and speaker of the house nancy pelosi\n\nnow as chairman of the oversight committee, cummings no longer has to consult with the republicans to issue subpoenas, initiate investigations or call hearings, and he has a much bigger budget and staff. so will adam schiff, chairman of the house intelligence committee, and jerrold nadler, chairman of the judiciary committee, but their inquiries will be limited to their specific jurisdictions. cummings' committee has the authority to investigate anything inside or outside the federal government.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: we can look at anything.\n\nsteve kroft: you could--\n\nrep. elijah cummings: anything.\n\nsteve kroft: --look at interior, you could look at e.p.a.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: anything. but the fact that we can look at anything is part of the problem. there's so much. no, i'm-- i'm serious. there's so much.\n\nsteve kroft: and you only have two years.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: less than that. actually, less than that. the congress doesn't meet but so many days in a year. and all i'm saying is that we've gotta hit the ground, not running, but flying.\n\nsome democrats believe cummings should go for the jugular and push for impeachment. he says it's premature, and he also wants to pursue other issues especially the high cost of prescription drugs. his staff has already sent out 51 letters to government officials, the white house, and the trump organization asking for documents related to investigations that the committee may launch. the issues range from the private use of government owned aircraft by cabinet members to the flow of foreign money into various trump enterprises like his hotel in washington.\n\nsteve kroft: you think he's making money off this job?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: please.\n\nsteve kroft: a lotta money?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: a lotta money.\n\nsteve kroft: and-- and you say the constitution and the laws say it's not okay?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: it's not okay. and, but this is the other piece. i still believe that people-- the average citizen, the guys on my block, they oughta know if the president is making a deal, whether he's making it-- making it in his self-interest or that of the country.\n\nin response, the white house said: these claims are completely baseless, but we cannot comment further about ongoing litigation.\n\nelijah cummings has been in congress for 23 years but he is not a creature of washington. when he needs to be there he commutes from his maryland district, an hour's drive to the north, where he represents 700,000 people and most of the city of baltimore. he was born here 67 years ago to parents with fourth grade educations who'd been sharecroppers in south carolina before moving north for a better life. his father worked in a chemical plant, his mother was a domestic. both were pentecostal ministers.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: first it was religion, and then it was the education. my father, steve, had a saying. he said-- he told us, if you miss one day of school, that meant you died the night before. and he meant that. i did not miss one second of school between kindergarten and graduating from high school. not one second.\n\nhe graduated phi beta kappa from howard university before earning a law degree at maryland. he says he is one of the few congressmen who live in an inner-city, working-class neighborhood.\n\ncorrespondent steve kroft with cummings at the congressman's home in baltimore\n\nsteve kroft: how long have you lived here?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: 37 years.\n\nhe says he keeps a campaign poster in the front window so people will know where to find him.\n\nsteve kroft: so you like to be among your constituents?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: i like to be among my constituents. let me tell you something man, if i don't do well in this block i'm in trouble. i mean, if you wanna take a poll, if i lost in this block i might as well go-- i might as well stay home.\n\nwhen riots broke out in baltimore three years ago after the death of a young black man, freddie gray, who was fatally injured in the back of a police van, cummings gained national attention walking the troubled neighborhoods trying to keep the peace. he is part of the city's fabric.\n\nbut now he has stepped onto a much larger stage, under the bright lights of the oversight committee.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: well, i sit here. and the democrats'll be all over here. and the republicans will be over there. our hearings can go anywhere from an hour and a half to 11 or 12 hours.\n\nsteve kroft: so you got a good, comfortable chair.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: got a good, comfortable chair. and i gotta tell you, steve-- standing here, it just-- it sorta gives me chills in a way because i think about my journey to this chair.\n\nafter years as the committee's ranking minority member, he is ready to wield the gavel and the subpoena.\n\nsteve kroft: you've got a lotta power. but you don't have unlimited power. i mean--\n\nrep. elijah cummings: no.\n\nsteve kroft: --and the republicans are going to put a lot of obstacles in your way.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: sure. i expect that. now, there's one big elephant that's sittin' around here that we don't know-- what it's gonna yield. and that is mueller's report. i don't know what that report is gonna have in it. one thing i do know, though, is whatever it is, even if it-- if it exonerates the president, fine. but this i do know: i want whatever it is, for the congress to have it, and i want the public to have it, so that everybody can make a judgment.\n\nsteve kroft: do you think it's possible the republicans will try and suppress the report?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: i hope not. but that's a possibility. but i hope not. i hope they don't.\n\ncummings' republican foil on the committee is ohio's jim jordan, one of the president's most loyal and enthusiastic supporters.\n\nsteve kroft: you've known elijah cummings for a while. how would you describe your relationship?\n\nrep. jim jordan: well, look, there's-- there's not much of anything that-- that mr. cummings and i agree on, policy-wise. but-- i certainly respect his toughness-- his tenacity. you know, he's demonstrated that he's-- he's a fighter and i kinda-- my background is such that i kind of appreciate that.\n\na founding member of the freedom caucus, congressman jordan is a one-time college wrestler and coach, still known for his scrappiness. he's seldom seen wearing a jacket, and always ready to go to the mat.\n\ncongressman jim jordan\n\nrep. jim jordan: taxes have been cut, regulations reduced, the economy growing at an unbelievable rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years. 312,000 jobs added last month alone. gorsuch and kavanaugh on the courts. we're out of the iran deal. the embassy's in jerusalem. hostages are home from north korea.\n\nand oh, by the way, there's a new n.a.f.t.a. agreement. so it's an amazing record and that's what i know about the two years that we've had donald trump as president of the united states.\n\nsteve kroft: after the midterms, you wrote a letter to the republicans saying, you must valiantly defend the president. is that your job?\n\nrep. jim jordan: my job is getting to the truth. if the president is getting a raw deal i'm going to defend him.\n\nsteve kroft: i feel like i would be remiss in this if i didn't point out that truthfulness has not exactly been president trump's strongest asset.\n\nrep. jim jordan: well, i mean, steve, look, this-- this president's probably been attacked more than any president that-- in my lifetime. and here's what i know. over the last two years, in spite of the unprecedented attacks that have come against president trump, the last two years have been amazing.\n\nchairman cummings wouldn't disagree that the past two years have been amazing, but in a much different way.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: i don't think the other presidents-- called a lie the truth and the truth a lie. i-- i'm gonna tell you, that's what makes the relationship so difficult. it's hard to trust. you-- you wanna believe that if you make an agreement with someone, and i believed that with the other presidents it was this way, their word was their bond. i don't know how to compare. i-- i-- i don't. and i'm not tryin' to be smart.\n\nsteve kroft: we're in new territory here.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: yes, it's new territory.\n\nthe new territory now includes a beefed-up white house counsel's office. it has added more than a dozen new lawyers to fight what it anticipates will be a barrage of requests and subpoenas from congress.\n\nsteve kroft: what happens if you issue a bunch of subpoenas and the administration doesn't respond? or invokes executive privilege.\n\nrep. elijah cummings: we probably will end up in the courts. and one of the interesting things about the courts is that our president has been making sure that some of the most conservative judges are being p-- appointed-- to the federal bench. and i think he relies on that, and i think that he assumes that the courts will-- will possibly be, it all depends-- be helpful to him.\n\nit promises to be a demanding time for a man who spent nearly six months in the hospital over the last year and a half for heart and knee surgery. as he showed us the victory prayer chapel, a church founded by his mother, congressman cummings relied on a cane and a walker. he says his chairmanship will be a physical burden on him, but his strong faith and awareness of his mortality will see him through.\n\nsteve kroft: do you feel like you have the strength--\n\nrep. elijah cummings: oh yeah, man--\n\nsteve kroft: --and the stamina to do this?\n\nrep. elijah cummings: oh, i'm good. i'm good. like i tell my-- my constituents, don't get it twisted. you know, i may-- my knee may be hurtin' a little bit, but my mind is clear. my mission is clear. and i am prepared and able to do what i have to do. and i will do it to the very best of my ability, so help me god.\n\nthis story was produced by maria gavrilovic.

frankfurt, germany - the european central bank has left its stimulus program unchanged as it waits for the continent's political situation to settle down. on thursday it also refrained from signaling any plan to taper off its support for the economy despite evidence that growth is picking up sharply.\n\nthe stand-pat decision comes days ahead of the second round of france's presidential election, in which anti-euro candidate marine le pen is battling pro-eu front-runner emmanuel macron. a le pen victory on may 7 could unsettle financial markets since she has advocated taking france out of the shared, 19-country currency.\n\nthe statement from the central bank's 25-member governing council on thursday gave no fodder for additional market speculation that would ruffle financial markets, which already have enough on their minds with the french election. the statement omitted any hint of when the bank might taper off its extraordinary support measures.\n\nspeculation of such a taper has grown as surveys show the eurozone economy accelerating sharply this year. the latest such report was a measure of economic conference by the european commission, which hit its highest level in almost a decade.\n\nthe ecb does not seem to want to take any chances still. at 1.5 percent, inflation remains below the ecb's goal of just under 2 percent, and unemployment is elevated at 9.5 percent.\n\nits statement on thursday repeated past wording that indicates it even stands ready to increase stimulus if the outlook for growth and inflation worsens. analysts consider that wording a way of discouraging investors from speculating about the end of the stimulus -- which might prematurely drive up market interest rates, blunting its intended benefits.\n\nmarkets are waiting to see whether ecb president mario draghi drops any more hints at his post-meeting news conference. betting is that he may acknowledge that the economy is improving but stay away from clear hints about when the stimulus will end.\n\nthe 60 billion euros ($65 billion) per month in bond purchases push newly printed money into the economy in an effort to boost inflation, which is considered too weak at 1.5 percent annually. the ecb has trimmed the purchases, which started in march 2015, from 80 billion euros a month as of april. but it insists they will continue at least until the end of the year, and in any case until inflation shows signs of turning convincingly upward.\n\ndraghi has said they won't be suddenly shut off after that but instead gradually reduced, but has not said when that taper will start.\n\nprinting money and adding it to the economy can raise inflation, lower interest rates and make it easier for businesses to get the credit they need. it is considered an extraordinary step undertaken to keep europe from falling into a chronic spiral of falling prices after the shock of the debt crisis that started in 2009 with financial trouble in greece.\n\nthe eventual withdrawal of the stimulus will have a wide-ranging impact on businesses, governments, investors and consumers. an end to the purchases will let longer-term interest rates rise, meaning governments will have to spend a bigger part of their tax revenues on interest costs, while mortgage payments will tend to increase. higher rates would make it easier in some cases to save for retirements or fund a pension plan, and would make bonds and bank time deposits more attractive compared to stocks.\n\nthe ecb is lagging far behind the u.s. federal reserve, which is already raising interest rates after the u.s. economy recovered faster from the great recession. ecb officials have said they won't start raising benchmark rates until after the bond purchases end.\n\nseveral analysts think the central bank will change the wording of its statement in its june or july meetings to signal that the european economy is less in need of help. that could lead to an announcement in september on the timing of the taper to the stimulus.\n\nkey wording currently includes the bank's statement that economic risks are tilted to the downside, meaning it's more likely the economy and inflation will grow less than expected rather than more than expected. another key statement is the promise to increase the stimulus if things worsen.\n\nother stimulus measures include keeping the bank's interest rate benchmark at a record low of zero. that rate largely steers short-term rates and keeping it that low makes it cheaper for banks to borrow money on the interbank market, which in turn would mean in lower borrowing costs for businesses.\n\nthe ecb has also imposed a minus 0.4 percent interest rate on deposits it takes from commercial banks. that is in essence a tax aimed at pushing banks to lend the money rather than leave it at the ecb's super-safe overnight deposit facility.
rep. nancy pelosi is expected to be elected thursday as speaker of the house of representatives for the second time, cementing her legacy as one of the most effective female legislators in american history. in her prepared floor speech upon accepting the speaker's gavel thursday, pelosi will outline democratic policy priorities, including addressing income inequality and climate change. she's also anticipating a new dawn in the house after her party's net 40-seat gain.\n\nwhen our new members take the oath, our congress will be refreshed, and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class, she will say in her speech, according to prepared remarks. as speaker, she'll preside over the swearing in of new members of congress.\n\npelosi will say democrats must be pioneers of the future and accelerate a future that advances america's preeminence in the world by improving public education and workforce development. she also sounds a warning on climate change, calling it a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions.\n\nthis is a public health decision for clean air and clean water; an economic decision for america's global preeminence in green technology; a security decision to keep us safe; and a moral decision to be good stewards of god's creation, pelosi will say about the need for congress to combat climate change.\n\nhowever, before pelosi can achieve any of these goals, the partial government shutdown must end. president trump is refusing to sign any legislation which does not include funding for a border wall, which democrats in the house and senate are unwilling to provide.\n\nwe will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from – and in that spirit, democrats will be offering the senate republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today – to meet the needs of the american people, and to protect our borders, pelosi will say about the democrats' immediate agenda.\n\nshe'll also refer to the for the people agenda, which democrats campaigned on nationally, a package including bills on infrastructure, ethics reform, lowering health care costs and protecting those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nnancy cordes contributed to this report.
the miami marlins are looking very different this season, including at the top of the franchise where derek jeter now sits as co-owner and ceo. but the onetime new york yankees captain is facing more than just a new challenge. he's been dealing with some rare and harsh criticism for reducing the team's payroll by trading several of its top players, including national league mvp giancarlo stanton to his former team.\n\ncbs evening news anchor jeff glor spoke with the future hall of famer to talk about this next chapter in his life, and what's ahead both on and off the field.\n\njeter has taken the field thousands of times, but doing so as an owner is a different ballgame. a generation ago jeter stepped into the most storied franchise in sports and won five world series championships in 20 years.\n\nin miami, he's essentially starting over. he traded away national league mvp giancarlo stanton to his former team and removed a number of longtime employees. it has not been an entirely smooth transition.\n\nhonestly, i don't really pay much attention to it, man. i – i'm an optimist. you know, i'm positive by nature and i try to look at the fact that we do have an end game here, jeter said of the criticism his actions have garnered. everyone gets criticized.\n\nderek jeter cbs news\n\nbut this criticism is different than what the former player has fielded before.\n\nwell, i think it's easier to criticize, we haven't even played a game yet. right? the bottom line is we're trying to fix something that's been broken, he said.\n\njeter did retain the team's manager, another yankee legend, don mattingly. the two played together briefly in the 90s.\n\ni think we're probably fairly aligned as far as, you know, the way we think and about going about it, mattingly said. people are like, 'it's all yankee stuff.' well, it's not such a bad example. you know, it's not such a bad place to have come from and to have learned from.\n\nironically, the last time the marlins made the playoffs was in 2003 when they went all the way, against the yankees. jeter says he's still a fan of his former team -- unless the marlins are playing them.\n\ni mean, this is an organization where i owe everything to. and you know, i have a great relationship with the steinbrenner family, i will continue to do so, he said. but it's, yeah, it'll be strange when we play the yankees because there hasn't been a day in my life that i've rooted against them.\n\njeter has little idle time these days. he and his wife hanna just welcomed daughter bella six months ago.\n\nit's by far, the most gratifying thing i've ever been a part of, jeter said. because regardless of how your day went at work, when you get home, and you see a smile on your daughter's face, it makes it all worthwhile.\n\nit is his daughter's generation that he seems focused on – building baseball for the future and being exceedingly careful about discussing baseball's problems of the past.\n\nderek jeter and jeff glor cbs news\n\nroger clemens, barry bonds, those whose names have been associated with peds. should they be in the hall of fame? glor asked.\n\nit's a tough question, right? it's, you know, a question for if someone is accused, or someone has proven to do.... you know, some opinions change over time. some people are bullish on their opinions. it's tough.\n\nyou're dancing around this, glor said.\n\nwell, yeah, i am, you know why? because, you know, i've played with players, you know, you play with guys that you built relationships with over time and you get close to them, and you develop a bond, and people make mistakes. not saying you can condone those mistakes. people do make mistakes, but yeah, you're right, i mean, it is a tough question. and you know, i don't make those decisions, jeter said.\n\n\n\nof his legacy as an owner, jeter's committed to miami.\n\nthat we made this a fun place to come. that we built something that they can be proud of, he said. i didn't get into this to have an exit strategy. i'm here to do it….in miami.\n\n\n\nthe marlins are scheduled to play the yankees in spring training on march 11. it'll be worth the price of admission to see the former yankee captain on the opposite side of the field.
washington — the trump administration on monday began enforcing stringent income-based requirements for green cards and certain visas, instituting the most ambitious unilateral effort in recent history to change the nation's legal immigration system.\n\nafter multiple legal barriers blocking the implementation of the new requirements were cleared by the conservative-leaning supreme court, most green card applicants in the u.s. and abroad will now be subjected to a redefined public charge test. under the rules by the departments of state and homeland security, immigration officials have more power to deny applications from petitioners they deem are, or could become, an economic burden on the country.\n\nthe sweeping policy change, one of the administration's top immigration priorities, is expected to block the entry of hundreds of thousands of people, disproportionately affecting prospective immigrants from asia, africa and latin america, according to experts.\n\nsince it unveiled the final regulation last summer, the administration has portrayed it as a way to promote self-sufficiency among immigrant communities. (the rule) enforces longstanding law requiring aliens to be self-sufficient, reaffirming the american ideals of hard work, perseverance and determination, said ken cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary of the department of homeland security.\n\nimmigrant advocates and democrats, however, say the rule amounts to a wealth test that will revive a discriminatory immigration system that shuts america's doors to low-income and working-class immigrants from the developing world.\n\nin 1924, our policy explicitly made it much harder for people from some parts of the world than others to come here. there were country-based quotas and there were country-based categorical exclusions for asian immigrants, julia gelatt, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan migration policy institute, told cbs news.\n\ntoday, it's not quite as explicit, but by placing such drawn emphasis on people's income and income potential, by putting in place what is essentially a wealth test, this public charge rule could have some of the same impact of reshaping our immigration system to be more european and less latin american, gelatt added.\n\nsoon after its final version was published last summer, the rule was blocked in court, with one federal judge in new york calling it repugnant to the american dream. however, circuit courts subsequently lifted three of the four nationwide injunctions. the administration then turned to the supreme court, which lifted the remaining nationwide injunction last month, as well as a state-wide injunction in illinois on friday, allowing officials to enforce the policy on monday across the country.\n\nin a withering dissenting opinion on friday, justice sonia sotomayor expressed concern about the conservative majority's recent decisions allowing the trump administration to move forward with fundamental policy changes without cases being decided on merit.\n\nperhaps most troublingly, the court's recent behavior on stay applications has benefited one litigant over all others, sotomayor wrote in her opinion, noting the conservative jurists on the bench have repeatedly sided with the administration.\n\na broad and sweeping definition of public charge\n\nfor decades, the u.s. has asked most green card and visa petitioners to prove they won't be a public charge — or an economic burden — on the country.\n\nthe term dates back to a time period in u.s. history when the government actively sought to severely limit immigration from developing, non-white countries. it was first codified in u.s. law in 1882, the same year the u.s. enacted the discriminatory chinese exclusion act, which barred the entry of most chinese immigrants on the premise that they jeopardized the good order of certain localities.\n\nin the late 1990s, the clinton administration issued guidance saying only cash benefits could be considered when determining whether an immigrant could be a public charge. the trump administration's policy, however, substantially expands this centuries-old term by broadening the type and amount of benefits — as well as income-based factors — that count against immigrants seeking to stay or move to the u.s.\n\nthis certainly is a very broad and sweeping use of the public charge legislation, gelatt said.\n\nunder the new regulation, caseworkers would consider enrollment in the widely used supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), certain federally funded medicaid benefits and a variety of forms of government-subsidized housing, including the popular section 8 vouchers.\n\nofficials would deem an immigrant a public charge and deny the application if they determine he or she is more likely than not to use one of the considered benefits for 12 months or longer over the span of three years. on certain occasions, those deemed a public charge could post a bond for an amount no less than $8,100.\n\nto determine whether prospective immigrants are likely to become a public charge, caseworkers would also take into account their income, assets, age, educational skills, english language proficiency, health and other factors. since those expected to be affected by the rule are not eligible for most public benefits because they are not u.s. citizens or permanent residents, critics of the regulation say it is designed to severely restrict immigration based on those factors.\n\nadvocates have also denounced harmful effects the rule is having on people who are technically not directly affected by it but who are scared that the use of any public benefits might jeopardize their or their family's immigration cases. researchers have been documenting a chilling effect stemming from the proposed changes that has prompted fearful immigrant families, some with u.s. citizen members, to drop out of essential welfare programs.\n\nto curb this confusion and fear, advocacy groups and local officials have staged public awareness campaigns. organizations like the legal aid society, make the road new york and empire justice center have created tools for lawyers and advocates to advise and screen immigrants on the new requirements.\n\nthe implementation of the public charge rule today is a devastating blow for all americans. the rule is heartless, cruel, and betrays our core values as a nation of immigrants, kristin brown, president of the empire justice center, said in a statement. this public charge screening tool will guide community-based organizations in helping families make crucial decisions that may carry life-changing consequences.
with voters in 14 states preparing to head to the polls for super tuesday, joe biden's campaign has steadily rolled out a slew of high-profile endorsements in key states, consolidating support from the moderate and establishment wings of the democratic party after his decisive victory in the south carolina primary. cbsnews.com writer melissa quinn reports the floodgates seemingly opened saturday in the wake of biden's win in the palmetto state, which propelled him to second in the national delegate race, trailing bernie sanders by just two delegates. as the former vice president was projected to win the state just after polls closed, former virginia governor terry mcauliffe announced on cnn his support for biden, saying he has the best chance of winning the state in november. joining mcauliffe were fellow virginians senator tim kaine, congressman bobby scott and congresswoman jennifer wexton, who unseated a gop incumbent in 2018. also closing ranks around biden were congresswoman veronica escobar of texas, congressman gil cisneros of california and senator tammy duckworth of illinois — the seventh u.s. senator to back the former vice president. california, texas and virginia all hold their primaries super tuesday, when a total of 1,357 delegates are up for grabs. california and texas will award the most, 415 and 228 respectively.\n\namong those announcing their support for biden on monday was former senate majority leader harry reid, who called him the candidate who can assemble the largest, most diverse coalition possible to defeat trump and lead our country following the trauma of trump's presidency. in a statement reid said, biden will be a much-needed stabilizing force following trump's disastrous term, offering a positive and progressive alternative to trump's dark vision of racism, xenophobia and policies built on cruelty and exclusion. reid, who represented nevada in the senate for 30 years, added, i believe biden is best able to defeat donald trump and enact the policies we all care about. the former vice president is also expected to snag support from his former competitors in the race for the democratic presidential nomination. amy klobuchar, who suspended her presidential campaign on monday, is expected to appear alongside biden at a rally in dallas on monday night. pete buttigieg, who dropped out of the presidential race sunday, endorsed biden in dallas on monday night.\n\namong the field of democratic presidential candidates, biden has always had a high number of endorsements in competitive states like iowa and new hampshire, but they didn't translate into wins in either of the two states. in iowa, biden came in fourth and in new hampshire, he placed fifth, and he came in second, far behind sanders, in the nevada caucuses. but that changed in south carolina, where he received the coveted endorsement of congressman jim clyburn, a democratic kingmaker in the palmetto state. among democratic primary voters, 47% said clyburn's endorsement was an important factor in their vote. biden thanked the south carolina congressman for helping drive him to victory in the state, saying he brought me back. the field of democrats seeking the presidential nomination has thinned in the wake of the south carolina primary. tom steyer ended his campaign on saturday, followed by buttigieg on sunday and klobuchar on monday. this leaves five candidates in the race: sanders, biden, mike bloomberg, tulsi gabbard, and elizabeth warren.\n\nbiden warned about the ramifications of sanders winning the nomination in an interview on monday with cbs news political reporter caitlin huey-burns, saying a ticket led by sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, could jeopardize democrats running for the house and senate. there's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist, biden said. imagine here in texas or in north carolina or in georgia, the idea, if i said to you, 'this is an open test. you're running for office. do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream democrat running at the top of the ticket?' my guess is in most states, they'd say no. the former vice president suggested his flurry of endorsements, including from democrats in battleground states, stems from the realization that the success of other candidates could hinge on the eventual democratic presidential nominee. it's not going to be enough just to beat donald trump. we have to win back the senate, we have to keep the house, he said. whether they're right or not, those people who are running for those offices think that bernie was not likely to help them, but hurt them in their pursuit of their senate or their house seat or their governor's seat.\n\n*cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson contributed to this report\n\nfrom the candidates\n\nelizabeth warren\n\nas opposing candidates are dropping from the race, cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak says warren is focusing on telling voters what she'd do in office. ahead of a los angeles speech monday night, the massachusetts senator released a pair of plans, one that includes a $400 billion stimulus package to head off the potential economic impact of coronavirus and another to improve conditions for farm and food chain industry employees. at the start of january, warren had released a plan on preventing, containing and treating infectious disease in light of the spread of coronavirus. this new plan echoes her speech in houston saturday, where she argued she is better suited to take on coronavirus then sanders, biden and bloomberg. it says she would make certain uninsured americans can get free care and evaluation for the virus, and that she would create an emergency paid leave program so that anyone with the cdc's outlined symptoms can be paid for time in quarantine. warren's farmworkers rights plan specifies that she would include farmworkers in her push for a $15 minimum wage as well as replace the h2-a agricultural guest worker visa program with an immigrant worker visa that has full labor protections built in. like her coronavirus economic plan, this one repeatedly references previous proposals and how they will work off of her new ones.\n\nlife after 2020\n\namy klobuchar\n\nklobuchar is suspending her presidential campaign and plans to endorse biden at a rally in dallas on monday night, a campaign spokesman told cbs news campaign reporter nicole sganga, just hours before voters in 14 states go to the polls on super tuesday. while the minnesota democrat often boasted about kicking off her campaign in the middle of a blizzard, the end of her run was marked by a storm of frustrations and stalled momentum. aides and allies told cbs news they took solace that her campaign performed better and lasted longer than many had initially expected. over the course of the campaign, klobuchar was quick to admit she did not have the name recognition or financial resources enjoyed by some of her rivals. besides hitting the trail, her prospects hinged on her performance in the primary debates, which were crucial for introducing herself to a national audience and raising money. klobuchar positioned herself as a moderate midwesterner who could unite the party, casting doubt on the feasibility of progressive policy proposals like free college tuition and medicare for all put forward by sanders. she also largely steered clear of criticizing biden, given the similarity in their views. armed with her neighborly appeal, klobuchar bet that a strong finish in the iowa caucuses would catapult her candidacy into the top tier. she set out to visit all of the state's 99 counties, a feat she accomplished just before the weeks-long senate impeachment trial trapped her on capitol hill. she came in fifth place in iowa, signaling that voters in that state did not agree with her proposition that a midwest moderate was best suited to win back the heartland. in what would prove to be the high water mark of her bid, klobuchar managed to bounce back with a strong showing at debate in new hampshire just days before the granite state's primary. she came in third, ahead of warren, a surprising finish that allowed her to continue on to nevada and south carolina.\n\nthere were indications earlier monday that klobuchar's bid was coming to an end. after an event in salt lake city, utah, the campaign held reporters for over two hours, with the lights turned off and no staff in sight. as late as monday morning, a senior adviser said they had received no official word of her exiting the race but declined to elaborate. multiple aides said they had expected her to remain in the race through super tuesday. the senator broke the news to her staff shortly after 1 p.m. et on a conference call from salt lake city on monday, two campaign officials told cbs news. klobuchar thanked her team for their work on the wild ride of the campaign, telling staff that she was proud of the operation they built. she also acknowledged that the outcome was not what they wished, but that she felt it was right to consolidate support around biden. the call lasted around 20 minutes, and klobuchar and staff members were sad and a bit shell-shocked. one longtime klobuchar ally told the initial plan to remain in the race through super tuesday was becoming untenable as polls showed her coming in behind sanders in her own state of minnesota, reports cbs news campaign reporter bo erickson. the feeling in the campaign really starting to change last week, this person said.\n\nmoney matters\n\non the $$$\n\nicymi over the weekend, sanders' campaign announced sunday it raised $46.5 million in february, the most of any democratic presidential candidate in a given month in the 2020 election cycle. cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice says the figure shatters the previous monthly record of $25 million, set by the sanders campaign in january. according to the campaign, the cash haul came from more than 2.2 million donations, including contributions from more than 350,000 donors who were giving to the campaign for the first time. the vermont senator's fundraising efforts were fueled by victories in the early primary states of new hampshire and nevada, and a first-place finish in the popular vote in iowa. the campaign said 99.9% of sanders' donors have not reached the federal limit on individual contributions, meaning they can give again. the average donation in february was $21. warren also announced her february fundraising numbers on sunday, saying she pulled in $29 million, a record for her campaign. her cash haul included $2.8 million on the day of warren's well-received debate performance in nevada on february 19. according to warren campaign manager roger lau, 250,000 people donated for the first time in february, bringing the campaign's total number of donors since its launch to more than 1.25 million. the average february donation was $31. read more here on how the candidate plans to use some of that cash.\n\nstate-by-state\n\nsouth carolina\n\nafter months of carrying a double-digit poll lead—that dramatically winnowed in the days leading up to the south carolina democratic primary—biden won the state's primary contest with 48.7% on saturday. gaining 39 delegates in the first in the south primary state, cbs news campaign reporter lacrai mitchell says biden received more than double the amount of delegates on saturday night than he had in the first three early state contests combined. the cbs news south carolina exit poll show that biden dominated in almost every category of south carolina voters—coming up short only among non-college educated white men, people who never attend religious services and younger voters. vermont senator bernie sanders edged out victories among voters ages 17-44 but came up short among black voters ages 30-44. according to the south carolina democratic party, more than 600 campaign stops were made by the candidates throughout the cycle and a cbs news analysis shows that combined the candidates spent at least 145 days over 75 visits in the state. amid reports that republicans were being encouraged to participate in the open democratic primary, exit polls showed only 5% of those who voted usually thought of themselves as a republican. the scdp reported record-breaking voter turnout with 539,020 south carolina democrats and independents voting in saturday's contest. this number smashed the 2008 democratic primary record by nearly 7,000 votes but the total turnout percentage was just 16.33%, compared to the 23% of registered voters who turned out in the 2008 primary, where then-senator barack obama won the contest with 55.4% of the vote.\n\nas predicted by early absentee ballot returns, more women (59%) voted than men and black voters comprised nearly 60% of those who voted. among black voters, 61% voted for biden with sanders coming in in second with only 17%. health care ranked as the top issue for south carolina voters and, while it was important for voters that the democratic party nominate a candidate who agreed with them on major issues, more than half of those who voted said they would rather see the party nominate a candidate who could beat president trump. biden won in every geographical region of the state—from the more conservative upstate down to the more liberal low country. more voters who live in small cities and rural areas came out than those in larger cities (population 50,000+) and the suburbs — and population areas that biden won. tom steyer, who had seen a notable rise in polls in recent months, ultimately came up short, receiving 59,917 votes, which was 11% of the overall vote. after having invested heavily in the state spending more than $20 million in ads, steyer did not reach the 15% threshold to receive any delegates and dropped out of the race saturday evening. during an emotional speech that was interrupted with cheers of we love you, tom! from supporters, steyer said that he would still be fighting for south carolinians. when the lord closes a door, he opens a window. i will climb through that window and crawl through it with you, he said.\n\ntexas\n\nthe second-biggest delegate prize on super tuesday is texas, which will award 228 pledged national delegates, according to cbs news campaign reporter adam brewster. democrats have ramped up their efforts in the days leading up to the primary, hoping to score points in the delegate-rich state. a cbs news battleground tracker poll released on sunday showed sanders with the lead in texas, with 30% of likely primary voters saying he was their top choice. biden was in second (26%), followed by warren (17%) and bloomberg (13%). the poll, taken february 27-29, had a margin of error of +/- 6.2%. candidates need 15% support statewide or in senate districts to win delegates. sanders, who has led the most recent texas polls, spent the weekend of the nevada caucuses crisscrossing texas. thousands of supporters attended his rallies in el paso, san antonio, houston and austin, where he repeatedly said he would win texas' primary. on television, they say you know texas is a conservative state, it's a red state. i don't believe it for a minute, sanders said at his houston rally. if our people stand together, come out to vote, we're going to win here in texas. sanders' five public events in 2020 trailed only bloomberg for public events held in the state in this calendar year. with the exception of bloomberg, sanders has also outspent all of his other democratic competitors on the airwaves in texas, dropping almost $5 million on advertisements, according to kantar/cmag data. part of sanders' polling strength has been his standing with latino voters. a univision poll released on friday showed sanders was leading with 31% support from latino voters, followed by bloomberg (23%), biden (19%) and warren (8%). the poll, taken february 21-26, had a margin of error of +/- 5.5%.\n\nbiden, who had a huge lead in texas polls until the calendar turned to 2020, spent his final day before super tuesday holding rallies in houston and dallas, hoping to capitalize on momentum from his strong finish in south carolina. biden's evening event in dallas is set to feature endorsements from klobuchar and buttigieg, who have suspended their campaigns. that could give his campaign a final jolt before voting tomorrow. recent polling has shown that buttigieg and klobuchar combined for 8% to 12% of the vote in texas. in an interview on monday with cbs news political reporter caitlin huey-burns, biden echoed concerns from some of his high profile texas congressional endorsers about sanders' possible effect on down ballot races. there's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist, biden said in the interview with cbs news in houston. imagine here in texas or in north carolina or in georgia, the idea, if i said to you, 'this is an open test. you're running for office. do you want a very popular, self-proclaimed socialist or a popular mainstream democrat running at the top of the ticket?' my guess is in most states, they'd say no.\n\nnobody has spent more money or poured more resources into texas than bloomberg. he has more than 180 staffers on the ground in texas and 19 offices around the state, giving him an unrivaled ground game form a sheer paid staff perspective. bloomberg has blanketed the texas airwaves by spending more than $47 million of advertisements. he has also held 13 public events in the state, more than his rivals, even though he jumped into the race last. we want to come in number one, said bloomberg's texas state director ashlea graves turner. we've built the biggest infrastructure that texas has ever seen for a statewide candidate, especially a presidential candidate. in the closing days, bloomberg made trips to houston and san antonio, where part of his pitch included his ability to handle crises like coronavirus.\n\nwarren's campaign has been on the ground in texas the longest of the campaigns remaining and has dozens of staffers spread around the state. warren made two trips to texas in the final week before super tuesday with rallies in san antonio on thursday and houston on saturday. in houston, she acknowledged her campaign's struggles in the early states, but said she believes it can turn around. i'll be the first to say that the first four contests haven't gone exactly as i'd hoped, warren said. but super tuesday is three days away and we're looking forward to gaining as many delegates to the convention as we can — from california to right here in texas. her high-profile texas endorsers, former obama housing secretary julián castro and congressman joaquin castro, campaigned around the state for her on the final weekend before the primary. while warren's campaign has spent about $900,000 on advertising in texas, the persist pac, which supports her, has spent more than $2.6 million.\n\ngabbard is also in texas on monday for an event in austin.\n\na key wrinkle in all of this: just over 1 million people voted early or by mail in the democratic primary, according to the texas secretary of state's website. early voting ended last friday and mailed ballots need to be counted. the texas secretary of state's office says those voters are not able to change their votes, even if a candidate has dropped out of the race. the turnout for democrats in texas' 15 most populated counties has eclipsed turnout in 2016's democratic primary, but has not matched the record numbers from the 2008 democratic primary.\n\ncalifornia\n\nas of monday evening, more than 3.5 million in california have already returned their ballots. election and data experts in the state expect total turnout this year to be close to 50%, which would mean around 10 million total votes.\n\nvoters who have cast early ballots for candidates no longer in the race are not allowed to change their ballots. according to paul mitchell, vice president of political data inc., more than 500,000 votes were cast for candidates no longer in the race since early voting began on february 3. this would be about 5% of the total eventual turnout in the state.\n\n\n\nanother group to keep an eye on are the so called perfect voters — the ones who have participated in the last five elections but are not turning in their ballots as fast. mitchell's data shows that so far, only about 40% of those perfect voters have turned in their ballots. in 2016 and 2008, more than 9 in 10 of these voters participated and this year, mitchell expects turnout among this group to be just as high.\n\n\n\nthere is a segment of democratic perfect voters, voters that have voted five of the last five elections that are not turning in their ballots as fast. and we know those people are going to vote. they voted five of the last five elections, mitchell said. they voted in the 2014 primary and the general, which were the lowest turnout elections we've had in forever and they still haven't voted. well, it's not because they said 'i just don't care anymore,' it's because they're waiting to see what happens in probably south carolina. i expect those people to turnout.\n\n\n\nin the latest cbs news battleground tracker poll, only 9% said the results out of south carolina will be a major factor in their decision, compared to the nearly 40% who said what happened in south carolina will have no impact on their vote.\n\ncongressional coverage\n\nin the house\n\nin addition to the presidential primaries on super tuesday, 120 congressional districts will also be holding primaries on super tuesday, and about three-quarters of these are in the delegate-rich states of texas and california. here's some interesting house races to watch on tuesday via cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro:
columbia, s.c. – on the steps of the south carolina state capitol, senators cory booker and bernie sanders on monday joined local leaders of the state naacp chapter and called for an end to racial injustice. only one of them leveled a direct, personal attack on president trump.\n\nwe now have a president of the united states who is a racist, sanders, an independent senator from vermont, told the crowd, adding later, what a president is supposed to do is to bring us together. and we have a president intentionally, purposefully trying to divide us up by the color of skin, by our gender, by the country we came from, by our religion.\n\nspeaking just before sanders at a martin luther king jr. day event, booker, a democrat representing new jersey, didn't go as far, preferring instead to echo a popular refrain of former president barack obama, who liked to remind crowds that king talked about the arc of the moral universe bending towards justice. but it does not bend with inevitability. we must be the arc-benders.\n\nthis is not a time for us to rest in our country, booker added. the work is not done. the dream still demands.\n\nsouth carolina hosts the fourth contest in the 2020 democratic presidential primary calendar. it will also be an important test of which candidates can appeal to a key constituency in the democratic party: african-american voters, who in 2016 made up 61 percent of the democratic primary voters in that state, according to cbs news exit poll data.\n\nfor democrats to reclaim the white house in 2020, they'll need overwhelming support from black voters, who helped drive obama to victory in 2008 and 2012 and whose tepid support for former secretary of state hillary clinton contributed to her narrow losses in several key midwestern swing states.\n\nobama won 95 percent of african-american voters nationwide in 2008 and 93 percent in 2012. but clinton earned just 88 percent of their vote – a smaller number that couldn't offset trump's massive advantage among white voters.\n\nthe 2018 midterms showed positive signs for democrats. they managed to win 90 percent of african-american voters nationwide. but voters and leaders warn that politicians cannot ignore black communities and expect their support in 2020.\n\nfor too long politicians have taken our votes for granted. that we'll just vote straight ticket, said rev. shawn johnson, pastor at new providence missionary baptist church. we have to learn to make our requests known and if those folks cannot champion our causes, we have to vote them out.\n\nthough neither senator has officially announced a campaign for president in 2020, their visit to the south carolina naacp's annual king day celebration suggests that both are seriously eyeing a run.\n\nafter the event, booker told reporters he's not that far from making a decision about a potential campaign.\n\nit's about them showing their presence, said q'ladrin qourters, a student with the naacp aiken collegiate chapter. she wants to see the march, now in its 19th year, continue to grow – and thinks having high profile politicians involved is a win-win.\n\nthis will be my first time seeing their faces, so if it is their initiative of showing that they're going to be for the youth and showing what they're going to do then, hey, i'm all for it.\n\nsanders, who struggled to win black voters in 2016, delivered his message about economic inequality along racial lines.\n\nracial inequality must be central to combatting economic inequality if we are to create a government that works for all of us not one percent, he said. we are going to change national priorities of this country, so that in this country justice rings out for all. that every american regardless of color of his skin, regardless of whether he or she is rich or poor, can have the quality of life that all human beings deserve.\n\nbooker would be the second black candidate to enter the democratic primary. south carolina could be an opportunity for him to set himself apart from a crowded field.\n\non monday, he cast himself as a unifying voice, urging voters to find what he called a courageous empathy.\n\nking said we can never let someone pull us so low as to hate them. we need each other in this nation, he said. we will be measured by our defiant love and our ability to pull people together and help them to recognize the lines that divide us are nowhere near as strong as the ties that bind us.\n\nwe come to the state house as a reminder that we're still here. we still have issues. we still have concerns, said brenda murphy, president of the south carolina naacp, which organized the march. she says both senators have proven they share those concerns.\n\nwe're glad they're here, murphy said.\n\nthe visit by sanders and booker in the january before election year was encouraging to some voters.\n\nthis probably is the earliest we've ever seen anyone in politics running for higher office to come to king day at the dome, said donfra miller, who brought his three children to the march. he said history has shown that most politicians ignore black voters, but he believes booker and sanders are listening.\n\nlendora nowlin agrees, saying all politicians need to do more to show black voters they care about their communities and that 2020 candidates need to get involved soon.\n\nthey've got to get their name in the public, she said. they should come visit with groups and invite themselves to more events.\n\nother democratic candidates are already making trips to the state. sen. elizabeth warren, of massachusetts, is visiting on wednesday and california sen. kamala harris, who announced a run for the presidency on monday, will be holding an event in the state on friday.\n\neditor's note: an earlier version of this article said that south carolina holds the third presidential nominating contest for democrats. but it comes after nevada, making it the fourth contest.
christian andreacchio was a 21-year-old man on track to being one of the youngest towboat captains on the mississippi river when he died of a single gunshot to the head. his parents say he was murdered, but law enforcement says it was suicide.\n\nandreaccchio's live-in girlfriend whitley goodman and friend dylan swearingen say they discovered him in the bathroom of his apartment in meridian, mississippi on february 26, 2014.\n\npolice quickly ruled out foul play, and the death was ruled a suicide despite suspicious clues: there was little blood spatter and there were no fingerprints found on the gun.\n\ni believe 100% he was murdered, andreacchio's mother, rae, tells 48 hours correspondent peter van sant.\n\ndetermined to find out what happened to christian, the andreacchios hired a team of investigators and experts to look at the evidence. they came up with a different conclusion: murder.\n\ndid your son, dylan, shoot christian? van sant asks swearingen's mother pam. absolutely not. on a very bad day, my son lost his best friend, she said.\n\ngoodman's mother christie chatterton says: i just want them to know that she did not kill him.\n\na grand jury heard the case in 2017 and chose not to indict goodman and swearingen in andreacchio's death. but 48 hours has learned jurors did not hear all of the evidence.\n\nfebruary 26, 2014\n\nrae andreacchio: i can't believe this is happening to our family — i think everybody was just kind of in shock. … this is something, you know, that happens to other people. it doesn't happen to you.\n\nfrom their lakeside home just outside meridian, mississippi, rae and todd andreacchio are haunted by the death of their 21-year-old son, christian, in 2014.\n\ntodd andreacchio: a lot of days i look out there and, you know, expect to see him out there with the jet ski floating about, but you know, every day you get caught with memories.\n\nhe was on his way to being a really good man, and i think he would have made a good father, a good husband, todd andreacchio said of his son christian. rae andreacchio\n\nchristian grew up on dalewood shore lake, where he fell in love with the water, and dreamed of becoming a towboat captain on the mississippi river.\n\ntodd andreacchio: he was on his way to being a really good man, and i think he would have made a good father, a good husband.\n\npeter van sant: it's tough to talk about this, isn't it?\n\ntodd andreacchio: yep. yep. i miss him every day [crying].\n\npeter van sant: have either of you honestly been able to have any peace in your life during all of this, since your son's death?\n\nrae andreacchio: no.\n\ntodd andreacchio: no. we've kind of been at war since it started.\n\npeter van sant: and you're at war now.\n\ntodd andreacchio: yes sir.\n\npeter van sant: this isn't over?\n\ntodd andreacchio: no. not by a long shot.\n\nfor now, there are two unanswered questions at the heart of this case: why would a young man with so much to live for take his own life? or perhaps more importantly, did someone take christians life from him?\n\npeter van sant: your son's death—suicide or homicide?\n\ntodd andreacchio: homicide.\n\nrae andreacchio: it's definitely a homicide.\n\nbut lauderdale county district attorney kassie coleman, who took over the case in 2018, says the evidence points in another direction.\n\nkassie coleman: well, at this point, there has been further investigation by multiple agencies … that have determined it to be a suicide.\n\nat issue are the events of february 26, 2014.\n\nrae andreacchio: i had talked to christian that morning. he was on the boat. you know, everything was fine.\n\nchristian was a few days into what's called a hitch—a 30-day work trip on the mississippi river where he was a first mate on a towboat. rae called him about getting tickets for a rihanna concert.\n\nrae andreacchio: and he said, well, let me check the date to see … he said, i gotta go. … i'll call you back later. love ya. got off the phone.\n\njust hours later, they were told that christian was found dead in his apartment, which he shared with his girlfriend whitley goodman.\n\ntodd andreacchio: and i was like, no. i don't think so. christian's at work. he's not even – he's not even in town.\n\na meridian police detective broke the horrible news to them in person.\n\nrae andreacchio: and he said, well, this is his driver's license. and … when we saw his driver's license, it became a little bit more real.\n\nbut suicide? nothing made sense to rae and todd.\n\ntodd andreacchio: he's never had any … kind of mental problems, any kind of depression.\n\nwhitley goodman and christian andreacchio cbs news\n\nprofessionally, at the age of 21, christian's life couldn't have been better. and on the personal side, he adored whitley, who had dropped out of high school and wanted to become a hair and makeup artist.\n\nchristie chatterton: they made each other happy. he was crazy about her.\n\nchristie chatterton is whitley's mother.\n\nchristie chatterton: she's very funny, very creative, and adventurous.\n\npeter van sant: she's a young woman that christian andreacchio fell in love with.\n\nchristie chatterton: she is.\n\nwhitley even moved in with the andreacchios. but after a few weeks, rae says whitley became jealous, defacing a picture of christian and his ex-girlfriend.\n\nrae andreacchio: i figure that she stabbed the faces out and then she brought the picture to me and gave it back to me.\n\npeter van sant: what did you think todd?\n\ntodd andreacchio: i thought she was a nut.\n\nthe andreacchios asked whitley to move out.\n\nrae andreacchio: and so, you know, his kind of attitude was, well, if she can't be here, then i can't be here.\n\nchristian and whitley moved into an apartment, which christian paid for.\n\nrae andreacchio: i felt … that she was using him for money. … he was providing her with a place to stay, with a car … clothes, makeup, whatever.\n\nwhitley's mom saw problems, too. especially when christian was on the towboat.\n\nchristie chatterton: she would have to stay on the phone with him at night … so he can keep up with where she was and what she was doing.\n\npeter van sant: you mean, for like an hour after an hour ...\n\nchristie chatterton: like hours and hours and hours. … every night … i didn't know how unhealthy the relationship had become.\n\nmeridian police said christian andreacchio's death was a suicide, but rae and todd andreacchio believe their son was murdered. cbs news\n\nbut none of this seemed to add up to suicide for the andreacchios.\n\ntodd andreacchio: so, for him to take his life over somebody he'd been dating for six months? i don't think so. no.\n\non the night of christian's death, rae needed answers. she called her brother, chris thompson, and asked that he drive over to the meridian police department. that's where christian's friend, dylan swearingen — who made that 911 call — was being questioned along with whitley.\n\nrae andreacchio: and i told him to be sure … that whitley didn't have christian's phone.\n\nat first whitley denied having it, but eventually turned it over to police.\n\nchris thompson: to me, that was a big red flag right off the bat.\n\npeter van sant: so, she had lied initially about not knowing where christian's phone was.\n\nrae andreacchio: right. … it's … very suspicious because why would you do that?\n\nkassie coleman: my personal opinion … is that she did not want that phone to get in the hands of law enforcement … because there were a lot of sexually oriented photographs and messages in that phone.\n\nthe andreacchio's were stunned to learn the investigation at the scene lasted only 45 minutes.\n\npeter van sant: and the job they did in this investigation, how would you describe it?\n\ntodd andreacchio: piss poor.\n\nbut that same investigation did turn up something that the andreacchios hoped would be a game changer.\n\npeter van sant: both dylan and whitley are checked for gunshot residue — g.s.r. what do they find?\n\ntodd andreacchio: gunshot residue.\n\npeter van sant: on both their hands?\n\ntodd andreacchio: both their hands.\n\npeter van sant: and what does that suggest to you?\n\ntodd andreacchio: they were in the room when the gun was fired.\n\nwhat happened to christian?\n\nrae andreacchio: nobody wants to think that their child was at a point in their life where they took their own life. i mean, that's just human nature. … but we had someone in the community … who had killed himself. … and that really bothered christian. … and he several times told me, you know, mom, if anybody ever says i killed myself, you come looking because i wouldn't do that.\n\nfor christian's family, that horrible night in 2014 started a search for answers that continues to this day.\n\nrae andreacchio: we took the time to have his funeral. and then the very next week, we started going to the police department.\n\nfrom the beginning, the andreacchios had questions about that 911 call placed by christian's friend dylan swearingen around 4:45 p.m.\n\nthey wonder, is this a genuine call?

[whitley is heard wailing in the background] operator: ok, just try not to touch anything, ok? dylan swearingen: whitley! whitley! operator: is she up with him? dylan swearingen: come down here. they don't want you to touch anything. come on. [crying in background]. operator: just trying, if – if it — dylan swearingen: come here, whitley. come here ...\n\ntodd andreacchio: just sounds fake to me.\n\ndylan swearingen: please get somebody up here. …i think he shot himself.\n\nrae andreacchio: he's already … put it out there in people's mind that it's a suicide … so, you know, now that's how it's going to be looked at.\n\npeter van sant: did your son, dylan, shoot christian?\n\npam swearingen | dylan's mother: absolutely not.\n\npam swearingen: on a very bad day, my son lost his best friend.\n\ndylan and whitley declined to grant us an interview, but their mothers agreed to speak for the first time to 48 hours. while they wouldn't discuss specifics of the case, they're adamant their children did not commit any crime.\n\nchristie chatterton, left, and pam swearingen are adamant their children did not commit any crime. cbs news\n\nchristie chatterton | whitley's mother: it was just so shocking. and you know what she saw, like, she can never unsee it.\n\nchristie chatterton: i just want them to know that she did not kill him.\n\nthat night, christie rushed down to the police station, where whitley had just been questioned.\n\nchristie chatterton: i just hugged her and comforted her.\n\npeter van sant: was she in tears?\n\nchristie chatterton: she was hysterical.\n\npeter van sant: christian's death— suicide or homicide?\n\nchristie chatterton: one hundred percent … it's suicide.\n\ninvestigators found christian's body in the upstairs bathroom, leaning facedown over a blood-filled tub, with that gunshot wound to the right side of his head. four months after christian's death, benny dubose became meridian's new chief of police and took on the case.\n\nbenny dubose: a lot of the stuff didn't make sense.\n\nwhen authorities tested christian's gun they found no fingerprints. former meridian police chief benny dubose, who inherited the case when he became the new chief, believes prints should have been on the gun, and the fact that there were none indicated it had been wiped down. meridian police dept.\n\nstarting with christian's gun.\n\nbenny dubose: when the gun was sent to the crime lab, they did not find any prints on the gun at all. … christian's prints should have been on the gun. … the gun was cleaned — wiped down.\n\nhe says the bathroom was surprisingly clean, too.\n\nbenny dubose: there should have been some blood splatter [sic] on this side and on this side [gestures to both sides of his head] … there was no blood splatter [sic].\n\npeter van sant: suggesting what?\n\nbenny dubose: that … number 1, the crime scene had been tampered with. probably, most likely the blood splatter had been cleaned.\n\ndubose says officers bungled the investigation.\n\ninvestigators found christian's body in the upstairs bathroom, leaning face-down over a blood-filled tub. christian had a single gunshot wound to the right side of his head. former police chief benny dubose says the bathroom was surprisingly clean. he believes the scene had been tampered with and that blood spatter had been cleaned. meridian police dept.\n\nbenny dubose: taking pictures of the crime scene with a doggone cell phone? … they all were issued cameras. … and the pictures, needless to say, were terrible.\n\ndistrict attorney kassie coleman agrees. she inherited the case in 2018.\n\npeter van sant: would you use the word incompetent?\n\nkassie coleman: yes … without a doubt, it lacked competence. it lacked thoroughness.\n\ndylan and whitley were not even photographed.\n\nkassie coleman: there's been a lot of questions about was there any blood on either one of them? the reality is, we don't know.\n\nrae andreacchio: the timeline that dylan gives of the events don't really add up.\n\ndylan told police christian had called him around 2 a.m. that morning, urgently asking for a ride home from st. rose, louisiana. apparently, christian had found out whitley was cheating on him.\n\nrae andreacchio: he was coming home to … kick her out of the apartment.\n\npeter van sant: you believe he was going back to break up with her?\n\ntodd andreacchio: yes, sir.\n\ndylan says he picked up christian and they drove back to the apartment. almost immediately, christian and whitley began arguing when, dylan says, christian suddenly took out a gun and put it to his own head.\n\nbenny dubose: according to the report, christian threatened to shoot himself. … telling whitley to tell him that she loved him. … dylan ended up saying that he took the weapon away from christian … unloaded it and hid it.\n\nbut whitley told detectives a different story.\n\nrae andreacchio: when whitley is asked … has christian ever appeared suicidal … she says, no, i don't think so.\n\nrae andreacchio: there was inconsistencies throughout her stories.\n\naccording to police reports, whitley told responders and friends that she discovered christian's body. but she told a detective at the station that it was dylan who found him.\n\nbenny dubose: she claimed to be asleep on the sofa … and a .45 caliber handgun is discharged, and she slept through it.\n\npeter van sant: is that believable?\n\nbenny dubose: no. no, not at all.\n\npeter van sant: you know your guns. how loud is a .45?\n\nbenny dubose: that should have been heard two to three apartments over.\n\ndylan swearingen and whitley goodman cbs news/twitter\n\nand remember, gunshot residue was present on both dylan's and whitley's hands. while police have not publicly commented about the gsr on dylan's hands, whitley told investigators she has an innocent explanation.\n\nrae andreacchio: her response was, well, i'm going to have it on my hands because i was shooting guns the night before.\n\nshe said she'd been target practicing with friends, a claim one of those friends said was true, but another said was false. but the andreacchios are questioning everything, including something odd dylan did earlier that day.\n\npeter van sant: what do we see in this picture?\n\nrae andreacchio: dylan swearingen at the credit union.\n\npeter van sant: who has an account at that bank?\n\nrae andreacchio: christian.\n\nabout 4 hours before dylan called 911, he was photographed at a credit union where christian had an account. dylan told investigators that christian had given him his debit card with a startling request. he says christian told him to withdraw all of his money because he wanted to give it to him. but there was one problem: dylan didn't have christian's pin number, so he left empty-handed. meridian police dept.\n\nthese photos were taken at 12:29 p.m. – around 4 hours before dylan called 911. dylan told investigators that christian had given him his debit card with a startling request.\n\nrae andreacchio: he says … that christian told him to withdraw all of his money — that he was giving him his money.\n\nbut there was one little problem: dylan didn't have christian's pin number. so, he left empty-handed.\n\npeter van sant: is that suspicious to you?\n\nbenny dubose: absolutely.\n\nrae andreacchio: he arrives back. … he said that … they watched a couple of movies.\n\ndylan said christian had calmed down, so he gave him his gun back. he says whitley settled in for a nap. dylan says he left for another errand and when he returned …\n\noperator: 911, where's your emergency? dylan swearingen: ma'am, we've had a suicide.\n\npeter van sant: knowing what you know about this case, if i asked you was this suicide or homicide, where are you leaning?\n\nbenny dubose: neither.\n\npeter van sant: how do you mean?\n\nbenny dubose: i don't think that mr. andreacchio killed himself on purpose. and i don't think anybody else killed mr. andreacchio on purpose.\n\ndubose believes christian may have once again held his gun to his own head — this time, upstairs in the bathroom.\n\nbenny dubose: i believe that … whitley may have … reached for the gun and the gun discharged. … i don't think there was a motive. i think it was just an accident.\n\nthe andreacchios aren't buying any of it.\n\npeter van sant: could it have been an accident?\n\ntodd andreacchio: i mean, anything's possible, but i don't believe it at all.\n\nrae andreacchio: in this situation, everything points to murder … and then they — whoever — staged it to look like a suicide.\n\nthat night, the coroner ruled the death undermined. after an autopsy, a forensic pathologist labeled it a suicide. and just like that, the meridian police department closed the case.\n\nrae andreacchio: and so, then we had to do this, start this investigation on our own.\n\nso, they began hiring their own private investigators, eventually forming a small army of supporters and experts including a forensic pathologist named dr. jonathan arden.\n\ndr. jonathan arden: it is my conclusion that the death of christian andreacchio was a homicide.\n\nseeking answers\n\ntodd andreacchio: we've just been really let down by the police and law enforcement.\n\ntodd andreacchio: we had no idea what to do or where to start.\n\nrae and todd andreacchio began their search for justice by hiring their own team of investigators, including former washington d.c. medical examiner, dr. jonathan arden, who examined the case file.\n\ndr. jonathan arden: i've performed about 3,000 autopsies on my own. … from the beginning, my reaction was—something is wrong here.\n\nstarting with where investigators found christian's handgun. it was pressed between his left thigh and the front of the tub.\n\ndr. jonathan arden: it's significant to me that the gun is in the wrong place on the wrong side.\n\npeter van sant: because he's right-handed ...\n\ndr. jonathan arden: he's right-handed — entrance wound in his right temple. how does the gun end up on his left side? … once the bullet goes through his brain, he's unconscious. he can't transfer the gun.\n\ncrime scene photographs show that the bullet had struck the wall on the opposite side of the bathroom next to the sink. but somehow, the bullet ends up in the bathtub and christian is leaning over the bathtub. dr. arden says none of this lines up. he believes someone must have put christian in the position he was found, staging the scene. meridian police dept.\n\ncrime scene photographs show that the bullet had struck the wall on the opposite side of the bathroom next to the sink. but …\n\ndr. jonathan arden: somehow the bullet ends up in the bathtub and he's leaning over the bathtub. so, none of this lines up for him to have shot himself in the position where he was found. it simply makes no sense. … clearly, somebody put him there. it's a staged scene.\n\nthe coroner placed the time of death at 3:45. but dr. arden believes christian may have died earlier. he says pictures show christian's body was in advanced rigor mortis.\n\ndr. jonathan arden: rigor mortis is the stiffening of the muscles that happens after death. … the development of well-formed rigor mortis tells me that he's been in that position, unmoved, undisturbed for at least several hours.\n\nwhich, if accurate, suggests that christian may have already been dead when dylan went to the credit union to empty christian's bank account.\n\ntodd andreacchio: so, yeah, i believe my son's dead and i believe he's trying to steal his money.\n\nthe evidence led dr. arden to reach a dramatic conclusion.\n\ndr. jonathan arden: somebody else shot and killed him.\n\ntodd andreacchio: i don't see how you can argue with forensics. … science doesn't lie. people lie.\n\npeter van sant: why would someone want your son dead?\n\nrae andreacchio: well, that's the answers, you know, that we would like.\n\nthe family worked with a team of private investigators including sheila wysocki to dig further.\n\nsheila wysocki: the scene was altered or staged. and usually when you do that, you're hiding something. … the andreacchios have had to fight tooth and nail for the truth.\n\nthe investigators recorded an interview with dylan swearingen a few weeks after christian died. he had this to say about his visit to the credit union:\n\ndylan swearingen [audio]: that's the only thing that i didn't understand. like, why did he want me to have his money?\n\ndylan told them that whitley and christian were always fighting, and that christian didn't trust her, even sending dylan to spy on her.\n\ndylan swearingen [audio]: i was kind of like the babysitter. he always would ask me to check on her, see what she's doing.\n\nand dylan repeated that he — and not whitley — discovered christian's body.\n\ndylan swearingen [audio]: when i opened the door … he was hunched over in the bathtub. and i knew that — i knew he wasn't alive just the way he was just staying there … and it didn't add up to me.\n\nwhitley's mom, christie, says the day christian died wasn't the first time he allegedly threatened suicide, and that whitley told her about an incident that happened about two months before his death.\n\nchristie chatterton: he had gotten intoxicated … and getting angry and heated and he had put the gun to his head. and he even would put it to her head … and he was asking her if she loved him.\n\nbut remember, when police asked whitley if christian had ever appeared suicidal, she said she didn't think so. rae and todd don't believe their son ever held a gun to his head.\n\nrae andreacchio: we don't think it happened.\n\npeter van sant: that does not sound like christian to you.\n\ntodd andreacchio: no. no.\n\nhowever, investigators found a misspelled message on christian's phone that was sent to whitley the night before he died:\n\nif this doesn't work when i get to my apartment i'm putting my pistol in my mouth and im ending this i'm ending this once and for all becaus e whitkey your the closest i have ever been to happiness...\n\ntodd andreacchio: i don't trust any of the texts because they were in possession of his phone.\n\ndon't forget, whitley had christian's phone at the police station. todd and rae believe the message could have been planted. district attorney kassie coleman dismisses that theory.\n\nkassie coleman: the phone … was on the tug boat with christian at the time that those messages were sent. and so, i do not know of any way that those messages could have been manipulated to appear that they were coming from the boat if she was in meridian.\n\nthree years after christian's death, benny dubose, who had taken over as police chief, decided it was time to get fresh eyes to look at the case. he assigned captain jay arrington.\n\nbenny dubose: i gave him the case, and he worked his butt off.\n\narrington, a 30-year veteran detective of the meridian police department, combed through the case file and came up with a conclusion that christian's family had long waited to hear.\n\njay arrington: it's homicide.\n\npeter van sant: are you sure of that?\n\njay arrington: absolutely.\n\npeter van sant: and do you believe that christian's body was moved at that scene, that somebody moved it after his death?\n\njay arrington: i have no doubt.\n\ncaptain arrington, like dr. arden, concluded that christian had been dead for several hours before the 911 call was made, allowing time for a clean-up.\n\njay arrington: the death scene had obviously been altered from its original state.\n\narrington wrote arrest warrants for whitley and dylan. the charge: manslaughter by culpable negligence, which means unintentionally causing a death while acting with disregard for the person's safety.\n\npeter van sant: and were those warrants ever served?\n\njay arrington: no, sir.\n\nin february 2017, before kassie coleman took over, her predecessor decided to hand off the case to the mississippi state attorney general's office. they wouldn't comment about it to\n\n48 hours. in october 2017, a mississippi state prosecutor did present the case to a grand jury, but ...\n\npeter van sant: were you allowed to present your investigative report at the grand jury?\n\njay arrington: i wasn't allowed to be at the grand jury. … it's the only one i've ever had done that way. in all my years, that's the only one.\n\nwithout ever hearing from the detective who calls this case a homicide, it's now up to the grand jury whether it will go to trial.\n\npeter van sant: do you believe … in a court of law, you could get a conviction?\n\nrae andreacchio: 100 percent.\n\npeter van sant: you were a member of the grand jury… correct?\n\njuror: yes, sir.\n\npeter van sant: and what decision was made?\n\na crushing blow\n\nthe woman at the heart of this southern mystery, whitley goodman, has never spoken publicly about the case until 48 hours came to town.\n\nwhitley goodman: two weeks ago, it just came to me, like out of nowhere.\n\nwhitley started talking when she agreed to meet our camera crew to get some video shots with her mom. she would not take questions, but she did read a poem.\n\nwhitley goodman: the title is moist by whitley goodman.\n\nthe verses describe what she says is her tumultuous life after christian's death.\n\nwhitley goodman reads her poem to 48 hours. cbs news\n\nwhitley goodman [reading her poem]: i miss who i was, the person i once was allowed to be, before the anxiety, the pain and the notoriety — before your name was used in vain as the main source of my pain.\n\nin whitley's words, she is the victim.\n\nwhitley goodman [reading her poem]: oh, it has been such a war. … i guess it's me who we should hate. i'll be everyone's escape.\n\nbut there has been no escape for the andreacchio family, which suffered a devastating defeat in late 2017, when that grand jury returned their decision to not indict whitley and dylan.\n\nkassie coleman: from the jurors that i have spoken with — they did not believe there was sufficient evidence to prove either of these people guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of either manslaughter or homicide.\n\nthe andreacchios were crushed.\n\ntodd andreacchio: i feel like the meridian police department, the attorney general's office and everybody involved officially has let us down. they let somebody get away with murder.\n\nwhitley's mother sees the grand jury's decision as just.\n\nchristie chatterton: she loved him dearly. … the greatest tragedy for her is still losing him and finding him the way she did that day.\n\nbut the andreacchios were determined to keep their son's case alive. so, they took to social media, starting their justice for christian facebook page.\n\nand in june 2019, the podcast culpable started covering the case.\n\nthe actions of whitley goodman and dylan swearingen were now being judged by a national audience.\n\n[podcast] sheila wysocki: the podcast is exposing all the injustices that have happened during this investigation.\n\npeople from coast to coast became enraged. and they acted on that rage. among their targets, d.a. kassie coleman.\n\npeter van sant: have you received threats?\n\nkassie coleman: yes sir. i have received threats towards me, towards my family … threats of physical violence [sobs].\n\npeter van sant: take your time.\n\nkassie coleman: there's a lot of tragedy and heartbreak in everybody's family.\n\npeter van sant: do you sleep with a gun by your bedside?\n\nkassie coleman: yes sir.\n\npeter van sant: it's that serious?\n\nkassie coleman: yes sir.\n\nthis past august, the controversy grew even more intense. right before 48 hours travelled to mississippi to cover this story, capt. jay arrington's investigative report from 2017 was made public for the first time.\n\nrae andreacchio: i realized that this was— things we had never heard.\n\npeter van sant: arrington writes, it's my thoughts it could be suicide, homicide or accidental, with one of the three, to be proved with facts. until that is established, the death should be classified as a homicide. that's a heck of a sentence. when you read that, what did you think?\n\ntodd andreacchio: i was shocked.\n\n48 hours spoke to kassie coleman just days after the report was released.\n\npeter van sant: mr. arrington's findings— this report—was it presented to the grand jury?\n\nkassie coleman: yes. … i have had conversations with grand jurors that were on the grand jury and i've had conversations with the investigators that were presenting the facts. and they told me that all of the reports from the meridian police department were presented.\n\nbut while 48 hours was reporting in mississippi, we found a grand juror who said that's not true.\n\npeter van sant: you were a member of the grand jury that was looking into the christian andreacchio case, correct?\n\njuror: yes sir.\n\nthe grand juror agreed to speak if we agreed not to use her name or show her face.\n\npeter van sant asks a member of the grand jury about capt. jay arrington's report. he read the major findings of the report, none of which the juror said she knew. cbs news\n\npeter van sant: i'm holding a report here that is dated january 11th, 2017. and it was written by a captain jay arrington. at the time, had you ever heard this man's name before?\n\njuror: no sir.\n\nvan sant read the major findings of captain arrington's report, none of which the juror said she knew.\n\npeter van sant: does that bother you? … does — is that something that you find in any way disturbing?\n\njuror: yes, it's very disturbing because it seems that he had a lot more information detailed in his report than what we were presented.\n\ntodd andreacchio: i think it's a travesty. i think my son deserves more than that.\n\nnow, with the release of arrington's explosive report, the andreacchio's were finally beginning to think maybe they might have one last change at justice for christian.\n\ntodd andreacchio: i think we need feds or somebody to come in here and—and clear this up. … i don't trust anybody over in meridian. i don't trust the da we've got right now. i don't trust the da we've got right now. i wouldn't want her anywhere near my son's case.\n\nthe case is far from over\n\nthis past november, like they do every year, the andreacchio family and their friends celebrated christian's life.\n\nrae andreacchio: today is christian's birthday, november 4th, and this is our 7th night to have wishing night\n\nheartfelt messages are written on lanterns and sent floating toward the heavens.\n\ntodd andreacchio: wishing night is kind of a way of just letting christian knew we haven't forgotten him.\n\non wishing night, heartfelt messages in remembrance of christian andreacchio are written on lanterns and sent floating toward the heavens. cbs news\n\nthis peaceful evening stands in contrast to the war of words and deeds in this emotional case fueled by social media that includes acts of cruelty.\n\nrae andreacchio: all of christian's autopsy photos were -- placed on social media and i think downloaded over 2,000 times.\n\ntodd andreacchio: they harassed my daughter.\n\nrae andreacchio: i still believe someone set her car on fire.\n\npam swearingen: we've been run off the road.\n\npeter van sant: you're kidding.\n\npam swearingen: absolutely not.\n\nchristie chatterton: i bought a new car and within three weeks, it had bullet holes in it.\n\nin 48 hours' interview with district attorney coleman, she said she would reconvene a grand jury if it turned out that captain arrington's report had not been presented.\n\nkassie coleman: i have said repeatedly and stand by … if that information was not presented, then yes, that is a situation that would open the door to allow the case to be re-presented to the grand jury.\n\nthree months later, peter van sant told coleman that 48 hours learned from that grand juror that she was not informed of captain arrington's 2017 report -- a fact that may have changed her opinion on this case.\n\njuror: i think they should have done more investigating and brought it back to a grand jury again with more evidence, especially that report to present it to another jury to decide if that --it would be indicted or not.\n\ncoleman confirmed that arrington's report was not presented to the grand jury and said she is willing to reconvene a new grand jury. she acknowledges the andreacchio family doesn't trust her to present the case, so coleman is trying to find another prosecutor.\n\nrae andreacchio: we're 100 percent confident that if the information is presented fairly, that people will be indicted. and then, of course, from there there'll be a trial.\n\ncomplicating matters further, nearly three years after he finished his report, captain arrington was indicted in federal court, accused of using city funds for his personal use. j. stewart parrish is arrington's attorney.\n\nj. stewart parrish: the allegations are false. they arise apparently from somebody either intentionally or maliciously misleading other folks.\n\ncaught in the middle of all this are dylan swearingen and whitley goodman's families.\n\npeter van sant: is there anything that you would like to say to the andreacchio family?\n\npam swearingen: that we loved christian.\n\nchristie chatterton: we grieve for him, too. pam: and we grieve for him.\n\nwhitley goodman's attorney bradley clanton has filed a $47 million lawsuit against the andreacchio family, the podcast culpable—and others—for defamation and emotional distress.\n\nbradley clanton: you can't torture people for the rest of their lives because they got accused of a crime.\n\nthe civil suit also seeks an injunction to shut down the justice for christian facebook page, and end their public accusations.\n\nbradley clanton: you've had four to five law enforcement agencies all the way up to the mississippi attorney general look at this and everyone has reached the same conclusion— that it's a suicide.\n\nwhitley goodman [reading her poem]: i was so confused whenever i started being blamed. i really was. … you know, if they were so weak minded that they took pride in, you know, hurting me without even asking me or confirming, you know, what the truth is then i don't want anything to do with them.\n\ntodd andreacchio: there's only one life destroyed — actually destroyed, and that's my son. he's not here anymore.\n\nchristian andreacchio rae andreacchio/cindy mcdaniel\n\nso, the case goes on.\n\nrae andreacchio: i think that they wake up every morning and they have a choice of what they're going to do with their day. you know, they get to go out and live and love and travel and get married if they want to and have kids. and, you know, christian, that's a choice taken away from him. [emotional] doesn't he deserve justice? don't we deserve answers?\n\nthe andreacchios are lobbying for a law named after their son.\n\nchristian's law would restrict the public release of autopsy photos in mississippi.\n\nproduced by chris o'connell and emily wichick. ryan smith is the development producer. grayce arlotta-berner, michelle harris, joan adelman and diana modica are the editors. anthony batson is the senior broadcast producer.
scientists say they have used the gene editing tool crispr inside someone's body for the first time — offering a new frontier for efforts to operate on dna, the chemical code of life, to treat diseases.\n\na patient recently had it done at the casey eye institute at oregon health & science university in portland for an inherited form of blindness, according to the companies that make the treatment. the company would not give details on the patient or when the surgery occurred.\n\nit may take up to a month to see if it worked to restore the patient's vision. if the first few attempts seem safe, doctors plan to test it on 18 children and adults.\n\nwe literally have the potential to take people who are essentially blind and make them see, charles albright, chief scientific officer at editas medicine, the cambridge, massachusetts, company developing the treatment with dublin-based allergan, told the associated press. we think it could open up a whole new set of medicines to go in and change your dna.\n\ndr. jason comander, an eye surgeon at massachusetts eye and ear in boston, another hospital that plans to enroll patients in the study, told the ap it marks a new era in medicine using a technology that makes editing dna much easier and much more effective.\n\ndoctors first tried in-the-body gene editing in 2017 for a different inherited disease using a tool called zinc fingers. many scientists believe crispr is a much easier tool for locating and cutting dna at a specific spot, so interest in the new research is very high.\n\nthe people in this study have leber congenital amaurosis, caused by a gene mutation that keeps the body from making a protein needed to convert light into signals to the brain, which enables sight. they're often born with little vision and can lose even that within a few years.\n\nscientists can't treat it with standard gene therapy — supplying a replacement gene — because the one needed is too big to fit inside the disabled viruses that are used to ferry it into cells.\n\nso they're aiming to edit, or delete the mutation by making two cuts on either side of it. the hope is that the ends of dna will reconnect and allow the gene to work as it should.\n\nit's done in an hour-long surgery under general anesthesia. through a tube the width of a hair, doctors drip three drops of fluid containing the gene editing machinery just beneath the retina, the lining at the back of the eye that contains the light-sensing cells.\n\nonce the cell is edited, it's permanent and that cell will persist hopefully for the life of the patient because these cells don't divide, one study leader not involved in this first case, dr. eric pierce at massachusetts eye and ear, told the ap.\n\ndoctors think they need to fix one tenth to one third of the cells to restore vision. in animal tests, scientists were able to correct half of the cells with the treatment, albright said.\n\nthe eye surgery itself poses little risk, doctors say. infections and bleeding are relatively rare complications.\n\none of the biggest potential risks from gene editing is that crispr could make unintended changes in other genes, but the companies have done a lot to minimize that and to ensure that the treatment cuts only where it's intended to, pierce said. he has consulted for editas and helped test a gene therapy, luxturna, that's sold for a different type of inherited blindness.\n\nsome independent experts were optimistic about the new study.\n\nthe gene editing approach is really exciting. we need technology that will be able to deal with problems like these large genes, dr. jean bennett, a university of pennsylvania researcher who helped test luxturna at the children's hospital of philadelphia, told the ap.\n\nin one day, she had three calls from families seeking solutions to inherited blindness.\n\nit's a terrible disease, she said. right now they have nothing.\n\ndr. kiran musunuru, another gene editing expert at the university of pennsylvania, told the ap the treatment seems likely to work, based on tests in human tissue, mice and monkeys.\n\nthe gene editing tool stays in the eye and does not travel to other parts of the body, so if something goes wrong, the chance of harm is very small, he said. it makes for a good first step for doing gene editing in the body.\n\nalthough the new study is the first to use crispr to edit a gene inside the body, another company, sangamo therapeutics, has been testing zinc finger gene editing to treat metabolic diseases.\n\nother scientists are using crispr to edit cells outside the body to try to treat cancer, sickle cell and some other diseases.\n\nall of these studies have been done in the open, with government regulators' approval, unlike a chinese scientist's work that brought international scorn in 2018. he jiankui used crispr to edit embryos at the time of conception to try to make them resistant to infection with the aids virus. changes to embryos' dna can pass to future generations, unlike the work being done now in adults to treat diseases.
defense secretary ash carter on monday made it clear that congress will have to change the law if the government wants to move some remaining detainees at the guantanamo bay prison to a facility on u.s. soil.\n\nspeaking to reporters at the pentagon, carter said that safety is his top priority and there has to be alternate detention facility created for the detainees.\n\nnow, that can't be done unless congress acts, which means that congress has to support the idea that it would be good to move this facility or the detainees to the united states, said carter, who reiterated that closing guantanamo bay would save the u.s. a lot of money.\n\ncarter went on to say that the closure plan, unveiled by the white house last week, could not be fully implemented until congress takes action.\n\nso it is good if it can be done, but it cannot be done under current law. the law has to be changed, he said. that is the reason to put a proposal to put in front of congress.\n\npart of the plan calls for the administration for work with congress to find a location in the u.s. to house fewer than 60 detainees. many of the other remaining detainees, under the plan, would be transferred to foreign countries.\n\nlast fall, president obama signed a defense policy bill that barred the administration from transferring detainees to u.s. soil.\n\nat a congressional hearing in november, attorney general loretta lynch acknowledged that the law is clear.\n\nwith respect to individuals being transferred to the united states, the law currently does not allow that, she told the house judiciary committee. certainly it is the position of the department of justice that we would follow the law of the land in regard on that issue.\n\nwhen mr. obama announced his plan last week, he explained that the u.s. has already had to house terrorists in the u.s. and the government has kept the country safe.\n\npart of my message to the american people is we're already holding a bunch of really dangerous terrorists in the united states because we threw the book at them and there have been no incidents. we've managed it just fine, he said.\n\nrepublicans in congress, meanwhile, blasted the president's plan and largely declared it dead on arrival on capitol hill.
austin, texas -- texas lawmakers have approved the hunting of feral hogs and coyotes from hot air balloons.\n\ntexas' growing hog population causes millions of dollars' worth of damage to crops every year. texas has an estimated four million feral hogs. their high breeding rate and lack of natural predators has seen their population explode.\n\nthe state already allows the shooting of feral hogs from helicopters, but that is expensive and has not been very successful because the aircraft often scare the animals away. hot air balloons are quieter and offer a more stable shooting platform.\n\nthe bill requires the state to license hot air balloon hunting.\n\nthe bill passed the senate wednesday night and now goes to gov. greg abbott for his consideration.\n\ntexas agriculture commissioner sid miller's controversial plan to poison the hogs with special bait was scrapped recently, cbs news correspondent don champion reports.\n\nmaybe somewhere down the road there'll be a reproductive solution to it, miller told champion.\n\nit's not just a problem in rural areas.\n\ntheir ability to change their behavior makes them incredibly adaptable to live in a lot of different settings, and one of those settings is in the city, said brett johnson of dallas' parks and recreation department.\n\njohnson traps 20 to 40 hogs a week for the city of dallas.\n\njohn green of nacogdoches told champion that homeowners like him are left with few options.\n\nif you want to stay up all night and guard your property, that's really the only thing you can do, he said.\n\nlast fall, hungry wild hogs destroyed his property.\n\nthey're brazen, he said. they have no problems with barking dogs anymore.\n\nand he expects it to get worse in the summer.
australia is burning. an area about as large as west virginia has been blackened by the fires and according to a university of sydney scientist it's estimated a billion animals have died. the blazes are bigger than the ones that torched california and the amazon, events that took place on different continents, but are part of the same story: global climate change. it's a story not just of fire but water. before climate scientists worried about australia burning, they warned that venice, italy, is drowning. man's most beautiful artifact, built on millions of pylons in the middle of a lagoon, may be vanishing before our eyes. the periodic floods of venice have become more threatening and more frequent. this past november, a sudden storm surge overwhelmed nearly 90% of the city. climate scientists say what happened that night exactly two months ago in venice is a warning to the world of what's to come – and not just in venice.\n\nflooding in venice eric kerchner/cbs news\n\never since the fifth century, venice has depended on the water for survival. this improbable italian city, knit together between islands, used water as a barrier against invaders to become a jewel of the world. then came the night of november 12.\n\nstreets ran like rivers, squares became swimming pools, it was venice's second-highest tide ever recorded, more than six feet above sea level, wind from a storm barreling up the adriatic sea accelerated from 6 miles an hour to 70 in less than 15 minutes. when the surge was over, the destruction totaled a billion dollars.\n\ntoto bergamo rossi: it's enough. i said to myself the other night, with the water until almost my underpants downstairs. i mean, this is ridiculous. this, we can't be like this.\n\ntoto bergamo rossi is known as venice's unofficial mayor. a descendant of an ancient venetian family, he is a director of the venice heritage foundation.\n\ntoto bergamo rossi: i feel like i'm the doctor of this kind of old patient and i have to do it. i have to check, i have to help\n\njohn dickerson: if venice is a patient, is it time to call the ambulance?\n\ntoto bergamo rossi: now i think is like, how you call that kind of department (laugh) that they put you the mask and you are in (laugh)\n\njohn dickerson: oh yeah, the intensive care unit.\n\ntoto bergamo rossi: intensive care (laughs) exactly. now we are in intensive care. completely.\n\ntoto bergamo rossi\n\nbut it wasn't just one flood. for days in november, venetians woke to the sound of tones warning of more record breaking tides. venice has always been vulnerable. the city is also slowly sinking, but the water is rising higher and more frequently. three of the eight highest tides in venice's recorded history occurred just in november. this is becoming the new normal. and water-logged venetians wonder how much more this ancient city can take.\n\nmayor luigi brugnaro (translation): the frequency, it's like an earthquake. when there are too many, then it means something is happening. i see it as an opportunity to wake up the world.\n\nluigi brugnaro, a conservative and former businessman, is venice's elected mayor.\n\njohn dickerson: are you convinced that the recent water rise, the frequency of the water rise is the results of manmade climate change?\n\nmayor luigi brugnaro (translation): yes, of course. yes, these are the effects of climate change.\n\nvenice mayor luigi brugnaro\n\nthese extreme events are damaging many of venice's masterpieces, like the 900-year-old basilica of st. mark, known as the church of gold. its marble floors were swamped on november 12, and downstairs water buried the crypt for only the second time ever. the water receded but left behind salt, which italians call the cancer because it eats away at mosaics and foundations. pierpaolo campostrini, who helps manage the basilica, pled for his church and his city.\n\npierpaolo campostrini: i'm emotional. i'm also a bit angry about this.\n\njohn dickerson: who are you angry at?\n\npierpaolo campostrini: it's the fault of my generation. so i don't want to leave to my children this responsibility. my generation should act.\n\nthis past november, venice nearly lost another of its gems. at la fenice, where verdi debuted his operas la traviata and rigoletto, november's flood hit days before the season opener. once the danger was over, fortunato ortombina, la fenice's artistic director, relived the drama of the panic backstage.\n\ncorrespondent john dickerson with fortunato ortombina, la fenice's artistic director\n\nfortunato ortombina: can you imagine this tube with a water? coming out like a fountain.\n\nfortunato ortombina: it was completely under the water.\n\njohn dickerson: and it's never supposed to have any water.\n\nfortunato ortombina: no, no, no, no, no. if the water arrives, on the cable, on the line, where you have electricity, it explode. it explode.\n\nmiraculously, it didn't. and with vacuums running around the clock, the water went down so the curtain could go up. the opening scene from verdi's don carlo? a prayer for the dead.\n\nmichael oppenheimer: venice is facing an existential threat essentially to the city as it has been.\n\njohn dickerson: you say venice is dying. those are the stakes for you?\n\nmichael oppenheimer: those are the stakes.\n\nmichael oppenheimer\n\nmichael oppenheimer is a professor of geosciences at princeton university. he was a lead author of a landmark report for the united nations on climate change that found coastal cities are increasingly at risk from sea level rise.\n\njohn dickerson: when people look at venice and what is happening in venice, more floods, faster and higher, what message should they take for the rest of the world?\n\nmichael oppenheimer: the rest of the world should take the message that this is what the situation's gonna look like in many places that they live in. venice is just, you know, as everybody says, the canary in the coal mine. it's happening there now.\n\nclimate change, oppenheimer says, is the major reason we'll see more floods for the ages across the globe, like the one that hit venice two months ago.\n\nmichael oppenheimer: sea level is rising almost everywhere on earth. not only is sea level rising the rise is accelerating. it's happening faster and faster.\n\njohn dickerson: how much faster has that pace quickened?\n\nmichael oppenheimer: so by the year 2050, which is only 30 years into the future, many places around the world, including in the u.s., are gonna experience their historical once in a hundred year flood level once a year or more frequently. let me repeat that. an event that used to cause severe flooding once a century, we're gonna get that same water level once a year.\n\njohn dickerson: and what cities are we talking about?\n\nmichael oppenheimer: places like los angeles, san diego, key west, miami, jacksonville, savannah, honolulu.\n\neric kerchner/cbs news\n\nbut at least there is a plan to defend venice. we headed out to one of the three inlets where the tides from the adriatic sea flow into the lagoon that surrounds the city. this is where venetians hope that a controversial project called moses will part the waters. more than 30 years in the making, moses is supposed to deploy 78 retractable gates to block exceptional high tides, as this animation illustrates. construction finally began in 2003 but corruption scandals and engineering challenges have delayed moses years past its due date.\n\njohn dickerson: after all the tests are done, when are you saying that moses will be ready?\n\nalessandro soru: it's now planned for the end of 2021.\n\nin a tunnel 60 feet below sea level, we met alessandro soru, the project's lead engineer.\n\njohn dickerson: so how many days a year was it planned that moses would be used?\n\nalessandro soru: say an average of 10 days a year.\n\nbut the fear is if the adriatic continues to rise past projections, the moses gates may have to be raised nearly every day by the middle of this century. it was not designed for that kind of wear and tear.\n\nthe worst flood in venice's history happened in 1966. it was only a few inches higher than this past november's. back in '66, experts said the flood was a once-in-800 year event. nonetheless, thousands of venetians left for good.\n\nshaul bassi: it really was the major historic turning point in the recent history of the city. and we thought that something like that would not happen again.\n\nshaul bassi is a product of that flood. a professor of english literature at venice's ca'foscari university, his parents met when his mother went to venice to help the flood victims. they stayed, but how many will now that the seasonal high tides, known as acqua altas, are getting worse.\n\neric kerchner/cbs news\n\njohn dickerson: explain how it was different this time from previous acqua altas…\n\nshaul bassi: so i think that people now feels far more vulnerable. we're hearing the sirens now (sirens in background). acqua alta's coming back. you see? this is what happened. it's happening every day now. this never happened like that. you know, it happens one, two, three days. now, it's like, over a week that every day we have that. this is new.\n\njohn dickerson: when you hear the sirens, does that take you back?\n\nshaul bassi: so i (pointing), you know, now it really makes me feel very nervous.\n\nduring our eight days in venice, we found the city on edge because the water keeps defeating the accommodations residents have already made to it.\n\nshaul bassi: the real, real threat, as far as i'm concerned, is that it may actually push even more people away and will leave the city as a kind of ghost town, as a beautiful empty museum.\n\nthe ground floors in this stooped and shrinking city have already been abandoned. life is lived on the first story and above. artisans like saverio pastor, one of the last who patiently crafts oar locks for the city's gondolas, are becoming scarce. while residents weigh moving out, the tourists keep marching in, donning neon booties and learning to walk on water or in single file on the hastily assembled footbridges that lace through what may be a doomed city.\n\nto give venice a future, its mayor wants to turn the city into a world laboratory to combat climate change.\n\nmayor luigi brugnaro (translation): why don't we do it here? let's do it here, let's study it here. let's study the water, let's study the pollution, the rising waters, the temperature. it could be an example of great mobilization at a world level.\n\njohn dickerson: is the message to the rest of the world, if you don't save venice, it will happen to you next?\n\nmayor luigi brugnaro (translation): i don't want to worry anybody, but i think that i'd like a different message. let's save venice to save the world.\n\nvenice has survived before. every november, venetians flock to the santa maria della salute church, which was built to commemorate the end of the 17th century plague that killed 50,000 citizens. this year's ceremony, in the wake of the flood, had a special resonance.\n\nshaul bassi: the festival is a festival about survival.\n\n\n\njohn dickerson: was it more well-attended this year than it woulda been in the past?\n\nshaul bassi: absolutely. i think that it was more heartfelt. i think a lot of people this time felt, you know, 'this might not be there forever.' i think this is what has perhaps changed, that a lot of us are feeling, 'well, we cannot take this for granted.'\n\nwhat would be lost is a city where so much of the art interprets the natural beauty of light that arrives twice a day, once from the sun and once as it is reflected back off the water, but venice is no longer just something beautiful to look at. its fragility is a warning to the rest of the planet that this ancient city is under pressures from forces it cannot control. venice is not alone. in a world of warming temperatures and sea level rise, no place is an island.\n\nproduced by draggan mihailovich. associate producer, jacqueline williams. field producer, sabina castelfranco. broadcast associate, claire fahy. edited by warren lustig.
1968 was a year like no other, not least because it was the year the beatles won four grammys for an album like no other.\n\nwith mark phillips this morning, we'll be doing some time traveling:\n\nright from the first ka-thump of stylus hitting vinyl, and into the instrumental run-in to the first track … you knew the world would never be the same.\n\nit was twenty years ago today\n\nsgt. pepper taught the band to play…\n\n\n\nit was fifty years ago this month, actually, that sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band won four grammys, including album of the year. but the album did more than win awards and set sales records; it divided time, between the world before sgt. pepper … and the world after.\n\nthe back cover of sgt. pepper's lonely hearts club band capitol records\n\nit was more than just a different kind of album cover full of famous people. it was a different kind of album -- the concept album, performed by a different kind of band, a band that couldn't hear itself think, let alone play, over the screaming of its fans.\n\na band, as paul mccartney explained back in 1967, that had to retreat to the recording studio to find itself again. performance, for us, see, it's gone downhill, performance, because we can't develop when no one can hear us, he said. so, for us to perform it's difficult. so we're trying to get better with things like recording.\n\nthe beatles (ringo starr, john lennon, george harrison and paul mccartney) at the abbey road recording studios in london. apple\n\ngiles martin, the son of george martin (the legendary beatles producer and the man behind the technological inventiveness that took sgt. pepper to places pop music had never been), told phillips, like a champagne bottle plopping out of a cork, they were released from beatlemania. they deliberately pulled themselves out of beatlemania.\n\npicture yourself in a boat on a river\n\nwith tangerine trees and marmalade skies\n\nsomebody calls you, you answer quite slowly\n\na girl with kaleidoscope eyes cellophane flowers of yellow and green\n\ntowering over your head\n\nlook for the girl with the sun in her eyes\n\nand she's gone\n\nlucy in the sky with diamonds\n\nby the way, the urban legend that lucy in the sky with diamonds was code for lsd is another one of those beatles stories that just won't die, even though the official version is that the song was based on a drawing done by john's son.\n\nphilips asked, did they know at the time that they had changed rock history?\n\ni'm not sure if it was deliberate, martin replied, but they wanted to do different things all of the time. you know, they wanted different sounds. they asked my dad, you know, 'how'd you get this sound?' or 'how can we do this?' the conscious decision was, 'we don't wanna be bored by what we're doing.' it wasn't 'how can we change the face of popular music?'\n\nbut that, of course, is exactly what they did. and giles martin -- who's become a very successful music producer himself -- has done a highly-praised remix of the album at the surviving beatles' request. comparing the old and new versions can be a little 50-years-on fun.\n\nexcerpt: original version of being for the benefit of mr. kite your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nexcerpt: remix of being for the benefit of mr. kite your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nand 50 years later, the re-mix has also topped the album charts.\n\nit's like turning back the hands of time 50 years, to coin a phrase. but it actually brings me back to places i'd rather not remember! phillips laughed. but, i prefer the new mix.\n\ni'll pay you! martin quipped.\n\nnostalgia aside, part of sgt. pepper's enduring appeal may be as much about when it was, as what it was.\n\ni think people back now on the summer of love, 1967, the summer when 'sgt. pepper' was number one, and out of every window came 'sgt. pepper,' said paul gambaccini, a dj, author, and walking pop music encyclopedia. it was unbelievable. everybody was doing the same thing at the same time. they had to hear this record.\n\nphillips said, it came at a period where the beatles could do no wrong; everything they touched turned to gold. and you can explain it in terms of talent, certainly, but it also had a kind of cultural momentum.\n\nthe amusing thing is that although most people acclaimed it, at the moment of its release, the new york times critic richard goldstein panned it, said gambaccini.\n\n[hated it, as in there is nothing beautiful on 'sergeant pepper.' nothing is real and there is nothing to get hung about … an album of special effects, dazzling but ultimately fraudulent.]\n\ngoldstein (did i get it wrong? i think so!) now recants.\n\nhe told phillips, what i didn't pick up was where it was leading music. that decision to take music and blast all the framework that pop music had been encased in like a very tight girdle and just let it flow freely was incredibly influential on the counter-culture, and on the whole history of music.\n\nnothing flowed more freely than that endless final chord:\n\nfrom a day in the life your browser does not support the audio element.\n\nsitting at the console and getting to play with the most famous chord in rock 'n roll history doesn't happen often. phillips said, there's just so much more in the new one. so much more …\n\nand like its final chord, sgt. pepper, it seems, goes on forever.\n\n\n\nsee also:\n\n\n\nfor more info:\n\n\n\nmore from the sunday morning series remembering 1968:
siegfried fischbacher, the surviving member of the magic duo siegfried & roy who entertained millions with illusions using rare animals, has died in las vegas, his publicist told the associated press. he was 81.\n\nfischbacher died wednesday at his home from pancreatic cancer, dave kirvin of kirvin doak communications said thursday. the news was first reported by german news agency dpa.\n\nfischbacher's longtime show business partner, roy horn, died last year of complications from covid-19 at a las vegas hospital. he was 75.\n\nthe duo astonished millions with their extraordinary magic tricks until horn was critically injured in 2003 by one of the act's famed white tigers.\n\nin an interview with cbs' sunday morning, fischbacher called the attack an accident and held the tiger blameless. the cat realized, 'oh my god, i did something wrong,' and felt bad about it, fischbacher said.\n\nin a statement announcing horn's death in may, fischbacher said, from the moment we met, i knew roy and i, together, would change the world. there could be no siegfried without roy, and no roy without siegfried.\n\nhe later told germany's weekly bild am sonntag newspaper his best friend would always stay by his side.\n\nfor dinner, i will continue to have the table set for him, too. like it always was the case. i'm not alone, dpa quoted fischbacher as telling the newspaper.\n\nfor years, siegfried & roy was an institution in las vegas, where fischbacher and horn's magic and artistry consistently attracted sellout crowds. the pair performed six shows a week, 44 weeks per year.\n\nhorn and fischbacher, both natives of germany, first teamed up in 1957 and made their las vegas debut a decade later. siegfried & roy began performing at the mirage in 1990.\n\nit's hard not to imagine siegfried & roy somewhere, reunited, doing two shows nightly, to a perpetual standing ovation, the mirage said on twitter. rest in paradise, siegfried fischbacher.\n\nit's hard not to imagine siegfried & roy somewhere, reunited, doing two shows nightly, to a perpetual standing ovation. rest in paradise, siegfried fischbacher. https://t.co/iwm6xhytlr — the mirage (@themiragelv) january 14, 2021\n\nthe pair gained international recognition for helping to save rare white tigers and white lions from extinction. their $10 million compound was home to dozens of rare animals over the years. the white lions and white tigers were the result of a preservation program that began in the 1980s.\n\nthe siegfried & roy show incorporated animal antics and magic tricks, featuring 20 white tigers and lions, the number varying depending on the night. the show also had other exotic animals, including an elephant.\n\nborn on june 13, 1939, in rosenheim in bavaria, fischbacher learned his first magic tricks as a young boy, dpa reported.\n\nhorn and fischbacher met on a cruise ship in 1957. fischbacher performed the magic tricks, while horn became his assistant, eventually suggesting using the cheetah in the act.\n\nthey honed their animal-magic show in small clubs in germany and switzerland in the mid-1960s. their break came in a monte carlo casino when an agent in the audience invited them to las vegas. the pair made their debut at the tropicana hotel-casino in the late 1960s.\n\nthe illusionists became popular in the 1970s, receiving their first star billing in 1978 as headliners of the stardust's lido de paris. their show beyond belief opened in 1981 at the frontier and played to thousands over seven years.\n\nwhen they signed a lifetime contract with the mirage in 2001, it was estimated they had performed 5,000 shows at the casino for 10 million fans since 1990 and had grossed more than $1 billion.\n\nthroughout the history of las vegas, no artists have meant more to the development of las vegas' global reputation as the entertainment capital of the world than siegfried and roy, terry lanni, chairman of mgm mirage, the casino's parent company, said after the 2003 attack that injured horn.\n\nfuneral services will be private with plans for a public memorial in the future.
starbucks (sbux) is learning the hard way not to get between coffee lovers and their free venti mocha lattes.\n\nthe coffee chain is under fire from customers after changing its loyalty program so that customers must spend more to earn a free drink or treat. under the current program, customers earn a star for each visit to starbucks. the new system, which takes effect in april, will give two stars for each $1 spent.\n\ncan't find one positive tweet about @starbucks and @starbucksgold new rewards program. i guess it starts with not blaming customer for greed — orny adams (@ornyadams) february 23, 2016\n\nthat might not sound bad, but the catch comes in how starbucks will start doling out rewards based on stars. currently, it takes 30 visits to earn gold status, and then another 12 visits to earn a free drink or treat. the new system will require customers to earn 300 stars to merely reach gold status, and then earn an additional 125 stars to receive a freebie.\n\nyour new loyalty program requires your loyal supporters to spend 25 percent more than the current program to earn a reward, one customer wrote on twitter, adding the hashtag #unrequited.\n\nother starbucks customers vowed to switch to other coffee chains, with a few pointing out that dunkin' donuts reward system offers more to customers. dunkin' donuts' program rewards a free drink for every $40 customers spend at the chain.\n\nby comparison, starbucks' new system will require customers to spend $62.50 to get a free drink, although that's after they've already reached the gold level.\n\nwow @starbucks your new #starbucksrewards isn't very rewarding. 20 visits v 12 to unlock freebies? time to give my @dunkindonuts app a try — bill binan (@whitepants) february 23, 2016\n\non starbucks' facebook page, customers are venting their spleen, calling the changes a joke, really bad and pretty stupid. others lamented that it will take them much longer -- and require more spending -- for them to reach the gold level. many told starbucks they planned to stop buying their coffee at its stores.\n\nstarbucks didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nthe company said the changes were made in response to customer feedback, and claimed that earning rewards will be just as fast or faster for gold-level members. for others, though, it might mean taking a little longer to get that free treat, the company acknowledged on its website.\n\nthe changes may hurt small spenders the most, according to an analysis by the associated press. a customer spending $2 for regular coffee would earn a free item after spending $24 over 12 visits, but the new system will require them to visit more than 31 times -- spending about $62.50 -- to earn the freebie.\n\nbut even big spenders were annoyed by the change, with one customer writing on facebook, a venti espresso drink is around $4.65ish pre-tax in my neck of the woods. i assume the taxes we pay does not get counted towards our stars. so now i need to buy about 13.4 drinks instead of 12 to get the freebie. not a fan of this change to the rewards program.\n\nanother customer added, way to reward your loyal customers, starbucks.
the u.s. food and drug administration has suggested britain's drug regulator may be gambling with public safety by expanding the time gap between administration of the first and second doses of pfizer's coronavirus vaccine beyond that proven safe and effective by trial data. the fda warned in a statement on monday that there was a potential for harm if people believed they were protected against covid-19 by a first dose of pfizer's vaccine for longer than available data demonstrate.\n\nfacing a dramatic surge in both infections and hospitalizations — fueled, according to u.k. officials, by a more infectious strain of the coronavirus discovered in southeast england — british officials decided last week to change their inoculation strategy.\n\nthe focus is now on getting as many people as possible a first dose of either the pfizer shot or the other approved for use in the u.k., developed by oxford university and astrazeneca. under government policy, the second doses of both vaccines can be put off for up to 12 weeks.\n\noxford scientists have said their trial data supports allowing a window of up to 12 weeks between shots, and that their vaccine will provide protection to the full extent possible (up to 74% effective at preventing symptomatic covid-19 infection) for that full period.\n\npfizer hasn't said that, however. along with its german partner biontech, the american pharmaceutical maker has made it clear that their trial data only shows efficacy for 21 days after a first dose.\n\nthe u.k. regulator appears to be making an assumption based on the available data from the pfizer-biontech phase 3 human trials.\n\nthe decision was made to update the dosage interval recommendations for the pfizer-biontech vaccine following a thorough review of the data by the mhra's covid-19 vaccines benefit risk expert working group, a spokesperson for the u.k.'s medicines and healthcare regulatory agency told cbs news on tuesday.\n\nthe spokesperson said the working group concluded that vaccine efficacy will be maintained with dosing intervals longer than 21 days… based on clinical trial data that showed the vaccine was 90.5% effective against preventing covid-19 after the first dose once the protection that starts at around 12 days kicks in, and there was no evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of the vaccine is declining towards the end of the 21-day period following the first dose.\n\nbut as the fda and pfizer have said, there's also no data to show that the effectiveness of the first dose lasts until the 12-week mark, or anything near it. the fda approved the pfizer vaccine for emergency use with a maximum of 21 days between the first and second doses.\n\nsuggesting changes to the fda-authorized dosing or schedules of these vaccines is premature and not rooted solidly in the available evidence, the u.s. agency said in its statement. without appropriate data supporting such changes in vaccine administration, we run a significant risk of placing public health at risk, undermining the historic vaccination efforts to protect the population from covid-19.\n\nif people do not truly know how protective a vaccine is, there is the potential for harm because they may assume that they are fully protected when they are not, and accordingly, alter their behavior to take unnecessary risks, the fda warned.\n\npeople line up for a covid-19 vaccination at guys hospital in london, england, on january 5, 2021. dan kitwood/getty\n\nwith the worst covid-19 epidemic in europe, and one that is worsening fast, britain's strategy was clearly born of urgency. it's a bid to provide as many people with some immunity as fast as possible to try and stem the dramatic spread of the virus, and it the u.k. isn't alone in considering the measure.\n\ngerman health minister jens spahn confirmed this week that the government was considering extending the length of time between the first and second doses of the pfizer-biontech vaccine, citing the example set by the u.k.\n\nspahn stressed, however, that germany's health ministry would await guidance from the standing committee on vaccination at the national health agency, the robert koch institute, before making a final decision.
werner herzog's latest film, salt and fire, has been dubbed an ecological thriller -- and he's not happy about that. the prolific filmmaker told cbs news that the descriptor took off before anyone had seen the film, and he doesn't think it's an accurate label.\n\nherzog also discussed the changing film industry, giving netflix a try and why individuals should stop worrying about government action and work to make the environment better themselves.\n\ndo you see an ecological thriller like this as a kind of cautionary tale for contemporary audiences?\n\nno, no. when you say ecological thriller, this is one of those stupidities that somehow emerged on the internet. nobody had seen the film, but somehow they decided to label it an ecological thriller, and that caught on. it's not an ecological thriller; it's a story about a mysterious hostage-taking where a woman who heads a small group of scientists is taken hostage and deliberately stranded in some gigantic salt flats together with two blind local boys.\n\nso you would rather that description hadn't come up?\n\nyeah, sometimes i find they're labeling a film that i've done before anyone has even seen anything of the film. the film itself will speak for itself and live its own life.\n\nare you concerned about environmental issues, considering your work and experience?\n\nyes, to some degree. but instead of waiting for politics to do something about it, i think i'm doing what almost everybody should do -- reduce your waste of energy, for example, by maybe 25 or 30 percent. we can do that easily. whenever i walk out of a room, i switch off the light. and i use my car only 10 percent of what i would do 20 years ago. for me, it's very easy to pay attention and not wait for big international accords like the paris agreement or for the american president to do something for or against the environment. we should forget about politics.\n\nthat sounds like a much more practical approach.\n\nwe live in affluence and we live in a consumer civilization, which creates a lot of damage. we are damaging our resources.\n\ndo you see this film in any way as a companion piece to into the inferno, your documentary about volcanoes?\n\nno, not really. it's a coincidence that in both films there are volcanoes. in salt and fire, yes, there is a volcano that plays a marginal role in it. and it happened only because where i filmed in bolivia -- at the largest salt flats in the world -- there is a volcano, and i just wouldn't like to bypass it completely.\n\nbut you wanted to focus more on potential manmade disasters.\n\nyeah, but what is described in the film is completely fictitious. the widening of salt flats is not an ecological disaster. it doesn't happen, and it's completely invented. but it could be any other kind of disaster.\n\nwhat was the thinking, then, in creating this particular disaster?\n\nwell, it started with a short story by tom bissell, which is a mysterious hostage-taking around a gigantic dried-out lake in central asia -- which, by the way, was a human-made disaster. i decided not to shoot there for logistical reasons. it looks fairly boring there. i decided i should look out for something completely different, and it took a very short time before i came across the salt flats in bolivia.\n\nwhich are very visually striking. what was your first impression of the area?\n\nthat it looks like not from our planet. there's something extraterrestrial about it, and it's a scary vision that one day our entire planet might look like those salt flats.\n\nthe film industry continues to change. how has your approach to getting a documentary or a narrative film produced?\n\nfor me, whether i do a documentary or a feature film, it doesn't make much difference. it's all movies for me, and many of my documentaries are in fact not real documentaries. they're feature films in disguise. but of course some of the old-fashioned distribution systems are not functioning anymore. the best-functioning distribution system today is still piracy. but of course there are new forms like the internet, and this is why i'm testing the waters with into the inferno, which is a netflix release.\n\nhow have your experiences been so far with that?\n\nwell, it worked out well so far. the only downside is that you do not connect to your film anymore. you do not have any feedback like when you are with a theater audience. i think in particular for the younger generation it is necessary to find new functioning modes of distribution, and i do believe it's shifting much more towards the internet. there's nothing wrong about it.\n\nsalt and fire is available on vod and itunes and in theaters friday.
in 2002, the singer sparkle, whose real name is stephanie edwards, claimed her niece was the underage girl in an infamous sex video featuring r. kelly. although a jury acquitted r. kelly, the lifetime docuseries surviving r. kelly now credits sparkle with shining a light on some of his alleged abuses.\n\nbe careful, sparkle's duet with r. kelly in 1998, was the no. 1 r&b hip-hop song for six weeks. about four years later, their professional relationship crumbled amid accusations kelly was sexually abusing sparkle's then 14-year-old niece.\n\n\n\ni was the first person who spoke up and out against him, and i did it alone, sparkle told cbs news correspondent jericka duncan.\n\nsparkle said she initially wanted kelly to help her niece become a rap artist.\n\n\n\ni didn't just throw my niece to the wolves, she said. i introduced my entire family to robert, not just my niece… my sister and my brother-in-law brought her down to the studio.\n\nin an emotional interview in the docuseries, sparkle said she should have never introduced my family to him.\n\nwhy do you still blame yourself? duncan asked her.\n\ni just feel partially responsible for the introduction, sparkle responded.\n\nshe said she became concerned when her niece started showing up at kelly's studio unaccompanied. sparkle claimed she even called child protective services. her worst fears, she said, were confirmed when she saw a video of what she believed was kelly and her niece engaged in a sex act.\n\n\n\nthe guy comes over, he shows me the first few seconds of the tape, and it's her. i don't need to see anymore, sparkle said.\n\nsparkle was a key prosecution witness at kelly's trial for child pornography. but her niece, her sister, and her brother-in-law – who had become kelly's guitarist – refused to testify. kelly was acquitted in 2008.\n\n\n\ni was kind of ostracized, if you will, sparkle said, referring to her family.\n\nis it your understanding that people in your family settled or had some sort of agreement with r. kelly? duncan asked.\n\ni don't know if any money was exchanged, you know, from robert to them to shut up. or if they signed something. i don't know if he threatened them. i don't know anything. they're not talking, sparkle said.\n\nshe said she's not sure if her niece is with kelly, but she's still concerned about her safety if her niece still interacts with him.\n\nbecause mentally… the girls… he's got them brainwashed, sparkle said. i'm really scared of that.\n\nkelly's attorney, steve greenberg, told cbs news sparkle's claims were absurd. sparkle is using her rejected allegations (jury did not believe her) to try and jump start her failed career, he said. it is beyond transparent.\n\nasked how much of the me too movement played in her decision to speak out, sparkle said, i wish they were along for the ride way back when in 2001 when i came up.\n\ni feel sometimes that black women… we don't get the same, you now, notoriety or interaction, so to speak, as our white counterparts, and i wanted that to change, sparkle said.\n\nwhat do you think is so different about this moment culturally now? duncan asked.\n\nthey're believing now. they're listening more, sparkle said. while she said she's not sure what's next, she hopes kelly gets help.\n\nhe really needs to get help, and then they can send him off to jail, sparkle said.\n\nsparkle released a new single titled, we are ready, around the time the lifetime docuseries began airing. in it, she sings about how she will no longer suffer in silence. kelly has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing, and no new criminal charges have been filed against him.\n\ndon russell, an adviser to kelly, claimed multiple record labels are interested in working with him after he was dropped by rca records. he told rolling stone magazine: i think he's outgrown rca. he's ready for the next level of life, anyway. protesters demanded that rca ditch the r&b legend, after surviving r. kelly detailed years of sexual abuse allegations.
as u.s. financial markets close out their most volatile week in years, stocks in china have also been rocked by a selloff. the benchmark shanghai index closed down nearly 10 percent for the week, while the tech-heavy shenzhen fell 7.8 percent.\n\ninvestors have different, though related, concerns about the world's two largest economies. in the u.s., the first market correction -- a 10 percent or more decline from stocks' recent high -- in two years was sparked by concerns over rising inflation and the future path of interest rates. the ripple effects overseas are now heightening concerns about financial stability in china, a main engine of global economic growth.\n\ninvesting in mainland chinese equities is in its infancy for most u.s. investors. that is set to change in may when china a shares will be included in the msci em index, which is widely held by u.s. pension funds. but domestic investors already have exposure to china through their ownership of multinational corporations that do business in china, including major technology companies, industrial giants, retailers and restaurant chains.\n\na longtime challenge for investors is the secrecy shrouding political and economic decisions in beijing, along with reliability of chinese government data.\n\nat the end of the day, the major political and economic decisions in china come down to what seven guys in the politburo standing committee, the major decision-making body of the chinese communist party, decide to do, gabe lipton, global macro strategist with gzero media, said in an interview with cbsn. it's not like the u.s., where we know what the fed is going to do, we know how the u.s. treasury is going to react.\n\nanother issue for those trying to gauge china's economic performance is assessing the accuracy of the country's official reports. regional governments in some provinces admitted to falsifying data during a downturn in 2015, when a commodity rout slammed sectors that specialize in metals and mining. questions about the validity of china's official gdp, unemployment, productivity and other data remains a challenge for global policymakers and for stakeholders looking to invest in the region.\n\nthere's a history of chinese data being pretty opaque and us not knowing what's happening. if there's a major crisis, we have to sort of ask -- what's going to be at the top of the government's priority list? lipton said. is it going to be giving people a really clear picture of what's going on in the country ... or maybe changing things to make them look a bit rosier than they actually are?
washington -- melting ice sheets in greenland and antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise, new satellite research shows. at the current rate, the world's oceans on average will be at least 2 feet -- 61 centimeters -- higher by the end of the century compared to today, according to researchers who published in monday's proceedings of the national academies of sciences.\n\nsea level rise is caused by warming of the ocean and melting from glaciers and ice sheets. the research, based on 25 years of satellite data, shows that pace has quickened, mainly from the melting of massive ice sheets. it confirms scientists' computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the united nations, which releases regular climate change reports.\n\nit's a big deal because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author steve nerem of the university of colorado.\n\noutside scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion.\n\nany flooding concerns that coastal communities have for 2100 may occur over the next few decades, oregon state university coastal flooding expert katy serafin said in an email.\n\nof the 3 inches -- 7.5 centimeters -- of sea level rise in the past quarter century, about 55 percent is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice. but the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of that acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in greenland and antarctica, the study shows.\n\nlike weather and climate, there are two factors in sea level rise: year-to-year small rises and falls that are caused by natural events and larger long-term rising trends that are linked to man-made climate change. nerem's team removed the natural effects of the 1991 mt. pinatubo volcano eruption that temporarily chilled earth and the temperature variations linked to el nino and la nina, and found the accelerating trend.\n\n\n\nsea level rise, more than temperature, is a better gauge of climate change in action, said anny cazenave, director of earth science at the international space science institute in france, who edited the study. cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research.\n\nglobal sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century when they rose and then accelerated due to global warming caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, said climate scientist stefan rahmstorf of the potsdam institute in germany, who wasn't part of the study.\n\ntwo feet of sea level rise by the end of the century would have big effects on places like miami and new orleans, but i don't still view that as catastrophic because those cities can survive -- at great expense -- that amount of rising seas under normal situations, nerem said. but when a storm hits like 2012's superstorm sandy, sea level rise on top of storm surge can lead to record-setting damages, researchers said.\n\nsome scientists at the american geophysical union meeting last year said antarctica may be melting faster than predicted by monday's study. greenland has caused three times more sea level rise than antarctica so far, but ice melt on the southern continent is responsible for more of the acceleration.\n\nantarctica seems less stable than we thought a few years ago, rutgers climate scientist robert kopp said.
for many americans, starting the new year on the right foot means committing to a dry january, or giving up alcohol for the first month of the year. experts say it can be a good idea.\n\na month of thanksgiving, holiday parties and new year's typically means a lot of great food and lots of alcohol involved with all of that, so a good way to start the new year is to abstain from one thing or another — and certainly alcohol can be one of those vices that you choose, dr. neha vyas, a family physician at cleveland clinic, told cbs news.\n\nshe notes that abstaining for one month at a time is also a more feasible goal than going cold turkey forever.\n\nhealth benefits of a month without alcohol\n\ngiving up drinking for a month may offer a number of health benefits.\n\nfor starters, alcohol can disrupt your sleep so not drinking may lead to more well-rested nights.\n\nwe know that alcohol interferes with rem sleep so abstaining from that can improve it and cause you to sleep better, which can have secondary benefits like increased productivity, and allow you to wake up early and not be groggy so you can take on the day or maybe even get some early morning exercise in, vyas said.\n\nalcohol also has a lot of calories, so cutting it out will help those aiming to shrink their waistline. abstaining from alcohol means you can easily cut 150 calories per drink, so multiply that by however many drinks you have in a week and there you go. there's weight loss right there, vyas said.\n\ndrinking alcohol also affects your immune system, making you more susceptible to colds and other viruses, so abstaining can help you fight off germs more effectively.\n\nand since alcohol can lead to dehydration, cutting it out may lead to improved skin in a typically dry winter month that can already take a toll on your complexion.\n\nof course, over the long run a drinking habit can have much more serious health consequences, increasing the risk of liver disease, heart disease, stroke and several types of cancer. in one recent study, even moderate drinking was linked to lower brain function over time.\n\nhave a plan in place\n\nonce you decide to make it a dry january, it's important to have a plan to help you succeed.\n\nthe best thing you can do is plan ahead of time. if you're going to a friend's house or out to dinner and know others will be drinking, know exactly what you're going to do or say, vyas said. if you like to end your day with a glass of wine at dinner, know what you're going to do in place of the wine. know if you're going to have a non-alcoholic drink, a seltzer water.\n\nshe warns that most signficant health effects won't be seen immediately but suggests that starting with a month cutting out alcohol could jump-start further change.\n\nevaluate your reasons for why you're abstaining for a month – whether it's a social reason or a weight loss reason – and then go from there with making new goals, vyas said.\n\nshould anyone not do a dry january?\n\npeople who are addicted to alcohol may experience withdrawal symptoms. vyas advises speaking to your doctor to come up with a plan to lessen your alcohol intake and potentially seek professional treatment.\n\nmillions of americans who are not alcohol dependent still drink to excess. the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism defines binge drinking as a pattern of drinking that brings a person's blood alcohol concentration (bac) to 0.08 grams percent or above. this typically happens when men consume five or more drinks, or women consume four or more drinks, in about a two-hour period. while most people who binge drink are not alcoholics, if you do so regularly, you may be at risk for alcohol dependency.
it was unusually early for cbs news' john dickerson to arrive at the network's washington bureau on sunday to moderate a broadcast of face the nation. the guests were the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and two longtime senators, chuck schumer and chuck grassley. the topics: north korea, afghanistan, iraq, and a contentious debate over health care reform.\n\nthat all may sound like a description of this past sunday – or really any sunday since dickerson took over as moderator of face the nation in 2015. but it wasn't. it was july 5, 2009, the first time dickerson ever sat in the anchor's chair as a substitute host. (in washington, the old adage rings particularly true: the more things change, the more things remain the same.)\n\nat the time, eight-plus years ago, dickerson was a full-time reporter at slate magazine and a part-time political analyst for cbs news. by 2011, he'd been named the network's political director. and when longtime face the nation moderator bob schieffer stepped down in 2015, dickerson was tapped as his replacement.\n\ndickerson has now begun another chapter at cbs this morning, joining gayle king and norah o'donnell as a co-host. (apparently the alarm clock ringing in the wee hours of the morning was such a joy, he decided he wanted to hear it five days a week, albeit a couple of hours earlier on the weekdays).\n\nas dickerson prepares for his final broadcast as the full time host of face the nation this sunday, we thought it might be fun to take a quick trip down memory lane to remember his first sunday in the job. the video is above, and a transcript is available here.

jeongseon, south korea -- it made no sense to ester ledecka. which is why the part-time ski racer, part-time snowboarder from the czech republic stood so still, absolutely motionless and expressionless, for several moments after crossing the finish line in the olympic super-g and seeing the numbers on a video board that appeared to show she was fast enough to be the gold medalist.\n\nnot merely any gold medalist, but one of the most unconventional and out-of-nowhere gold medalists in alpine history.\n\nthis, the 22-year-old ledecka would explain later, was what went through her mind at that moment: is this a kind of mistake?\n\nthen came this: ok, they're going to change the time. i'm going to wait for a little bit, and you're going to switch and (add) some more seconds.\n\nthat never happened. this was no mistake. this was real. her posted time of 1 minute, 21.11 seconds was, indeed, accurate. it was, indeed, 0.01 seconds -- yes, one one-hundredth of a second -- better than austria's anna veith, the defending olympic champion and, as the leader until the moment when the relatively unknown and low-ranked ledecka took her turn as the 26th woman down the slope, the presumed repeat olympic champion.\n\nester ledecka of czech republic wins the gold medal during the alpine skiing women's super-g at jeongseon alpine centre on february 17, 2018 in pyeongchang-gun, south korea. alexis boichard/agence zoom / getty images\n\ninstead, it was ledecka who collected the prized medal. this is someone who has participated in only 19 world cup skiing races in her entire career -- mikaela shiffrin, in contrast, has been in 23 this season alone -- and only once finished as high as seventh. someone who is a far more accomplished snowboarder, owning a world championship in the parallel giant slalom, an event she plans to enter at the pyeongchang games next week, an unprecedented achievement.\n\ncbs sports writes that ledecka wasn't even riding her own skis. she borrowed american mikaela shiffrin's for the race. within minutes of ledecka's win, shiffrin congratulated her.\n\nester ledecka. 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻 — mikaela shiffrin (@mikaelashiffrin) february 17, 2018\n\nshe's not a medal favorite. she just wanted to come here and be the first person ever to ski and snowboard race, said justin reiter, who competed for the u.s. at the sochi olympics in snowboarding and now is ledecka's coach for that sport. she stayed in her heart and she stayed in her own head and she skied like she can ski and it was beautiful to watch.\n\neverything about this was remarkable. or maybe that doesn't even come close to capturing it. so pick another word. extraordinary. astonishing. unbelievable. it was all of those things, and more, to ledecka herself. to the rest of the field, which included superstar lindsey vonn of the u.s. and other past medalists such as lara gut of switzerland and federica brignone of italy. to everyone.\n\ndefinitely shocking, said vonn, who tied for sixth.\n\njust wow, said switzerland's michelle gisin, a 2017 silver medalist at the world championships who was ninth saturday.\n\nthat pretty much described the day at the jeongseon alpine center, which began with a one-hour delay because of blustery winds that calmed but still played a factor during the race, serving as tailwinds for some skiers but acting as a headwind to others.\n\nwhen things finally began under a clear-as-can-be blue sky, vonn went first. the bronze medalist in super-g and gold medalist in downhill at the 2010 vancouver games but sidelined for the 2014 olympics was fast in stretches. however, she lost a chunk of time both before the midpoint and again on the last key part of the course, a jump-turn combination that she flubbed and was sure cost her a medal.\n\nthat's why it's so difficult to win at the olympics, vonn said. because literally anything can happen.\n\nsure seemed to this time.\n\n(left to right) austria's silver medallist anna fenninger veith, czech republic's gold medallist ester ledecka and liechtenstein's bronze medallist tina weirather pose on the podium during the medal ceremony for the alpine skiing women's super-g at the pyeongchang medals plaza during the pyeongchang 2018 winter olympic games in pyeongchang on february 17, 2018. afp/getty\n\nfirst gut, the 2016 overall world cup champ and a downhill bronze medalist at sochi, temporarily moved into first place. then weirather, the super-g silver medalist at last year's world championships, moved in front by 0.01 seconds. then it was veith who took over first place, by 0.10 seconds. and that's how things stood for the next 10 skiers. it is generally considered unlikely — although not impossible, of course — for anyone outside of the first 20 starters to emerge as the winner.\n\nveith was sure she'd clinched a gold. weirather figured the silver was hers. gut couldn't wait to get that bronze around her neck.\n\nthey were a little bit in shock, ledecka said. they were staring at me a little bit.\n\nnow comes a decision for ledecka. the alpine downhill is wednesday and requires serious training runs down the mountain beforehand. qualifying for her snowboard event is thursday.\n\nso which should she focus on?\n\ni'm sure that my ski coach will be a little bit pushy on downhill, ledecka said. but my snowboard coach wants me on snowboard.\n\nher work in the two sports can help her performance in each.\n\nthe speed from skiing translates to snowboarding. and the balance required in snowboarding is a boost for ski racing. reiter pointed out, for example, that on the same final jump that gave vonn trouble saturday, ledecka's weight shifted too far backward, but she managed to recover.\n\nit was kind of scary there for a moment. she was able to save it, he said. and that's because of her heart and because of her ability with a snowboard.\n\nledecka proved to be pretty adept at her other sport, too.\n\nunlikely as it might have seemed, she forever will be able to call herself an olympic alpine champion.\n\nthe fact that she's able to beat all of us and be a snowboarder is pretty darn impressive, vonn said. at the olympics, a lot of weird stuff happens.
exactly six months ago this evening, hurricane dorian slammed into the northern bahamas. it was the fifth category 5 atlantic hurricane in just the last three years. before that, there hadn't been a single cat-5 storm in nearly a decade.\n\n\n\nthere's a growing consensus among scientists that climate change is what's making hurricanes stronger and more destructive. that's very bad news for the bahamas, a string of more than 700 low-lying islands stretching from florida nearly down to cuba, in the heart of what's come to be known as hurricane alley.\n\nbut the bahamas has found a ray of hope - specifically, a solar array - that can help its islands survive future hurricanes. and in the process, it may have important lessons the rest of the world should learn, as mother nature continues to brew devastating storms like dorian.\n\nhope town after the storm wpec\n\nwith sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, gusts above 200, and a storm surge well over 20 feet in some spots,dorian wreaked unimaginable havoc on the bahamian islands known as the abacos.\n\nthere's not enough words in the dictionary to describe what hope town looked like after that storm, vernon malone told correspondent bill whitaker.\n\nhope town has been malone's home for all of his 82 years. his family has lived here since 1785. he's the town baker and grocer, and he and his wife rode out the storm in his store. it survived, but their home just up the street did not.\n\nvernon's son, brian, had a home just around the corner. had a home.\n\nthat's actually two and a half houses, brian malone said when whitaker pointed out a pile of rubble. mine's on the bottom.\n\nhope town is a bahamian landmark. its candy-striped lighthouse dates to 1863 and is pictured on the country's ten-dollar bill. the lighthouse stood up to dorian, but as we saw coming into the harbor, not much else did.\n\ni hear generators everywhere, whitaker said to brian malone and matt winslow, an american who owns a vacation home on the island. is this how you guys are getting through?\n\nyep, they both said.\n\nwinslow told whitaker why all those generators are still running.\n\nthe substation in marsh harbor which feeds us the power's destroyed, winslow said. and then, of course, you can see all the utility poles-- are pretty much destroyed. so this isn't a case where you-- you come in and replace some poles, and you flick a switch. this is months, and months, and months of-- of work.\n\nhope town is on one of several small islands ravaged by dorian, which then moved across 7 miles of open water to marsh harbour, the largest town in the abacos. at least 60 people died in marsh harbour, and destruction is still everywhere. total damage and loss from dorian is estimated at $3.4 billion.\n\nwhen you see the extent of the destruction, where do you even begin? whitaker asked bahamian prime minister hubert minnis. how do you even begin?\n\nthat's always the question, minnis said. where do we begin?\n\nprime minister minnis and viana gardiner, a top aide, visited marsh harbour with whitaker and pointed to one huge priority: restoring electric power.\n\nhow do you bring this back? whitaker asked.\n\nthe power, minnis said. we had to make determination to set up micro-grids.\n\nbahamian prime minister hubert minnis\n\nthe microgrids prime minister minnis is talking about are small-scale systems. more and more, they're solar arrays with battery storage for when the sun's not shining. they can either feed electricity into the larger grid or operate independently to power a single facility or a neighborhood. the way electricity has been produced in the bahamas is with diesel-fueled generating stations on each inhabited island, about 30 in all, feeding power to everyone through overhead lines.\n\nthe main power plant for this island is literally 25 miles south of here, chris burgess said. that's 25 miles of line that has to be rebuilt.\n\nburgess and justin locke run the 'islands energy program' for an american non-profit called the rocky mountain institute. they have solar projects throughout hurricane alley. after category 5 maria hit puerto rico in 2017, they put microgrids on the roofs of ten schools. maria also brushed st. vincent, which has now installed its first microgrid. now, the islands energy program has come to marsh harbour.\n\nso how big will this solar array be? whitaker asked.\n\n15 acres, burgess said. right through here.\n\nthat microgrid will satisfy 10% of marsh harbour's total power needs, and will be built right between its government center and hospital, both of which were without power for weeks after dorian.\n\nthis is high ground, which makes it less vulnerable to storm surge or other types of disaster events, locke said.\n\nso if a storm like dorian hits again, the power to these two critical facilities stays on? whitaker asked.\n\ncorrect, locke said.\n\nthe push to build storm-proof solar microgrids in the bahamas began in 2017 after hurricane irma, another category 5 storm, tore through tiny ragged island, at the southern tip of the island chain.\n\nafter ragged island was devastated, i made a statement: let us show the world what can be done, prime minister minnis said. we may be small, but we can set an example to the world.\n\nminnis said it's his goal to make ragged island a green island.\n\nabsolutely. after which, we can expand it. we can expand it, minnis said.\n\nsolar array on ragged island\n\nto see the prime minister's green experiment, whitaker flew to ragged island with whitney heastie, ceo of government-owned utility bahamas power and light. engineer burlington strachan met them there and took us to what he calls the very first hurricane-proof solar microgrid being installed in the bahamas.\n\nunlike other solar designs, it's very low to the ground, strachan said. so this installation is rated to withstand 180 mile an hour winds.\n\n180 mph winds are an even harder punch than when irma landed back in 2017.\n\nit was significant devastation on this island as you can see, some of the poles snapped right at the very base of the pole, strachan said. that happened throughout the island.\n\nthis microgrid will produce enough electricity for ragged island's roughly 100 residents. the prime minister calls it a laboratory for the solar future. the past is a diesel generator needing boats to deliver fuel from hundreds of miles away, a system whitney heastie says is a nightmare.\n\nyou know, in summer we're almost on the verge of running out of fuel in some of these islands, because bad weather sometimes prohibits the ships from actually getting to some of these locations, heastie said.\n\nthe bahamian government spends nearly $400 million a year on imported fuel to keep its power plants running and passes that cost along to its citizens. they pay three to four times what people in the mainland u.s. pay for electricity.\n\nright, and that isn't price gouging, burgess said. i mean, that's just inherent cost.\n\neverything costs more in the islands. the bill to install one new solar microgrid on ragged island is $3 million. heastie insists it's money well spent.\n\nso you have this initial big outlay to build these panels, whitaker said to heastie. but over time, the cost of generating power actually goes down?\n\nabsolutely, heastie said. by using what god has blessed us with, which is the natural sun.\n\nit's not a perfect solution on ragged island; notably, the power from these panels will still feed into the vulnerable overhead power lines; the money's not there yet to bury them.\n\none of the first things that i think everyone can agree on is everything has to go underground, matt winslow said.\n\nback in hope town, winslow said they have the funds to bury their lines. americans with second homes here add a lot to the economy, winslow's family foundation has donated nearly a million dollars to rebuilding efforts. they already have a makeshift microgrid powering the fire station and health clinic and winslow has hired engineers to help plan a much bigger one on a nearby island.\n\nit's possible that over in great abaco we could put, you know, a solar array, 18 acres, winslow said. that power is piped through... preferably a new undersea cable to the island. and that could be a main source of our power.\n\nwinslow said that would be enough to power the island.\n\nthe bahamas' goal is to produce 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. justin locke and chris burgess of the islands energy program believe the country can do even better.\n\nthe price of renewables have come down to the point where they're now very, very competitive with diesel, burgess said. and in most cases, way cheaper than diesel.\n\nthe key game changer has been battery storage, locke said. battery storage has decreased in cost over 60% over the last five years. and what battery storage does is it enables the sun to shine when the sun is not shining. renewables make more sense here than anywhere else in the world.\n\nand microgrids in the caribbean are starting to show their value. when earthquakes struck puerto rico in january, the entire island's big electrical grid was shut down for days. but remember those solar microgrids installed at schools? they kept providing power. the lessons can really apply anywhere.\n\ncalifornia has the same system architecture as here in the caribbean, right? fossil fuel, long transmission distribution lines, locke said. and you see that pg&e had to proactively shut off power to millions of people in order to prevent fire.\n\nif there had been these micro grids might it have been that pg&e would not have had to cut off power to millions of consumers? whitaker asked.\n\ncorrect. correct, locke said.\n\nhere in the bahamas there are still huge economic obstacles. losses from dorian equal nearly 30% of the country's entire annual gdp.\n\nyou've got this incredible outlay to rebuild these islands that were devastated by dorian, whitaker said to prime minister minnis. can you afford to bring on a new form of electrical generation?\n\nwe cannot afford it, minnis said. we recognized from day one that we cannot do it alone.\n\njust weeks after dorian hit, prime minister minnis spoke at the united nations. he emphasized that most of the bahamas was not damaged and eager for tourists, the lifeblood of the economy. then he said that first-world countries and their pollution are at least partly to blame for the threat of ever-stronger hurricanes.\n\nfirst world nations-- and this is what i said at the u.n. i said, 'first world nations make the greatest contribution to climate change,' minnis told whitaker. they are the ones responsible for the changes that we see. the increase in velocity and ferocity of the hurricanes and the different-- and the changes, typhoons that we see today, but we're the innocent victim. we're the ones that are being impacted by what you have created.\n\nminnis and leaders of other island nations have proposed that the u.s. and european countries contribute to an insurance fund – think of it as a really rainy day fund – to help rebuild from future storms.\n\nthat's what you say, and what you said at the u.n., the first world nations should do? whitaker asked minnis.\n\nabsolutely, minnis said.\n\nbut are they doing it?\n\nit's an ongoing discussion, minnis said. it's an ongoing discussion.\n\ndoes this make the change to renewable energy that much more important, imperative, urgent for you here in the bahamas? whitaker asked.\n\nit is, minnis said. because even though our contribution to climate change is minimal, it's miniscule to compare with first world nation, but we still have a responsibility.\n\nproduced by rome hartman. associate producer, sara kuzmarov. broadcast associate, emilio almonte. edited by matt richman and aisha crespo.
washington -- u.s. retail sales fell for a second straight month in march and consumer prices dropped for the first time in 13 months, supporting views that the economy lost significant momentum in the first quarter.\n\nbut with the labor market near full employment, the decline in both sales and consumer prices is likely to be temporary and probably does not change expectations that the federal reserve will raise interest rates again in june.\n\nthe u.s. labor department said its consumer price index dropped 0.3 percent in march, the first decline since february 2016, as declining costs for gasoline and mobile phone services offset rising rents and food prices.\n\nthe cpi nudging up 0.1 percent in february. in the 12 months through march, the cpi rose 2.4 percent, slowing from february's 2.7 percent increase.\n\nsome fed officials will be disturbed by the unexpected drop back in core inflation, but this won't prevent a june rate hike, said paul ashworth, chief u.s. economist at capital economics in toronto. he said a number of one-off factors were behind the muted inflation results, such as an influx of cars whose leases expired and were put up for sale at discounts.\n\nthe u.s. commerce department said on friday retail sales dropped 0.2 percent last month after a 0.3 percent decrease in february, which was the first and biggest decline in nearly a year. compared to march last year retail sales increased 5.2 percent.\n\neconomists polled by reuters had forecast retail sales slipping 0.1 percent last month. excluding automobiles, gasoline, building materials and food services, retail sales rebounded 0.5 percent after falling 0.2 percent in february.\n\nthese so-called core retail sales correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product.\n\ndespite last month's increase in core retail sales, consumer spending likely braked sharply in the first quarter after growing at a brisk 3.5 percent annualized rate in the final three months of 2016. the apparent slowdown in consumption is partly blamed on the late disbursement of income tax refunds by the government as it sought to combat fraud.\n\nthese data are impossible to square with the stratospheric levels of consumer confidence recorded across an array of surveys, said ian shepherdson, chief economist pantheon macroeconomics\n\nthe atlanta fed is forecasting gdp rising at a 0.6 percent rate in the first quarter. this would be the weakest performance in three years and follows a 2.1 percent growth pace in the fourth quarter, who expects a pickup in spending in the months ahead.\n\nwith job growth averaging 178,000 per month in the first quarter, the anticipated slowdown in gdp likely understates the health of the economy. in addition, first-quarter gdp tends to be weaker because of calculation problems that the government has acknowledged and is working to resolve.\n\nretail sales last month were dragged down by receipts at auto dealerships, which fell 1.2 percent, decreasing for a third straight month. sales at service stations dropped 1.0 percent, reflecting lower gasoline prices.\n\nreceipts at building material stores fell 1.5 percent, likely as bad weather halted work at construction sites. there were, however, areas of strength in march's retail sales report.\n\nsales at electronics and appliances stores surged 2.6 percent, the largest increase since june 2015. receipts at clothing stores climbed 1.0 percent, the biggest advance since february 2016. retailers have been hurt by declining mall traffic and increased competition from online retailers, led by amazon.com (amzn).\n\nthat has forced retailers like j.c. penney (jcp), abercrombie & fitch (anf) and macy's (m) to scale back on brick-and-mortar operations.\n\nthe dollar was little moved by the data. u.s. stocks and treasuries markets are closed for the good friday holiday.\n\non the inflation front, the so-called core cpi, which strips out food and energy costs, fell 0.1 percent, the first and largest decrease since january 2010, after rising 0.2 percent in february. as a result, the year-on-year increase slowed to 2.0 percent.\n\nthat was the smallest advance since november 2015 and followed a 2.2 percent increase in february. the fed has a 2 percent inflation target and tracks an inflation measure which is currently at 1.8 percent.\n\na 6.2 percent drop in gasoline prices was the biggest factor in the monthly decline in the cpi. monthly consumer inflation was also weighed down by a record 7.0 percent drop in the cost of wireless telephone services. still, consumers paid more for food and rents last month.\n\nrents increased 0.3 percent in march after a similar gain in february. owners' equivalent rent of primary residence rose 0.2 percent after climbing 0.3 percent in february.\n\nfood prices rose 0.3 percent. the cost of food consumed at home increased 0.5 percent, the biggest gain since may 2014.
in final training for launch next month to the international space station, nasa astronaut chris cassidy already expected to be following standard quarantine protocols in star city near moscow before the global coronavirus outbreak began its exponential growth.\n\nnow everyone around him at the russian cosmonaut training center is in quarantine with him and his two russian crewmates, and travel restrictions have been implemented that will prevent his family from attending launch at the baikonur cosmodrome in kazakhstan on april 9.\n\nif you'd asked me eight months ago, i could have told you, hey, this week, these two weeks, i will be in quarantine. but it would have been for a different reason, he said in a satellite interview with cbs news. i'm still in quarantine, but so is everybody else around us.\n\nprobably the biggest impact is this past week, had it been in normal quarantine, i probably could have gone out to some restaurants and left the immediate (vicinity) of the star city area and just been smart about where we went. but not this time. we've been sort of isolated to our cottages and just the essential places we go to get food.\n\nastronaut chris cassidy, left, soyuz ms-16/62s commander anatoly ivanishin, center, and flight engineer ivan vagner take a break outside a simulator at the cosmonaut training center in star city near moscow. the trio is in final training for launch april 9 on a flight to the international space station. nasa\n\nfortunately for cassidy, his wife peggy was able to accompany him to star city earlier this month and has been with him throughout. asked if there was any chance he might have come in contact with covid-19, he said i really haven't been around anybody else, so it'd be really, really strange if if i did contract something.\n\nyou know, of course, anything can happen between now and april 9, but we're being really super vigilant so that i can remain healthy to get to the station.\n\nin an interview with the associated press, cassidy said it was a real lucky opportunity that he was able to spend the time with his wife, who was expected to fly back home to houston friday — three weeks earlier than originally expected.\n\nit would be a really crushing blow if we were not together during this month and then she was not able to get to baikonur, he said. unbeknownst to us, our goodbye would have been back in houston on february 28th or 29th, and we wouldn't have known that. i'm very fortunate that we've been together for this month.\n\na former navy seal, cassidy has flown in space twice, including a long-duration stay aboard the space station. he is scheduled to blast off from baikonur aboard the soyuz ms-16/62s spacecraft on april 9 along with vehicle commander anatoli ivanishin and co-pilot ivan vagner.\n\nu.s. astronauts flying aboard soyuz spacecraft are allowed 15 guests for launch. thanks to coronavirus travel restrictions preventing non-russian passport holders from flying home through russia, cassidy's wife and three children will not be able to attend.\n\ni will have no launch guests at at the baikonur cosmodrome, he told cbs news. the launch guests who go into and out of moscow to get the baikonur couldn't get back through moscow. so that closed the gates for us. ... and so none of those folks will come.\n\nlaunch preparations at baikonur are tightly scripted by the russians. on launch day, crews are cheered on by local crowds and they get a final chance to chat with friends and family before heading for the launch pad.\n\nwhat's super cool normally is you come walking out of the hotel where we stay for the whole two weeks that we're down there, and there's music playing, and there's crowds of people lining the walkway as we proceed from the hotel to the buses. and it's very, very motivating. it's super exciting.\n\nthis time around, he said, it'll be completely quiet. there won't be anybody there. we'll just kind of walk out. maybe we'll still play music and fire the three of us up ourselves, but who knows?\n\neight days after cassidy, ivanishin and vagner arrive, the station's current crew — expedition 62 commander oleg skripochka, jessica meir and drew morgan — will return to earth with a landing on the steppe of kazakhstan. from that point forward, cassidy and his crewmates will have the lab to themselves until a spacex crew dragon spacecraft gets there in may or june.\n\nchris cassidy, left, anatoly ivanishin, center, and ivan vagner meet with russian officials overseeing final exams before launch april 9 aboard as soyuz spacecraft bound for the international space station. nasa\n\nnasa managers had expected to already be launching astronauts aboard spacex and boeing commercial crew ships by now, ending the agency's sole reliance on the soyuz. equally important, the new crew ships are needed to ensure the presence of three to four u.s.-sponsored astronauts aboard the station at all times to carry out a full slate of scientific research.\n\nanticipating the advent of u.s. commercial crew ships, russia scaled back production of its three-seat soyuz spacecraft and only two will be launched this year: the soyuz ms-16/62s vehicle april 9 and the second around october 14.\n\nbut the commercial crew program has suffered a series of setbacks and delays, and the first piloted test flight, carrying astronauts doug hurley and bob behnken, is now targeted for launch around may 13. if all goes well, a second crew dragon, carrying astronauts mike hopkins and victor glover, will arrive at the station in the mid-summer timeframe.\n\nin the meantime, cassidy will be hard pressed to carry out a significant amount of research while handling day-to-day maintenance chores. but he's optimistic that state of affairs is about to change.\n\nthe energy, the momentum, the excitement is really kind of building for summertime, realistic summertime arrivals, he said. we chatted before, when i was chief astronaut and we were talking about this same flight. i think we all had guarded enthusiasm back then. now it's real.
hong kong - china's manufacturing sector continues to gear down, highlighting the country's slowing economic growth.\n\nchina's manufacturing outlook deteriorated in february, according to two surveys of factory activity released tuesday, a day after beijing loosened credit to counter sluggish conditions in the world's second biggest economy.\n\nan index based on an official survey of factory purchasing managers declined to 49.0 in february from 49.4 in january in the seventh straight month of contraction. the index has not been at a lower level in seven years; it fell to 45.3 in jan. 2009 as the global financial crisis was unfolding.\n\nthe economy's road to stability remains bumpy, said he fan, caijing magazine's chief economist, said of the manufacturing report tuesday. the government needs to press ahead with reforms, while adopting moderate stimulus policies and strengthening support of the economy in other ways to prevent it from falling off a cliff.\n\nthe reading by the china federation of logistics and purchasing is based on a 100-point scale with the 50 mark dividing expansion from contraction.\n\nseparately, a private survey also showed further weakening in manufacturing.\n\nthe caixin/markit purchasing managers' index slipped to a five-month low of 48.0 last month from 48.4 the previous month.\n\nthe index readings for all key categories including output, new orders and employment signaled that conditions worsened, in line with signs that the economy's road to stability remains bumpy, said he fan, chief economist at caixin insight group. he said the government faces more pressure to continue rolling out moderate stimulus policies to prevent growth from slowing too sharply.\n\nthe latest such move came monday night when the central bank freed up more money for lending by cutting the amount banks need to hold in reserve.\n\ncaixin's survey mostly covers smaller, private enterprises while the federation report focuses on larger, state-owned companies.\n\neconomists cautioned the numbers were distorted by the lunar new year holiday, which falls at different times in the first two months of the year. factories typically stock up on raw materials and scramble to fill orders before shutting for an extended break that began this year in early february.\n\nattempting to iron out the distortions, anz bank economists raymond yeung and louis lam noted that the official index's average for january and february together was 49.2, which still indicates contraction.\n\nthere was some better news for china's services sector, with an official survey of non-manufacturing business activity slipping but continuing to grow last month, coming in at 52.7 from 53.5 in january. services have helped offset manufacturing weakness in china's economy, which last year posted its slowest expansion in a quarter century as growth ebbed to 6.9 percent.\n\nchina's economic slowdown comes as policymakers in beijing try to wean the economy off a tired model based on manufacturing and investment and refocus it on self-sustaining services and domestic consumption. to spur lending, the government on monday moved to cut how much capital china's lenders must keep on deposit at the country's central bank.\n\nthe change reduced required reserves by 0.5 percent points effective tuesday, which will release several hundred billion yuan (tens of billions of dollars) into the market. chinese trading is heavily influenced by the availability of credit, so an easing can lead to higher prices.\n\nwith respect to the manufacturing side of the chinese economy, the government is getting serious about slashing excess capacity in a variety of industries, said peter boockvar, chief market analyst with the lindsey group, in a note.\n\nsome forecasters expect china's efforts to loosen monetary conditions to succeed in shoring up growth.\n\ngiven the usual impact of such easing on investment, we don't think growth is set to weaken much further this year as many expect, said julian evans-pritchard, china economist with capital economics, in a report. if anything, we still think a small policy driven uptick in growth is the most likely scenario.\n\nbut questions remain about whether china can avoid a hard landing given the massive overcapacity in its industrial base, with many state-run factories around the country sitting idle. without sufficient domestic demand to fill the vacuum, the government is reportedly planning to lay off 1.8 million coal and steel workers, and perhaps millions more over the next few years.
new york - starboard value lp nominated an entirely new board at yahoo (yhoo) on thursday, setting up a battle between the activist investor and the faded internet company.\n\nstarboard, which owns about 1.7 percent of outstanding shares, sent a letter to yahoo investors that said that company leaders have failed to deliver results. the hedge fund says significant change is needed to hold management accountable and properly oversee any operational turnaround plan, separation or sale of assets.\n\nyahoo ceo marissa mayer sits on the board and has said that she wants to continue leading the company. it is not clear what the attempted coup means for her.\n\nthe management team and board of yahoo have repeatedly failed shareholders, starboard wrote in its letter to shareholders. time and again, operating results have been decidedly negative and materially worse than management's guidance and external expectations.\n\nyet starboard may simply be applying pressure with the hope that it can assert its influence immediately.\n\nstarboard said in its letter that it hopes that it can reach a mutually agreeable resolution with yahoo that would allow us to get involved sooner to ensure a good outcome.\n\nyahoo did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nstarboard's board nominees include eddy hartenstein, former ceo of tribune co.; and jeffrey smith, ceo of starboard and chairman of darden restaurants inc.\n\ntension between starboard and yahoo has been escalating. yahoo named two new directors earlier this month, a maneuver that likely agitated starboard. starboard has suggested a major change in leadership is needed, and that could include mayer, who has cut staff and jettisoned assets in a bid to turn yahoo around. mayer has been ceo since july 2012.\n\nyahoo has been trying to reverse a prolonged decline in its revenue and figure out a way to avoid paying taxes on the gains from a roughly $28 billion stake that it holds in china's e-commerce leader, alibaba group.\n\nmayer is pushing to lay off 15 percent of its workforce and shed unprofitable services to reduce expenses and sharpen the company's focus on mobile, digital video and core operations, such as sports and finance. at the same time, mayer is trying to pull off a complicated spin-off that would break off yahoo's internet operations into a newly formed company to shield the alibaba stake from taxes.\n\nstarboard and other shareholders want yahoo to sell its internet operations as soon as possible. that demand is based largely on the belief that yahoo's revenue is bound to fall even further as more digital advertising flows to the industry leaders, alphabet inc.'s google and facebook inc.\n\nyahoo's board says it is still backing mayer, but it also signaled that it is receptive to selling the internet operations last month by hiring three investment banks to solicit offers. analysts believe the most likely bidders are verizon communications inc., at&t inc., comcast corp. and a private equity firms that specialize in buying troubled companies.\n\nshares of yahoo inc., based in sunnyvale, california, rose slightly in thursday premarket trading with the broader indexes down sharply.
sacramento, calif. -- a proposal to make california's drought-era water restrictions permanent could allow the state to chip away at long-held water rights in an unprecedented power grab, representatives from water districts and other users told regulators tuesday. members of the state water resources control board delayed a decision about whether to bring back what had been temporary water bans from california's drought, spanning 2013 to 2017. the plan is part of an effort to make water conservation a way of life, with climate change expected to lead to longer, more severe droughts.\n\nit comes after u.s. officials declared that nearly half the state, all of it in the south, is back in drought just months after emerging from it.\n\nofficials from several irrigation and water agencies said the restrictions are reasonable, but not the plan to impose them under the state constitution's prohibition on the waste or unreasonable use of water. that would create a slippery slope of allowing the board to repeatedly chip away at california's historic protection of water rights for landowners, they said.\n\nerratic individuals can occupy great positions of power in government, and you had better believe they will occupy your chair someday, said jackson minasian, an attorney for stanford vina ranch irrigation co. their view of what is 'waste and unreasonable use' will be radically different than yours.\n\nsome water users also said permanent mandates would be too rigid in a sprawling state with needs that vary by region.\n\nthe restrictions, punishable by a $500 fine, include prohibitions on watering lawns so much that the water flows into the street, using a hose to wash down sidewalks or using a hose without an automatic shut-off nozzle to wash cars. a final decision is now expected by april 17.\n\nhotels would have to ask guests if they really need their towels and sheets washed each day. running an ornamental fountain without a recirculating system would be barred, as would watering outside within 48 hours of a good rain. another measure would give cities and counties until 2025 to stop watering ordinary street medians.\n\nrestaurants would be allowed to serve water only on request if the governor declares a drought emergency.\n\nwater officials expect neighbors to be responsible for detecting and reporting most of the wasteful water use, and they have no plans to add more enforcement officers if the permanent restrictions are adopted.\n\ngenerally, first-time offenders would get warnings, while repeat offenders risk fines.\n\nenvironmental groups urged officials to crack down more aggressively on wasteful water use rather than rely on policies that encourage neighbors to develop good practices.\n\nwater board chairwoman felicia marcus said the restrictions are hardly a long-term solution to california's drought problems but the least we should do.\n\nwe're not in an emergency right now, but shame on us if we just bury our heads in the sand ... allow people to go out and waste water by washing down the driveway with a hose when a broom would do, she said.\n\nthe plan also includes legislation that would create customized water-use limits for urban water districts, which would risk state enforcement if they fell short. lawmakers also are considering whether to allow districts to enforce drought regulations, a power now reserved for the state.\n\ngov. jerry brown lifted california's emergency drought status a year ago, after a wet winter. strict 25 percent conservation orders for cities and towns and other restrictions then were phased out.\n\nsome climate scientists say the drought never fully ended in parts of southern california. the los angeles area has received just a fourth of normal rainfall so far this rainy season.\n\nin the northern sierra nevada, the winter so far has been the third-driest on record for the year's wettest three months -- december, january and february -- produced very little rainfall, said john leahigh of the california department of water resources.\n\nthe water content of the sierra snowpack, which feeds water supplies, is about 20 percent of normal for this time of year, he said.\n\nmost of california's reservoirs are at or slightly above their historical average for this time of year, but experts expect that to fall when water is released in the spring and summer and not enough melting snow can replenish it.\n\nthis is a very ugly picture in terms of the water supply management, leahigh said.
the duggar family is returning to tv with a full season of jill and jessa: counting on. the show originally started as a three-part special, but it will return as a series starting on march 15 on tlc.\n\nin a promo clip on people's website, anna duggar, wife of josh duggar -- who fell from grace after he was embroiled in child molestation and ashley madison scandals -- opened up about life after learning about her husband's problems.\n\ni don't know what i'm stepping into, she says in the video. i don't know how to handle each situation. it's not anything i ever would have thought i would walk through. [i tell myself,] 'just do the next right thing, have the next right response for the next 15 minutes.'\n\nmeanwhile, jessa seewald and her husband ben are figuring out life as first-time parents of their son, spurgeon. having the full 24-hour care of an infant -- every diaper change, every feeding, it's all on you, jessa says in the clip.\n\nthe show also follows jessa's sister, jill dillard, and her husband, derick dillard, as they work as missionaries in central america along with their baby son, israel.
exactly 100 years ago saturday, the u.s. government passed a groundbreaking law to protect migratory birds that fly across the atlantic. to mark the anniversary, national geographic magazine helped declare 2018 the year of the bird. it kicked off the observance with an essay from acclaimed author jonathan franzen, who's also a bird lover and a conservationist.\n\nit was the experience of seeing a brightly colored warbler sitting in a tree 18 years ago that changed franzen's life forever, reports cbs news' alex wagner. he had walked by that same tree hundreds of times before.\n\n\n\nand the scales had fallen from my eyes. there was this other world….it was like being introduced to sex, he said.\n\nin the two decades since then, franzen has traveled to see as many of the world's nearly 10,000 bird species as possible.\n\n\n\ni've actually birded on all seven continents, he said. there is a bad kind of birder who only cares about increasing the length of his or her list of birds seen….i have a little bit of that but there's another part of me that, i think, is a good birder which is – this is a way to have an experience.\n\nin his january essay for national geographic magazine why birds matter, and are worth protecting, franzen compares birds to humans, writing: they build intricate homes and raise families in them. they take long winter vacations in warm places. cockatoos are shrewd thinkers, solving puzzles that would challenge a chimpanzee, and crows like to play.\n\nto the extent that there is still a natural world, the birds are the best ambassadors for it because you can't go anywhere on this planet without running into birds. you can be 90 miles inland in antarctica and there are the emperor penguins, he said. you can be in the most bleak south pacific ocean and there are the albatrosses, there are seagulls nesting in the desert….i've seen great birds outside my window on the upper east side in manhattan. they're everywhere and always not really caring very much about us. they're just being themselves.\n\nalex wagner and author jonathan franzen cbs news\n\nbut that doesn't mean that humans aren't affected by birds. franzen remembers one experience in east india when he was approached by two great hornbills.\n\n\n\nthey flew in, and it sounded like some meteorological event. their, their wings are so huge. it's this woof, woof, woof as they come in….and i became aware that somebody was shouting, he said. and i realized i'm shouting. that is spontaneous joy that i am emitting.\n\n\n\nthe joy was contagious when wagner and franzen came upon a pair of owls. it's moments like those that made franzen fall in love with birds.\n\n\n\nand because i had fallen in love with them, i wanted to help them, he said.\n\n\n\nbirds may have the gift of flight, yet franzen points out they are unable to master their own environments. humans are responsible for the climate changing too quickly for birds to adapt. franzen wonders if birds are valued enough for us to make the effort to protect them.\n\nso part of my mission has become to try to remind people that there are other things to think about if you care about nature than just climate change, he said.\n\n\n\nthis month, national geographic is highlighting how birds are able to migrate thousands of miles every year and how a changing landscape is making it harder for them.\n\nthe contrast that is interesting to me is between a kind of fire and brimstone christianity. 'you are damned unless you change your ways' which is kind of the climate conversation. and then, on the other hand, you have this older catholic, particularly franciscan, from st. francis who was all about, hey, birds. i love the birds. i'm gonna write to the emperor and ask him to put grain out in the fields on christmas day to feed my friends the larks, franzen said. his approach to the world was love, love, love, love, love. and i think for meaningful action of any kind, love is a much better motivator than fear of damnation.
duxbury, mass. -- the northeast is bracing for round two -- a second major storm in four days. heavy snow, rain and high winds will move into the region overnight. amtrak has cut back service and airlines are waiving change fees in many cases.\n\nabout 200,000 homes and businesses are still without power after the last storm.\n\na drone captured footage of the coastal homes at risk after last week's four-day storm, which left a gaping hole in the seawall. with high tide approaching, waves could be seen pounding the coastline.\n\nall that happened within two hours, said robyn chiminiello, who moved to duxbury 35 years ago with her late husband. she's afraid her dream house will be lost.\n\nit is devastating, you know, and there is nothing you can do, chiminiello said.\n\nmore than 300 homes along the coast are in danger of being washed away, a seawall built in 1954 being their last defense.\n\ni think this is a reminder of how powerful the sea is, said duxbury fire captain rob reardon. we had four high-tide cycles that caused a tremendous amount of flooding around us all the way through these neighborhoods and up the coast.\n\nthere were huge chunks of concrete missing from the seawall up and down the coast. now there's a race against time before the next storm arrives.\n\nexcavators have been working overtime to shore up the wall to try and stop the water from gushing in.\n\nwatermarks on one home showed just how high flood waters were earlier tuesday afternoon. now, they have gone down dramatically as residents brace for round two.
aguadilla, puerto rico -- david thompson felt the smack of a wave and found himself hanging by a tether off the back of his sailboat in the atlantic ocean, the northern coast of puerto rico off in the distance.\n\nno problem, thompson thought. he was still tied to his boat, wearing his life jacket. all he had to do was hoist himself back onto his boat.\n\nbut conditions were rough: 20-knot winds and 10-foot swells. as he climbed back on board, another wave tossed him off. then the surging water stripped away his life jacket, which had linked him to the boat, and he watched as the boat moved farther away by the second.\n\nmy arms were so tired, i couldn't grab ahold of anything anymore, the 68-year-old said wednesday from a hospital in puerto rico, where he is recovering from his ordeal. so i was watching my boat sail away. i was thinking that was it.\n\nyet he kept himself going. he swam and floated on his back and swam - on and on for seven hours, finally crawling onto a puerto rico beach after dark, half naked and exhausted.\n\nthompson, a retired engineer from kalamazoo, michigan, who was sailing solo when he went overboard, is being treated for dehydration and expects to be hospitalized for at least four days.\n\nin an interview with the associated press, thompson said he had been with his wife, donna, in st. maarten. she flew home and he was taking their 49-foot boat, the enthalpy ii, to south florida. it was about 1 p.m. sunday when he was knocked overboard.\n\nhe recalled that the wave that took his life jacket also stripped off his clothes except for his shirt, leaving him almost naked as he floated in the water and considered his options.\n\nthompson made his way toward land, about 4 miles away. he alternated between floating and swimming, thinking about his 2 1/2-year-old granddaughter to keep himself going.\n\ni wanted to see her and hug her again. and i have a wife and a nice life. i didn't want to die.\n\nthompson kept swimming. a sharp reef cut into his legs as he scrambled onto land. aware that he was naked, thompson took off his shirt, stepped into the arm holes to fashioned makeshift shorts before looking for help. he knocked on the door of several homes and called out for help, but none came.\n\nwhen they saw me, i was walking like i was drunk because i didn't have any strength left in my legs, which were bleeding. i didn't look like someone you wanted to invite to dinner.\n\nfinally, he arrived at villas del mar hau, a seaside hotel in the north coastal town of isabela. he stumbled into the restaurant and asked waiters for help. they gave him food, water and clothes that a previous guest had left behind.\n\nthat man ate so much rice and beans that it seemed like he had not eaten for three days, said sandra villanueva, the hotel owner's assistant. i truly admire him. he was so beat up. he had lost all his clothes. his head, his hands, his feet were all beat up.\n\nthe hotel called police and the u.s. coast guard, and thompson was taken to the nearby hospital in aguadilla. officials at the private hospital would not allow an ap journalist inside, but thompson said by phone that he was awaiting dialysis to get rid of the tremendous amount of protein built up in his body. he was too weak to hold a cup of coffee.\n\nhis wife said in a phone interview from michigan that she was not surprised her husband survived.\n\nhe is stubborn. he is determined. he is like one of the strongest people i've ever known. once he sets his mind to something, you are not going to change him, which can be aggravating from a wife's point of view, she said with a laugh.\n\nthe thompsons had planned to vacation in the florida keys or possibly the bahamas next year in their sailboat, which the u.s. coast guard recovered, but those plans are on hold.\n\nknowing that your husband is on a boat by himself, and getting a call from the coast guard is the worst call you can get, she said, choking up. the fact that the boat came through and that he was able to come through, it's a miracle.
with so many diets to choose from and nutritional guidelines seemingly in constantly flux, deciding what to eat can be challenging at times. mark hyman, m.d., hopes to help simplify those decisions.\n\nhyman, director of the cleveland clinic center for functional medicine, is the author of the new book, food: what the heck should i eat? aimed at getting readers to think about the quality of food they put into their bodies and helping them make healthier choices.\n\nin an interview with cbs news, hyman says most of us could benefit from taking the ancient quote from hippocrates to heart: let food be they medicine and medicine be thy food.\n\nthat's what we're now discovering scientifically, that foods have properties that actually create healing or disease, he said. it's not just calories. it's information. it literally speaks to your genes. it changes your hormones, it changes your immune system, it changes your microbiome. every single bite matters.\n\nhyman notes that food is more powerful than any drug to reverse disease.\n\nthis is especially important as the united states continues to fight a growing obesity epidemic. currently, more than one-third of u.s. adults are obese, according to the centers for disease control and prevention. more than 12 million children and teens across the country also suffer from obesity and could face a wide range of health problems as a result.\n\nso how did we get here? from an evolutionary perspective, hyman notes that humans were traditionally hunters and gatherers for millions of years. it's only in the last 12,000 years that things began to change, and more recently the shift in our diets has vastly accelerated.\n\nwe ate 800 species of plants. we ate wild animals, he said. now, we eat highly processed foods.\n\nto counter this trend, hyman suggests getting back to eating simpler, natural foods.\n\nhe calls it the pegan diet, combining aspects from both vegan and paleo diets.\n\nit's really simple, hyman said. eat foods low in sugar and starch. eat lots of plant foods. if you're going to eat animal foods, eat sustainably grown or harvested foods. have foods that have lots of good fat, like nuts and seeds, olive oil, avocados.\n\na good place to start, he says, is to read the ingredient lists on the foods in your cupboard.\n\nif you have an ingredient you would cook with, like salt and pepper, great, hyman said. if it's butylated hydroxytoluene, you're probably not going to have that in your cupboard and sprinkle it on your veggies.\n\nbut these types of chemicals are in so many of the processed food we consume.\n\nwe eat about 3 to 5 pounds a year of these chemicals in our food, hyman said, not to mention hormones, antibiotics, and pesticides.\n\nwhen giving talks at churches, hyman offers the following rule of thumb: if god made it, eat it. if man made it, leave it.
study aims to examine links between climate change and clouds an unprecedented study was recently launched to explore clouds, which cover two thirds of the earth's surface on average. scientists still understand precious little about the phenomenon, but most climatologists believe they hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of climate change. cbs this morning: saturday took a closer look at where scientists are conducting the study out in the caribbean.
11 new tv shows to watch out for in 2017\n\nit's the end of the road for wgn america's critically acclaimed drama underground, which was canceled tuesday after two seasons.\n\nthe move comes a month after the cable network canceled its other high-profile drama series, outsiders, signaling a change in direction.\n\ndespite 'underground' being a terrific and important series, it no longer fits with our new direction and we have reached the difficult decision not to renew it for a third season, tribune media's peter kern said in a statement. we are grateful to the loyal fans of 'underground' and our partners at sony pictures television. it is our hope that this remarkable show finds another home and continues its stories of courage, determination and freedom.\n\nsony pictures television, which produces the series, had already begun looking for a new home for underground but has not had much luck, according to deadline.\n\nmeanwhile, moonlight director barry jenkins is currently adapting colson whitehead's award-winning the underground railroad into a series for amazon.
the following is a transcript of the interview with secretary of state mike pompeo that aired sunday, jan. 13, 2019, on face the nation.\n\nmargaret brennan: joining us now from abu dhabi one of nine countries he's visiting in an eight day trip through the middle east is secretary of state mike pompeo. welcome to face the nation.\n\nsecretary of state mike pompeo: it's great to be with you, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: mr. secretary, we are in the middle of this shutdown, and i know a number of state department employees are not getting paid including a quarter of u.s. employees in foreign countries. you've been going to u.s. embassies. what are you telling staff about when they can expect a paycheck?\n\nsec. pompeo: look it- it's unfortunate that we're in the shutdown, i wish we weren't, too. i hope that it's resolved quickly and i've certainly told our- our teams that. but you have to know these great americans who are working in our embassies around the world. they understand the mission. they understand its importance. they understand that whether the government is open or closed they have a task to do and they are hard at it. they have- they have all uniformly been very engaged and continue to be so. it's been a great trip in that respect.\n\nmargaret brennan: how has this been impacting morale? i mean how are you telling people to explain to their foreign counterparts why the u.s. government shut itself down?\n\nsec. pompeo: yeah, margaret, our foreign counterparts have lots of things on their agenda to talk with us about. the topic of the government being shut down in the united states hasn't risen to the top of the pile in any of the visits that i've had.\n\nmargaret brennan: well i do want to ask you since we are so focused on what's happening with this shutdown here at home, the state department when it comes to the border issues has issued a report in 2017 about counterterrorism and it says that there is no credible evidence that international terrorist groups have established bases in mexico or sent operatives via mexico into the united states. it adds the southern border is vulnerable, but terrorist groups likely seek other means of trying to enter the united states. how does this match with the claim that there is a border security crisis?\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret, make- make no mistake about it margaret, keeping our southern border secure is an important national security component, it's- it's critical that we do that well. there's a real risk to the united states of america. we need to take this seriously. we need to secure our southern border. we need to make sure that those who want to do us harm don't have a way to access us in that way. there are many things we have to do. one of the reasons i'm in the middle east is to work on prevailing against terror. there are lots of elements of this but border security is a certain and certainly an important component.\n\nmargaret brennan: so is the state department report wrong to say that this is not how terrorists are trying to enter the united states?\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret, terrorists try to get into our country lots of ways. one of the ways they can come in is across our southern border. what you saw was an unclassified report. make no mistake about it, terrorists will always find the weakest link. and we need to make sure that the weakest link in our national security isn't on our southern border.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to get to your trip through the middle east, but i first want to ask you about this new york times report that says right after president trump fired former fbi director james comey the fbi began investigating whether president trump himself was a potential threat to national security and whether he'd been working for russia or unintentionally influenced by moscow. what is your reaction to this?\n\nsec. pompeo: i'm not going to comment on new york times stories, but i'll certainly say this: the- the notion that president trump is a threat to american national security is absolutely ludicrous.\n\nmargaret brennan: just to clarify since you were cia director did you have any idea that this investigation was happening?\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret- margaret- margaret. i've answered this question repeatedly indeed on your show. the- the idea that's contained in the new york times story that president trump was a threat to american national security is- is silly on its face and not worthy of a response.\n\nmargaret brennan: one of the reasons you're in the middle east is to reassure and explain to some of our allies what the u.s. policy in syria is. so i'd like you to do that for us today because the pentagon announced yesterday that it actually has begun its withdrawal from syria. yet the u.s. national security adviser john bolton said that wouldn't happen until two things. one, the u.s. defeated isis and two, turkey assured us it wouldn't go after our kurdish allies. have those two conditions been met?\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret the president's guidance is incredibly clear. the roughly two thousand uniformed soldiers that are in syria today are going to be withdrawn that- that activity is underway. we're going to do so in an orderly and deliberate way. a way that protects america's national security. a way that allows us to continue the important mission that they were on - the counterterrorism mission. the effort to make sure that with the destruction of isis is not only complete but that their resurgence is not possible. our efforts to counter the threat from terrorism stemming from the islamic republic of iran. those are all real missions. the tactical change we've made and the withdrawal of those two thousand troops is just that - a tactical change. mission remains the same.\n\nmargaret brennan: so has turkey's president promised you not to attack our kurdish allies?\n\nsec. pompeo: yeah, look when president erdogan and president trump spoke, they talked about this issue. the turks have made clear that they understand that there are folks down in syria that have their rights. we also want to make sure that those in syria aren't attacking- terrorists aren't attacking turkey from syria. we're fully engaged. ambassador jeffrey is fully engaged in conversations with the turks as well as with the sdf in syria to make sure that we accomplish all of those missions. we can- we can do each of those things, margaret.\n\nmargaret brennan: the sdf among some of the fighters that we were talking about kurdish allies there. just to explain for our audience.\n\nsec. pompeo: that's right.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you here though because you know as a diplomat the threat of credible use of military force is what gives you power at the negotiating table. how does taking out u.s. troops from syria get you any closer to expelling iran?\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret, the united states of america can project military power from lots of places in the world. the absence of a couple thousand soldiers on the ground in syria in no way materially diminishes the capacity of the united states of america and our amazing armed forces to deliver american power to accomplish our objectives anywhere in the world. that certainly includes in syria. it certainly includes into iran if need be. we still have those tools. america's diplomats still have that leverage and that power standing behind them. i'm very confident in our military capabilities here in the middle east.\n\nmargaret brennan: so by that, are you saying that having u.s. troops in nearby iraq will fill any kind of vacuum left by pulling out of syria?\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret, we have lots of tools in the arsenal. i was out visiting some amazing warriors out at navcent yesterday in bahrain. we have an enormous amount of american military capacity. our- our ability to achieve what we need to do militarily is there. my task as america's secretary of state is to make sure that we don't have to use that tool. that we get the diplomatic outcomes to secure the middle east and keep it stable and protect the american people as well.\n\nmargaret brennan: when it comes to iran, the trump administration has taken some, you know, confrontational tactics here, pulling out of the nuclear accord saying that iranian threats would be matched here. but we saw this week another american - a navy vet - michael white has been behind iranian bars since july. so the trump administration is not stopping iran from taking americans hostage. what is happening with this american?\n\nsec. pompeo: this administration is proud of the work that we've done to get americans released all across the world. with respect to that michael white case in particular, i can't say much. it's an ongoing consular matter. but the american people should know we take the security of every american, wherever they are traveling in the world as one of our foremost priorities. we will continue to work to get each of them back. and your point- your point about the islamic republic of iran is spot on. it's why the jcopa was such a horrible idea. many americans are being held there today that were taken by the iranian regime. these are a group of people who are among the worst terrorists in the world and who have the least respect for human rights in the world. and it's why this administration has taken the very hard line you just described against iran.\n\nmargaret brennan: is the trump administration open to a prisoner swap with iran?\n\nsec. pompeo: i'm not going to talk about something like that.\n\nmargaret brennan: well i ask you because michael white's mother spoke to cbs and she said she would like the administration to negotiate for her son. she said, what is a human life worth? i would like the u.s. to negotiate. i want him home. what can you tell her you're doing to bring her son home?\n\nsec. pompeo: i have great sympathy for the families of those americans who are wrongfully detained all across the world. and we do everything we can every day to get their return. we use our diplomatic tools in every corner of the world, to reach out to these places to get these young men and women home. we're intent to do that in iran. we're intent to do that all across the world. we- we take this- this obligation as a solemn one. and this administration's had quite a few successes.\n\nmargaret brennan: so--\n\nsec. pompeo: i hope we have more.\n\nmargaret brennan: potentially open to negotiations then?\n\nsec. pompeo: we're using every tool that we have in our arsenal to get these americans back home, wherever we find them.\n\nmargaret brennan: ambassador bolton said the next summit with kim jong-un would be in january or february. we're in that window. when will we see president trump sit down with the north korean leader?\n\nsec. pompeo: we're working out the details margaret, you'll be among the first to know.\n\nmargaret brennan: i know, sir, you're at the end of this trip, you will be headed to saudi arabia. it has been about 100 days since washington post journalist jamal khashoggi was brutally murdered there. will you raise this issue with mohammed bin salman, the crown prince?\n\nsec. pompeo: of course.\n\nmargaret brennan: then what will you say?\n\nsec. pompeo: i'll say what- margaret i'll say what we have said consistently. america's position both privately and publicly is the same. this was an outrageous act, an unacceptable murder. those who were responsible will be held accountable by the united states of america. we're determined to do that. we're determined to get at the facts just as quickly and as comprehensively as we can. we've had a policy that's been remarkably consistent with respect to this. we- we- we, we like the rest of the world, value human rights all across the globe. and the murder of jamal khashoggi was outrageous and we'll hold those responsible accountable. and then we'll talk about all the important things we do with the kingdom of saudi arabia and all the support they provide to keep americans in kansas and colorado and california and in washington, d.c. safe.\n\nmargaret brennan: mr. secretary, thank you very much for your time. safe travels.\n\nsec. pompeo: margaret, thank you very much. you have a great day
seaworld announced it would end its controversial orca-breeding program last spring after years of criticism. it also began phasing out theatrical killer whale shows. but after the theme park's parent company closed 2016 with a net loss of $12.5 million, seaworld is seeking to rebound.\n\nthe company is introducing new rides, educational programs and innovations like virtual reality technology. seaworld wants to change its public perception as an animal entertainment company to get people back into its parks.\n\nwhat we want to do is be known for a company where families can have a lot of fun but also do something meaningful at the same time, seaworld parks and entertainment ceo joel manby said. millennials especially. they want to have an experience that matters. and so we want to show them how they can make a difference.\n\nin san antonio, for example, he said a new ride called wave breaker will allow visitors to go on a rescue experience.\n\nlast year, manby and humane society president and ceo wayne pacelle announced a partnership on cbs this morning to help animals in the wild.\n\nin the end of the day, we've always been a rescue organization, manby said, adding, there's no doubt… that society is changing and we need to change with it. we've made some difficult decisions, but i think the model of the future is companies, for-profit companies who can spend their resources to make the world a better place. the millennials want it. we want it as human beings.
the inauguration of president-elect joe biden will come exactly two weeks after an angry pro-trump mob stormed the u.s. capitol. but will it be safe on wednesday?\n\ncbs evening news anchor and managing editor norah o'donnell spoke exclusively with the senators in charge of the inauguration, republican roy blunt of missouri and democrat amy klobuchar of minnesota. the senators discussed the significance of the inauguration after the violent assault, and how the country should regard those who stormed the capitol.\n\no'donnell: senators, thank you so much. senator blunt, let me ask you: is there any doubt in your mind that there will be a peaceful transfer of power?\n\nblunt: no. no doubt at all. and i think we're gonna project to the world exactly the message we want to at this very spot where so many bad things happened two weeks ago. i think the world's gonna see the constitution and the democracy of our country work.\n\nhow important is that, to show that to the world?\n\nklobuchar: it couldn't be more important. and while the events of january 6th and the insurrection — i think for a lot of people, they stepped back and reflected and thought, this democracy means something to us.\n\nthere was a security scare this morning that led to the capitol being locked down. what if that happens wednesday?\n\nklobuchar: take one thing at a time. there's always plans and ways you can change things. but that turned out to be not a real occurrence of any security risk.\n\nas a republican, are you disappointed that president trump won't be here?\n\nblunt: i think the president should have been here, and i'm disappointed.\n\nwhat kind of message do you think it sends?\n\nklobuchar: that's his decision. but this is still going to be this magical moment where our new president takes the reins.\n\ndid you ever consider, for security reasons, moving this inside?\n\nblunt: i don't think we seriously did. this is not only a moment of importance, but the fact that we do it and where we do it matters. and it's really important to maintain that sense of the continuity of both our constitution and our democracy.\n\nand yet, the leader of your party and his most fervent supporters tried to derail that.\n\nblunt: what happened here two weeks ago was one of the great stains on the history of the country, in my view. it was outrageous. it was totally unforgivable.\n\nthere were hundreds, if not thousands of rioters on this very stage just last week pushing through that door. how much damage was done?\n\nblunt: a lot of damage was done to our reputation, not much done to the building. there were probably 1,000 people in the building. every one of those people should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\nwhat if president trump pardons some of the people involved?\n\nblunt: i think that'd be disastrous.\n\nklobuchar: yes.\n\nblunt: i think what they did is unpardonable.\n\na view from the lectern at the u.s. capitol during preparations for the inauguration of president-elect joe biden. cbs news\n\nthis is what president joe biden will see when he address the nation.\n\nklobuchar: exactly. well there will be some people out there, so yes. that's what he sees.\n\nand then some nearly 200,000 american flags instead of a crowd.\n\nblunt: well normally we have 200,000 people. so instead of 200,000 people, i guess we'll have almost 200,000 flags.\n\nwas there any damage done to [the area where mr. biden will be sworn in]?\n\nblunt: there was a little damage. some repainting had to be done.\n\ni understand they replaced all the windows. these are the windows that we saw them punching flagpoles and helmets through and then crawling through these very windows.\n\nblunt: they crawled in here, right.\n\nbut that has all been replaced.\n\nklobuchar: just like our democracy is starting fresh on the 20th.
getting a tax refund as quickly as possible is what taxpayers filing returns over the next two months are looking for. and why not: the average refund this year is expected to be about $3,200.\n\nthe fastest way to get your refund is to prepare and file your return electronically and elect to have your refund directly deposited into your bank account. you'll have your money in two to three weeks. or you could wait four weeks or more to get your refund by paper check.\n\nif you also want to be sure of getting the biggest refund you're entitled to, you could benefit from using a tax professional. a tax pro can help identify and claim additional deductions and credits, significantly boosting your tax refund.\n\nbut automatic deposit of a tax refund is a problem for those who don't have a bank account. also, some people who would like to use a tax pro don't have the several hundred dollars to pay for these services up-front.\n\ncompanies offering tax prep services and software, such as intuit (intu), h&r block (hrb) and jackson hewitt all offer products aimed at those without a bank account or the money to pay for tax prep fees. but while these products have some benefits, they also come with fees and other features that might mean you don't really get your money any sooner.\n\nhere's a brief rundown of these products.\n\nintuit's turbotax software offers to have your tax refund directly deposited onto intuit's netspend premier visa prepaid card. according to its website, there's no fees to set one up, but fees do apply when you use the card for purchases, withdrawals or reloading card with additional cash. you'll also have to fork over $9.95 to replace a lost or stolen card. the netspend card targets those who don't have a bank account and don't want to wait a month or more for a paper check.\n\nturbotax users can also elect to have the turbotax fees deducted from their federal tax refund, but beware that a refund processing service fee applies ... and prices are subject to change.\n\nh&r block also offers to direct deposit your tax refund onto a debit card, its emerald card mastercard. there's no fee for this service, but block clearly states that it doesn't result in faster delivery of your refund.\n\nin response to the problem of not having the money up-front to pay for the tax prep fee, block offers a refund anticipation check, which deducts the fee from your federal tax refund. you'll pay an additional $34.95 for your federal tax refund and $13 for your state refund.\n\nif you elect to have your rac sent via paper, an additional $25 fee applies. block says you can expect to get your rac in about 21 days -- no faster than having a tax refund directly deposited from the irs.\n\njackson hewitt recently announced it has teamed up with american express (axp) to give clients the option to receive their tax refund on an american express serve card, which also has no setup fee. jackson hewitt is offering to add $50 on the serve card the same day you file your taxes with the firm -- but only for users paying tax prep fees of $150 or more.\n\nfinally, jackson hewitt claims you can get your tax refund money deposited on the serve card up to two days faster than with automatic deposit into your bank account. that's because american express adds the money to the card when it gets notification of the pending irs refund deposit. just be mindful that if you go this route, you'll want to use the card quickly -- it carries a $3 fee for every month it's active.
new research calls into question what's in those iv bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. using a different intravenous fluid instead of the usual saline greatly reduced the risk of death or kidney damage, two large studies found.\n\nthe difference could mean 50,000 to 70,000 fewer deaths and 100,000 fewer cases of kidney failure each year in the u.s., researchers estimate. some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.\n\nwe've been sounding the alarm for 20 years about possible harms from saline, said dr. john kellum, a critical care specialist at the university of pittsburgh. it's purely inertia that prevents a change, he said.\n\nkellum had no role in the studies, which were discussed tuesday at a critical care conference in san antonio and published by the new england journal of medicine. federal grants helped pay for the work.\n\nivs are one of the most common things in health care. they are used to prevent dehydration, maintain blood pressure or give patients medicines or nutrients if they can't eat.\n\nadministering iv fluids is the first thing we do -- we use an iv, we hang an iv and that's how we start taking care of you, régine villain, who manages supplies at nyu langone health, told cbs news last fall.\n\nsaline — salt dissolved in water — has been the most widely used fluid in the u.s. for more than a century even as evidence has emerged that it can harm kidneys, especially when used a lot.\n\nother iv solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also contain potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. they're widely used in europe and australia.\n\nthe studies involved 28,000 patients at vanderbilt university who were given ivs of saline or a balanced fluid. for every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.\n\nsince there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the u.s. alone each year, there are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline, said one study leader, vanderbilt's dr. matthew semler.\n\nafter seeing the results two months ago, vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. the university of pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, kellum said.\n\nthe fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per iv — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.\n\niv fluids have been in the news since hurricane maria hit puerto rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by baxter international, one of the biggest makers of these fluids. the shortage has eased, but some supply issues remain.\n\nbaxter makes up more than 43 percent of the united states' iv solution market, and earlier this year the company told cbs news they produce tens of millions of sterile iv solutions every year.\n\nit's just really nerve-racking to think about not being able to have those bags available to the patient, villain said about a month after the hurricane hit.\n\nbaxter told cbs news in january that production has resumed since the restoration of its power grid, but the company was having to deal with a three-month backlog.
amanda kloots is once again getting candid and deeply personal with her followers. the tv personality reflected on starting the new year with an emotional post about her difficult holiday season following the death of her husband, nick cordero, due to covid-19 in july.\n\nnew years has been tough, extremely hard for me. i've cried more recently than in awhile, kloots wrote in an post shared to her instagram story on saturday. i thought christmas would be hard, this was worse.\n\ni think it's because when the new year comes you want a clean slate or to forget about last year, esp 2020. but, i can't forget about last year and will not be able to wipe that slate clean, kloots continued. i also think i am slightly scared of what can happen in a year, how much things can change.\n\nkloots also shared that she feels like everything i went through is finally catching up to me and i am finally ready to go to therapy to address the trauma.\n\nkloots and cordero tied the knot in september 2017, and welcomed their son, elvis, in june 2019. cordero was hospitalized with covid-19 in april, and after a roller coaster three months of operations and medical setbacks, the broadway actor died on july 5.\n\nkloots continued her emotional message, writing, i share all of this as my continued honesty about grief and loss. how it ebbs and flows, changes a lot. how it hides and then finds you. how it's a journey, not just a week. how it's continued struggle even as i stay positive and active. how you can cry some days for two seconds or two hours. how it makes you feel so lonely and confused.\n\nbeing honest, acknowledging all of this instead of hiding it, has helped me. i hope it helps you, she concluded.\n\namanda kloots posted this on her instagram story over the weekend. screenshot via etonline\n\namid the holidays, kloots has been reflecting on the hardships she endured this year and the death of her husband. on christmas eve, she posted a throwback of her and cordero celebrating their first christmas with their son.\n\nlast month, kloots was announced as a new co-host for the talk. she, along with elaine welteroth, will join current hosts sharon osbourne, sheryl underwood and carrie ann inaba.\n\nthis story originally appeared on etonline, titled amanda kloots shares moving new year's message following the loss of nick cordero
rudolph giuliani, president trump's lawyer, said in a cnn interview wednesday night that he never said there was no collusion between associates of the trump campaign and russia ahead of the 2016 presidential election. i never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign, giuliani said.\n\ni said the president of the united states -- there is not a single bit of evidence the president of the united states committed the only crime you can commit here -- conspiring with the russians to hack the dnc, he told cnn's chris cuomo on cuomo prime time wednesday.\n\ngiuliani's comments would seem to conflict with dozens of tweets from the president in which he says there was no collusion. it also conflicts with some of giuliani's own previous tweets as well.\n\nthe comments were part of a rambling back-and-forth by giuliani in which he mixed his message on whether collusion was even a problem at all. if the collusion happened, it happened a long time ago. it's either provable or it's not. it's not provable because it never happened. when asked what he meant by if it happened, giuliani said, i'm telling you there's no chance it happened.\n\ngiuliani also denied a report that he wants to edit what special counsel robert mueller writes in his report. he said he wants to see it and respond to it before it is public, but would leave it intact, and that it should be made public. he reiterated he does not want to alter the report any any way. of course i should, be able to see the report before it is public, he said. i should be allowed to respond, but i don't want to change the report, i want to respond to the report.\n\ngiuliani also dismissed the alleged contacts with ex-russian agents by former trump campaign chairman paul manafort. he was only there for six months -- or four months, giuliani said of manafort. manafort's attorneys revealed earlier this month that their client is accused of sharing polling data with a former russian intelligence officer.\n\ngiuliani said that sharing polling data was not collusion, and that polling data is given to everybody. however, giuliani said manafort shouldn't have given it to them.
the fearless girl staring down wall street's iconic charging bull is celebrating her first birthday on international women's day, but new york city officials have yet to decide her long-term fate, despite the impact she's made in the business world.\n\nthe bronze statue of a young girl with her head held high and hands placed defiantly on her hips was installed one year ago in lower manhattan by a major financial firm as a call to action for more women to sit on corporate boards.\n\nfearless girl, which was created by artist kristen visbal, stands on property belonging to the city's department of transportation and was originally only supposed to stay for a few days after her arrival. after she became a tourist draw and internet sensation, the statue was permitted to remain standing through february 2018.\n\nnatalie grybauskas, a spokesperson for new york city mayor bill de blasio, told cbs news the statue will likely stay in place for a few more days after international women's day, and the city expects to announce the next steps very soon.\n\nlast month, adweek reported that the fearless girl and her nemesis, the charging bull, could both be moved to a new permanent location. the city declined to comment on the report.\n\nthe fearless girl's message has resonated with new yorkers and visitors alike, and that's something we want to remain a part of the city's civic life, grybauskas said.\n\nthe charging bull and fearless girl statues are shown on lower broadway in new york on march 22, 2017. ap\n\nthe fearless girl statues isn't just popular with visitors near wall street, it's also become a symbol of change in the business world.\n\nstate street global advisors, the asset management firm behind the defiant statue, said it has reached out to and pressured more than 700 companies in the united states, britain and australia that had no women serving on their boards. of those companies, more than 150 have now added at least one woman and 34 committed to making the same change soon.\n\nfearless girl has sparked important conversations around the world, and has increased shareholder action on the issue of gender diversity, rakhi kumar, who leads environmental, social and governance investment strategy at state street, said in a statement. however, there is still important work to be done.\n\nthe firm also said it voted against more than 500 companies for failing to demonstrate progress on board diversity. state street plans to expand its board guidance to companies in japan, canada and europe.\n\nsince her installation, the daring 50-inch statue has received countless visitors and become the star of innumerable tourist photos.
new research about the intense pressure young women face to share nude photos of themselves is raising questions about how we address some of the norms that have taken hold among today's teenagers.\n\nresearchers at northwestern university analyzed nearly 500 stories on an anti-cyberbullying and sexting campaign's website and found that more than two-thirds of girls between ages 12 and 18 said they had been asked for explicit images. researchers say the girls faced persistent requests, anger and threats from boys to send those pictures.\n\npsychologist and cbs news contributor lisa damour joined cbs this morning to discuss the repercussions girls face when they refuse to send explicit photos and why we need to teach teens to stop asking for nude photos -- not to just stop sending them.\n\nthey sometimes face harassment, they sometimes face threats, they're sometimes cut off from relationships, and this has been going on among teenagers for a while, damour said. it's something that teenagers and teenage girls have largely dealt with alone.\n\ndamour says it's important that the issue is being brought to light by this research, and that it's crucial for teenagers to get the message, don't ask for nude photos.\n\nwe have not made a practice of saying 'don't ask for nude photos.' and so one of the important things we need to do at this point is we need to recalibrate that norm and set rules around this, she said.\n\nin explaining this to teens, damour recommends that parents point out what kind of position the sexting request puts both receiver and sender in.\n\nit puts you in an awkward position, personally, socially -- maybe legally, she said. then we need to say don't ask for nude photos – it puts somebody else in a terrible position to do so.\n\nshe also highlighted how the emphasis is often placed on girls to regulate their behavior instead of boys.\n\none of the things i had to come to terms with is that when i've talked with teenagers -- and when a lot of us talk with teenagers -- usually the subtext is: all right ladies, we're gonna ask you to regulate adolescent sexuality because we're not gonna ask the boys, damour said. i think it's something we need to change when we talk about teenagers and to teenagers in general, which is that we're going to ask them to be fair and equitable, both boys and girls, in terms of how they handle themselves in these relationships.\n\nwhile the research started with 12-year-olds, damour recommends beginning a conversation with your kids when they get their first cellphones.\n\ni think a great rule is don't do anything with this phone you wouldn't want your grandmother to see. so that's a good generic way to start it. but then i think it's time to start moving that conversation up, as kids move into 6th, 7th, 8th grade – where we really hear about this happening, she said.\n\nasked about the common refrain that sexting is simply a new norm of the digital age, damour said norms are created in part by rules.\n\nso if we have no rules saying don't ask for pictures, we're not creating the norms we want to create. so i think we need to actually take that extra step and make a rule for all teenagers -- girls and boys. don't ask for these pictures, she said. i think it's one that they've been dealing with largely without adult support and we owe them support for how they're going to conduct their relationships now because that lays the ground work for how they're going to conduct their relationships as adults.
on thursday, education secretary betsy devos resigned in response to the riot at the capitol earlier in the week. in her resignation letter to president trump, devos said that there is no mistaking the impact your rhetoric had on the situation, and it is the inflection point for me. lesley stahl interviewed secretary devos a year into her tenure. the following is the transcript from secretary of education, which originally aired march 11, 2018.\n\nsecretary of education betsy devos is a devout christian grandmother from michigan -- who has spent most of her life trying to improve the quality of education for poor kids. so how in the world did she become one of the most hated members of the trump cabinet?\n\nshe is dedicated to promoting school choice but her critics say she really wants to privatize the public school system that she once called, quote, a dead end.\n\nnow, after the school shooting in parkland, florida, her portfolio is expanding. monday, president trump is expected to appoint her as head of a new commission on school safety charged with developing policies to prevent school violence.\n\ndo something unexpected: answer our questions. you came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions for the 90 minutes you were actually here. how about you actually do your job? #neveragain #doyourjob https://t.co/4ts0inq0gr — aly sheehy🦅 (@aly_sheehy) march 7, 2018\n\nbetsy devos visited the school in florida on wednesday, but like almost everywhere else she goes, she faced criticism. some of the students sent out angry tweets: you came to our school just for publicity and avoided our questions. betsy devos came to my school, talked to three people, and pet a dog. many of the students are frustrated at the administration for talking about school safety, but not acting.\n\nbetsy devos came to my school, talked to three people, and pet a dog. this is incase the press tries to say something else later — alanna//#neveragain (@agci3cu2) march 7, 2018\n\nbetsy devos: i give a lot of credit to the students there for really raising their voices, and i think that they are not going to let this moment go by.\n\nlesley stahl: they want gun control.\n\nbetsy devos: they want a variety of things. they want solutions.\n\nlesley stahl: do you think that teachers should have guns in the classroom?\n\nbetsy devos: that should be an option for states and communities to consider. and i hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, mrs. zorhoff, i couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way. but for those who are-- who are capable, this is one solution that can and should be considered. but no one size fits all. every state and every community is going to address this issue in a different way.\n\nsecretary of education betsy devos speaks with 60 minutes correspondent lesley stahl cbs news\n\nlesley stahl: do you see yourself as a leader in this-- in this subject? and what kind of ideas will you be promoting?\n\nbetsy devos: i have actually asked to head up a task force that will really look at what states are doing. see there are a lot of states that are addressing these issues in very cohesive and coherent ways.\n\nlesley stahl: do you feel a sense of urgency?\n\nbetsy devos: yes.\n\nlesley stahl: 'cause this sounds like talking. instead of acting.\n\nbetsy devos: no, there is a sense of urgency indeed.\n\ni hesitate to think of, like, my first-grade teacher, mrs. zorhoff, i couldn't ever imagine her having a gun and being trained in that way.\n\nthe reason betsy devos wanted to be secretary of education was so she could promote school choice, offering parents options other than traditional public schools – where 90 percent of kids go. she has proposed massive cuts in public education funding and wants to shift billions to alternative players like private, parochial and charter schools.\n\nbetsy devos: we have invested billions and billions and billions of dollars from the federal level and we have seen zero results.\n\nlesley stahl: but that really isn't true. test scores have gone up over the last 25 years. so why do you keep saying nothing's been accomplished?\n\nbetsy devos: well actually, test scores vis-à-vis the rest of the world have not gone up. and we have continued to be middle of the pack at best. that's just not acceptable.\n\nlesley stahl: no it's not acceptable. but it's better than it was. that's the point. you don't acknowledge that things have gotten better. you won't acknowledge that, over the--\n\nbetsy devos: but i don't think they have for too many kids. we've stagnated\n\nlesley stahl: okay, so there's the big argument. so what can be done about that?\n\nbetsy devos: what can be done about that is empowering parents to make the choices for their kids. any family that has the economic means and the power to make choices is doing so for their children. families that don't have the power, that can't decide: i'm gonna move from this apartment in downtown whatever to the suburb where i think the school is gonna be better for my child if they don't have that choice – and they are assigned to that school, they are stuck there. i am fighting for the parents who don't have those choices. we need all parents to have those choices.\n\nwe should be funding and investing in students, not in school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems.\n\nquestion is: does her solution work? do choice schools perform better than public schools? naturally -- there are conflicting studies. it's complicated.\n\nbut devos spends a lot of time showcasing choice schools like cold spring elementary, a public school in indianapolis – that was allowed to get rid of the local teachers' union and create an innovative curriculum.\n\nbut when parents choose these options, taxpayer funds follow the child and that means that the public school left behind can end up with less money.\n\nlesley stahl: why take away money from that school that's not working, to bring them up to a level where they are-- that school is working?\n\nbetsy devos: well, we should be funding and investing in students, not in school-- school buildings, not in institutions, not in systems.\n\nlesley stahl: okay. but what about the kids who are back at the school that's not working? what about those kids?\n\nbetsy devos: well, in places where there have been-- where there is-- a lot of choice that's been introduced-- florida, for example, the-- studies show that when there's a large number of students that opt to go to a different school or different schools, the traditional public schools actually-- the results get better, as well.\n\neducation secretary betsy devos works with students at cold spring school in indianapolis cbs news\n\nlesley stahl: now, has that happened in michigan? we're in michigan. this is your home state.\n\nbetsy devos: michi--yes, well, there's lots of great options and choices for students here.\n\nlesley stahl: have the public schools in michigan gotten better?\n\nbetsy devos: i don't know. overall, i-- i can't say overall that they have all gotten better.\n\nlesley stahl: the whole state is not doing well.\n\nbetsy devos: well, there are certainly lots of pockets where this-- the students are doing well and--\n\nlesley stahl: no, but your argument that if you take funds away that the schools will get better, is not working in michigan where you had a huge impact and influence over the direction of the school system here.\n\nbetsy devos: i hesitate to talk about all schools in general because schools are made up of individual students attending them.\n\nlesley stahl: the public schools here are doing worse than they did.\n\nbetsy devos: michigan schools need to

intentionally visited schools that are underperforming.\n\nlesley stahl: maybe you should.\n\nbetsy devos: maybe i should. yes.\n\ndevos is the only cabinet secretary protected by a squad of u.s. marshals because she's gotten death threats. she's frequently met by protesters who accuse her of pushing an elitist agenda.\n\nshe often manages to offend, as when she called historically black colleges and universities pioneers of school choice – as though they had a choice.\n\nat this commencement speech at bethune-cookman university, students booed and turned their backs to her.\n\nlesley stahl: why have you become, people say, the most hated cabinet secretary?\n\nbetsy devos: i'm not so sure exactly how that happened. but i think there are a lot of really powerful forces allied against change.\n\nlesley stahl: does it hurt?\n\nbetsy devos: sometimes it does. sometimes it does. again, i think-- i think--\n\nlesley stahl: do you ever say--\n\nbetsy devos: --i'm more misunderstood than anything.\n\neducation secretary betsy devos cbs news\n\nsome of the criticism, she feels, is unfair, especially when it involves her wealth. she faced a hostile question about it during a speech at harvard last year.\n\nharvard question: so you're a billionaire with lots and lots of investments. and the so-called school choice movement is a way to open the floodgates for corporate interests to make money off the backs of students. how much do you expect your net worth to increase as a result of your policy choices?\n\nmoderator: you can choose not to answer that secretary.\n\namong president trump's cabinet of moguls and titans, devos is the richest: she grew up wealthy and married even wealthier. in their hometown of grand rapids, the devoses have been exceedingly charitable, their name decorates buildings like the civic center and children's hospital.\n\nat her bruising confirmation hearing, she was grilled about her wealth and lack of experience. she's been an advocate, not an educator.\n\nlesley stahl: what happened there?\n\nbetsy devos: i've not had a root canal, but i can imagine that a root canal might be more pleasant than that was.\n\nlesley stahl: so you've been on the job now over a year. what have you done that you're most proud of?\n\nbetsy devos: yeah. we've begun looking at and rolling back a lot of the overreach of the federal government in education.\n\nby overreach she means regulations. and like most of president trump's cabinet, devos is a devoted de-regulator. part of her job as secretary of education is overseeing guidelines that protect the civil rights of students.\n\njust days after being confirmed, she rescinded a guideline implemented under president obama that allowed transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice – sparking even more protests.\n\nshe is now considering scrapping the obama-era guidance on how to identify, avoid and remedy discriminatory discipline, which aims to prevent schools from punishing students of color more harshly than their white classmates.\n\nbetsy devos: we are studying that rule. we need to ensure that all students have an opportunity to learn in a safe and nurturing environment. and all students means all students.\n\nlesley stahl: yeah but let's say there's a disruption in the classroom and a bunch of whites kids are disruptive and they get punished, you know, go see the principal, but the black kids are, you know, they call in the cops. i mean, that's the issue: who and how the kids who disrupt are being punished.\n\nbetsy devos: arguably, all of these issues or all of this issue comes down to individual kids. and--\n\nlesley stahl: well, no. that-- it's not.\n\nbetsy devos: --it does come down to individual kids. and--often comes down to-- i am committed to making sure that students have the opportunity to learn in an environment that is conducive to their learning.\n\nlesley stahl: do you see this disproportion in discipline for the same infraction as institutional racism?\n\nbetsy devos: we're studying it carefully. and are committed to making sure students have opportunity to learn in safe and nurturing environments.\n\nwhile this regulation is under review, she has already drawn fire for changing title ix guidelines on handling sexual assault on college campuses. she's allowing colleges to require stronger evidence from accusers, and give the accused a greater benefit of the doubt.\n\nlesley stahl: are you in any way, do you think, suggesting that the number of false accusations are as high as the number of actual rapes or assaults?\n\nbetsy devos: well, one sexual assault is one too many, and one falsely accused individual is one too many.\n\nlesley stahl: yeah, but are they the same?\n\nbetsy devos: i don't know. i don't know. but i'm committed to a process that's fair for everyone involved.\n\nlesley stahl: the me-too movement has come along at the same time. this is all feeding into it. we're not talking about colleges anymore. we're talking about men in positions of power in industry and government. have you ever had an issue?\n\nbetsy devos: i can recall a number of moments in the past-- several decades ago that i think today would just be viewed as unacceptable. yeah.\n\nit's been an unlikely journey and balancing act for grandmother betsy

new york — after spending more than half a billion dollars and winning an estimated 31 delegates on super tuesday, former new york mayor mike bloomberg ended his presidential run in the face of a stinging rejection by democratic primary voters, saying he no longer has a path to the nomination.\n\nbloomberg released a statement saying he would be leaving the race and endorsing joe biden.\n\nthree months ago, i entered the race for president to defeat donald trump. today, i am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat donald trump — because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult, he said. i'm a believer in using data to inform decisions. after yesterday's results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible — and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.\n\nit's been a little over three months since bloomberg joined the democratic primary race. though he had initially declined to run in 2020, the billionaire entered the campaign fray because he had no confidence that anyone in the field could beat president trump in november.\n\nclick here to view related media. click to expand\n\ni started watching and listening to the candidates, he said on 60 minutes on sunday. and they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. donald trump is going to eat them for lunch.\n\nbut bloomberg said wednesday that it had become evident biden is the candidate to unite behind with the best chance at defeating mr. trump in november.\n\ni've known joe for a very long time. i know his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country — including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs, he said in his statement. i've had the chance to work with joe on those issues over the years, and joe has fought for working people his whole life. today i am glad to endorse him — and i will work to make him the next president of the united states.\n\nbiden thanked bloomberg for his support and praised the former new york city mayor for his work combatting climate change and ending gun violence. this race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. it's about defeating donald trump, and with your help, we're gonna do it, biden said in a tweet.\n\nbloomberg had hoped for a strong showing in virginia, where he announced his candidacy in late november, and in other states like tennessee, north carolina and oklahoma. but biden won all of those states on tuesday. bloomberg captured only american samoa.\n\nhe ended up spending a stunning $570 million on total advertising over the course of his candidacy, amounting to $18 million per delegate he ultimately won.\n\nin virginia, bloomberg spent nearly $18 million on advertising in the weeks running up to super tuesday. the deluge of spending did little to persuade voters in the state — exit polling showed 56% of them had a negative view of bloomberg, compared to 39% who viewed him favorably.\n\nclick here to view related media. click to expand\n\nbloomberg's path to the nomination had already become less clear after his lackluster debate performance and the resurgence of biden in the south carolina democratic primary.\n\nfrom the start, bloomberg bucked the political norms of presidential campaigning. opting to skip the first four early voting states entirely, bloomberg flooded television, radio and digital markets nationwide and in the super tuesday states, outspending every other candidate in the field, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in some states.\n\non the campaign trail, he spent little time in the photo line taking pictures with voters, and declined to take questions, something most of his competitors did. instead, bloomberg held comparatively short events that had the production value of a general election rally. bloomberg focused heavily on super tuesday and battleground states. during an election night event in west palm beach, bloomberg showed no signs he planned to drop out.\n\nin just three months, we've gone from 1% in the polls to being a contender for the democratic nomination for president, bloomberg told the crowd of supporters tuesday. if i'm the nominee, let me make you this promise: we will beat donald trump here in florida and in swing states around the country.\n\nfollowing the results in iowa and new hampshire, which showed sanders in a strong position, the bloomberg campaign saw an opportunity to capitalize on moderate candidates splitting the rest of the field, calling on others to drop out and rally behind him as the only viable alternative to sanders. a campaign memo suggested the race for the nomination was between two candidates, bloomberg and sanders, and also warned that if sanders were the nominee, he would eventually lose to mr. trump in the fall.\n\nalthough bloomberg used his large network of support from mayors across the country and organizations like every town and moms demand action, the former mayor and one-time republican had a hard time distancing himself from his past.\n\nhe was also never able to completely put behind him his mayoral administration's implementation of the controversial policing practice, stop-and-frisk. questions surrounding past comments he is alleged to have made to women who worked for his company, bloomberg lp, also surfaced as his campaign built momentum. in february, after pressure from fellow democratic contender and elizabeth warren, bloomberg released three women from non-disclosure agreements in an effort to promote more transparency at his company.\n\na constant target of mr. trump, bloomberg made his intentions clear from at every speech that his focus was beating mr. trump in the general election.\n\nthe president continued his trend of attacking bloomberg after he announced his decision to leave the presidential race and rejected the notion that biden will ensure he is a one-term president.\n\nmini mike bloomberg just 'quit' the race for president. i could have told him long ago that he didn't have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost, he wrote on twitter. now he will pour money into sleepy joe's campaign, hoping to save face. it won't work!\n\nmini mike bloomberg just quit the race for president. i could have told him long ago that he didn't

as navy seals talk publicly to cbs news about drug abuse in the ranks for the first time, some members of the elite force say drugs aren't the only problem.\n\naccording to interviews, e-mails and text messages from nine current and former seals, ...there's been a corruption within the teams, one of them wrote. the death of our quiet professionalism continues to erode at our ethos, and endangers our teammates overseas, not to mention our families at home.\n\nthree navy seals -- one active duty, two retired -- agreed to talk to cbs news on camera if we disguised their faces and change their voices to protect them from retribution.\n\none seal told cbs news correspondent david martin that the community has got to stop seeking the limelight and exposing what they do or it continues to put people in danger.\n\nthey accused fellow seals of profiteering -- or as they called it -- selling the trident, a reference to the insignia they earn after making it through basic training. fitness routines based on seal training have become a cottage industry as have books by former seals.\n\nthey are just guys that are going in to try and sell the brand, to sell that trident on their chest, to make a buck from it, said one seal. and frankly if that's all they were doing, so what? but the thing they're selling is information.\n\nthese men say movies like zero dark thirty and captain phillips are all too accurate in showing the way seals operate. one movie, act of valor, included active duty seals in the cast.\n\nthey get all of these, you know, sometimes ex-seals or active-duty seals to help make sure it looks as realistic as possible in that process, you know, on seal told us. unknowingly or knowingly they're giving away, you know, our tactics and procedures.\n\nas long ago as 2012, seven navy seals were disciplined for having worked as paid consultants on the video game medal of honor: warfighter.\n\ndo video games really give away real tactics?\n\nhow we move, and, you know, they were pretty accurate for a lot of different things, you know, one seal said. so yeah, i would say some of them do.\n\none seal told martin that he has had to change the way he operates because something has been made public.\n\nit all adds up to a betrayal of the seals' own code of conduct.\n\nwhen i joined the navy, the brochure said 'quiet professionals,' and that's what i signed up for, but that's not what it is today, one seal said.\n\nis fame ruining the seals? martin asked\n\ni believe that has a lot to do with it, one seal responded.
san francisco -- instagram users could soon notice something different in their feeds: instead of always showing the most recent posts first, the popular mobile photo-sharing app says it will give higher priority to posts that each user is likely to care about most.\n\nif that sounds familiar, it's because that's how facebook decides what to show users in their news feeds. facebook inc., which owns instagram, has long used a complex formula to emphasize items it hopes will be relevant to each user, based on factors like whether the post came from a close friend or how the user responded to similar posts.\n\ntwitter also adopted a similar approach recently, abandoning its most-recent-first order to present popular tweets from people you follow at the top of your feed.\n\nnot all instagram fans greeted the news positively. there was almost immediate backlash, which many users posted on rival social media site twitter.\n\n@instagram leave the feed. let us decide what we care about. don't need an algorithm to decide what posts i should see. #instagramfeed — ajdmacc (@ajdmacc) march 16, 2016\n\nnoooooo instagram announced that its going to start using an algorithm like facebook so posts won't be chronological anymore 😢 — monica joy constant (@monicaconstant) march 16, 2016\n\nuntil now, instagram had shown every post in reverse-chronological order, with the newest ones at the top. but as its audience has grown to more than 400 million users, instagram says it's become harder for users to keep up with the gusher of photos and videos posted by friends, celebrities and other accounts they follow.\n\nthis means you often don't see the posts you might care about the most, the service said in a message to users on tuesday.\n\ninstagram plans to introduce the new formula gradually, using an algorithm that gives weight to the same kind of factors facebook considers in its news feed. instagram says users will still be able to find all the posts they saw before, although they won't be in the same order.\n\njudging from posts on instagram itself, user reaction was mixed, at best.\n\nit's an instagram apocalypse, joked cnet's dan ackerman. all these social media brands are trying to find ways to be more engaging, to kind of get you to come back more often and like what you see more. so they're figuring out what posts and what stories and what tweets or photos you want to see, more than just 'here's the 10 last things that anybody posted.'\n\nthe strategy of phasing in the new feature gradually seems intended to avert too strong a backlash from users who don't like the new system -- a problem every social network has faced when it changed familiar features. facebook annoyed many early users when it changed from reverse-chronological ordering to its current formula several years ago. twitter has also run into user complaints whenever it hints at changing its layout or the length allowed in tweets.\n\nthe change comes as instagram is also showing more commercial messages. while the new formula doesn't affect advertising, instagram needs to keep users engaged and interested if it wants to maintain its audience for paid postings.
the new hampshire democratic primary brought to the surface various issues that divided voters — frequently pitting bernie sanders on one side against pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar on the other. sanders won the state, with buttigieg finishing second and klobuchar third.\n\nelizabeth warren and joe biden were unable to gain momentum in new hampshire and neither was on pace to win delegates. electability was an issue for voters that did not work in either warren's or biden's favor. almost 30% of new hampshire democratic primary voters thought biden had run the most negative campaign.\n\nexit polls show democratic primary voters prioritized beating president trump over having a candidate who agrees with them on the issues. of the majority of voters concerned about beating mr. trump, their support was split between buttigieg and klobuchar. for voters more concerned about a candidate agreeing with them on issues, support went to sanders.\n\nanother issue that separated the field was whether voters wanted a candidate who can bring needed change or one who can unite the country. of those who said they want change, the largest share of support went to sanders. of those who are looking to unite, support was split between buttigieg and klobuchar.\n\nsimilarly, primary voters were split between those who think the next president should return to barack obama's policies — a group that supported klobuchar, followed by buttigieg — and those who think the next president should change to more liberal policies — a group that supported sanders.\n\ntop issues for sanders\n\nbernie sanders garnered the support of younger voters, people under 30 years of age. people in low-income households were also more likely to vote for sanders. additionally, for those voters who identified as liberal — which was 6 in 10 of the new hampshire democratic primary voters — tended to support sanders.\n\nwhen asked about the issues that were most important to them, health care was cited the most, and the voters who said that tended to support sanders.\n\nthose who said they support replacing private insurance with a government plan mostly voted for sanders. additionally, voters who cared about the issue of income inequality also strongly supported sanders.\n\nbuttigieg favored for electability\n\npete buttigieg has more support among voters who prioritize electability over agreement on issues. he has strong support among high-income households.\n\nbuttigieg's competitive showing in iowa seems to have helped him in new hampshire. half of the new hampshire democratic primary voters said they made their decision in the past few days and a large share of those supported buttigieg.\n\nbuttigieg also splits the moderate vote with klobuchar.\n\nolder voters, college grads for klobuchar\n\namy klobuchar did well among voters aged 65 and over and among college graduates. klobuchar also had strong support from people who regularly attend religious services.\n\nshe split the support of moderates with buttigieg. similarly they split the support of people who want to return to barack obama's policies.\n\nvoters who said age is a factor in choosing a candidate divided between klobuchar and buttigieg. like buttigieg, klobuchar had strong support among new hampshire democratic primary voters who made their decision in the last few days, as well as those who factored the recent debate into their decision. the debate worked heavily in klobuchar's favor in this primary.\n\nabout the author: melissa herrmann is president of ssrs, a full-service survey and market research firm.
despite what you hear about artificial intelligence, machines still can't think like a human, but in the last few years they have become capable of learning. and suddenly, our devices have opened their eyes and ears and cars have taken the wheel. today, artificial intelligence is not as good as you hope and not as bad as you fear, but humanity is accelerating into a future that few can predict. that's why so many people are desperate to meet kai-fu lee, the oracle of ai.\n\nkai-fu lee is in there, somewhere, in a selfie scrum at a beijing internet conference. his 50 million social media followers want to be seen in the same frame because of his talent for engineering and genius for wealth.\n\nscott pelley: i wonder, do you think people around the world have any idea what's coming in artificial intelligence?\n\nkai-fu lee: i think most people have no idea, and many people have the wrong idea.\n\nscott pelley: but you do believe it's going to change the world?\n\nkai-fu lee: i believe it's going to change the world more than anything in the history of mankind. more than electricity.\n\nlee believes the best place to be an ai capitalist is communist china. his beijing venture capital firm manufactures billionaires.\n\nkai-fu lee in a scrum of selfie seekers\n\nkai-fu lee: these are the entrepreneurs that we have funded.\n\nhe's funded 50 ai start-ups.\n\nkai-fu lee: we have about ten billion-dollar-companies here.\n\nscott pelley: ten, $1 billion-companies that you funded?\n\nkai-fu lee: yes, including a few $10 billion-companies.\n\nin 2017, china attracted half of all ai capital in the world. one of lee's investments is face++, not affiliated with facebook. its visual recognition system smothered me to guess my age. it settled on 61 which was wrong. i wouldn't be 61 for days. on the street, face++ nailed everything that moved. it's a kind of artificial intelligence that has been made possible by three innovations: super fast computer chips, all the world's data now available online, and a revolution in programming called deep learning. computers used to be given rigid instructions. now they're programmed to learn on their own.\n\nkai-fu lee: in early days of ai, people try to program the ai with how people think. so, i would write a program to say, measure the size of the eyes and their distance. measure the size of the nose. measure the shape of the face. and then, if these things match, then this is larry and that's john. but today, you just take all the pictures of larry and john and you tell the system, go at it. you figure out what separates larry from john.\n\nlet's say you want the computer to be able to pick men out of a crowd and describe their clothing? well, you simply show the computer ten million pictures of men in various kinds of dress. that's what they mean by deep learning. it's not intelligence so much. it's just the brute force of data having ten million examples to choose from.\n\nso, face++ tagged me as male, short hair, black long sleeves, black long pants. it's wrong about my gray suit and this is exactly how it learns. when engineers discover that error, they'll show the computer a million gray suits and it won't make that mistake again.\n\nanother recognition system we saw, or saw us, is learning not just who you are but how you feel.\n\nscott pelley: now what are all the dots on the screen? the dots over our eyes and our mouths?\n\nsongfan yang: the computer keeps track of all the feature points on the face.\n\nsongfan yang developed this for tal education group, which tutors 5 million chinese students.\n\nscott pelley: well let's look at what we are seeing here now. according to the computer, i'm confused, which is generally the case. but when i laughed i was happy. that's amazing.\n\nsongfan yang: exactly.\n\nthe machine notices concentration or distraction to pick out for the teacher those students who are struggling or gifted.\n\nscott pelley: it can tell when the child is excited about math?\n\nkai-fu lee: yes.\n\nscott pelley: or the other child is excited about poetry?\n\nkai-fu lee: yes.\n\nscott pelley: could these ai systems pick out geniuses from the countryside?\n\nkai-fu lee: that's possible in the future. it can also create a student profile and know where the student got stuck so the teacher can personalize the areas in which the student needs help.\n\nai will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.\n\nwe found kai-fu lee's personal passion in this spare beijing studio. he's projecting top teachers into china's poorest schools. this english teacher is connected to a class 1,000 miles away in a village called duh-fang.\n\nmany students in duh-fang are called 'left behinds' because their parents left them with family when they moved to the cities for work. most 'left behinds' don't get past ninth grade. lee is counting on ai to deliver for them the same opportunity he had when he immigrated to the u.s. from taiwan as a boy.\n\nkai-fu lee: when i arrived in tennessee, my principal took every lunch to teach me english. and that is the kind of attention that i've not been used to growing up in asia. and i felt that the american classrooms are smaller, encouraged individual thinking, critical thinking. and i felt it was the best thing that ever happened to me.\n\nand, 'the best thing that ever happened' to most of the engineers we met at lee's firm – they too are alumni of america – with a dream for china.\n\nscott pelley: you have written that silicon valley's edge is not all it's cracked up to be. what do you mean by that?\n\nkai-fu lee: well, silicon valley has been the single epicenter of the world technology innovation when it comes to computers, internet, mobile and ai. but in the recent five years, we are seeing that chinese ai is getting to be almost as good as silicon valley ai. and i think silicon valley is not quite aware of it yet.\n\nchina's advantage is in the amount of data it collects. the more data, the better the ai. just like the more you know, the smarter you are. china has four times more people than the united states who are doing nearly everything online.\n\nscott pelley: i just don't see any chinese without a phone in their hand.\n\ncollege student monica sun showed us how more than a billion chinese are using their phones to buy everything, find anything and connect with everyone. in america, when personal information leaks, we have congressional hearings. not in china.\n\nscott pelley: do you ever worry about the information that's being collected about you where you go what you buy who you're with?\n\nmonica sun: i never think about it.\n\nscott pelley: do you think most chinese worry about their privacy?\n\nmonica sun: not that much.\n\nscott pelley: not that much.\n\nwith a pliant public, the leader of the communist party has made a national priority of achieving ai dominance in ten years. this is where kai-fu lee becomes uncharacteristically shy. even though he's a former apple, microsoft and google executive, he knows who's boss in china.\n\nscott pelley: president xi has called technology the sharp weapon of the modern state. what does he mean by that?\n\nkai-fu lee: i am not an expert in interpreting his thoughts. i don't know.\n\nscott pelley: there are those, particularly people in the west who worry about this ai technology as being something that governments will use to control their people and to crush dissent.\n\nkai-fu lee: as a venture capitalist, we don't invest in this area, and we're not studying deeply this particular problem.\n\nscott pelley: but governments do.\n\nkai-fu lee: it's certainly possible for governments to use the technologies, just like companies.\n\nlee is much more talkative about another threat posed by ai. he explores the coming destruction of jobs in a new book, ai superpowers: china, silicon valley and the new world order.\n\nkai-fu lee: ai will increasingly replace repetitive jobs. not just for blue-collar work but a lot of white-collar work.\n\nscott pelley: what sort of jobs would be lost to ai?\n\nkai-fu lee: basically chauffeurs, truck drivers anyone who does driving for a living their jobs will be disrupted more in the 15 to 20 year time frame and many jobs that seem a little bit complex, chef, waiter, a lot of things will become automated we'll have automated stores, automated restaurants, and all together in 15 years, that's going to displace about 40 percent of the jobs in the world.\n\nscott pelley: forty percent of the jobs in the world will be displaced by technology?\n\nkai-fu lee: i would say displaceable.\n\nscott pelley: what does that do to the fabric of society?\n\nkai-fu lee: well, in some sense there is the human wisdom that always overcomes these technology revolutions. the invention of the steam engine, the sewing machine, electricity, have all displaced jobs. and we've gotten over it. the challenge of ai is this 40 percent, whether it is 15 or 25 years, is coming faster than the previous revolutions.\n\nthere's a lot of hype about artificial intelligence, and it's important to understand this is not general intelligence like that of a human. this system can read faces and grade papers but it has no idea why these children are in this room or what the goal of education is. a typical ai system can do one thing well, but can't adapt what it knows to any other task. so for now, it may be that calling this intelligence, isn't very smart.\n\nscott pelley: when will we know that a machine can actually think like a human?\n\nkai-fu lee: back when i was a grad student, people said, if machine can drive a car by itself, that's intelligence. now we say that's not enough. so, the bar keeps moving higher. i think that's, i guess, more motivation for us to work harder. but if you're talking about agi, artificial general intelligence, i would say not within the next 30 years, and possibly never.\n\nscott pelley: possibly never? what's so insurmountable?\n\nkai-fu lee: because i believe in the sanctity of our soul. i believe there is a lot of things about us that we don't understand. i believe there's a lot of love and compassion that is not explainable in terms of neural networks and computation algorithms. and i currently see no way of solving them. obviously, unsolved problems have been solved in the past. but it would be irresponsible for me to predict that these will be solved by a certain timeframe.\n\nscott pelley: we may just be more than our bits?\n\nkai-fu lee: we may.\n\nproduced by guy campanile and andrew bast\n\neditor's note: in an earlier version of this story, we stated that kai-fu lee has funded 140 artificial intelligence start-ups. the correct number is 50.
broadcom (avgo) raised its bid for qualcomm (qcom) to more than $121 billion in cash and stock monday in what would be the largest tech deal in history.\n\nbroadcom ltd. said that its best and final offer of $82 per qualcomm share includes $60 in cash and the rest in broadcom shares.\n\nqualcomm, which makes the omnipresent snapdragon chips used in smartphones and tablets, said monday that it has received the revised bid and that its board, along with financial and legal advisers, will review the offer.\n\nqualcomm inc. previously said that a $103 billion unsolicited acquisition offer undervalued the san diego company. it criticized the people that broadcom and silver lake partners had wanted to put on its board, saying that they were conflicted and had no skills or expertise to offer.\n\nqualcomm is already the no. 3 global chip supplier, according to research firm gartner, behind intel and samsung. a combination with broadcom would not change that.\n\nbroadcom is the product of a $37 billion tie up two years ago between avago, a singapore company that was once part of a former unit of pioneering pc maker hewlett-packard, and broadcom, another company with origins in southern california that made chips.\n\nbroadcom is hungry to grow and it's moving its home address to delaware to make that happen. the company's corporate headquarters in san jose, california, but its home address is in singapore.\n\nqualcomm is in the middle of negotiating a $38.1 billion deal to buy nxp semiconductors, but that's come under regulatory scrutiny in europe. broadcom said monday that its revised takeover offer is premised on either qualcomm acquiring nxp or the transaction being terminated. it also doesn't want qualcomm to delay or adjourn its annual meeting past march 6.\n\nqualcomm's stock dropped 2 percent in premarket trading, while shares of broadcom rose slightly.

and this is face the nation.\n\nwashington may have a new congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.\n\npresident donald trump: you can call it the schumer or the pelosi or the trump shutdown, doesn't make any difference to me. just words.\n\nmargaret brennan: but words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the u.s. government remains shuttered for the third week. president trump warns it could last months or years and democrats dig in.\n\nnancy pelosi: we're not a doing a wall. does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. the democratic whip, senator dick durbin of illinois and republican senator lindsey graham of south carolina.\n\nkevin mccarthy: nancy pelosi, i extend to you this gavel.\n\nmargaret brennan: in the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth congress gavels in, nancy pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as democrats take control of the house and usher in the most diverse congress in history. a panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the president.\n\nrepresentative max rose: this is a national disgrace.\n\nmargaret brennan: and it's off to the races as the battle for the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape. one high-profile democrat jumps in.\n\nelizabeth warren: hello, council bluffs. whoo.\n\nmargaret brennan: and other potential candidates near their own decisions.\n\nall that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on face the nation.\n\ngood morning and welcome to face the nation. top white house officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. so far their talks have yielded nothing. yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. with no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.\n\nwe begin today with senate democratic whip dick durbin who is in springfield, illinois. senator durbin is among a group of senators talking to the white house about how to end this shutdown. senator, welcome to face the nation. the president said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. if he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will senate democrats do?\n\nsenator dick durbin (minority whip/@senatordurbin/d-illinois): well, i can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. this is the first president in history who shut down his own government. unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. as of next friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. this is totally unnecessary. and that's a point we've made over and over to this president, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for america.\n\nmargaret brennan: but the president says he could bypass congress by declaring this national emergency. so what would you do if he-- he went that route?\n\nsenator dick durbin: i can just tell you, i don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, i'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.\n\nmargaret brennan: we described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. you were in the room with the president on friday. did you hear any points of agreement?\n\nsenator dick durbin: well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. but what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. this gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the republican senate leader, mitch mcconnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. he's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the president. he is part of a branch of government and a leader in the senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. as of last night, three republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.\n\nmargaret brennan: so from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. how close are we to ending this shutdown?\n\nsenator dick durbin: well, i can't say that we're close because president's made it clear he doesn't care. he's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. it was stunning to hear a president of the united states say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. but that is his position. think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the treasury department has been shut down, the internal revenue service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.\n\nmargaret brennan: according to the white house, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among democrats, right? they point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? what-- what is your response to that?\n\nsenator dick durbin: well, i would just say, do you remember the president's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the mexicans. how many times did he say that to the american people? that is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, he now says--\n\nsenator dick durbin: talk about-- or--\n\nmargaret brennan: --it doesn't have to be concrete.\n\nsenator dick durbin: --those fences and barriers. well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. and when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? he basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. that is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which democrats certainly want.\n\nmargaret brennan: have you seen the more specific financial request that the white house says they were giving to democrats?\n\nsenator dick durbin: no. as a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between vice president pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the president's latest demand might be. but vice president pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. and then within a matter of hours, the president reversed and said, no, it has to be 5.6. that's what we're up against. there doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. if we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the united states overstayed visas.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator dick durbin: they did not cross the border. the solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. and this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.\n\nmargaret brennan: it sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?\n\nsenator dick durbin: i don't see that. but i will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. the president could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. but he said, no, i'm going to shut down my own government. that's what he's done.\n\nmargaret brennan: there has been speculation and-- and our next guest, senator lindsey graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for daca, sort of, a trade here. the president stood in the rose garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the supreme court rules on daca before he comes to any kind of proposal here. do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? and is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?\n\nsenator dick durbin: listen, senator graham and i could not be more different politically. he's a conservative republican from south carolina; i'm a progressive democrat from illinois. but we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. and a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the president on january, the eleventh, 2018, i do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with daca and many other aspects of the reform and the president rejected it. he said, i'll go with my approach. his approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the united states senate. it wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. so we're in a position now where when the president makes these claims and promises a lot of us, i hope i could speak for senator graham, are a little bit skeptical.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, thank you very much, senator.\n\nwe will turn now to south carolina republican senator lindsey graham who joins us from clemson. senator graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the president, often shares his advice. senator, did you speak to the president this weekend about this shutdown?\n\nsenator lindsey graham (r-south carolina/@lindseygrahamsc): yeah. it was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. dick durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. we're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ice, not support ice. we're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. as long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. the president will compromise but he will not capitulate. so that's where we're at.\n\nmargaret brennan: but the people in the room are your colleague senator durbin along with--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: he's not in the room.\n\nmargaret brennan: --along with speaker pelosi. you don't--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: he's not in the room. neither one of them are in the room.\n\nmargaret brennan: he was on friday. he was--\n\nsenator lindsey graham. neither one--\n\nmargaret brennan: --on friday with the president.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: they sent staff. they sent staff people to do the negotiation. the vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers.\n\nmargaret brennan: today.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: dick durbin is a good guy. he's a reasonable guy. but nancy pelosi has made progress. she's gone from not a penny to a dollar. nancy pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. president trump sees it as real. until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. the president is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. it will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. and every plan i've supported in the past with dick durbin has had money for physical barriers--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --including walls and fences. except now when trump is president.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, there are about eight hundred thousand federal workers who are in this limbo not being sure--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --when they're going to get paid. so--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? who gives you a dollar for a wall when the democratic party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? we're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. we'll negotiate with dick durbin but i'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the border patrol agents a bunch of nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. these caravans have changed everything. the reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. we've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from central america.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: and it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only god knows what they go through to get here. the democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--\n\nmargaret brennan: but what about--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --until that changes there's--\n\nmargaret brennan: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the coast guard? who are not going to get paid.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah. they're being held hostage. they're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. they're being held hostage by people--\n\nmargaret brennan: so you don't want to--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --who accuse them--\n\nmargaret brennan: --open the government and then continue talking?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. the goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. that ice is not the problem, it's the solution. the goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. it's to implement policies--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --democrats have voted for in the past on president trump's watch. we're not going to give in to this radical left ever until we can find a rational way forward. we'll have wall as part of a border security plan. we're going nowhere. wall plus daca plus tps makes sense. but you'll never convince me--\n\nmargaret brennan: is the president open to--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --that we don't need a wall.\n\nmargaret brennan: but is the president open--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah i think so.\n\nmargaret brennan: --to that compromise you just floated there?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah. i really believe that.\n\nmargaret brennan: that daca and tps for a wall?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah. but what he's not open to is a lecture by the speaker of the house. i'll give you a dollar. he's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being gestapo agents gassing children. he's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. so if you bring dick durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm. but let's dig into that--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: if the left is going to--\n\nmargaret brennan: --because that's significant what you said there--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: okay.\n\nmargaret brennan: --if you think the president--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah i think he is open to it.\n\nmargaret brennan: --is indeed open to a daca for wall trade here because he stood in the rose garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: okay. here's what he's open to. he's open to getting his wall money. we need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. he has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. so how can you say he's not open minded to it. here's what i think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. and i think we can put on the table tps reform. there's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. i'd like to deal with that problem and i would--\n\nmargaret brennan: when is that going to be put on the table? that offer.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. we're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, i don't see anything happening.\n\nmargaret brennan: you've worked with the president's son-in-law jared kushner on criminal justice reform.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: he is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of daca for wall.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: yes, he is.\n\nmargaret brennan: but the president really seemed to shoot that down in the rose garden the other day.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i am here to tell you--\n\nmargaret brennan: when would we see that put on the table? is that-- that's a bigger immigration overhaul than what we're talking about right now which is simply the wall.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: when you see dick durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. when you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. when you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. when that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal democrats who don't see a border security problem. they see their own government being the problem--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --not the illegal immigrant. until that changes we'll never get anywhere. there is a deal to be had here--\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --but it will include a wall. and if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to ask you about syria. i know you watch the region and you had criticized the president's decision to pull out. the national security adviser john bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a u.s. drawdown and it'll be dependent on turkey agreeing not to slaughter our kurdish allies. it sounds like he's describing--\n\nsenator lindsey graham: right.\n\nmargaret brennan: --an indefinite timeline of u.s. troops staying in syria.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: well, i had lunch with the president last week and i came away a bit encourage. there are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. we want to make sure that when we leave the kurds do not get slaughtered. and i don't trust turkey to take care of the kurds. it'd be like putin trying to police assad. that didn't work well. we need a plan to protect the kurds from turkey and others. we need to make sure isis doesn't come back once they're defeated and iran is not the biggest winner. if you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which i think we can, then count me in. but those three things have to be--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: --accomplished for us to successfully leave syria. and the president's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. don't let iran get the oil fields, don't let the turks-- turks slaughter the kurds, and don't let isis come back. i think i share the goal of the president to withdraw our forces. let's just do it smartly.\n\nmargaret brennan: is this an admission that the president made a mistake?\n\nsenator lindsey graham: i think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. president obama ended the operations in iraq against sound military advice. the president's getting sound military advice about the status of the kurds--what will happen with iran if we leave too soon. and the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that isis doesn't come back. and i applaud the president for re-evaluating what he's doing. he hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. and president obama never would do that. and you saw what happened when a president shuts people out. this president's not shutting people out. he has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. i share that goal. let's just do it smartly.\n\nmargaret brennan: senator graham, thank you for joining us.\n\nsenator lindsey graham: thank you.\n\nmargaret brennan: we will be back in a moment. don't go away.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: four freshman democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in congress. we spoke with representative jahana hayes, a former national teacher of the year from my home state of connecticut and that state's first african-american woman to serve in congress. congressman max rose, an army captain from new york who earned a bronze star and a purple heart in afghanistan, he then went on to work in the brooklyn district attorney's office. congresswoman mikie sherrill represents new jersey. she flew helicopter missions in the navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. and representative colin allred, who's from texas. he's a former nfl player who later worked for president obama's department of housing and urban development. we started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.\n\nall of you just came to washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. all of you took a vote to reopen the government but leader mcconnell in the senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. where do we go from here, congresswoman?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill (d-new jersey/@repsherrill): well, i don't think it's a waste of time. we voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the senate, within the last month. and so i think what we're asking congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.\n\nmargaret brennan: but passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the president has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. do you see, congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?\n\nrepresentative colin allred (d-texas/@repcolinallred): well, let's be very clear. he doesn't want border security. we have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. there is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. a five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. there's a lot of things we can do instead of that.\n\nmargaret brennan: is it just a matter of semantics here? border fence, some kind of barrier? i mean is there movement for democrats to support what the president in some way is asking for?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: well, let me say, i'm from texas. we have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that.\n\nmargaret brennan: congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? i mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. are you seeing that in your district?\n\nrepresentative max rose (d-new york/@ repmaxrose): absolutely. look we all are. we all have federal workers in our district. this is a national disgrace. there's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. but we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.\n\nmargaret brennan: so, speaker pelosi has called the wall an immorality. she said, no way, no how, is the president going to get money for it. that's a pretty hard line position versus where the president is. do you find any room for compromise in the middle?\n\nrepresentative max rose: the room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. we don't--\n\nmargaret brennan: you think the ports are a bigger issue than the southern border?\n\nrepresentative max rose: i think that we have serious issues throughout the country. the point here is that what i'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. what, you want to also bring horses back to the united states cavalry?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative max rose: bring some rowboats to the navy? we can put trump's name on it. this is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? let's get back to work. it's why we all ran and i know it's what the republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. and i promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. this is not political suicide.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for democrats. do you see your-- your fellow house members getting on board?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes (d-connecticut/@jahanahayesct): well i think-- i apologize i lost my voice yesterday. but i think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. we have to get to work. we cannot keep operating in hard lines. we cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. we have to move. that's why we were elected. that's what we were sent here to do. we have to get back to work.\n\nmargaret brennan: so you would be open--\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: absolutely.\n\nmargaret brennan: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: i think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.\n\nmargaret brennan: so would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for democrats, like protections for dreamers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: well, i think it's important to see what's in the package. and it's- i think it's hard for any of us to say. i think all of us at this table came to congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. we're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. we need some bend from the other side as well.\n\nmargaret brennan: we'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. so, stay with us.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: new york democrat alexandria ocasio-cortez has made a name for herself taking on republicans in her own party. tonight, she sits down with 60 minutes. here's part of her interview.\n\n(begin vt)\n\nanderson cooper (60 minutes): you're willing to compromise?\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez (60 minutes): yeah, absolutely. absolutely. it's just about what we choose to compromise. my personal opinion. and i know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. and--\n\nanderson cooper (60 minutes): the democratic party has lost so much.\n\nalexandria ocasio-cortez (60 minutes): i think so. i think-- i think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with mitch mcconnell, whether it's compromising on climate change i think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am i open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. absolutely.\n\n(end vt)\n\nmargaret brennan: and you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 minutes.\n\nnext up on face the nation, we'll have more of our panel of new house members.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. we continue our conversation now with our panel of new house members. earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in washington.\n\nanother topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. the house oversight chairman, elijah cummings, said that's premature. what do you all think? is that too soon?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i-- i think so. i'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the fbi finished their investigation. i think we've got to let mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.\n\nmargaret brennan: you're waiting on the mueller report?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i am.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: it's absolutely premature. this is way too early to be talking about this. we need to let the investigation run its course. and i just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the tone of this conversation? one of your colleagues, congresswoman from michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. what do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?\n\nrepresentative max rose: well, i'm from staten island. i have no problem with profanity, okay? well what-- what i have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. i-- i-- i certainly object to it.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: premature.\n\nmargaret brennan: premature.\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: the gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.\n\nmargaret brennan: i want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. congresswoman, as we said, you're from connecticut. in your home state that was the site of the sandy hook shooting. i know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. what is it that you think can actually get done? what are you going to try to do about gun control?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: well, i think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. i think we have to have background checks. we have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.\n\nmargaret brennan: so would you commend the trump administration for this ban on bump stocks that recently happened?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes. yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: but not enough?\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: it's a first step.\n\nmargaret brennan: it's a first step.\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: congressman rose, you served in afghanistan as we said in your introduction. both president obama and president trump have wanted to draw down troops--\n\nrepresentative max rose: mm-hm.\n\nmargaret brennan: --from that war zone. what do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?\n\nrepresentative max rose: well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. so the key here in afghanistan, because we saw in iraq, the invasion of iraq was absolutely foolish. but then we did a speedy withdrawal, which i believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. we cannot afford to do the same thing in afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative max rose: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. and i intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that.\n\nmargaret brennan: and that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--\n\nrepresentative max rose: no. it-- it absolutely isn't. but we have been at war in afghanistan now for seventeen years. to put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the united states military who were born after 9/11. and we cannot just have perpetual war. but we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. we need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--\n\nmargaret brennan: that sounds like what the trump administration is suggesting.\n\nrepresentative max rose: well, what i just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. i believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. i don't want to see americans put at risk. i've watched loved ones get hurt. i don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. but i just want us to have a long-term strategy--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative max rose: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the united states military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action.\n\nmargaret brennan: congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. what do you think? do you support not just afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: you know what i would add to what max is saying, and what i think is lost a little bit in the discussion of trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. we are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and nato, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. and so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, i think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.\n\nmargaret brennan: but you support a drawdown?\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but i don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in syria we're just pulling out.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: you have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing.\n\nmargaret brennan: congressman, this week, not only a new week in congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- i know, get ready.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: if-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, i know you're sort of, wow.\n\nrepresentative max rose: exhausted.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: it's exhausting, but it's beginning.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: you know, i-- i think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. and there are certainly lessons you can learn, i think, from some of our races. i think there--\n\nmargaret brennan: like what?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: i think-- i think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. i think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. i think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and i think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.\n\nmargaret brennan: do you have anyone in mind from your home state?\n\nrepresentative colin allred: well, i certainly like my former boss, julian castro--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: --who is a friend of mine and a mentor of mine. and-- and we have a lot of political talent in texas, so.\n\nmargaret brennan: what about the rest of you?\n\nrepresentative max rose: i'm supporting mikie.\n\n(laughter)\n\nrepresentative max rose: but if i could just have one important thing. it's obvious that election season's starting again. but what we can't do is campaign in the halls of congress. when it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say oh, i don't want to give this president a win because it might improve his chances in 2020.\n\nmargaret brennan: is that what you think is happening now in the house?\n\nrepresentative max rose: i think that there's the potential that it could happen. we've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. there's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? everybody is running on anti-corruption now. but in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. if all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the american people are going to suffer.\n\nrepresentative mikie sherrill: i think if we're going to win as democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. the way we took back the majority of the house is through districts like mine. the eleventh district of new jersey, where i ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. these are things that the majority of americans agree on and the democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.\n\nmargaret brennan: and all of that requires working with a republican senate--\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: --and a republican president.\n\nrepresentative max rose: yes, sure.\n\nrepresentative colin allred: yeah.\n\nrepresentative jahana hayes: yes.\n\nmargaret brennan: and all of you are willing to do that?\n\nrepresentative max rose: but here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. it's just different political parties run-- won. if you think about what donald trump ran on, okay? if you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, i know. but he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect medicare and social security, draining the swamp. we ran on many of those same things, the american people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. and now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.\n\nmargaret brennan: thank you very much for this conversation. i wish you all luck as lawmakers. welcome to washington.\n\nwe'll be right back with our reporters' panel.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, dan balz is the chief correspondent for the washington post, ed o'keefe is the political correspondent right here at cbs news, shannon pettypiece is a white house reporter for bloomberg news and mark landler covers the white house and foreign policy for-- at the new york times. so, ed, i'll start with you. did you hear any points of agreement or were democrats and republicans just talking past each other on the show?\n\ned o'keefe (cbs news political correspondent/@edokeefe): two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and i think elsewhere as well. look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. we can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. maybe that's the delay. but what are we on, day sixteen now? and-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\ned o'keefe: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. we got a ways to go. congress doesn't get back till tuesday night, wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. i am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.\n\nmargaret brennan: you had senator durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. you had senator graham saying no wall, no deal. is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, dan?\n\ndan balz (the washington post/@danbalz): there's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security.\n\nmargaret brennan: whatever that means.\n\ndan balz: and-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. so whatever that means. and i think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. it feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. i win, you lose.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ndan balz: that's never the way these kinds of things end. we'll see whether this is a different situation.\n\nmargaret brennan: well, and the senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. but it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?\n\ndan balz: well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for president trump the wall has been central to his political message. and i know there are democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. and so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. but with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. i mean, this can't go on indefinitely. president talked about this could go on for months or even years. it's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. but the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? and i think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, i don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.\n\nmargaret brennan: shannon, i mean, is that the calculus? we didn't really hear answers from either of the senators about what to do about these hundreds of thousands of american workers--\n\nshannon pettypiece (bloomberg news/@spettypi): yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --who are waiting for paychecks.\n\nshannon pettypiece: right. at this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. no one is facing any real political pressure. and part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. but for the white house, they see this (indistinct) politically. democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. so that changes at the end of this coming week when friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. there are services. people will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. so then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. but because the sides are so far apart, i don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. so it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.\n\nmargaret brennan: mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the national security advisor in israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the syria policy. the president said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of u.s. troops in syria. what are people of the pentagon actually being told to do?\n\nmark landler (the new york times/@marklandler): well, it's-- it is interesting. it's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on december 19th when president trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. i think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the pentagon and i think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in syria. there's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the white house and the pentagon all along. the question i have now is, how in sync is the national security advisor--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\nmark landler: --with his own president. president trump just a few minutes ago on his way to camp david repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of syria soon. that's a very different message than what john bolton had in israel a few hours earlier. some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the turks would go after our kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, i think a lot of people in the pentagon are skeptical the turks can ever be relied on not to go after the kurds. so i think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. but i have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from president trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. he will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nmark landler: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. his words meet reality on the ground and i think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah. it's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.\n\nmark landler: indeed.\n\nmargaret brennan: and we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either.\n\nmark landler: and that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against president trump's troop pullout. lindsey graham being an obvious example. tom cotton expressed reservations about it as well. so some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. there are some other names that are being bandied about, but i am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and mick mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. i wouldn't be surprised if pat shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.\n\nmargaret brennan: and that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the american people. more to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.\n\nwe'll be right back in a moment.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: we're back now with more from our reporters' panel. we saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. dan. and elizabeth warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. how do you see democrats defining themselves?\n\ndan balz: that-- that is such an interesting question because i think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on president trump in 2020, and i think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. we saw in iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for elizabeth warren. i think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. i think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like elizabeth warren or vice president biden, bernie sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. but there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. and my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.\n\nmargaret brennan: so lots of exploring without declaring, ed?\n\ned o'keefe: yeah. i mean, senator warren was the first-- second to do it actually, julian castro, the former hud secretary, was the first before christmas, and will make it official next weekend. but where is everybody else? you might ask. and-- and they are still mulling it. i think we have at least seven democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, governor inslee of washington state said this week he's still thinking about it. so you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, i'm still thinking about it. unless you think it's just empty talk, i-- i heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.\n\nmargaret brennan: this is biden.\n\ned o'keefe: this is biden. and biden said in response to her, what's her name? give me her number. he had an aide get her phone number. the next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think i should run? yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do i will volunteer for you. and he asked her all these reasons why. that happens. and they're all doing this. it's got to be tremendous for their ego. but whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can i stand up against somebody like elizabeth warren--\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ned o'keefe: --who has a name id in the network. can i somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, i have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time i have to find a way to play in california, in georgia and all these other places because of early voting. it's going to be a tremendous competition and one that i think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but i think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them.\n\nmargaret brennan: it-- it sounds there-- shannon, like, you're going to see some campaigning in the halls of congress--\n\ned o'keefe: oh, yeah.\n\nmargaret brennan: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates.\n\nshannon pettypiece: well, yeah. well, i mean, and-- we can talk about this. meanwhile, at the white house, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. i mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the white house is transitioning into 2020 mode. and while you have these democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to iowa, now you have a president trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. it's not the trump tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. they have raised millions and millions of dollars. they have a big data operation. they are out of the gate and running and the democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. so, i mean, that's what they're going to be up against. and they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the president might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. you might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. he was not one of those politicians who came to washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.\n\nmargaret brennan: mm-hm.\n\nshannon pettypiece: he-- he did what he said. and they feel like that's a strong hand to run on.\n\ned o'keefe: you know, to your point about campaigning in congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor republican candidates. to-- to watch those kinds of democrats now in congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, medicare for all, agreeing with the president maybe we should withdraw all our forces from syria.\n\nmargaret brennan: right.\n\ned o'keefe: it's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for president and their party. and it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.\n\nmargaret brennan: mark, i mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the president prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. you can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. afghanistan, when the president had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, wall street journal came down pretty hard on him.\n\nmark landler: yeah. no, the president said in essence that the soviet union has been right to invade afghanistan. he offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. he said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. and-- and he also attributed the collapse of the soviet union to their misadventures in afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of soviet union. but to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, i think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing american troops from foreign conflicts. i think it's--\n\nmargaret brennan: so did obama.\n\nmark landler: so did obama. and so do-- as you say many democrats. what i don't think has been tested maybe at least i'd love to see it--\n\nmargaret brennan: hm-mm.\n\nmark landler: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for president trump's base. we know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard.\n\nmargaret brennan: yeah.\n\nmark landler: and i think that also explains this decision before christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. i just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out.\n\nmargaret brennan: good question. we'll be right back.\n\n(announcements)\n\nmargaret brennan: that's it for us today. thank you all for watching. until next week for face the nation, i'm margaret brennan.
climate change's impact on iowa voters cbs news' natalie brand traveled around iowa speaking to farmers, environmental activists, business owners and the state's secretary of agriculture about extreme weather conditions and how those situations and climate change are impacting voters.
amid a parabolic push by big tech stocks this week -- briefly lifting the nasdaq above 6,100 on monday for the first time -- wall street is bracing for the start of another two-day federal reserve policy meeting on tuesday.\n\nwhile no rate hike is expected as policymakers gauge the effect of their quarter-point rate hike in march, the third increase of this tightening cycle that started in december 2015, all eyes will be on how officials interpret recent unevenness in the economic data.\n\nconsider that first-quarter gdp growth slowed to just 0.7 percent amid the worst consumer spending performance since 2009 during a time of ebullient post-election confidence (as measured by a multitude of surveys) and record stock prices. consumers, investors and businesses say they're geared up and ready to spend, invest and hire.\n\nbut the on-the-ground reality says something different. and that presents a policy conundrum for the fed.\n\nat its last policy meeting in march, the fed updated its economic projections (forecasting 2 to 2.2 percent gdp growth for 2017) and dramatically quickened the pace of policy tightening: from just two quarter-point hikes in two years, it unleashed its next increase after just three months in response to the post-election surge of confidence and resulting financial market gains.\n\nmoreover, in recent months fed officials have increasingly discussed the need to reduce the size of the central bank's asset holdings after multiple iterations of bond-buying stimulus since the financial crisis. from around $800 billion before the crisis, the fed's balance sheet now totals more than $4 trillion.\n\nin retrospect, this may have been too much too fast. key leading indicators like loan growth have rolled over dramatically -- with the decline in commercial and industrial lending happening at a pace associated with the last three recessions. corelogic recently noted that loan performance -- a key indicator of typical economic expansions and recessions -- is beginning to deteriorate.\n\nconfirming all of this were first-quarter earnings reports out of the financial sector over the past month. quarter-over-quarter lending at the largest u.s. regional banks declined in the period for the first time since 2013's first quarter. commercial loan balances didn't change at jpmorgan (jpm) and wells fargo (wfc) compared to the fourth quarter of 2016, with wells fargo getting dinged for lower mortgage activity as well.\n\nand early reads on the second quarter don't look much better: a weaker-than-expected ism manufacturing index for april suggests the weakness may be continuing. the reading for new orders fell to 57.5 from 64.5, while employment dropped to 52 from 58.9. while any measure over 50 indicates month-to-month growth, this is a rather dramatic slowdown suggesting the post-election confidence boost is fading.\n\nconsumers continue to hunker down as well: the savings rate increased to the highest level since last august in april.\n\nno wonder then that according to the cme's fedwatch tool, which measures rate hike expectations based on futures trading, the market sees only a 4.8 percent chance of a rate hike this week.\n\nbut the current economic unevenness is expected to fade: for the fed's june meeting, the market assigns 70 percent odds of at least a quarter-point hike. by the end of the year, short-term interest rates are forecast to be somewhere around 1.5 percent, up from 0.9 percent now. hope springs eternal, it seems.\n\nwhile the fed's policy statement will likely be light on detail when it's released wednesday afternoon, watch for additional insight from fed officials, including vice-chair stanley fischer and chicago fed president charles evans. both will speak at an event on friday at stanford university. chair janet yellen is scheduled to speak at a conference on friday as well, but according to keefe, bruyette & woods analysts, she isn't expected to comment on policy.
the naacp legal defense and educational fund launched a $40 million scholarship program on monday to support a new generation of civil rights lawyers, dedicated to pursuing racial justice across the south. with that whopping gift from a single anonymous donor, the fund plans to put 50 students through law schools around the country.\n\nin return, they must commit to eight years of racial justice work in the south, starting with a two-year post-graduate fellowship in a civil rights organization.\n\nthe donor came to us, said sherrilyn ifill, president of the legal defense and educational fund. the donor very much wanted to support the development of civil rights lawyers in the south. and we have a little bit of experience with that.\n\ntoday's the day! the launch of @naacp_ldf 's #marshallmotley scholars program. building & supporting a new generation of civil rights lawyers in the south. because now more than ever, the work must continue. #mlkday2021 https://t.co/1p7m20qhn1 — sherrilyn ifill (@sifill_ldf) january 18, 2021\n\nindeed, the ldf has been backing civil rights lawyers ever since its founding by thurgood marshall in 1940, during an era when black people rarely had effective legal representation and black students were turned away from southern universities. it funded the creation of black and interracial law firms in several southern states in the 1960s and 1970s, and has built a network of lawyers since then.\n\nwhile without question we are in a perilous moment in this country, we are also in a moment of tremendous possibility, particularly in the south, ifill said. the elements for change are very much present in the south, and what needs to be strengthened is the capacity of lawyering.\n\nthe naacp chose martin luther king day to announce the marshall-motley scholars program, named for the supreme court justice and for constance baker motley, who was an ldf attorney just a few years out of columbia university law school when she wrote the initial complaint that led to the court's brown v. board of education ruling outlawing racial segregation in public schools. she later became the first black woman federal judge.\n\nthis combo of file photos from washington show supreme court associate justice thurgood marshall on october 24, 1967; and constance baker motley, nominated to be judge of the southern district of new york, at her confirmation hearing, on april 4, 1966. charles tasnadi, left, and henry griffin / ap\n\nour country continues to be plagued with racial injustice, and we need nonviolent warriors who are prepared and equipped on all fronts to deal with it - especially on the legal front, the rev. bernice king said in a statement supporting the program. it will allow the ldf to make greater strides on behalf of the black community for generations to come in the area of racial justice, just as they did during the movement led by my parents.\n\nthe new york-based ldf, which has offices in washington, also announced monday that it will open a regional office in atlanta as part of a renewed effort to fulfill the promise of that 1954 ruling. we still have the largest desegregation docket outside the justice department, more than 100 cases stemming from brown v. board of education that still haven't been closed, ldf associate director janai nelson said.\n\neducational inequity, impediments to voting, racial and economic injustice, the policing crisis and confronting the resurgence of overt white supremacy are just some of the challenges these lawyers will face, said nelson, adding: we feel this program is a timely antidote to this particularly violent history that has resurfaced.\n\nthe naacp shared a statement from cissy marshall, the justice's 92-year-old widow, who said the fund is especially meaningful to her because of thurgood's powerful partnership with lawyers across the south who served with him as co-counsel on so many consequential civil rights cases.\n\nand joel motley, the late judge's son, said he's delighted that his mother's legacy will live on through well-trained and committed litigators who will defend the rights of black people across the south, dismantling the structures of white supremacy.
the novel coronavirus has brought life to a standstill around the world and left millions of people wondering when things will return to some semblance of normal. one hope is that the virus could perhaps behave somewhat like the seasonal flu — taking a break during the warmer summer months, lessening the threat and giving society time to mount a systemic response. but there are many unanswered questions.\n\nto find out more about how the change of seasons might affect the spread of the virus, cbs news spoke with dr. jeffrey shaman, an expert on infectious disease transmission and director of the climate and health program at columbia university. the following is an abbreviated version of the conversation.\n\ncbs news: is coronavirus less likely to spread at warmer temperatures, and will spring or summer slow the spread of the disease?\n\ndr. shaman: that is one of the critical questions we would like to answer and i would love to see some virus survival experiments that elucidate and show evidence one way or another.\n\nthere are four endemic coronaviruses [a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses] that circulate within humans. studies and data i have seen show three or even all four of them circulating seasonally, peaking during the wintertime and pretty much disappearing during the summer months. and it's an even more marked seasonality than we see for flu, which also in temperate regions is like that.\n\nnow, there's reasonable evidence with the flu that it's not actually linked to temperature, but rather linked to humidity levels and that these viruses thrive in conditions that are very dry, which is what we get in the wintertime. why that is for flu, we don't know, and if that is the mechanism that extends to coronavirus, we don't know either. either way it leads to the enticing possibility that maybe this novel coronavirus will also be affected by ambient conditions which lead to it dissipating during summertime.\n\nnow, i have to caution that although seasonal flu peaks during the winter and it peters out in spring, when we have a pandemic influenza outbreak such as what happened in 2009, it can penetrate farther into the summer. the reason for this is there is heightened susceptibility in the human population that allows for transmission even as humidity conditions rise. the pandemic flu doesn't disappear until june, and then resurges again in late august and september as humidity starts to drop. so, if this novel emergent coronavirus were to follow this pattern, then it would probably continue circulating until may or june, then we'd get a break, and then we might get a second wave of it in september. if it doesn't have this characteristic then none of this will happen. also, this novel coronavirus appears to be more transmissible than influenza, which might preclude any disappearance during summer.\n\nwhile there's been some limited study of the survival of this virus, both aerosolized in the air or on a surface — which has shown the virus remains viable for hours and that airborne transmission is certainly possible — its survival has not been tested under diverse climate conditions. consequently, its sensitivity to temperature and humidity conditions aren't known. it would be great to see these experiments repeated under different temperature and humidity conditions.\n\ncbs news: the largest concentration of cases appears to be in the colder mid-latitude areas of china and europe — and in the united states, [like] seattle and new york city — but not as large a number in the south. is it possible that the virus is following colder and not warmer climates?\n\ndr. shaman: there's something to that that might be intriguing. if you look at southeast asia, the countries that have cases of covid-19 but have not gone out of control are singapore, vietnam, thailand and taiwan; they have kept the growth of the virus linear. korea and china, on the other hand, are further north and more temperate and have had bigger outbreaks to deal with. this could be a manifestation of differing climates, but it's pure speculation. this may much more reflect that they [singapore, vietnam, thailand, taiwan] have engaged in much more proactive control of the virus and are successful at it. the japanese have also kept the growth of cases linear even though they have had a substantial number of cases. they have managed to control it, even though they are a temperate [colder and less humid] country. so, although there is this tantalizing possibility that the virus spreads less in warmer or more humid climates, it could also be linked to a country's response to the outbreak.\n\nif you look at it right now, you are seeing outbreaks in the northern hemisphere countries, which is not unexpected. you are seeing it in europe and iran, which are colder, but you are not yet seeing large numbers in australia, which is in summer right now, and you are not seeing it in the deep tropics where it's warm all year round. this suggests that maybe this coronavirus has some temperature or humidity sensitivity that limits its circulation when conditions are warmer or more humid.\n\nhowever, there may be considerable reporting discrepancies among countries. many countries in the deep tropics have less developed medical and public health infrastructure and may be less able to test and report infections. in some of these countries many infections may go undocumented.\n\ncbs news: is it possible that people being in more confined spaces and packed closer together in winter is more of a factor in the spread of the virus than the actual effect of climate?\n\ndr. shaman: without a doubt. you see evidence of this when you put people in isolation or quarantine you can slow the spread of virus because the virus thrives on contact. and if people are running into each other because they are on subways, buses, in stores and banks — in the urban environment you have hundreds of contacts per day — then the virus will spread faster. in the winter people tend to be in closer quarters.\n\nnow in the 2009 [flu] pandemic the only occasions we documented outbreaks in the summertime were in places where there was close contact, such as military ships and dorms. so contact is obviously a very important issue, but there may be this overlying effect of the environment, like the climate of a place, that acts as an upper boundary as to how much virus activity there can be.\n\ncbs news: do you know of any ongoing or proposed research on this that would be helpful in determining the impact of climate on the coronavirus?\n\ndr. shaman: like i said, i'd really like to see laboratory experiments on coronavirus survival repeated but this time with different temperature and humidity conditions. that would be much more compelling to me than any other studies done so far which try to tease apart various effects from population-scale data. there are a number of studies posted on medrxiv related to this which can provide some perspective.
vatican city -- the vatican says pope francis was shocked and profoundly saddened by a murderous attack at a home for the elderly in southern yemen that killed 16 people, including four nuns.\n\nthe vatican secretary of state said in a condolence message on saturday that the pontiff prays that this pointless slaughter will awaken consciences, lead to a change of heart, and inspire all parties to lay down their arms.\n\nofficials and witnesses in yemen said gunmen on friday stormed a retirement home run by a charity established by mother teresa, moving room to room handcuffing the victims before shooting them in the head.\n\nthe pope sent prayers for the dead and expressed his spiritual closeness to those affected by this act of senseless and diabolical violence.\n\nthe killing spree began with two gunmen who first surrounded the home for the elderly in aden. meanwhile, four others entered the building on the pretext they wanted to visit their mothers at the facility, according to the charity, yemeni security officials and witnesses. the officials spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.\n\nthe gunmen then moved from room to room. a nun who survived and was rescued by locals said that she hid inside a fridge in a storeroom after hearing a yemeni guard shouting, run, run.\n\nkhaled haidar told the associated press that he counted 16 bodies, including that of his brother, radwan. all had been shot in the head and were handcuffed. he said that in addition to the four nuns, one yemeni cook, and yemeni guards were among those killed.\n\nhe said that his family was the first to arrive at the house and that he spoke to the surviving nun, who was crying and shaking. haidar said that his family later handed her over to a group of southern fighters in charge of security in the local aden district of sheikh osman.\n\nsunita kumar, a spokeswoman for the missionaries of charity in the indian city of kolkata, said the members of the charity were absolutely stunned at the killing.\n\nthe sisters were to come back but they opted to stay on to serve people in yemen, she added.\n\nshe also said that two of the killed nuns were from rwanda and the other two were from india and kenya.\n\nearlier, yemeni and indian officials reported that all four killed nuns were indian but such conflicting information on casualties is not unusual in the chaos of yemen's civil war. india's foreign ministry had initially cited information it got from its embassy in yemen.\n\nvikas swarup, the spokesman of india's external affairs ministry, said the attackers had asked the guard to open the gate on the pretext of visiting their mothers at the retirement home.\n\non entering inside, (they) immediately shot dead the gatekeeper and started shooting randomly, he said, adding that the assailants escaped soon after the attack.\n\nthe bodies were transferred to a police station and then a hospital run by the aid organization known as doctors without borders or msf. an official with msf confirmed that 15 bodies had arrived at the hospital. haider said his family took his brother's body for burial.\n\nthere were around 80 residents living at the home, which is run by missionaries of charity, an organization established by mother teresa. missionaries of charity nuns also came under attack in yemen in 1998, when gunmen killed three nuns in the red sea port city of hodeida.\n\naden descended into lawlessness after a saudi-led coalition recaptured the city from shiite houthi rebels last summer.\n\nyemen's civil war has split the country in two. the northern region, where shiite rebels are in control, has been struck by an extensive air campaign by a saudi-led coalition. the southern region, which is controlled by the internationally-recognized government backed by saudi arabia, is suffering from a power and security vacuum.\n\nthe islamic state of iraq and syria, or isis, and yemen's al qaeda affiliate have exploited the lawlessness and created safe havens in the south. al qaeda controls several southern cities while isis has claimed responsibility for a wave of deadly attacks in aden, including a suicide bombing that killed the city's governor and several assassination attempts on top officials.\n\naden's churches have also come under attack. last summer, a catholic church in the district of crater was torched and sabotaged by islamic extremists.\n\nyemen's war has killed at least 6,200 civilians and injured tens of thousands of yemenis, and 2.4 million people have been displaced, according to u.n. figures.\n\nsaudi arabia's u.n. ambassador abdallah al-mouallimi said friday that while he is concerned about the worsening humanitarian situation, he doesn't see the need for a security council resolution addressing it.\n\nthere are reports here and there about what the security council is up to, he said. we continue to believe that a political solution is the only way to resolve the yemeni crisis.
a member of the republican national committee, fearing primary challengers to president trump in the wake of incoming gop sen. mitt romney's scathing op-ed, is urging fellow committee members to change the rules to thwart intra-party threats to mr. trump in 2020.\n\nin an email obtained by cbs news, jevon o.a. williams, the national committeeman for the virgin islands, urged fellow elected rnc members tuesday night to push for an unprecedented rule change in the wake of the romney op-ed's calculated political treachery. williams wants to close loopholes in the nomination in a way that would make it tougher for even token challengers to mr. trump to enter the fray. the washington examiner first reported the letter.\n\nspecifically, williams urged fellow rnc members to change rule 40, which requires a candidate for the nomination to garner support from a majority of delegates in at least five states or territories in order to be placed on the nominating ballot at the republican national committee convention. williams also called for a resolution to declare mr. trump the presumptive nominee in 2020, calling for both of those moves to take place at an rnc winter meeting later this month.\n\nwhile president trump would win re-nomination it wouldn't come quick and it wouldn't be inexpensive. any contested re-nomination campaign—even a forlorn hope—would only help democrats, williams wrote. accordingly, i am asking for your support to take the unprecedented step of amending the rules to close loopholes in the re-nomination campaign, including rule 40.\n\nthe email was sent to rnc members two hours after romney, who has yet to be sworn into office, published an arresting op-ed in the washington post titled, the president shapes the public character of the nation. trump's character falls short. romney argued that mr. trump has failed to live up to the mantle of his office in the last two years, and america's standing on the international stage is worse off because of it. the op-ed offered a glimpse of how romney, who has criticized mr. trump in the past, might maneuver being a republican senator under a polarizing president.\n\nthe op-ed prompted visceral responses from mr. trump's staunchest defenders — including ronna mcdaniel, the chairwoman of the rnc who is romney's niece and dropped her maiden name -- romney -- reportedly to appease mr. trump. mcdaniel, without naming her uncle, blasted the incoming republican freshman senator for his criticism of the president.\n\npotus is attacked and obstructed by the msm media and democrats 24/7. for an incoming republican freshman senator to attack @realdonaldtrump as their first act feeds into what the democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive. https://t.co/arhi7bi7bo — ronna mcdaniel (@gopchairwoman) january 2, 2019\n\nwilliams' proposal to thwart challenges to the incumbent president comes as some states also look to fend off challenges to him. cbs news' caitlin huey burns has reported some of mr. trump's supporters in early states, including south carolina and new hampshire, are looking into allowing the republican party to simply endorse him without holding primary contests.\n\nthe iowa caucuses are scheduled to take place in early february 2020.\n\nhere is the full text of the email sent to rnc members, as obtained by cbs news. williams did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
democrats on the house intelligence committee have wasted no time in beefing up the investigative staff dedicated to continuing the committee's work on its semi-dormant russia probe, even as the committee's new membership is still taking shape.\n\nthe new majority has made offers to half a dozen new staffers, cbs news has learned, and is still searching for six more. among the latest hires are an expert in corruption and illicit finance and a former prosecutor.\n\nthe committee typically does not reveal much publicly about its staff; it is withholding names and most details about potential new hires as some of them progress through a lengthy security clearance process.\n\nthere's a lot of work yet to be done on russia, a senior committee official told cbs news. what we're doing is we are creating a purpose-built team that will take the point on that.\n\nas they assume the majority, democrats under newly appointed chairman adam schiff, d-calif., will add four members to the committee and more than double its staff, from 11 to roughly 24; republicans will cut their staff count and, with some members having retired from congress last year, likely keep their membership even at nine.\n\nabout seven of the democrats' new staffers will be dedicated full-time to the committee's residual work investigating alleged connections between president trump, his campaign associates, and russian officials – while a handful of other staffers will be available to assist in that investigation on a surge basis, committee officials say.\n\nthough republicans on the committee declared an end to the russia probe last spring and issued a final report finding no collusion on the part of the president's campaign, democrats have long decried the findings as fundamentally unserious, and vowed to keep parts of the inquiry open.\n\nschiff said in an interview last month that the committee had been deluged with résumés from candidates hoping to join its staff.\n\nthe new staff additions are intended to enhance the committee's ability to make inroads on unanswered questions in the russia investigation without requiring it to pivot away from the day job of overseeing the intelligence community's 17 organizations, according to committee officials. but the final team will likely bring with it the investigative and prosecutorial specialties schiff has long sought.\n\nas ranking member, the california democrat consistently lamented being hamstrung by a republican majority which, under then-chairman devin nunes, d-calif., seemed at best incurious about certain aspects of the trump-russia nexus. schiff has also been publicly wistful about the special counsel's investigative horsepower, telling an audience at the council of foreign relations last february that he was deeply jealous of the team mueller had assembled.\n\ni have a phenomenal staff, he said at the time, they're bright and they work 24/7, seven days a week and they do it with no windows.\n\n[b]ut they're largely analysts, schiff continued, they're not trained to be investigators.\n\nthe team now tasked with resuscitating the russia investigation is not expected to start from scratch, but instead to zero in on some complex financial and legal questions whose answers have largely eluded house investigators.\n\nunlike in the last congress, when the investigation was undertaken by existing oversight staff, chairman schiff will now have a team better able to answer the key questions about trump's relationship with [russian president vladimir] putin and his cronies, the senior committee official said.\n\nschiff and some of his fellow committee democrats have been transparent about what some of their immediate priorities will be. they include the release to the special counsel -- and subsequently to the public -- of all of the committee's russia investigation interview transcripts; subpoenaing relevant banking and telecommunications records that democrats have said contain information that implicates the president; and hearing – in some cases a second time – from key witnesses.\n\namong the witnesses in which the democrats have expressed an interest are the president's personal lawyer, michael cohen, family members like donald trump jr. and jared kushner, and other former trump campaign officials, like george papadopoulos and michael flynn, who have cooperated with the special counsel.\n\ndemocrats have also telegraphed a voracious appetite for new avenues of inquiry, including the trump organization's reported offer of a $50 million condo in trump tower moscow to putin and the notes taken by the interpreter present at the two leaders' one-on-one meeting last july.\n\nwhile schiff has also previously mentioned the potential for coordination between his committee and that of the senate intelligence committee, whose own investigation will enter its second year later this month, aides from both indicated the change in leadership would not necessarily pave the way for collaboration, and that the two investigations will remain separate.\n\nas these new priorities come to the fore, schiff has also vowed restore both comity and sobriety to the committee – though there are no indications that he and nunes, who will now serve as ranking member, have reestablished lines of communication, let alone decided on an amicable path forward.\n\nin fact, republicans on the committee are generally skeptical that the majority, under schiff, will make a concerted effort to resume normal oversight work as long as the russia investigation remains a chief focus.\n\na republican committee official said democrats were adopting a posture of show me the man and i'll show you the crime vis-a-vis president trump – an apparent reference to the ruthless and manipulative tactics of the former head of the soviet secret police under joseph stalin.\n\nin a statement, the spokesman for the committee's republican minority, jack langer, said, for months, the committee's democrats have shown that their principal priority is to launch a sprawling investigation of trump and to try to manufacture a basis for impeachment.\n\nso republicans will focus on doing the oversight of the intelligence community that this committee was created to do, and will be pointing out the absurdity of the democrats' myriad conspiracy theories, langer said.\n\nrestructuring\n\nthe day-to-day work of oversight is also evolving with the democrats taking the reins.\n\nwhile parts of the committee's operations and structure are virtually always tweaked by the incoming majority – nunes, as chairman, put in place a mostly agency-specific subcommittee structure, with groups dedicated to the cia, nsa and defense intelligence in particular – under schiff, the four existing subcommittees will also be reorganized.\n\nrather than keeping the subcommittees focused on specific agencies, they will be restructured around thematic challenges – or core missions – across the intelligence community, according to officials familiar with the committee's plans.\n\none subcommittee will focus on crucial and increasingly competitive technologies at the heart of the intelligence enterprise, including satellites and other space-based assets, advanced and quantum computing, and challenges like artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\na second will oversee the intelligence community's counterterrorism and counterproliferation efforts – including those in hotspots like north korea and iran – as well as counterintelligence. the third will look at the overall management of the intelligence community, with an emphasis on human capital management, information technology, and security clearance reform. the last will focus on intelligence community's support to the american military and the pentagon.\n\n[t]hese subcommittees will be empowered to devise and execute their own oversight plans through hearings, deep dives, and travel to [intelligence community] elements at home and abroad, schiff said in a statement provided to cbs news.\n\nit sounds to me like a sensible division of labor over four subcommittees and i don't think the agencies will feel like they're overlooked, said michael allen, a former majority staff director under republican chairman mike rogers, r-mich.\n\nthe technologies subcommittee in particular makes a lot of sense, said allen, who also served on former president george w. bush's national security council. that topic – especially as china continues stealing critical technology – remains a major concern in the national security community.\n\nmark lowenthal, who also served as staff director to former republican chairman larry combest, agreed. this array is more likely to lead to effective oversight, he said. while there are agency-specific problems, a lot of issues that you worry about – whether you are managing or overseeing – transcend the intelligence agencies, across the board.\n\nlowenthal, who also served in policy and management roles in the executive branch as vice chairman of the national intelligence council and as an assistant director of central intelligence, said the new structure will likely provide the committee with more visibility into the intelligence community's most urgent challenges.\n\none of the things people always complain about in the intelligence community is 'stovepipes,' he said. well, if you set up committees on an agency basis you replicate those stovepipes.\n\nthis seems a much better way to get a sense of what's going on and where congress can help figure out what needs doing, lowenthal said.\n\nthe committee, once it is fully constituted, will still need to vote in order to finalize the new structure and assign new subcommittee chairs.\n\nfrom there, other business items, both regular and extraordinary, and ranging from the release of dozens of witness transcripts, to the issuance of subpoenas, to standard open hearings, are expected to be put in motion later this month or in early february.\n\nit is unclear if nunes, who for a time stepped away from the committee's

president trump's announcement of a 30-day travel ban from europe wednesday night included several provisions he and the white house clarified in the hours after his brief oval office address. for instance, the president indicated during his remarks that trade would also be subject to the suspension. these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval, he said. but he appears to have misspoken.\n\nafter his speech, he clarified by tweet that it's very important for all countries & businesses to know that trade will in no way be affected by the 30-day restriction on travel from europe. the restriction stops people not goods.\n\nmr. trump's timing also required a correction. he said that the new rules will go into effect friday at midnight. later, the white house explained that mr. trump actually meant the rules would be implemented a day later, at midnight saturday.\n\nas for those the ban applies to, the president told americans, we will be suspending all travel from europe to the united states for the next 30 days. the white house later tweeted that the travel restriction applies only to most foreign nationals who've been in the 26-nation schengen area of europe in the two weeks before their scheduled arrival in the united states. u.s. citizens traveling in europe will be exempt, but american travelers will have to undergo screenings before they come back to the u.s.\n\namerican citizens traveling in the affected parts of europe will be funneled to the 11 airports that offer health screenings and that are able to check for signs of a fever. however, there's some research showing those checks can miss about two-thirds of people with coronavirus.\n\nthe suspension applies to foreign nationals who have been in 26 european countries with open borders agreements, in the last 14 days, the white house tweeted. those exempt from these restrictions, such as u.s. citizens, will be directed to limited airports where screening can take place.\n\nmajor airlines, which weren't notified in advance of the president's announcement, have started reacting to it. delta has waived change fees for customers traveling to, from or through europe and the united kingdom through may 31. this waiver applies to all tickets issued on or before march 11.\n\namerican airlines said in a statement, we are in contact with the federal government to understand and comply with this directive. the health and safety of our customers and team members remains our highest priority.\n\nkris van kleave, steven portnoy, fin gomez and gaby ake contributed to this story
self-driving delivery machines are now traveling around the united kingdom.\n\nthe robots are created by starship technologies, a company launched by the co-founders of skype. they could be tested in the united states next month.\n\nfirst on cbs this morning, cbs news correspondent charlie d'agata got a preview of the new technology, and watched as the ground drones went for a spin in london.\n\nthe new delivery guy looks more like a cooler on wheels than a high tech robot, but this little baby is about to revolutionize the industry, boasts its creator and skype founder ahti heinla.\n\nbecause, easily, billions of people today are customers of delivery companies, heinla said.\n\nthe battery-powered robot is designed to deliver on demand in less than 30 minutes from a neighborhood store or depot to the doorstep. it scoots along at four miles per hour and it is big enough to carry most home deliveries.\n\nand while aerial drones have been getting all the attention, heinla said that idea just isn't ready to get off the ground.\n\nit's a lot safer. it's a lot friendlier to people, heinla said. people don't like aerial drones. they don't like drones flying over their backyards with other people's groceries dangling there.\n\nis this a fantastic idea? is it absurd? it's hard to judge right off the bat, said scott stein, senior editor at cnet. although, stay tuned -- robots and automated services for delivery are going to come.\n\nbut heinla doesn't even like the term ground drone; making them likeable was a big part of the design.\n\nwe knew it has to be cute, or it has to be a good looking robot, heinla said. most of the people that this robot is going to encounter on the sidewalks, they're not technologists, they're not industrialists. they're regular people and for them, it wouldn't be ideal if the robot looks like a robot.\n\nbut it is a robot.\n\nnine onboard cameras and sensors detect pedestrians and tell it to slow down, stop and change direction. it uses gps and on-board maps to reach its destination.\n\nalthough it is monitored by humans, the robot itself does 99 percent of the work. it not only knows where people are, it also recognizes them. using a special app, only the recipient will be able to unlock the lid and get at the goods.\n\nthe creators are aiming specifically at suburbs -- places with open sidewalks. big cities are simply too crowded already.\n\nand of course, there are other vulnerabilities to consider.\n\nisn't there a concern about teenagers taking a bat to it for fun? d'agata asked.\n\nof course, of course i'm sure somebody will do that at some point, but there's also danger of the same people taking a bat to a parked car for instance, heinla said.\n\na human operator can also use a speaker to warn the culprits that they're being filmed, and that authorities are on the way.\n\nthere's only one problem -- it doesn't have a name yet.\n\ni think this thing deserves a brilliant name, and we are searching for it, heinla said.
washington — house speaker nancy pelosi regained the gavel on thursday, announcing a dramatically new direction for the house after eight years of republican control. she promised to end discrimination against lgbtq americans, address gun violence and climate change.\n\npelosi also administered the oath of office to members of the most diverse new congress ever. more than 100 female house members were sworn in, including the first two native american women and the first two muslim women.\n\ncongress overturned a two century-long ban on hats so that minnesota's ilhan omar could wear her hijab on the house floor. twenty-five new members are under the age of 40, their youth reflected by the swarm of congressional offspring who filled the chamber.\n\nnancy pelosi of california, surrounded by her grandchildren and other children raises her right hand as rep. don young, r-alaska, the longest-serving member of the house, administers the oath to pelosi to become the speaker of the house at the capitol in washington, thursday, jan. 3, 2019. carolyn kaster / ap\n\nat 78, pelosi is the first person to reclaim to the speakership in more than 60 years, winning support from all but a dozen democrats after two months of horse trading and policy promises.\n\non thursday democratic committee chairs — newly vested with subpoena power — began to lay out their plans to investigate president trump and his administration. they filed legislation to go after the president's tax returns and vowed to reopen a russia probe house republicans closed last year. as special counsel robert mueller continues his investigation, pelosi disputed the justice department's claim that a sitting u.s. president cannot be indicted.\n\nhouse democrats are also planning to vote to fund the parts of the government that have been shut down for two weeks. but the democratic bill doesn't contain the border wall money the president is looking for, so the president said it's a non-starter. he's invited house and senate leaders to the white house on friday to continue negotiations.
miami -- the last orca to be born in captivity at a seaworld park was born in san antonio just over a year after the theme park company decided to stop breeding orcas following animal rights protests and declining ticket sales.\n\nthe orlando-based seaworld said the orca - the last in a generation of whales bred in confinement - was born wednesday afternoon. seaworld did not immediately name the calf because the park's veterinarians had not yet determined whether it was male or female.\n\nthe mother, 25-year-old takara, was already pregnant when seaworld announced in march 2016 that it had stopped breeding its orcas. the gestation period for orcas is about 18 months.\n\npreparing late last month for the moment, seaworld's chief zoological officer, chris dold, told the associated press he expected the birth to be bittersweet, because it would be the last such event at any of the parks. but just hours after the calf was born about 3:30 p.m. edt wednesday, dold said, seaworld staff only felt like celebrating. seaworld said mother and calf both appear healthy.\n\nthese are extraordinary moments, he said by phone while traveling to the u.s. from abu dhabi, where seaworld is developing its first new park without orcas. it's a tempered celebration only because we're focused on the health of these guys.\n\nafter 18 months of waiting, we are excited to welcome a new member to our family of #killerwhales! learn more here: https://t.co/r8x28nvsif pic.twitter.com/hqdlvbvmyi — seaworld (@seaworld) april 20, 2017\n\nseaworld decided to stop breeding orcas, and phase out its world-famous killer whale performances by 2019, after public opinion turned against keeping orcas, dolphins and other animals in captivity for entertainment. the backlash intensified after the 2013 release of blackfish, a documentary critical of seaworld's orca care. it focused on the orca tilikum, which killed trainer dawn brancheau in orlando in 2010, dragging her into the pool before shocked visitors after a dine with shamu show.\n\ntilikum, which sired 14 calves over nearly 25 years in orlando, died of bacterial pneumonia in january.\n\nthe newborn calf was sired by kyuquot at the san antonio park by natural means. it brings seaworld's orca population in the u.s. to 23. all the orcas are expected to remain on display and available for researchers for years to come in orlando, san diego and san antonio.\n\nseaworld has said it plans to introduce new natural orca encounters in place of theatrical shows. this summer, the san diego park will unveil a new, educational attraction in a revamped pool, and new orca attractions eventually will follow in san antonio and orlando.\n\nthe calf will be visible to visitors either in the orca stadium pool at the san antonio park or in two adjacent pools. observations about the calf and takara by seaworld trainers will be provided from the moment of birth to researchers trying to fill gaps in their data about wild killer whales.\n\ndold said veterinarians at the san antonio park told him the calf was born normally - tail first - after about an hour and a half of smooth labor. both orcas were swimming calmly, including taking breaths at the water's surface, and trainers would be watching for the calf to begin nursing.\n\nmom generally will rest but she can't rest too much .... mom's not holding onto the calf, but it's riding in her slipstream, and that's how it gets around, dold said. our expectation is that all of this will go smoothly, but we take none of that for granted.\n\nbirth control and social management will prevent future orca pregnancies, said spokeswoman suzanne pelisson beasley. seaworld has not collected a wild orca in nearly 40 years, and most of its orcas were born in captivity.\n\nresearchers have said they worry that seaworld's decision to stop breeding orcas will slowly reduce their ability to study orca health, growth and behavior, limiting them in coming years to collecting data from a small pod of aging whales.\n\nheather hill, a st. mary's university comparative psychologist who plans to monitor the sleeping habits of takara and the calf over the coming year, said it was frustrating to see research opportunities at seaworld undermined by public opinion amid federal cuts to science funding.\n\nthis will be one of the first times we'll be able to see not just a mother with a newborn calf but also a newborn calf with siblings, hill said.\n\nin a statement, people for the ethical treatment of animals executive vice president tracy reiman said the mother and her calf should be retired to a seaside sanctuary.\n\nthroughout her life, takara the orca has been artificially inseminated many times, separated from her mother and two of her children, and shuffled from theme park to theme park at seaworld's whim, peta's statement said.\n\nthis is takara's fifth calf. two of her other offspring remain at the san antonio park, while one lives at seaworld orlando and another has been loaned to a park in tenerife, spain. seaworld has no current plans to separate takara and the newborn in the future, or to move any of its other orcas, dold said.\n\nin march, dold said seaworld remains committed to orca research and conservation, calling the last orca birth in captivity a solemn reminder of how things can change and how things can be lost.
aghan police stand guard at the entrance of the ministry of public works a day after a deadly militant attack in kabul, dec. 25, 2018. an hours-long gun and suicide attack on the compound killed at least 43 people, the health ministry said, making it one of the deadliest assaults on the afghan capital of 2018. getty\n\nkabul, afghanistan -- an afghan official said tuesday that the taliban launched two blistering attacks in northern sar-e-pul province, killing 15 members of the country's security forces. in one attack, on the outskirts of the provincial capital, heavy artillery fire by afghan forces trying to repel the insurgents sent local residents fleeing for safety.\n\nprovincial council chief mohammad noor rahmani said along with 15 policemen killed, 21 were wounded in the two attacks which took place late on monday. he said fierce gun battles raged for several hours in sayyad district and outside sar-e-pul, the provincial capital.\n\ntaliban spokesman qari yousof ahmadi claimed responsibility for both attacks.\n\nthe taliban have carried out near-daily attacks targeting afghan forces, as u.s. policy in afghanistan appears headed for a significant change. while the u.s. pushes for a negotiated truce between the afghan government and the taliban, president trump has indicated he will halve the number of american forces in the country.\n\ncbs news correspondent david martin reported before christmas that the pentagon was ordered to start planning the withdrawal of roughly 7,000 troops from the war-torn country, almost half of which remains under taliban control.\n\nthe former top u.s. commander in afghanistan said sunday that withdrawing so many of the u.s. forces from the country would reduce the incentive for the taliban to negotiate a peace deal after more than 17 years of war. retired gen. stanley mcchrystal said the u.s. had, basically traded away the biggest leverage point we have.\n\nmcchrystal spoke in response to questions about former defense secretary jim mattis, who mentioned mr. trump's withdrawal order in his resignation letter. mattis' last day in the administration was monday -- earlier than he initially announced, after mr. trump moved up his departure date.\n\nthe u.s. and nato formally concluded their combat mission in 2014, but american and allied troops remain, conducting strikes on the islamic state of iraq and syria (isis) affiliate there and the taliban, and working to train and build the afghan military.\n\nif you tell the taliban that we are absolutely leaving on date certain, cutting down, weakening ourselves, their incentives to try to cut a deal drop dramatically, mcchrystal said on abc's this week.\n\nmcchrystal also said he was worried that the afghan people would lose confidence in the u.s. as a reliable ally.\n\ni think we probably rocked them, said mcchrystal, who commanded u.s. and nato forces in afghanistan for about a year.
