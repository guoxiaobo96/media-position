new york -- four men from brighton beach, brooklyn have filed a lawsuit against american airlines, claiming they were racially profiled and kicked off a plane that was supposed to bring them home from canada.
cbs new york reports the longtime friends from brooklyn had boarded the american airlines flight after a weekend in toronto. shan anand and faimul alal said they were doing nothing out of the ordinary, but the gate agent told them they had to go.
they came to us and said, you know, 'take our belongings and exit the aircraft.' at that point, like, everybody just around us was just, like, looking at us, alal said. the way she said it wasn't, like, low either, so it was at least like three rows ahead.
it wasn't the proper way to say it, anand said. they came to us and they told us, you know, 'get your belongings and exit the aircraft.'
they said being escorted off the plane was mortifying.
it was probably the longest walk of my life, alal said.
two of their friends had upgraded to business class. another two were in another row. anand said they were told the flight crew found that suspicious.
inconsistency in the way we travel because some of us upgraded and some of us didn't; that they felt uneasy, anand said.
four of the men were booked on the next flight, they said, with no further explanation. their attorney, tahanie aboushi, said the airline has protocols it could have followed -- but didn't.
seems like it was definitely discrimination, aboushi said.
the young men are born-and-raised new yorkers. alal's family is from india, anand's from bangladesh.
they had heard about racial profiling following the attacks of sept. 11, 2001, but never personally experienced it.
you just hope things change and people are still not, like, this ignorant toward these things, but then when it happens to you, you see it from a different light, anand said.
their lawsuit demands an apology from american airlines and $9 million in total damages. cbs new york reached out to american, which said only that it is reviewing the lawsuit.

markets have rallied on hints of further easing by the ecb and speculation that the boj will follow suit. but there has been no major change in fundamentals to support the rally, and the concern is if and when it fizzles out, markets could even drop below their recent lows, angus nicholson of ig said in a commentary.
on friday european central bank head mario draghi said the bank has a lot of options to boost inflation and is determined and willing to act. on thursday draghi suggested the ecb will consider more stimulus action at its next meeting in march. the signals from europe also spurred expectations that the bank of japan would consider adding to its already lavish stimulus.

sheboygan, wis. -- a wisconsin sheriff has defended his decision to hire a man convicted of killing and dismembering his girlfriend nearly 40 years ago in texas.
rafael george macias has worked as a radio technician for the sheboygan county sheriff's department since 2011 after performing similar duties as a contract employee for 10 years.
macias was a 20-year-old airman at carswell air force base in north texas when he pleaded guilty to killing and dismembering his live-in girlfriend, julia adams, in 1977. macias was sentenced to 40 years in prison, but was released after 13 years.
while at the texas state penitentiary at huntsville, macias earned an associate degree as a radio technician. he eventually moved to wisconsin and ended up working at his cousin's radio shop.
macias told the associated press on thursday that he never lied about his past and was upfront with sheriff todd priebe when he wanted to bring him on as a regular employee. details of the case resurfaced when an anonymous letter was sent recently to media outlets, including the milwaukee journal sentinel, questioning why sheboygan county employees had to work with someone who committed such a horrible crime.
macias said he's not sure what the motivation was in bringing up his crime to the media, but knows he has priebe's support.
you can't change what happened. it happened, macias said. what you can do is change what you do in the future and don't put your life to waste.
priebe said macias has proven himself as a trusted employee and is a rehabilitation success story.
macias said through faith, anger management counseling and maturity he has become a better man.
as far as i'm concerned, that guy is dead, macias said referring to his younger self, adding, it was a fit of rage.
priebe said he will meet with the county board's law committee at its request to discuss the hiring, but the committee does not have the authority to overrule his decision.
rescue teams searching for survivors four days after a landslide carried away homes in a norwegian village found no signs of life saturday amid the ruined buildings and debris. three bodies have been recovered but searchers are still looking for seven more people believed to be missing.
the landslide in the village of ask is the worst in modern norwegian history and has shocked citizens in the nordic nation.
search teams patrolled with dogs as helicopters and drones with heat-detecting cameras flew amid harsh winter conditions over the ravaged hillside in ask, a village of 5,000 people 25 kilometers (16 miles) northeast of oslo.
norwegian police pledged not to scale down the search even though a rescue team from neighboring sweden has already returned home.
local police chief ida melbo oeystese said it may still be possible to find survivors in air pockets inside the destroyed buildings.
medically, you can survive for several days if you have air, she told reporters at a news conference.
flattened homes lie covered in snow as rescue crews work with a dog in the landslide area at ask, gjerdrum, norway january 2, 2021. ntb/erik schroeder via reuters
by late saturday, a second and third body had been found after a first one was discovered on friday. only a dalmatian dog has been rescued alive from the ruins so far.
king harald v, queen sonja and crown prince haakon plan to visit the disaster area on sunday to pay their respects to the victims and to meet with residents and rescue workers. the 83-year-old monarch said in his new year's speech that the royal family had been deeply moved by the tragedy.
norwegian police have published the names and birth years of the 10 people initially reported missing, including a 2-year-old child. officials haven't yet identified the three recovered bodies.
the landslide early wednesday cut across a road through ask, leaving a deep, crater-like ravine. photos and videos showed buildings hanging on the edge of the ravine, which grew to be 700 meters (2,300 feet) long and 300 meters (1,000 feet) wide. at least nine buildings with over 30 apartments were destroyed.
the rescue operation is being hampered by the limited number of daylight hours in norway at this time of year and fears of further erosion. the ground is fragile at the site and unable to hold the weight of rescue equipment, including a heavy vehicle from the norwegian military.
over 1,000 people have been evacuated, and officials said up to 1,500 people may be moved from the area amid fears of further landslides.
the exact cause of the accident is not yet known but the gjerdrum municipality, where ask is located, is known for having a lot of quick clay, a material that can change from solid to liquid form. experts said the substance of the clay combined with excessive precipitation and the damp weather typical for norway at this time of year may have contributed to the landslide.
norwegian authorities in 2005 warned people not to construct residential buildings in the area, but houses were eventually built there later in the decade.
spokeswoman toril hofshagen from the norwegian water resources and energy directorate called the landslide unique in its destruction.
not since 1893 has there been a quick clay landslide of this dimension in norway, hofshagen told the media on saturday.
the following is a script from danny clinch which aired on feb. 14, 2016. anderson cooper is the correspondent. david browning and michelle st. john, producers.
in march of 1999, an up-and-coming photographer named danny clinch got two phone calls that would change his life. the first came from bob dylan's manager, asking him to take some pictures of the legendary singer. and a few hours later, bruce springsteen's people also called to book him for a shoot.
in the 17 years since, danny clinch has photographed just about every heavyweight in the music world: rappers, rockers, country stars, jazz and pop artists. tomorrow night, he'll be backstage at the grammys, taking portraits of the winners as he has for 13 years now. clinch has developed friendships with many of his subjects, and that gets him up close and personal access onstage and off. for example:
bruce springsteen -- hitting the road on tour once more, his wife patti by his side. and danny clinch is there to talk a bit about old times and shoot the band rehearsing.
danny clinch: in '99, was the first time i photographed you guys and it was then.
[bruce springsteen: one, two, three, four, one, two, three, four...]
over the years, clinch has taken thousands of pictures of springsteen. and many have become classics.
danny clinch: this is in a farmhouse that's on bruce's property. and it's just a really sweet little spot.
there are portraits of the artist offstage that mirror the tone and the message of his music. and there's the famous shot of springsteen falling back into the crowd, where from the stage, clinch had a perfect view.
danny clinch: i was like, right in there. and he fell back and i got my shot.
anderson cooper: and did you know you got it?
danny clinch: i felt like i did. yeah.
clinch wears many hats, pun intended. as the official portrait photographer at the grammys, he covers the musical spectrum. tony bennett and lady gaga.
danny clinch: i'm not like a strong-arm guy. i want to collaborate.
danny clinch: you want to make people relaxed.
danny clinch: you want to find a common ground as quickly as you can.
foo fighter dave grohl and paul mccartney.
danny clinch: you're in a sense part of the history of that moment. and i never really get tired of that, and i never take it for granted.
[trey anastasio: you want to go up onstage?
he goes way back with many musicians. that's trey anastasio of the band phish, one of several that let him shoot on stage, trusting him to stay out of the way.
it's new year's eve: phish is playing madison square garden and to the crowd, clinch is the invisible man.
anderson cooper: what is it about shooting a concert? what are you trying to get?
danny clinch: i'm trying to capture a moment. it's not about the singer at the microphone. i'm trying to look for, like, a moment in between.
he works from the back of the stage, hiding behind the drums or the amplifiers, waiting for that in-between moment. popping up like a whack-a-mole to get his shot.
and sometimes over the years, it's paid off big, as in this classic photograph. the view from the stage of foo fighter's dave grohl and a cast of thousands.
danny clinch: it still gives me goose bumps.
or this one, at a pearl jam concert. eddie vedder and jeff ament, airborne.
danny clinch: i popped up from behind jeff's amplifiers. the whole stadium was lit. they're up in the air in that perfect moment.
anderson cooper: you were hiding behind an amplifier.
anderson cooper: do you wear earplugs?
danny clinch: i often don't, yeah.
anderson cooper: wow. i'm surprised you can even hear me.
anderson cooper: or are you just reading my lips?
danny clinch: yeah. it is - i get out there and i'm like, jeez, i should probably have some earplugs. and then i'm like, i forgot them.
learning the ropes, clinch was an assistant to photographer annie leibovitz. he prefers shooting in natural light, and agrees with what the famous war photographer robert capa said: if your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough. and even when he's not working, he's still looking for that perfect shot.
danny clinch: i'm photographing all the time. i'm such a visual person and i don't want to miss that moment.
anderson cooper: you're never without your camera?
anderson cooper: even right now sitting here?
danny clinch: yeah. see? i always want to be prepared, 'cause you never know who's going to come to your studio.
[danny clinch: i really like his a lot.]
his studio is a place where any music fan would love to be locked up for a few days.
anderson cooper: it's like a history of rock and roll.
danny clinch: there's a couple things here i want to show you so we'll show them over here.
a couple years back, he photographed one of the men who started it all: chuck berry, who's now 89. and another founding father: jerry lee lewis, who's 80. and here are some pictures from that first session with bob dylan.
danny clinch: we were trying to figure out, you know, give him a little something to do. somebody came back with a whole bunch of different language newspapers. and he picked that one up and i started to shoot just, you know, keeping it real simple.
more of his greatest hits: southern gothic, gregg allman on a rainy day in savannah. johnny cash, waiting to go onstage, a shot capturing the loneliness of life on the road. country stars faith hill and tim mcgraw. tom waits. norah jones. tupac shakur.
danny clinch: he was really professional and he was into it. we chose a shirt that he was gonna change into. he took his shirt off and i saw all the tattoos. and i said, would you mind doing one like that? and he said yeah.
anderson cooper: when you took this did you know how strong it was?
danny clinch: i mean, i felt like this was really a powerful image. i felt like the simplicity of it was really powerful.
clinch has branched out into making commercials and music videos. this one shot in willie nelson's bedroom on his tour bus.
danny clinch: willie doesn't mind me taking his photograph, but he's not really crazy about sitting and being directed and all that sort of stuff. so i've found ways to work with that.
he also got some very candid stills. nelson braiding his hair. and indulging in his favorite recreational pastime, smoking a huge stick of weed.
anderson cooper: i don't even know what it would be called, it's so big.
danny clinch: i know, it's something -
anderson cooper: it's like a cigar.
danny clinch: somehow i can't remember what happened after that.
and then, there are the occasional shoots he wishes he could forget.
danny clinch: i was at a madonna show many, many years ago and i was in the sweet spot and she came out and i mean it was the best part of the show. and i was shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting. and i'm like, god, i must have shot a hundred pictures have i not run out of film? and i opened the back of my camera and there was no film in there. so that happened to me only once.
no doubt one reason he gets along so well with musicians: he knows the language, wearing yet another hat to play with the tangiers blues band, and sometimes jamming with the likes of willie and bruce. his harmonica, like his camera, goes everywhere he goes.
he grew up on the jersey shore, living in toms river, a few miles down the garden state parkway from springsteen country.
he got the photography bug from his mother.
danny clinch: she always had a camera, always still has a camera. and at times i find myself taking pictures of her taking pictures of the family.
and from his father he got a taste for classic rock and roll from the 50s and classic cars.
his prize possession: a 1948 pontiac silver streak. the sort of car his father always noticed when clinch was a kid.
danny clinch: everywhere we went he would go, oh, there's a '55 chevy. and, oh, you know, look at that 1959 cadillac. and i started to love cars myself.
and he's always found a way to work them into the shot. springsteen with the pontiac and in his wife's 1950 hudson with clinch's father at the wheel. an old cadillac with neil young's hat. and young inside, tooling around nashville.
danny clinch: this was a great moment for me, i'm a big fan of neil's, to be driving around in this cadillac was -
anderson cooper: yeah. was he driving?
danny clinch: he was driving yeah, yeah. and we stopped at a little intersection and i grabbed it.
but nothing could prepare him for the trip he made in december to the old car capital of the universe: havana.
anderson cooper: cuba, havana, it's gotta be a photographer's dream.
danny clinch: i'll tell ya. there's so much interesting culture and there's so much great color, everywhere you look is a photograph.
anderson cooper: you seem to have a smile on your face kind of all the time.
the preservation hall jazz band was invited to a cuban music festival, and clinch tagged along with a documentary film crew.
they play the traditional music of new orleans. a distinctive sound -- and some distinctive instruments.
anderson cooper: you know you do a lot rock and roll bands, don't see a lot of rock and roll bands with a sousaphone.
danny clinch: yeah. (laugh) that's true.
the rhythms of new orleans and havana are much alike. and the americans were soon jamming with cuban musicians: on stage, at their homes.
danny clinch: you don't need to speak spanish, you know? you just need to speak music.
between concerts, clinch wandered the city, snapping away. and checking out the cars.
danny clinch: i'm not just a fan of the really restored ones, the shiny ones. but i like the working man's cars -
danny clinch: how they've fixed it, how it had been repaired time after time.
but his biggest thrill came backstage, with the band warming up.
danny clinch: they were preparing for the show. and it just turned into this impromptu, like jam, this percussion type thing. and i live for those moments.
he's seen a lot of moments, heard a lot of music. and has come -- to one conclusion.
danny clinch: it doesn't matter if it's hip-hop. it doesn't matter if it's jazz, or anything in between. if it hits you right here, it's good music.
anderson cooper: and you can get a photo out of it. you can capture it.
writing in clinch's notebook, tupac shakur said: if a picture is worth a thousand words, photographers are worth a million. that's a thought shared by clinch's fellow native of the jersey shore, who says...
bruce springsteen: this is the man here.
bruce springsteen: if you want the picture...
danny clinch: come and get it.
the battle for the super bowl isn't just waged on the field: dozens of advertisers are collectively spending more than $350 million to reach the game's massive audience.
the super bowl remains a rarity on tv, a broadcast where people tune in not only for the main event but also for the commercials. but that combination -- a huge audience and one that's primed to listen to tv ads -- can sometimes prove to be a mixed blessing for brands, given the enormous pressure to score a touchdown with a memorable ad.
when an commercial succeeds, it can both charm viewers and change the way consumers think of a brand. witness apple's 1984 commercial, which broadcast the message that the computer company was breaking away from colorless rivals. but for every 1984, there's at least one advertiser that wants to succeed on a similar scale but falls far short. sometimes, those ads make viewers cringe, spark boycotts or calls for the commercial to be yanked.
the super bowl 50 advertisers as a whole may swing toward humor this year, contrasting with last year's game, which tended to have a sombre tone, said peter daboll, chief executive of ace metrix.
last year's group of commercials lost their impact collectively because there were so many serious-minded ads, he noted. i think they will shift back to a more lighter tone to get people to pay attention, to have surprises and not be as preachy.
merely bad commercials often lose the plot because they're trying to push the envelope, often with humor. one notorious spot came from snickers in 2007, which showed two mechanics snacking on opposite ends of a candy bar, meeting in the middle with a kiss. the men, shocked, try to prove their heterosexuality by tearing out their chest hair and, in one version, fighting. the spot was condemned as homophobic.
controversial commercials, on the other hand, often shoot for a big statement but come across as stern, tacky or worse. last year's super bowl included one commercial that left many viewers upset and troubled.
read on to learn about that commercial and four other controversial super bowl ads.
super bowl 50 is on sunday, feb. 7 on cbs.
he became the first dreamer to win the prestigious rhodes scholarship, but for recent harvard university graduate jin park, the joy of that achievement has given way to uncertainty.
the 22-year-old, who lives in new york city, risks not being allowed back in the country if he enrolls at the university of oxford in england in the fall.
president trump's administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with deferred action for childhood arrivals status, or daca, when mr. trump moved to phase out the obama-era program in 2017.
but travel abroad, which was allowed under limited circumstances such as academic study during the obama administration, should still be permitted because the federal courts have upheld the program for now, argue park and his supporters.
if i leave, there's a very real possibility that i won't be able to come back. that's the biggest fear for sure, said park, whose family came to the u.s. from south korea when he was 7 years old. i haven't really thought about what that's going to mean if i'm not allowed back.
u.s. citizen and immigration services, which administers daca, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.
harvard university grad jin park, who holds a degree in molecular and cellular biology, during interview in cambridge, mass., on dec. 13, 2018 charles krupa / ap
daca recipients, commonly called dreamers because of never-passed proposals in congress called the dream act, are protected from deportation because they were brought into the country illegally at a young age.
discussing the risks has been a delicate topic to broach with his parents, who cried out of joy when he won the scholarship, park said.
i've been avoiding that question, he said days after graduating from harvard last month. this was especially meaningful for them. it was like a validation of the sacrifices they've made for me.
nearly 700,000 individuals are currently on daca, which was created in 2012 and can be renewed every two years. to qualify, immigrants must have entered the country by 2007 and been under age 16 when they arrived.
the trump administration issued an order winding down the program in 2017, but federal judges in new york, california and washington, d.c., ruled against those efforts last year and have effectively kept the program running. the administration is now seeking a supreme court review.
past rhodes scholars and other rhodes trust supporters are volunteering their private counsel to park in the meantime, but it's a matter of american law and not anything the rhodes trust can resolve alone, said elliot gerson, the british organization's american secretary.
our hope is for federal action, he added.
the government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow jin to fulfil his scholarly work, said kristian ramos, a spokesman for define american, an immigrant advocacy organization that supported park in his rhodes scholarship bid.
park could turn down the scholarship but has decided against that route. he wants to continue to be a voice in the immigration debate and believes the benefits of going to oxford outweigh the risks.
i'm looking forward to having that unstructured time to think about these broader questions of who belongs in america and the value judgments we make about others, he said.
park has been a vocal advocate for daca recipients since he was in high school. in 2015, he founded higher dreams, a nonprofit organization that helps students without permanent immigration status navigate the college application process.
with the backing of harvard, park applied for the rhodes scholarship last year as part of a broader effort to underscore how daca recipients didn't qualify for the venerated award and others like it. the scholarship was created in 1902 by british businessmen and politician cecil rhodes and provides all expenses for at least two years of study at oxford.
park's application - like a number of others in recent years - was rejected, but the message was received. the rhodes organization changed its policy effective this year. park re-applied and was accepted.
gerson said the change reflects the organization's efforts to expand eligibility. legal permanent residents and residents of u.s. territories like puerto rico have also been allowed to apply in recent years.
at oxford, park hopes to study migration and political theory as he weighs his future.
the molecular and cell biology major has also applied to medical school, but he hasn't ruled out working in city government, where he believes he can make an impact on immigration policy no matter who is in the white house.
and regardless what happens next, park has the conviction of knowing where home is.
for me, i think of queens, new york, he said. whatever happens, i'm always going to know that fact. even if i have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next.
jack welch, who became a celebrity ceo and management guru after reviving general electric in the 1980s and 1990s, is dead at age 84.
his death was confirmed monday by ge, according to the associated press. the cause of death was renal failure, his wife suzy told the new york times.
welch took over the industrial giant in 1981 at a time when the u.s. economy was emerging from recession and conglomerates were falling out of style among investors. the executive took ge's many industrial divisions global and instituted a management method for better testing the profitability of its divisions, selling off those that were underperforming. that led to higher profits, but also massive layoffs. ge cut more than 100,000 jobs, or nearly a quarter of its employees, during welch's tenure.
welch also overhauled ge's business. he led the company's charge into financial services and its purchase of rca, whose assets included the nbc television network.
today is a sad day for the entire ge family, current ge chief executive h. lawrence culp jr. said in a statement. jack was larger than life and the heart of ge for half a century. he reshaped the face of our company and the business world. jack was a strong and constant influence throughout my career despite never having worked directly for him.
in a post on linkedin, jeff immelt, welch's handpicked successor for ge's top job in 2001, called welch the best boss i have ever seen, and said welch made his employees feel valued.
jack was always direct, but his frankness was appealing and effective, immelt wrote. his informality and accessibility made ge a team, and we all loved working for him because he wanted the people around him to succeed.
welch's ge makeover was a huge success during his tenure. revenue soared at ge under welch, up 600% to $130 billion. he also made ge's investors a lot of money: general electric's stock market value under welch rose to more than $400 billion, from $14 billion when he took the job of chief executive. during his tenure, ge's revenue grew nearly fivefold, and the firm's market capitalization increased 30-fold.
that led to ge becoming the world's most valuable company at one point and its stock one of the most widely held among both institutional and average investors. in 1999, fortune magazine named welch as its manager of the century.
former general electric ceo jack welch speaks during the world business forum in new york on october 5, 2010. lucas jackson / reuters
welch, trained as chemical engineer, championed the belief that the main job of a ceo was to boost shareholder wealth. i had plenty of money in the first three years i was ceo — the next 17 was spent making other people rich, welch said two years ago in an interview. i mean it's a turn-on. i used to call guys in my office and give them a million bucks. you realize how good that feels?
but since stepping down from ge's top job in 2001, welch's leadership at the company has come into question, especially since the financial crisis. ge's stock has floundered in recent decades, and the company faced steep losses in its financial businesses after the collapse of lehman brothers. welch also became a vocal critic of president barack obama and other democrats.
in october 2012, welch questioned a monthly government jobs report that showed the unemployment rate had fallen below 8% for the first time in three and a half years. the report came two days after mr. obama had performed poorly in his first debate with romney and a month before the election.
unbelievable jobs numbers, he tweeted. these chicago guys will do anything...can't debate so change numbers.
obama hailed from chicago. while some republican members of congress echoed his views, his criticism was mostly derided by economists and by former labor department officials from the bush administration, who vouched for the accuracy of the government's labor data.
welch quickly climbed the ranks at ge, becoming its youngest chairman and ceo in 1981 at age 45. he also shook up the company laying off tens of thousands of employees in his first five years. that earned him the unwanted nickname neutron jack, after the nuclear weapon that kills people but leaves buildings largely intact.
welch bristled at the name, insisting that successful companies needed to be agile. to that end, he also divested ge of billions of dollars in businesses that didn't live up to his mantra that they be no. 1 or 2 in their markets.
he's quick on the trigger — sometimes too quick, noel tichy, author of a 1993 book on welch and a former leader of ge's vaunted training programs, said in 2001.
he'll make snap judgments; he's a human being that has temper tantrums. tichy said. with all that, i think he's the greatest business leader i ever met.
— the associated press contributed to this report.
a priority of the new president and congress will be reining in the giants of social media. on this, democrats and republicans agree. their target is a federal law known as section 230. in a single sentence it set off the 'big bang' helping to create the universe of google, facebook, twitter and the rest. some critics of the law say that it leaves social media free to ignore lies, hoaxes and slander that can wreck the lives of innocent people. one of those critics is lenny pozner. after a tragedy in his own life, pozner has become a champion for victims of online lies, people including maatje and matt benassi, who, overnight, became the target of death threats like these.
maatje benassi: we're gonna put a bullet in her skull. let's load up the trucks. let's go get 'em. let's hang 'em. they posted our address, our full address, where we live.
the hate focused on maatje and matt benassi, was unleashed by a hoax that claims she brought covid-19 into the world.
matt benassi: it's changed and migrated over the 70-plus videos that they've had about us. but--
matt benassi: yeah. if you actually go through all of the videos there is a total 70 videos across multiple youtube channels.
the videos claim maatje benassi carried the virus to china on a bicycle. she was invited there as a member of a u.s. military cycling team. maatje is a dutch immigrant, american citizen and solider who served in iraq. in 2019, during an international military olympics, she crashed in wuhan, where covid-19 was discovered two months later. her collision with the internet began after an innocent article about the race.
maatje benassi: and somebody came across it, and it had wuhan in it, and they took a run with it. oh, we got a person.
scott pelley: your name, the name wuhan, and the rest only takes a lot of imagination.
scott pelley: what were they saying about you?
maatje benassi: first they said i brought it to china. and when i crashed, i spread it. and that i spread it in the hospital which i never was in a hospital. all these lies about vials in my bicycle hidden. and i have no idea.
the absurdity was spelled out, literally, by a hoax peddler named george webb. he has a following among the deep state phony conspiracy crowd.
scott pelley: what has this meant to you?
maatje benassi: i was looking over my shoulder a lot. i was scared for my life
scott pelley: you were taking all that seriously?
maatje benassi: yes. once my address was posted, that was it for me. that did it. because they put me in danger, my family.
matt benassi: there was like 60 or 70 death threats over the span of, you know, four or five weeks.
they called the police and the fbi which got them nowhere.
matt benassi: and the reason why the fbi and the police don't want to talk to you is because even though we're receiving death threats they didn't say, we're coming to the benassis to kill them tonight.
scott pelley: they need a crime to have been committed.
scott pelley: and you're trying to prevent a crime from being committed.
right about now you might be thinking, they should sue. but that's the problem. they can't file hundreds of lawsuits against internet trolls hiding behind aliases. and they can't sue the internet platforms because of that law known as section 230 of the communications decency act of 1996. written before facebook or google were invented, section 230 says, in just 26 words, that internet platforms are not liable for what their users post.
jeff kosseff: that means that if i were to post something about you on facebook that was awful and defamatory and you actually had a viable defamation lawsuit, you could sue me, but you can't sue facebook.
jeff kosseff teaches law and wrote a book called the 26 words that created the internet.
scott pelley: but help me understand, the same is not true for other forms of media. if somebody says something defamatory on 60 minutes or on fox or cnn or in the new york times, those organizations can be sued. so why not google, youtube, facebook?
jeff kosseff: so the difference between a social media site and let's say the letters to the editor page of the new york times is the vast amount of content that they deliver. so i mean you might have five or ten letters to the editor on a page. you could have i think it's 6,000 tweets per second. and so section 230 really recognizes how exceptional the internet is and says, we want to encourage this marketplace of ideas. 25 years later, that marketplace has a lot of really great stuff, but it also has a lot of really terrible products in that marketplace. and that's really what's driving this debate right now.
maatje and matt benassi quickly discovered the law was not on their side so they turned to lenny pozner who had suffered in the same way.
lenny pozner: i was being attacked, the memory of my son, my son's very short life was being attacked. and i just wasn't going to stand for that.
the very short life of pozner's son, noah, ended at connecticut's sandy hook elementary school in 2012, with 25 others. the gunshots of a madman have ricocheted online ever since.
lenny pozner: conversations denying the tragedy-- accusing the government of staging it.
scott pelley: what was the most hurtful thing they said about you?
lenny pozner: that noah did not die. that i'm not noah's father. it all revolves around the notion that these are staged shootings, that they're scripted events, that i'm an actor, that i'm paid to fake the death of a child.
before the covid pandemic we hired theatrical makeup artists to disguise pozner for his safety. he's pursued by death threats. one woman left a voicemail saying, death is coming for you real soon. she landed in prison sooner.
scott pelley: how many times have you had to move your family?
lenny pozner in theatrical makeup to disguise himself for safety.
he's targeted because he's invented ways to fight back. he copyrighted photos of his son to control how they are used. he published a letter to facebook's ceo that read, [you] have deemed… our lives are less important than providing a safe haven for hate.
scott pelley: this was meant by you and your ex-wife to be public shaming of facebook?
lenny pozner: that has been really the only effective way to get change for online platforms.
after the letter, a facebook manager called pozner.
lenny pozner: it began a relationship with facebook that helped them learn about the material that is being posted on their platform and how it is abusive, defamatory
scott pelley: have you seen a difference, a practical difference in facebook?
lenny pozner: yes, it's almost all gone.
pozner expanded his work into a non-profit called the honr network—that applies what he has learned to help others.
andy parker: that's when i reached out to lenny pozner, he had volunteers that were fighting harassment-- and i said, lenny, i want this video to come down. and he said, i will help you do that.
by himself, andy parker couldn't get video of his daughter's murder off of google's youtube.
andy parker: i really expected them to do the right thing. their motto was, don't be evil. and for a while, they did a pretty good job of it. but now, they are the personification of evil.
in 2015, reporter alison parker and cameraman, adam ward, were shot, on camera, by a fired co-worker. the scene has been posted hundreds of times. this one got more than 600,000 views. and to the right, the automatic ad means the person who posted this made money and so did youtube.
andy parker: we shouldn't have to be the ones policing their platform. their terms of service say, we don't allow this. we don't allow violent content. we don't allow harassment. my biggest beef with google, and youtube, and facebook for that matter is, that video is still out there. it's still out there today in essence, they profit from my daughter's murder. and i can't abide by that.
scott pelley: do you worry about threats?
andy parker: no, i really don't.
scott pelley: why do you feel so brave?
andy parker: because alison would expect nothing less.
scott pelley: you're still her dad.
andy parker: yeah, i'm her dad. always will be, and i will fight like hell-- for her.
lenny pozner flagged alison parker videos for youtube to remove.
youtube wrote us, there is no place on youtube for content that exploits this horrendous act, and we've spent the last several years investing in tools and policies to quickly remove it. youtube told us it now prioritizes all requests from pozner's honr network.
scott pelley: why do you think the online platforms have not been effective in enforcing their own terms of service?
lenny pozner: i don't think they were prepared for their online platforms to be used this way. i think they were more focused on growth and expansion and likely had more of an idealized notion of the internet and the way it would be used for the greater good.
scott pelley: an idealized notion of human nature?
pozner also has been successful pulling down much of that covid-19 lie that shadows maatje and matt benassi. he got hoax peddler george webb kicked off youtube.
recently, some platforms took first steps toward editing their users. facebook and twitter flagged dubious content during the election. now they're doing the same for myths about covid-19.
scott pelley: based on what you've had to learn about all of these things, what do you think the solution could be?
matt benassi: this is really, really hard, right? 'cause section 230. when that was written, it was probably done with the intent that social media companies would police themselves in some manner. and social media companies haven't done that very well. they need to police themselves quicker or the government needs to step in and figure out some mechanism to make them liable. 'cause making them liable would make them police themselves.
but making social media liable would also mean facebook, twitter, even wikipedia and yelp, couldn't exist as we know them. president-elect biden wants to revoke section 230. the federal government is already suing to break up facebook and google. no one can say what social media 2.0 will look like or whether the innocent will ever be protected from a world wide web of lies.

charlottesville -- in a deal that spares him the death penalty, jesse matthew has pleaded guilty to the murders of two virginia college students as family members of the victims read emotional impact statements.
watch: 48 hours: hannah graham: deadly connections
during a wednesday court hearing, the former hospital orderly pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and two counts of abduction with intent to defile in the september 2014 death of 18-year-old university of virginia student hannah graham and the 2009 death of 20-year-old virginia ech student morgan harrington. matthew, 35, made no statement to the judge and showed little emotion.
jesse matthew arriving in court wednesday, march 2, 2016 wdbj reporter joe dashiell via twitter
a sentence of four consecutive life terms was accepted by the judge, in addition to the three he's already serving in a 2005 fairfax, va. rape. capital murder - a charge which carries a possible death sentence - was taken off the table.
matthew has expressed remorse for the killings, his lawyer douglas ramseur said at a press conference following the hearing.
he had me express for him in court how terribly sorry he is for everything that's happened, and how much he loves his family and is sorry for everything they've been put through because of this, ramseur said.
speaking before the judge, hannah graham's mother sue graham called her daughter a heroine who helped change the world.
she helped capture a serial rapist and murderer who had been hiding in plain sight in charlottesville for years, graham said.
she said matthew dumped her like a bag of trash to be picked over by buzzards.
describing hannah as irreplaceable and the most optimistic person we've ever known, she said she misses her daughter's smile and quick wit, and snuggling with her on the couch.
harrington's father dan harrington also spoke before the judge, reading a statement prepared by his family, reports cbs affiliate wtvr.
harrington described his daughter morgan as beautiful, smart and talented. he said he and his family have felt the pain of their daughter's loss acutely, every second, of every day in the 6.5 years since that wicked act occurred.
he said matthew robbed his family of morgan and our joy, and robbed his daughter of her future, her potential to educate others, to be married, have children and to grow old.
our little girl, morgan was killed by jesse matthew. how can that be? the brutality and intentionality of morgan's murder pierces our every day, and will continue to do so until we join her, his statement read.
how could he? why would he?
according to authorities, graham and harrington were young women in vulnerable straits when they vanished in charlottesville five years apart. harrington disappeared after she stepped out of a u.va. arena during a metallica concert and was unable to get back in. graham, after having dinner and attending parties off campus, was captured on surveillance video walking unsteadily, and sometimes running, past a service station and a restaurant. she texted a friend that she was lost.
additional video showed graham crossing charlottesville's downtown pedestrian mall, then leaving a restaurant with matthew, his arm wrapped around her.
the surveillance images of matthew meeting their daughter will stay in the family's mind's forever, sue graham said wednesday.
graham's disappearance, which came at a time of rising national concern about sexual assaults and other crimes on college campuses, prompted a massive search. her body was found five weeks later on abandoned property in albemarle county, about 12 miles from the charlottesville campus and 6 miles from a hayfield where harrington's remains had been found in january 2010.
after police named matthew a person of interest in graham's disappearance, he fled and was later apprehended on a beach in southeast texas. he was charged with abduction with intent to defile, a felony that empowered police to swab his cheek for a dna sample. that sample connected matthew to the 2005 sexual assault in fairfax, a virginia suburb of washington, according to authorities.
the dna evidence in the fairfax sexual assault, in turn, linked matthew to the harrington case, authorities have said.
the charge against matthew in the graham case was later upgraded to capital murder, giving prosecutors the option to seek the death penalty.
matthew, who was a taxi driver before going to work at the university of virginia hospital, also had been accused of raping students in 2002 and 2003 at liberty university and christopher newport university, where he had played football. but those cases were dropped when the women declined to press charges.
consumers, get ready: you're about to suffer some sticker shock. thanks to the post-election surge of business optimism, last year's rebound in energy prices and a tightening labor market, we learned this week that inflation measures are already rising at the fastest pace since 2013.
headline consumer price inflation jumped 0.6 percent month-over-month -- double the expected gain. on an annual basis, inflation is rising at a 2.5 percent clip (the hottest since march 2012).
should these trends continue, as they appear ready to do, shoppers are going to suffer a surge of higher prices not seen since the end of the last economic expansion in 2007.
it's not just inflation, but real growth is heating up as well. and that means the inflation surge is no mere flash in the pan.
headline retail sales rose 0.4 percent in january over december, pushing the annual rise to a level that was last hit in 2014. and the february empire state manufacturing survey increased to its strongest print since september 2014.
separately, producer price inflation increased 0.6 percent last month from the month prior, double the gain expected and landing the annual rate at 1.6 percent -- another level not seen since 2014. you get the idea.
digging into the consumer price index (cpi, chart above), energy is playing a big role, with gasoline prices up 7.8 percent as we eclipse last february's energy price wipeout before opec started teasing a production freeze agreement that was eventually finalized late last year. but other areas of upward price pressure include apparel, new vehicles, household furnishings, housing and medical care. so the forces are broad-based.
shelter costs in particular are a big deal because they're heavily weighted in inflation measures (at about a third of overall spending) and have been rising steadily in recent years. the cpi's shelter component is rising at a 3.5 percent annual rate -- last hit in the fading days of the housing bubble in 2007.
two dynamics threaten to precipitate the inflation surge: the long-awaited rise of wage pressure and the ability of businesses to pass higher costs onto consumers via higher prices.
wages certainly look poised for a move higher, assuming the tepid but steady payroll gains continue. the national federation of independent business survey found a growing shortage of qualified, desirable applicants. the latest numbers show the net share of small companies saying they're receiving inadequate applicants for job postings rose to 47 percent from 44 percent in december.
should this hiring tightness translate into higher pay as businesses compete for a diminished pool of quality workers, the temptation to protect profitability will be hard to resist.
so far, this dynanmic isn't hitting consumers: only 5 percent of nfib respondents said they're raising prices. but that could soon change.

as if it weren't tough enough to get a date as you get older, dating site tinder also charges more if you're over 30. but now a california appeals court has revived a lawsuit that alleges tinder's pricing discriminates against older users, who must pay more to access certain features of its service. that ruling was a reversal of a lower-court decision.
at issue is tinder's 2015 decision to charge customers 30 and older a $19.99 monthly fee for its tinder plus feature, for which younger people pay $9.99 to $14.99. plaintiff allen candelore filed suit seeking class-action status against tinder, alleging the company's pricing constituted unfair competition and violated california's unruh civil rights act. a spokesperson for tinder couldn't be reached.
the service, where people swipe right on their smartphones to accept a potential match, is part of the internet company match, also the corporate parent of match.com and okcupid. tinder plus allows users to change their location so they can find potential dates anywhere in the world and a rewind feature that lets users undo a left-swipe reject.
tinder, which claims more than 26 million matches every day, charged lower rates for younger consumers because its market research showed that they were less able to afford premium services. a three-judge panel of the los angeles county superior court, however, rejected tinder's justification for the difference in charges.
no matter what tinder's market research may have shown about the younger users' relative income and willingness to pay for the service, as a group, as compared to the older cohort, some individuals will not fit the mold, the 26-page ruling said. some older consumers will be 'more budget constrained' and less willing to pay than some in the younger group. … because nothing in the complaint suggests there is a strong public policy that justifies the alleged discriminatory pricing. … accordingly, we swipe left, and reverse.
candelore has been involved in other high-profile lawsuits. he is a member of the nonprofit national coalition for men (ncfm), which seeks to raise awareness about how men and boys are affected by sex discrimination. mother jones reported in 2016 that candelore and two other ncfm members filed suit in california against business networking and golf events in recent years that were open only to women. both cases were later settled for an undisclosed amount of money.
al rava, who represents candelore in the tinder case, also served as counsel in the networking and golf course cases. he has cited the unruh act in many of the more than 150 discrimination cases he has filed over the past decade, including a challenge to an oakland athletics' giveaway of baseball hats to female fans that was eventually settled.
in fact, i have been victorious in all my unruh civil rights act sex-discrimination lawsuits because, as a result of these lawsuits, every defendant stopped its unequal treatment of male and female consumers,' rava said. he added that the tinder lawsuit isn't related to the ncfm.
president donald trump has always linked illegal immigration to the southern border and the need for a wall. on thursday — the 13th day of a government shutdown tied to the issue — mr. trump tweeted a video called crisis on the border depicting rioting migrants trying to rush into the country.
but only one-third of the recent undocumented immigrant population came to the united states through the southern border, according to the center for migration studies (cms), a new york city-based think tank. the rest came legally on work visas and stayed after they expired, according to cms.
in other words, a wall wouldn't have kept them out.
according to cms, about 42 percent of the 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the u.s. in 2014 — the most recent year for which data was available — were doing so on expired visas. as the southern border has hardened, that number is estimated to have risen to over half, randy capps, director of research for u.s. programs at the migration policy institute, said.
the fight over a border wall is a typical issue of 'fighting the last war': ten years ago was the fight against mexican migration to the u.s., capps said in a telephone interview with cbs news. the problem isn't mexican migration anymore. now the immigration problem is overstayers, not border crossers.
the undocumented immigrant population hit a 12-year low in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, almost entirely due to a sharp drop in unauthorized border crossings by mexican nationals, according to the pew research center. pew estimated that the unauthorized mexican immigrant population decreased by 22 percent since its peak in 2007.
over a five-year period ending 2016, a little over half a million mexicans illegally entered the u.s. through the southern border. that was down from 2.05 million during five years ending 2007, according to pew.
while there has been an increase in central american migrants arriving at the southern border recently, a vast majority have claimed asylum, a legal mode of immigration, said capps.
mr. trump has made immigration, specifically a border wall, a signature piece of his administration's priorities. while there have been some measures to rein in visa overstays since mr. trump was sworn into office, the changes have been less resource-draining.
one such change is that immigration customs and enforcement now emails visa holders to warn them that their legal residency is about to expire, said jessica vaughan, director of policy studies at the center for immigration studies, a research group that supports policy which admits fewer immigrants.
it'll make people think twice about staying, vaughan said in a telephone interview with cbs news. i think it'll help.
in the year ending september 30, 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, about 700,000 foreigners were living in the u.s. on visas that had expired in the prior 12 months, according to data from the department of homeland security. the agency estimated that about 15 percent of those have since left the country, but the rest remain in the u.s. as undocumented immigrants. 2017 was only the second year that dhs reported the overstay figure.
like most other immigration data points, pinpointing the total undocumented population and how they arrived in the u.s. is equal parts art and science, vaughan said. using deportation data from ice, which tracks how immigrants arrive in the u.s., vaughan estimates that visa overstays comprise somewhere between 40 and 50 percent of the undocumented immigration population.
both modes of entry are a big problem, said vaughan.

it's friday night in quincy, illinois, and thousands have come out to cheer for the home team.
the quincy high school blue devils is a revered, legendary program. one of the winningest programs in high school history, said local journalist bob gough, who swaps his keyboard for a microphone and moonlights as the announcer.
if you're a local sports star, you know people are always wanting to know about you, he said.
and no one was bigger than blue devil's hall of famer curtis lovelace. in the 1980s, he made headlines as a star athlete and scholar at quincy high school.
curtis lovelace was a star student athlete at quincy high school
curtis lovelace was a very hard working kid, smart kid, said gough.
and the university of illinois gave lovelace - #54 -- a scholarship to play football.
i mean quincy, illinois, doesn't produce a ton of all-big ten players, gough noted.
he wasn't just any player. lovelace, who studied business administration, was considered one of the top offensive linemen in the big ten -- a team captain who lead the university of illinois to the big ten championship his senior year.
was two-time all-big ten, even got a look in free agent camp in the nfl, gough explained. had a bad knee injury, which, not sure if he woulda made it or not, but that certainly didn't help the situation. but being a smart kid curtis already had other goals in mind.
while at school, curtis started a long distance relationship with cory didriksen. they met in high school, but only started dating when they left for college. she was studying communications at the university of iowa.
she just had a perfect smile, cory's mother, marty didriksen, told cbs affiliate khqa. and she just smiled at everyone. and she just did stuff.
cory was vibrant, dynamic. a little bit of stubbornness, and she was a pistol and i loved her for that. i think that was her most endearing quality, said friend steve belko.
belko, beth dobrzynski and bret schrader grew up with cory and curtis in quincy.
curt was easygoing he was a gentleman, fun loving, intelligent - a gentlemen, said belko.
do you think they were well matched? maher asked the group of friends.
i did. i did. well, they looked great together, but they had a lot of similarities and they seemed to have fun together, dobrzynski replied.
it didn't take long before their relationship became serious.
it was thanksgiving. we were sitting up on her bed. and we were just kinda talking about things and she said, 'oh, by the way, i've met the man i'm going to marry,' said didriksen.
curtis and cory lovelace marty didriksen
in 1991, just one year after graduation, they were married. belko was curt's best man and dobrzynski was cory's bridesmaid.
it was one of the best days, you know, in our lives, said belko.
cory was beautiful. it was a great night. they were very happy. the pictures you know, you could see on their faces. whether it was cutting the cake or dancing or walking around and talking to people. it was a magical night, dobrzynski reminisced.
with cory by his side, curtis lovelace had grand plans. he attended law school and eventually became an assistant state's attorney in the city they both loved, quincy.
what did cory want to do with her life? ... what were her dreams? maher asked dobrzynski.
cory was all about family. she had a great childhood growing up, she replied. she wanted the big family. ...the happy marriage.
that dream came true in 1993, when their first child, lyndsay, was born. they would later have three sons: logan, lincoln, and larson.
she was a beautiful person, lyndsay lovelace said of her mother.
lyndsay, now 22, told khqa reporter jenny dreasler how she and her mother loved listening to the music group abba.
we would just have girl moments and just dance around and sing 'dancing queen.' i still listen to them because it brings me so much joy from that, she said.
lyndsay's dad was a man on the move. in 2005, he opened up his own law firm while still at the state's attorney's office. years later, he left to concentrate on his own practice. and, if his schedule wasn't busy enough, lovelace was elected president of the school board. he became a captain in the illinois national guard, and an adjunct professor at quincy university.
he definitely was a pillar of this community, no question about it, gough remarked.
but friends say with power, came ego.
i just felt he kinda started to talk down to me more and more each time i saw him, said schrader.
he became arrogant more and more, yes, belko said. there was a little bit of holier than thou. ...maybe you were entitled to this living. i think he lost friends over time because of that.
the situation at home had also been changing. while curtis had spent years focused on his professional life, the long hours away from cory and the kids were starting to take a toll on their personal life.
from what we learned now, and he eventually admitted, they had a volatile relationship, said gough.
neighbors around the lovelace house on kentucky street say that in the months leading up to her death, they had heard loud and contentious arguments between cory and curtis. by many accounts, both were heavy drinkers. and in this small community, it was known that at times there was a tremendous amount of turmoil in their home.
she suffered from bulimia. this is something her family has admitted, dreasler said. and the rumors started coming out. ...known alcoholism. the community knew that too. there've been people who've even told me ... i saw her out drinking here or out drinking there. people knew that she had an alcohol problem, but i don't think that they knew to the extent.
cory and curtis lovelace steve belko
amazingly, curtis and cory managed to keep their problems from their closest friends, like belko, who years before, had moved away from their small town.
was there a point in time where any of you started to see things changing between the two of them? maher asked the friends.
no indication that there was trouble coming up? maher asked.
i never had any, belko replied.
cory was a great person, very confident, she had everything under control. and she wasn't one to you know whine or complain, dobrzynski said. she could handle it.
but everything fell apart on valentine's day 2006, when belko got a call from curtis's father that cory had died.
he said, 'listen i got some bad news.' ...and i just couldn't believe it. no, that doesn't happen. she's my age. she's healthy. this just doesn't come from nowhere, belko said. something's wrong. there was no doubt something is terribly wrong.
on feb. 14, 2006, love was in the crisp winter air of quincy, illinois. at 1869 kentucky, it was a school day and cory lovelace would usually have her hands full.
cory was a stay at home mom, gough explained. she was always hustling, always trying to get the kids wrangled around and to where they needed to be.
that morning seemed like so many others. according to curtis lovelace, cory helped get the kids ready. they had breakfast and jumped in dad's car. it was 8:15 a.m.
curtis then took the three oldest children to school, gough said. they left the youngest, the 4-year-old, there.
and little 4-year-old larson went upstairs to see his mom.
went in and he said that he said her name and he thought he poked her. but she didn't answer, dreasler explained. so he ... sat and waited for his dad to get home.
then when he got back, the youngest was still there ... said something that he couldn't wake his mom up, said gough.
by then, it was about 9 a.m.
curt went upstairs to use the restroom and glanced back in the bedroom and saw something wasn't right. went in to see cory, tried to shake her. and nothing, said belko.
that was the moment a normal valentine's day morning turned into a mystery. behavior turned suddenly strange, starting with curtis lovelace.
took the youngest to cory's mother's house. gave the youngest child to cory's mother and said, 'cory's dead' and left, gough said. the first call was not to 911. the first call was not to the paramedics. the first call was his boss, the state's attorney.
still strikes you as odd, maher noted.
who walks over to their mother-in-law's house, gives them their youngest ... and says, 'your daughter's dead, here's my child. take care of him,' maher commented.
the whole scenario was bizarre, said gough.
people do process grief differently, sure. if it was my wife, i think i'd have called 911 screaming and ranting and trying to perform cpr, which he didn't do, said gough.
the grim details of the day would be embedded in the minds of those who were there. e.m.t cole miller was among the first on the scene.
she was laying in the bed and her arms were drawn up by her chest, he explained, holding up his arms to show how cory's were positioned. and i went in there to check for signs of life, checked her carotid pulse in her neck, and then checked her wrist and saw that it was cold and stiff.
it was just surreal, said dobrzynski.
when i did find out i was very shocked, said schrader.
what happened in the house that morning, when it happened -- just how long cory lovelace had been dead -- would be questions that would haunt a town and destroy a family.
she'd been dead long enough that there was no need to start cpr. it wouldn't do any good, said miller.
quincy police detective jeff baird would not speak to 48 hours. but that day he did speak with curtis, who told his version of events -- a morning curtis swears to police and to friends, cory was still very much alive.
what did he say happened? maher asked steve belko.
that cory had been ill the night before ... had thrown up and wanted some tylenol and he got her some, he explained. apparently she did come down to help. he told me he just remembers her at the bottom of the steps, they walked out and he took the kids to school.
according to curtis, his wife cory was not feeling well that valentine's day morning. she came down the stairs and sat down for a while. detective baird said that three of the children also told him they saw their mother alive that morning.
he interviewed the three oldest children. those interviews were not recorded, video or audio. he just took notes and then turned in a report in which he spoke to the three oldest children individually, without their father being there. and they all told him they had seen their mother that morning, said gough.
why is the time cory lovelace died so critical? ask a man who deals in death for a living, deputy coroner james keller. that valentine's day morning, he was there to transport cory's body.
upon entering the bedroom, i notice the female lying on the bed on her back with her hands kind of in an upright position, keller explained.
can you show me? maher asked.
hands kind of above her, he said, holding his arms up, elbows bent, in front of his chest. kind of this direction here ... a very odd position.
however long cory lovelace had been dead, to keller it certainly appeared that medical rigor mortis had set in -- a process he says usually takes close to 12 hours.
she was in the state of full rigor, said keller.
almost like a mannequin? maher asked.
keller was told that cory saw the kids off to school, handing one a valentine's class project. and someone on the scene told keller cory lovelace had died in the morning.
keller's response to that was, what day?
did it make any sense to you that they were saying it was that morning? maher asked.
it did not, keller said. it just didn't seem to add up.
over the years, james keller has learned one undeniable truth of his trade: the dead do speak.
a body always tells a story the way you find them, he said.
what is the story that cory's body was telling you? maher asked.
that she had passed earlier that prior evening or day, keller replied.
ten to 12 hours earlier, possibly?
but that medical assessment of time of death wasn't matching what curtis and the kids were saying -- that cory has been alive that morning.
it was just not what she was telling. it was just not what she was saying, said keller.
did you tell anybody about that afterwards and as the inquisition went on? maher asked.
there's numerous people ... the coroner gary hamilton, he replied. ... everybody had some reservations, maybe concerns.
james keller was a deputy coroner at the time, second to sitting coroner gary hamilton, who was also at the lovelace home. an autopsy, including toxicology test, was conducted the day after cory was found dead, and hamilton signed off. the cause of death was undetermined.
well 'undetermined' ... if you don't have a cause ... leaving it 'undetermined' was the right thing to do, said keller.
despite the odd position of cory's arms and despite an unexplained cut on her lip, two days later, at her mother's request, cory lovelace was cremated and quincy police officially closed the investigation.
and life went on? maher asked gough.
eight years would pass, and then a curious cop followed a hunch.
you had a detective in the quincy police department, adam gibson, gough explained.
and lookin' at the photos ... and with -- with cory's body bein' in that condition, it just -- it just didn't make sense to me, said det. gibson.
a fresh look at the case
within six months after the mysterious death of his wife, cory, on valentine's day 2006, curtis lovelace rekindled his love life and began dating a student in a class he taught at quincy university. the woman, named erica, was eight years his junior. they married two years later, but she and his then-14-year-old daughter, lyndsay, didn't get along. lyndsay became estranged from her father.
lyndsay, apparently, didn't have a place in that family. why, i don't know, said steve belko.
lyndsay then moved out of her father's house and in with her grandmother marty didriksen, cory's mom.
curt chose his second wife over his daughter, said belko.
marriage number two fell apart in 2013.
but once again, curtis lovelace didn't stay single for long. he got married for a third time months after his divorce in 2013, this time to his current wife, christine, whom he had known in high school and reconnected with years later.
christine and curtis lovelace christine lovelace
he is a funny, charming, sweet, kind, compassionate, wonderful husband, she told 48 hours. we're actually best friends.
while the end of 2013 marked a new beginning for curtis and christine ...
we'd go on dates not typical of romantic date nights -- eat fried chicken, go across the bridge to missouri, have hot fudge sundaes with extra cherries, she said.
... it was around that same time that a newly-promoted detective at the quincy police department, adam gibson, took a fresh look at cory's death.
sometimes it takes fresh eyes to see things, said det. gibson.
and i was at the office ... just reading old case files, and the lovelace case popped into my head, he said.
the more det. gibson read about the 8-year-old case, the more he was intrigued.
what in that file made you say, 'huh, i'm gonna go find the pictures and the hard copy of this file? maureen maher asked the detective.
just the general description of the position of her hands, he replied.
and when you saw the pictures, what was your first reaction?
it did not appear to me that could've been a natural death, said det. gibson.
a drawing by artist bill beard of a graphic photo of cory lovelace
the pictures show cory's body in bed - lifeless, but with her arms bent at the elbows and bizarrely frozen in the air.
that didn't really make sense, and there was no real explanation for 'em, said det. gibson.
gibson consulted king county coroner james keller, who was the deputy coroner in 2006.
it bothered me for years, said keller.
so when you found out that detective gibson was moving forward, what was your reaction? maher asked.
i think it -- it is definitely time to open, keller replied.
detective gibson kept investigating the old case secretly, out of the public eye. he consulted the original pathologist, dr. jessica bowman, who had ruled the death undetermined. bowman told gibson she would no longer participate in the case, but sent him for another opinion to another pathologist she knew in chicago, dr. shaku teas.
she said basically that she saw nothing suspicious about the death, det. gibson said of dr. tea's ruling.
so why wasn't that the end of it for you? i mean, you have dr. bowman who says undetermined, you have now dr. shaku teas, who is accredited and is telling you, 'look it's undetermined, i don't see a problem with it,' maher asked the detective.
because i didn't believe that the information that dr. teas had given was credible to what i already knew, he replied.
so det. gibson sought yet another opinion. enter dr. jane turner, an assistant medical examiner in st. louis.
what do you remember as the first thing that struck you about that file? was there anything in there that you looked at and said, 'well, that's interesting,' maher asked dr. turner.
yes. it was the scene photographs ... the presence of rigor mortis and the position of the hands is unusual ... the hands weren't resting on a surface. they were almost suspended in air, which tells me that there was ... an object that had been there previously that had been removed, she replied.
could you show me, put ... my arms in the position that you saw cory lovelace's body in while she was laying down still in the bed? maher asked dr. turner.
so she was on her back. and her arms were like this. a little bit lower than that, she replied, positioning maher's arms, as shown in the photo above.
and-- if they were stuck in this position, they're in rigor-- what does that tell you at that point? maher asked.
well, that more time has passed than the witness stated, dr. turner replied.
the witness being curtis lovelace, who said he had talked to his wife less than an hour before finding her dead.
in my report, i stated 10 to 12 hours. rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. and with her arms in that position, which -- with the -- the emergency responders coming in, they were still in that position, suggests to me that she was in full rigor, said dr. turner.
based on the photos, the autopsy report and police reports, dr. turner pinpointed the cause of death: suffocation at the hands of another.
what did you determine would have caused the suffocation? maher asked.
well, with the position of the hands, it suggests that there was an object between her hands and her body. ...and it appears that there is a pillow missing, dr. turner replied. so i suppose that a pillow was used to suffocate her.
while det. gibson had a new timeline and a cause of death, he also had one big problem. remember, the three oldest lovelace children insisted they saw their mother alive that morning, sitting on the stairs.
the one thing i do know is, the science of cory lovelace doesn't match that story, said gibson.
gibson believes the children may have simply been mistaken. maybe that's because they weren't interviewed by the original detective, jeff baird, until two days after their mother's death. but if curtis lovelace did kill his wife the night before, as dr. turner believes, what was his motive?
was there a life insurance policy, maher ask gough.
...he said there was no life insurance, he replied.
i have not heard that, said gough.
so what's the motive? what does he gain? maher asked.
...he told one of the witnesses that their last 90 days of their marriage hadn't been good, gough replied.
people fight and argue all the time, maher noted to det. gibson.
how did it lead to murder in this situation? maher asked.
that's the million-dollar question, det. gibson replied.
a new detective ... found a doctor to give him the answer he was looking for. there's not one bit of evidence ... that cory ... was murdered, said christine lovelace.
how certain are you now that curtis lovelace murdered his wife, cory?
i'm 100 percent certain. the science tells me that, said det. gibson.
in august 2014, eight years after the death of cory lovelace, curtis lovelace was leaving his law office at lunchtime when police confronted him - and arrested him for his wife's murder.
nobody had any idea that this was, this was happening. none of the local media, said khqa reporter jenny dreasler.
the same day as a grand jury indictment comes down, he's arrested in broad daylight, cuffed and stuffed right outside his law office and taken down to booking, said local journalist bob gough.
a good friend who works for a news station in quincy, he texted me ... said 'christine, curt's been arrested for cory's murder,' christine lovelace told 48 hours. i said,'that makes no sense, cory was not murdered.'
there was nothing to prepare us for this, it was probably worst day of my life, she said.
the former golden boy would spend the next 17 months in jail, held on $5 million bond.
i was a little stunned, friend steve belko said. he looked old, haggard. something i'd never seen before.
curtis lovelace pleaded not guilty, awaiting his trial until just over three weeks ago.
a decade after cory lovelace's death, the murder trial of her husband was about to begin at the adams county courthouse. after hearing all the evidence, it may come down to just one question for the jury: do they believe cory's children, who say they saw their mother alive that morning? or do they believe two medical examiners who insist the science says she was killed the night before?
some of the jurors who would decide curtis' fate spoke with 48 hours.
and by show of hands, how many of you knew curtis lovelace and his family or knew of them prior to this? maher asked the group. four of the six jurors raised their hands. ok, so a majority of who are here.
is it the trial of century in quincy? maher asked gough. yes, he replied.
and why is that, just because of who he is?
yes. absolutely, gough replied. i mean, bigger they come, the harder they fall.
quincy was consumed with this trial on social media and in the coffee shops.
i don' think the case should've been brought to start with ... all they got is circumstantial evidence, no smoking guns, a resident told 48 hours.
the prosecution laid out its dramatic case -- that curtis lovelace smothered his wife, cory, the mother of his four children, with a pillow the night before valentine's day.
jurors heard from world-renowned pathologist dr. michael baden and dr. jane turner. they both testified that cory had to have died the night before.
it's the whole picture -- she had drying artifact of her lips. she had drying artifact of her eyes. again, something that develops with the passage of time after death, dr. turner told maher. rigor mortis develops maximally at 12 hours. and with her arms in that position ... suggests to me that she was in full rigor.
the prosecution uses dr. turner to explain how a cut found during the autopsy on cory's lip was caused by her being suffocated.
there's a bruise on the inside of the lip and -- and with it a laceration. and that's from blunt force trauma. so some forceful pressure was applied to the mouth, she explained.
but then, in this battle of the experts, the defense counters with their own, dr. george nichols. he says cory most likely died of causes related to an enlarged liver due to drinking and her bulimia.
i think she died as a result of natural diseases related to her liver disease. but the corroborative tests to confirm that were not performed, so i cannot come to that conclusion scientifically, said dr. nichols.
my opinion is, there's no proof that this woman was murdered, he said.
and as to dr. turner's claim that the degree of rigor mortis shows she had to be dead 10 to 12 hours?
as i said repeatedly in there, rigor mortis does not occur at a specific, fixed time. there's huge variability from person to person, dr. nichols stated.
further, he said, dr. turner was only working from photos -- she never actually saw cory's body in person.
and as to that single cut on cory's lip? nonsense, says dr. nichols.
that's eliminated, because she does not have sufficient injuries to the inner surface of her lips, he told 48 hours.
but she did have that one injury, a 48 hours producer pointed out.
one. not multiple. how many teeth do i have? dr. nichols said, showing his teeth. ok? each of those is capable of making at least one, if not more, injuries to the inside of my lips as i'm fighting back against someone who's holding a pillow over me.
if the testimony of the dueling pathologists had jurors scratching their heads, it was in stark contrast to the testimony of the lovelace boys, which clearly pulled at their hearts.
the kids will be in my mind probably forever, said juror theresa tarr.
the prosecution called the youngest son, larson, who was 4 years old at the time of his mother's death, who recounts his story about poking mommy to wake her up. juror theresa tarr was struck by the image.
it was an emotional testimony, she said. thinking that a four-year-old mighta been pokin' his dead mom, it was very emotional.
my children have dealt with enough pain in their life for them to feel any kind of pain, an emotional christine lovelace said.
then, the defense called the two older sons, logan, now 18, and dressed in his military uniform, and lincoln, now 17. a normally stoic curtis breaks down when each of the two older boys takes the stand, recounting how curtis came to school that day to tell them their mother had died.
news report: this is the first day we saw any real emotion out of curtis lovelace as he broke down in tears as his two oldest sons took the stand.
both boys emphatically tell the court, they are 100 percent certain they saw their mother alive that morning. logan said he even remembers asking his ailing mom if he could stay home from school to take care of her.
there are people who have accused the kids of lying, that's not who the kids are, christine lovelace said. kids will share experiences as they know them, not what they're told to.
and then came lyndsay, the final key testimony for the prosecution. she was 12 at the time her mother died, and now she's the star witness at her father's trial.
so how important is lyndsay's testimony? maher asked gough.
oh, it's critical. it's the whole ballgame, he replied.
up until this trial, lyndsay had always insisted she saw her mother alive that morning. but now, at age 22, and under oath in the courtroom, she says can't be sure about what she remembers from that day.
and i've had a long time to think about that and it's almost frustrating not to remember, because you want to, she said in an interview with dreasler.
and yet, immediately afterwards, defense attorneys show a videotape made just two years earlier, where lyndsay tells det. adam gibson she absolutely remembers seeing her mom alive that morning.
in the end, if you can't, you can't remember, she said. ...and just say, 'i'm sorry. it was 10 years ago i can't remember.'
were you surprised by lyndsay's testimony when she got up and said, now i don't remember. i can't definitively say anything? maher asked det. gibson.
yeah. you never know what anybody is gonna say, he replied.
lyndsay changing her story, the testimony of her brothers, and the dueling medical experts -- it all had the jurors heads spinning.
she didn't remember, and that, to me, was very hard. because two years earlier, she had given a statement to adam gibson, that she remembered a lot, said jury foreperson adam buss.
in the course of deliberations, i changed my mind, said juror mike hayden.
you answer one question. but it spawns another question, maher noted.
on feb. 4 2016, closing arguments begin. curtis lovelace, who has prosecuted cases in this very courthouse, walked in for the conclusion of his own murder trial. his new wife, christine, says the trial has taken a toll -- especially on curtis' sons.
we know that everyday the focus is bringing their father and my husband home, she said. it's so cumbersome to be raising a family while we're still doing all that we're doing. we're managing, it's difficult but we're managing.
for det. adam gibson, who started it all, the stakes couldn't be any higher.
i want people to remember cory outta all this ... she deserves to have her day just like everybody else, he told maher. the jury will decide if somebody took that life from her.
and you'll live with the decision, whatever it is? maher asked.
whatever it is, det. gibson replied.
but that decision may not be so easy.
the length of time that it takes for rigor mortis to set in, i think i've heard it a half a dozen different ways, so i'm not sure. and if i'm not sure, i'm not sure a jury member is sure, gough pointed out.
how many of you thought it boiled down to you either believed the kids, or you believed the science? maher asked the group of jurors. all six raised their hands.
going back on the hands thing, that was the most debated thing in that deliberation room, as far as i'm concerned, juror adam buss said. i mean, we had jury members on the floor, you know, just - 'how do we lay? how you know, do we hold the covers?'
jury members got on the floor -- put themselves in this position like this. to try and figure it out, maher commented.
and did that help? did the show-and-tell of it help you?
it did. but it--it almost left more questions than answers, he said.
meanwhile across town, lyndsay lovelace -- estranged from her father, stepmother and brothers -- awaited the verdict from the comfort of the home she shares with her grandmother.
yeah, we need a verdict. we need some kind of closure -- some kind, said steve belko.
and hopefully the boys, the family, the grandparents--that everybody can get back together again someday down in the future, said beth dobrzynski.
if found guilty, curtis lovelace could spend the rest of his life behind bars.
i haven't gotten a lot of sleep in the last year-and-a-half. every minute is spent thinking about what we could we be doing ... with the goal of bringing curtis home and proving his innocence, said christine lovelace.
after 16 1/2 hours of jury deliberations over two days, lyndsay received that much anticipated call.
breaking news here inside the adams county courthouse. judge hardwick did just now declare a mistrial, jenny dreasler reported.curtis' current wife could be seen sobbing ... the three lovelace boys all holding hands before that verdict was reached.
it was unreal and ... i felt so empty and out of breathe and the only thing i could do was hug my kids and let them know it is going to be ok and it is going to be ok, christine lovelace said of the jury's decision.
this is just dragging it out more. but if they're hung, they're hung. and there's nothing we can do about it. we just wait for the next round, lyndsay said of the outcome.
it's set for retrial. and we plan to retry it, said prosecutor ed parkinson.
if there's no new evidence, how do you paint it in a different light and not put yourself in a position of a hung jury again? maher asked.
maybe not paint in a different light. might paint it in the same light and with a different jury, he replied.
but this jury fought until the end.
did it ever become contentious? maher asked the six jurors.
it did. i think, probably five of the jurors said, 'there is no way anybody is ever gonna change my mind.' and two of those, i think, were for guilty, three for not guilty, juror mike hayden said. and that just deflated me so much.
joyce ... you believe he did it? maher asked.
i believe he did it, said stevens.
he's not guilty. and they didn't prove it to me, said tarr.
i had a feeling, after that first day, we weren't gonna come to a unanimous decision, said stevens.
it was pretty -- it was pretty obvious, stevens affirmed.
steve, do you think that curt killed cory? maher asked steve belko.
i don't know. i don't wanna believe it. because everything i know about curt, he could not have done it. and -- i don't even know if it would've been done in a crime of passion, he replied. i think of cory on that. because i know cory is -- is one tough cookie. she'd have fought to the death to defend her children.
i don't hear anyone in this little triad saying, 'no way, no how, he didn't do it,' maher said to the lovelace's friends. there's nobody here pounding their fists saying, 'my friend didn't do it.'
i wouldn't go that far. i'm not entirely sure, said belko.
i wouldn't go that far, either, said beth dobrzynski.
it's definitely put a huge question in my mind. was there something-- some reason she died other than natural causes, said bret schrader.
as the entire town awaits this new trial, speculation and gossip continue.
the question everyone has: what does the future hold for curtis lovelace?
how does he get his life back ... in his hometown? said gough.
because in the court of public opinion, you think people will always feel like he did something, said maher.
yeah. yeah. and again when this ends ... i just don't see how he's gonna be given the benefit of the doubt, said gough.
christine lovelace says she will never stop fighting to clear her husband's name.
there's nobody guilty for this crime because there was no crime committed, she said. we will not allow him to sit in that jail cell for one day longer than he has to.
...whatever it takes to make sure my husband is exonerated and the truth is known and that he comes home. that's what matters, she continued.
with curtis' fate in limbo, lyndsay lovelace and her grandmother, marty didriksen, continue to try to move forward while keeping the focus on the cherished life they lost.
you don't want to lose sight of cory. she died too young. she left children. there's a family here. i mean, lindsey and her brothers. so try to put that back together if we can and move forward, she said.
i just want everyone to find happiness again. and be able to remember the good times rather than the bad times, said lyndsay.
she was an amazing woman ... she loved with the biggest heart. she had a beautiful personality, lyndsay said of her mother. she touched so many people and that's who she needs to be remembered as.
curtis lovelace's new trial date is scheduled for may 31.
his bail was set at $5 million. he remains in jail.
san juan, puerto rico — as puerto rico faces a wave of violent crime, law enforcement union leaders on the island are demanding that gov. ricardo rosselló fire public safety secretary héctor pesquera.
if the governor does not take the decision that the people want, he will be completely responsible for the misfortunes, killings and bloodshed in our island, police union representative sgt. gregorio matías told cbs news.
matías and other puerto rican law enforcement union leaders traveled to the capitol in san juan on wednesday to call for pesquera's ouster. matías called pesquera an incompetent leader and accused him of demoralizing puerto rico's law enforcement agencies during an already trying time.
the puerto rico department of public safety oversees the island's police departments, firefighters, forensics institute, medical corps, and emergency and disaster management units, as well as the local investigations bureau. its secretary serves at the discretion of the governor.
a spokesperson for the governor's office didn't respond to cbs news' requests for comment, and pesquera canceled an interview with cbs news that was scheduled for wednesday.
over the past weeks, mounting crime and gang violence — including murders captured on camera in broad daylight — have beset puerto rico, which is still recovering from the devastation of two powerful hurricanes and reeling from years of economic instability.
douglas leff, the top fbi official in puerto rico, told cbs news the island is facing a crisis of violence fueled by drug trafficking and gang turf wars.
one san juan resident said he has noticed a change when it comes to crime.
the pillos have no shame anymore, said josé pacheco, a car technician, referring to delinquents by a term used locally. they know there aren't many police officers around now. they no longer wait until it's dark to kill someone.
some residents have leveled heavy criticism against gov. rosselló's administration, saying it has not deployed enough police officers on the streets.
matías, who is still an active-duty officer, said the puerto rican police force has been decimated in the last couple of months as many officers have left to the mainland with their families to look for work with better pay and benefits.
because no one listens to their concerns, officers are resigning. approximately 1,200 officers left the force last year and are now working in the (mainland) u.s., matías said. there is no future for a police officer in puerto rico. they have no medical or retirement benefits.
the island's resident commissioner and non-voting member of congress jenniffer gonzález asked the homeland security and justice departments on wednesday to increase their law enforcement capabilities and personnel in puerto rico to address a sense of impunity and lawfulness among the approximately 3.2 million u.s. citizens in the territory.
safety should be the first priority, gonzález told cbs news. i mean, if you can't feel safe in your house, if you can't feel safe to go to work, i mean that puts a heavy burden on the economy of the island. that puts a heavy burden on the quality of life of all puerto ricans.

santa clarita, calif. -- a little girl is being taken from the only family she has known after a native american tribe won a long and bitter custody battle -- based on a law that few know about.
lexi's foster dad, rusty, sobs after she is driven away cbs news
it was a tearful scene outside the page family home in santa clarita, as their foster daughter -- 6-year-old lexi -- was taken away by state authorities.
earlier, a devastated rusty page acknowledged that he and his wife had lost a nearly four-year legal battle to adopt the little girl.
with very heavy hearts we're complying with the order.
lexi came to live with page and his wife when she was two, and they have been trying to adopt her ever since.
but lexi is part native american, and the indian child welfare act works to keep native american children with their tribal relatives.
lexi's foster father walks her out of their home as she is taken to live with relatives in utah cbs news
on monday, the pages learned lexi will be going to live with her extended family in utah.
it's like getting a phone call that your kid was hit by a car. how do you cope with that phone call, page asked.
page's neighbors have been camped out near his home since friday in support of the family, and hoping authorities will change their minds.
neighbors protest the decision to take lexi from her foster parents cbs news
court records show lexi's biological father has an extensive criminal record and her mother had a substance abuse problem. they lost custody of lexi when she was 17 months old.
the choctaw tribe agreed to let lexi stay with the pages until she could be re-united with relatives. the tribe's statement monday said the choctaw nation desires the best for this choctaw child.
whether it's a native american kid or not, have the same end goal -- which is to reunite a child with his or her biological relatives so they can be raised into the family they were born into, a lawyer for the tribe said.
the pages say they are the only family lexi knows. they told cbs news they plan to take the case to the california supreme court.
firefighter marc hadden was working with the medical unit when he helped deliver the baby girl who would grow into the blonde-haired, blue-eyed daughter he now knows as gracie.
it was a surprisingly slow day for one of the busiest fire stations in myrtle beach, south carolina on november 11, 2011. hadden had spent the day training and killing time cleaning engines.
when he finally sat down with his crew to eat dinner in the middle of his 24-hour shift, the phone rang — and he had to hop into an ambulance to make an emergency call. when he arrived on scene, he and his partner found a pregnant woman in labor. as soon as they helped her into the ambulance, she was ready to give birth.
grace hadden poses with her two big brothers. marc hadden
it was the first time hadden took charge during a delivery in his two decades of working.
i was tasked with everything to do with gracie, hadden told cbs news. i helped her take her first breath.
the team then called for backup and rushed to the hospital to drop off the mother and child. while filling out routine paperwork at the hospital, hadden overheard nurses say the new mom requested the baby girl be put up for adoption immediately.
throw my name in the hat if this baby's being put up for adoption, hadden said jokingly.
due to medical complications, hadden and his wife, rebecca, weren't able to have any more children after they had their second son.
we checked into adopting, but it was way too expensive, hadden. we prayed about it.
marc hadden poses with his newborn daughter, gracie, shortly after her adoption.
the nurses turned to hadden and said, you need to go talk to this mom.
hesitantly, hadden walked into the woman's hospital room to introduce himself. he explained that he has two kids, his wife's a school teacher and they want to have more children, but aren't able to. after a friendly chat, hadden swung by the nursery and sent his wife a picture of the smiley little girl.
she jokingly texted back, can we keep her?
firefighter marc hadden shares a photo of his adopted daughter, gracie, when she was a baby. marc hadden
hadden knew his wife wasn't joking either.
exhausted, hadden headed home to talk to his wife in person. they both agreed, it was worth trying. what did they have to lose?
the next day, rebecca visited the woman in the hospital.
with both of our boys, we had families, support and a ton of stuff, hadden said. this mom didn't. she had nothing. no family that was there.
as rebecca started to walk out of the hospital, a doctor stopped her in the hallway and said, she's ready to go forward with the adoption.
forty-eight hours later, the haddens had their little girl, and in march 2012 the closed adoption that the girl's birth mom requested was complete.
it was meant to be, hadden said. everything that happened that day changed: my station, assignment, the location. so many things happened that made us 100 percent sure.
our bond is extremely tight, says marc hadden of his 5-year-old daughter, gracie. marc hadden
the family named their baby girl rebecca grace hadden; she goes by gracie.
the name grace over the years has become extremely fitting for her, hadden said of the now 5-year-old. she's an awesome kid.
the 5-year-old girl loves playing with her brothers and dressing up with her mom, but she especially loves hearing the story of how her daddy delivered her in the back of an ambulance.
our bond is extremely tight. she's a part of the family, and we love her more than life, hadden said. we wouldn't change anything. we would do it all again if we could.
if you're looking for clues to the next big thing in social media, keep an eye on the realm of dark social.
what's that, you may ask? the term first emerged in 2012, coined by the atlantic writer alexis c. madrigal. it refers to social content that is shared through private channels, rather than more public forums like facebook where posts can be seen and shared openly by a wide circle of people. think e-mail communications or chats on messaging apps like kik or snapchat. as a result of being shared through private channels, this content often exists beyond the reach of standard analytic tools and metrics that companies use to assess how content is shared and where it is being shared from.
the term dark social certainly gives people pause when they first hear it. it sounds a lot like the dark web, conjuring headlines of hackers, cyberterrorism, and illicit online content. but greg swan, vp of public relations and emerging media at the digital advertising agency space150, said that rather than something sinister, it simply refers to personal communication that is happening below the radar.
to best explain it, swan used the example of a grandmother copying and pasting a link and sending it to her grandson. it's a popular news story that's been trending, but the original site that housed the content has no idea that the traffic generated from that simple share stemmed from grandma's original email. her grandson can tweet out the story, which gets re-tweeted by 10,000 people who then click on it. it starts a domino effect with an untraceable chain, which carries with it implications for how brands and organizations need to better assess their analytics and how they're reaching users.
at the south by southwest (sxsw) interactive festival, swan and his colleague marc jensen gave a talk entitled deep web and dark social: is anything really private, exploring the state of how we communicate today, what it means for personal privacy, and how shifts in messaging technology are shaping the media we consume and the brands and businesses we follow.
people want to connect with each other, and people will give up certain private information in exchange for value in how they communicate, swan told cbs news. if you believe that, then it is easier to understand when the next thing comes out whether it will have longevity or not.
in social media, trends change rapidly. last week's snapchat could be this week's yik yak. what is consistent is the shift toward personal, private communications through larger social channels. for instance, members of generation z -- the group younger than millennials, born in 1996 or later -- have gravitated away from the very public forums presented by social networks like facebook and twitter and toward messaging apps that are immediate, visual, impermanent, and most crucially private. it is a more intimate take on the kind of social media interaction that exploded in popularity over the past decade.
with a rise in this messaging culture, dark social becomes increasingly significant.
it literally gives them exactly what they want. all of these apps are driving communication that is really instant, jensen, the chief technology officer for space150, told cbs news. i mean snapchat, the interface is really hard for a lot of people to understand, but even with that, you turn it on and the camera is is running right away. it's there immediately for people.
jensen asserted that this kind of quick, immediate, yet private communication emphasizes the visual over the textual. he said that we are moving increasingly toward chats that skip text completely. if you're having a bad day, sending a selfie with a sad facial expression communicates the idea in a snap.
with this kind of messaging, a picture is literally worth a thousand words, jensen said.
among users who are flocking to this kind of mobile communication, how big a concern is privacy and security?
swan said that basing an opinion solely on the sxsw crowd might be skewed given the fact that he and jensen addressed an audience of pretty well-educated people well-versed in the intersection of privacy and technology. that being said, he stressed that there is a legitimate education gap between the latest technologies and their privacy policies and people taking responsibility for their own security.
ultimately, it is up to you to control your privacy, assuming that you have the tools to control your privacy, swan said.
jensen agreed, adding that it is key that users understand exactly how they can create safeguards to protect their data. he added that an emerging arena for privacy debates could revolve around the rise of voice-recognition devices and internet of things-connected smart home devices that don't necessarily have screens and keyboards.
when you have a device that is essentially always listening, it will be interesting to see how companies tackle that idea of a user being recorded at all times. some companies are very transparent about this, jensen said.
at the end of the day, it falls on the individual to protect him or herself, jensen added.
concerns over people hacking your laptop web camera or looking into your records is not a reason to fear all web cams or be angry at apple, he said. it's up to you to do the research, read the fine print, and stay vigilant.
hope solo made a name for herself as one of the most accomplished soccer goalkeepers in the world. she helped the u.s. women's team win the 2015 world cup, played on three consecutive olympic teams and set records for the longest undefeated streak by a goalkeeper.
but she's also made headlines for what happened off the field. in her years on the u.s. national team, solo spoke out about coaching decisions, was suspended for 30 days, and encouraged teammates to join her in a federal complaint alleging wage discrimination.
her time with the team came to an explosive end in 2016 when the united states soccer federation terminated her contract for negative comments she made about an opposing team at the rio olympics. now, solo has launched a bid to lead the same organization that axed her.
solo joined cbs this morning to discuss what kind of change she'd like to bring to the organization as president.
for 20 years during my career i fought for change within the system. i fought for gender equity, i fought against injustices, and we weren't really getting anywhere. so this became kind of a natural step for me to really, really continue that fight, to run for president and to really get inside the organization and force this change that we've been fighting for 20 years to do, solo said.
she said her platform would focus most importantly on developing youth.
u.s. soccer has $150 million in surplus funds and they don't put it back to the youth in america, and so it's really become this sport here in america that's dedicated to the rich white kid and we are excluding so many potential great youth players, solo said. u.s. soccer's mission statement is to make soccer the preeminent sport here in the united states. we can't do that unless we make it accessible and affordable for every young kid in america.
according to solo, the costs for young kids participating in sports continue to grow.
it costs anywhere between $5,000 to $11,000 per year for a young kid in travel expenses, just for registration fees. and most kids can't afford it anymore, she said.
even with her controversial history, solo said she does have support within the federation.
it's not just the board members at u.s. soccer. it's not just, you know, the current leadership within the federation. soccer is important to a lot of people and a lot of people have voting rights to this election, she said.
given her past, some say she may be a great athlete but that she's not the best role model.
i've been through things off the field but it's only made me a better leader and a better person. i'm done apologizing for them. i've learned from them and i think it's important that we all do the same, she said.
despite a federal complaint about wage discrimination, solo said the women's soccer team has still not achieved equal pay.
unfortunately, the federation tries to convolute it to the general public by saying, well, it's equitable. but what's equitable mean? that's the same thing as equal. really, we're still not there yet. that's another part of my platform, gender equality, she said.
new york - u.s. stocks traded higher tuesday as industrial and internet companies rose, and the major stock indexes notched their first three-day winning streak since november.
even though the latest round of trade talks between the u.s. and china ended without word of progress, investors were heartened that there were no evident signs of setbacks either.
talks with china are going very well! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 8, 2019
the s&p 500 index rose 25 points, or 1 percent, to close at 2,574. the dow jones industrials picked up 256 points, or 1.1 percent, ending at 23,787. early in tuesday's trading, the dow jumped as much as 333 points.
the nasdaq composite gained 74 points, or 1.1 percent, to finish at 6,897. the russell 2000 index of smaller-company stocks added 19 points, or 1.4 percent, closing at 1,425.
railroad operator union pacific jumped 8.8 percent to close at $150.75 after it named an industry veteran to a top executive position. autonation fell 3.9 to $36.18 after predicting a weak year for auto sales.
there was no evidence tuesday that the u.s. and china made significant progress in their latest round of trade talks, and experts say it will take months for them to resolve the causes of the trade war, which include disagreements over beijing's handling of technology and intellectual property.
but investors have become notably more optimistic about an eventual deal, a sharp reversal of the concerns that helped send stocks plunging in october and december. an agreement between the two biggest economic powers in the world could remove a major obstacle to global economic growth.
kate warne, an investment strategist for edward jones, said the market's large moves reflect investors' questions about major issues including economic growth, the threats of recession and trade tensions, and rising interest rates. she said it's normal for stocks to change course as traders grapple with those issues on a day-to-day basis.
you have new information that's driving stock prices both higher and lower, and that's pretty typical when there's uncertainty and there's a lot of new information coming into the market, she said.
warne added that trading on wall street is typically light during the holidays, and that can exaggerate market moves up or down.
wells fargo investment institute expects the u.s.-china trade talks will continue to be a focus for investors. since formal talks have only just begun, we expect this trade-related narrative to remain with the markets for some time, the firm said in a report. that said, we expect risks related to tariff escalation to remain contained so long as talks remain productive and progressive.
oil prices also continued to rally. u.s. crude was on track to rise for the eighth day in the last nine and jumped 2.3 percent to $49.71 per barrel in new york. brent crude, used to price international oils, was up 1.7 percent to $58.33 a barrel in london.
u.s. crude dropped from $76 a barrel in early october to about $42 a barrel on dec. 24 as investors worried about slowing economic growth and a supply glut. the modest recovery in oil prices has helped energy company stocks after they took big losses at the end of 2018.
south korean smartphone and computer chip maker samsung said demand for chips is weak because the global economy is slowing. the company expects its fourth-quarter sales to drop 11 percent compared to a year ago and said its operating profit will fall as well. samsung also said its phones are facing stiffer competition, and its stock fell 1.7 percent in seoul.
u.s. chipmakers, nvidia and applied materials also fell.
tech stocks were roiled on thursday after apple said iphone sales in china were falling.
bond prices fell and yields rose, a sign investors expect continued economic growth and higher interest rates. the yield on the 10-year treasury note rose to 2.71 percent from 2.65 percent late monday.
higher interest rates allow banks to make bigger profits on lending, but despite the increase tuesday, banks stocks declined. investors may have been preparing for future disappointment: analysts for goldman sachs lowered their forecasts for bond yields around the world because of weakening economic growth and tightening financial conditions. the yield on the 10-year treasury note has fallen sharply since october, when it reached a seven-year high, and the report said yields may have peaked for this [economic] cycle.
an artwork called mcjesus, which was sculpted by finnish artist jani leinonen and depicts a crucified ronald mcdonald, is seen on display as part of the haifa museum's sacred goods exhibit, in haifa, israel, jan. 14, 2019. ap
haifa, israel -- an art exhibit in israel featuring a crucified ronald mcdonald has sparked protests by the country's arab christian minority.
hundreds of christians calling for the removal of the sculpture, entitled mcjesus, demonstrated at the museum in the northern city of haifa last week. israeli police say rioters hurled a firebomb at the museum and threw stones that wounded three police officers. authorities dispersed the crowds with tear gas and stun grenades.
church representatives brought their grievances to the district court monday, demanding it order the removal of the exhibit's most offensive items, including barbie doll renditions of a bloodied jesus and the virgin mary.
museum director nissim tal said that he was shocked at the sudden uproar, especially because the exhibit - intended to criticize what many view as society's cult-like worship of capitalism - had been on display for months. it has also been shown in other countries without incident.
the protests appear to have been sparked by visitors sharing photos of the exhibit on social media.
christians make up a tiny percentage of israel's arab minority and say they face unique challenges.
we need to understand that freedom of expression is interpreted in different ways in different societies, said wadie abu nassar, an adviser to church leaders. if this work was directed against non-christians, the world would be turned upside down.
israeli culture minister miri regev, who has been accused of censorship for pushing legislation mandating national loyalty in art, also called for the removal of the disrespectful artwork.
the museum has refused to remove the artwork, saying that doing so would infringe on freedom of expression. but following the protests it hung a curtain over the entrance to the exhibit and posted a sign saying the art was not intended to offend.
this is the maximum that we can do, tal said. if we take the art down, the next day we'll have politicians demanding we take other things down and we'll end up only with colorful pictures of flowers in the museum.
but that did little to placate those who want the artwork removed. a protester remained camped out in a tent at the museum on monday with a sign reading respect religions. police watched closely as local christians complained to reporters in front of street signs spray-painted with crosses and windows still shattered from last week's clashes.
this is very offensive and i cannot consider this art, haifa artist and devout christian amir ballan said. we will continue through peaceful rallies and candle vigils... we won't be quiet until we reach a solution.
jani leinonen, the finnish artist behind mcjesus, has also asked that it be taken down - but for a different reason.
he says he supports boycott, divestment, sanctions, or bds, a palestinian-led movement aimed at pressuring israel to change its policies toward the palestinians. the group has made significant gains in recent years, persuading a number of foreign artists to cancel performances in israel.
tal said the museum won't bow to religious or political pressure.
we will be defending freedom of speech, freedom of art, and freedom of culture, and will not take it down, he said.
with only a few days left in president trump's term, congressional democrats are calling on vice president mike pence to invoke the 25th amendment to remove mr. trump from office. now, mary trump, the president's niece, says that mr. trump must be held accountable for wednesday's capitol assault and barred from ever running for public office again.
in an interview on cbsn's red & blue, trump told host elaine quijano that the riot on capitol hill was a direct result of [the president's] unwillingness to concede the election. his insistence that it was stolen or rigged.
and it was also the direct result of the abject cowardice shown by his own party, and its failure to stand up to his egregious lies around this election, she said.
trump said that, while she was not surprised by the violent events of january 6, she was still horrified.
trump, a psychologist who authored the book too much and never enough: how my family created the most dangerous man in the world, explains that mr. trump's response to his electoral defeat comes from the stigma their family placed on losing.
losing was literally the worst thing you can do, she said. so, for the first time in his life, donald finds himself in a situation in which, not just that he's lost, but he cannot for the life of him figure out a way to turn the loss into a win — something he's always been able to do in the past because he's perfectly happy to lie, cheat and steal his way to a win.
trump says this is making her uncle increasingly desperate and dangerous, in my view.
trump also criticized the republican party for not doing enough to hold the president accountable. she said that their refusal to take action after the violent insurrection has left mr. trump feeling enabled to do whatever he feels he needs to do in order to stay in the oval office.
the president and vice president met for the first time on monday since the riots, but mr. trump never contacted pence during the siege of the capitol to check on his safety. trump said this did not surprise her.
it doesn't matter that mike pence was fulfilling his constitutional duty, she explained. it matters, in donald's mind, that mike pence betrayed him. it shouldn't surprise mike pence, either. he's seen what happens to people who don't toe the line 100% of the time.
trump said she was not surprised to learn mr. trump would not be attending president-elect joe biden's inauguration, either. she said attending would mean ceding the spotlight to mr. biden, and it would also amount to a concession.
one thing we need to remember, despite all these videos ... he has not yet conceded the election, trump said. so he's still clinging to the idea that he can change that result somehow.
she concluded by saying that mr. trump must be barred from ever running for public office again.
because if he is allowed to, then as soon as joe biden is sworn in, donald is going to start his 2024 campaign, trump said. i don't believe he intends to run, but he's going to pretend to run and he will continue to have way too big a platform from which to continue to incite his supporters.
for our series three meals, major garrett traveled to three cities in texas to talk to voters over breakfast, lunch and dinner.
in texas, impeachment came up frequently; overall, most voters were fatigued by it all. but those paying close attention defied party stereotypes.
at the avalon diner in stafford, texas, jeannine benoit said she supported president trump; her husband, scott, did not vote for mr. trump in 2016, but will this year. cbs news
garrett started in a diverse area outside of houston with eggs, hash browns and pancakes at the avalon diner in stafford.
the economy is going really well, said dentist scott benoit. i think overall we're safe as a country. everything's going pretty well.
the now hiring sign outside backs that up; the avalon's owner told us she's lost workers to better jobs elsewhere.
benoit did not vote for mr. trump in 2016, but will this year. his wife jeannine, a speech therapist, was with the president from the beginning. i just have more conservative values, so i tend to go more with that person, she said.
just across from scott and jeannine, garrett met bernard and sharon maynore. both work in health care. bernard said, i feel mystified when i'm listening to what donald trump has to say.
garrett asked, how frequently now, or during the trump presidency, have you found yourself shaking your head?
every day, sharon replied.  my co-workers said that we needed a change, they wanted to make america great again. i'm wondering, do those same people, do they think that he has made american great again?
at mac's bar-b-q in midland, alison loera and laura ortega discussed president trump's divisive rhetoric. cbs news
then it was on to lunch in conservative midland, a boom town in west texas, where oil and natural gas production runs around the clock.
at mac's bar-b-q, a local favorite, the brisket is slow-cooked out back for 18 hours. customers start arriving for lunch around 11.
kyle davis, his brother jake, and their business partner tom hull run a construction and drilling company. kyle and jake support president trump and expect him to be re-elected.
i don't like all the nonsense that comes with him, kyle said. but yeah, his policy has been spot-on.
jake added, i really don't want another obama. i kind of feel like he divided our country.
garrett asked both about impeachment. kyle's answer surprised him: was it an impeachable offense? yeah, it sounds like it probably was, he said.
jake took the long view: i'm sure at some point every president could have been impeached.
tom hull calls himself a new england republican and considers mr. trump a failure. the economy's been propped up with record levels of deficit spending, he said. and he picks fights that he doesn't know how to get out of.
garrett also met alison loera, laura ortega and jennifer reyes. loera works in insurance; ortega and reyes are data specialists for drilling companies.
they criticized the president for his comments about the hispanic community. loera said, we feel targeted.
garrett asked, do you feel lumped in or somehow demonized?
in a way, i guess, loera replied.
reyes said, comments like that shouldn't be made by someone with that much power and authority.
blake hammerton and daniel torres discuss the 2020 campaign with cbs news chief washington correspondent major garrett, at the flying saucer pub in garland, texas. cbs news
dinner took garrett to the flying saucer pub in garland, a politically-moderate area northeast of dallas.
i voted for trump, said rita dusek. i did, because i thought we need somebody who's not a politician. but that didn't seem to work out, she laughed.
garrett asked, will you vote for him again?
her husband, al, a registered republican, said, i did not vote for him. i don't like extremism on either side.
just across the way garrett met david lindsay, who owns a construction firm. the economy has probably been the best since i've owned the company, he said.
do you give anyone in the political world credit for that? asked garrett.
i will solidly give the president credit for doing it, said lindsey.
the president's volatile style was raised: do you ever wish he would tone it down? asked garrett.
oh, yeah, i think somebody should hide his cellphone on him, lindsey said.
blake hammerton and daniel torres both opposed mr. trump in 2016, and will vote in the march 3 texas democratic primary.
i have very, very strong feeling: the young vote will come out this year, torres said.
garrett asked, when you think about the democrats, what are your thoughts?
stop making everything a battle to the end, hammerton said. the democrats are exhausting themselves and exhausting the public.
sounds like they're exhausting you? yes! he said.
garrett said of his excursion that, among democrats, he did not find hard-core supporters of elizabeth warren, bernie sanders or joe biden. flat line across the board, texas democrats are waiting for iowa, new hampshire, south carolina and nevada to sort this out, he said. democrats said they were keeping an open mind for texas' 'super tuesday' primary.
one person they were keeping in mind, because he's on tv so frequently in texas, is mike bloomberg, he added, noting the billionaire's strategy of creating an impression with voters via paid ads while his opponents — fighting it out in iowa, new hampshire and elsewhere — have yet to make an impression in the lone star state.
garrett asked everyone if they had seen or remembered a bloomberg tv ad. all but two had. trump supporters said they thought bloomberg might give the president the toughest challenge.
one other thing: when we asked people what they thought about the november election, they said two words: anticipation, and dread.
other entries in our three meals series:
you know that universal sign we give truckers, hoping they'll sound their air horns? well, you're going to be hearing a lot less honking in the future. and with good reason. the absence of an actual driver in the cab. we may focus on the self-driving car, but autonomous trucking is not an if, it's a when. and the when is coming sooner than you might expect. already, companies have been quietly testing their prototypes on public roads. right now, there's a high-stakes, high-speed race pitting the usual suspects, google and tesla and other global tech firms, against small start-ups smelling opportunity. the driverless semi will convulse the trucking sector and the two million american drivers who turn a key and maneuver their big rig every day. and the winners of this derby, they may be poised to make untold billions, they'll change the u.s. transportation grid and they will emerge as the new kings of the road.
it's one of the great touchstones of americana: the romance and possibility of the open road. all hail the 18-wheeler hugging those asphalt ribbons, transporting all of our stuff across the fruited plains, from sea to shining sea. though we may not give it a second thought when we click that free shipping icon, truckers move 70% of the nation's goods. but trucking cut a considerably different figure on a humid sunday last summer on the florida turnpike. starsky robotics, a tech startup, may have been driving in the right lane, but they passed the competition with 35,000 pounds of steel thundering down a busy highway with nobody behind the wheel. the test was a milestone. starsky was the first company to put a truck on an open highway without a human on board. everyone else in the game with the know-how keeps a warm body in the cab as backup. for now, anyway. if you didn't hear about this, you're not alone; in jacksonville, we talked to jeff widdows, his son tanner, linda allen and eric richardson - all truckers; and all astonished to learn how far this technology has come.
linda allen: i wasn't aware 'til i ran across one on the florida turnpike and that just-- it just scares me. i can't imagine. but i didn't know anything about it.
jon wertheim: no one's talkin' about it at work.
eric richardson: i didn't know that it'd come so far. and i'm thinking, wow. it's here.
truckers speak with correspondent jon wertheim cbs news
he's right. the autonomous truck revolution is here. it just isn't much discussed - not on cb radios; and not in statehouses. and transportation agencies are not inclined to pump the brakes. from florida, hang a left and drive 2000 miles west on i-10 and you'll hit the proving grounds of a company with a fleet of 41 autonomous rigs.
jon wertheim: this is a shop floor? or this is a laboratory
in the guts of the sonoran desert, outside tucson, chuck price is chief product officer at tusimple, a privately held, global autonomous trucking outfit valued at more than a billion dollars with operations in the u.s. and china. at this depot, $12 million worth of gleaming self-driving semis are on the move.
jon wertheim: right now we've got safety operators in the cab. how far away are we from runs without drivers?
chuck price: we believe we'll be able to do our first driver-out demonstration runs on public highways in 2021.
that's the when. as for the how...
chuck price: our primary sensor system is our array of cameras that you see along the top of the vehicle--
jon wertheim: heard about souping up vehicles. this takes it to a new level.
chuck price: it's a little bit different… yeah.
the competition is fierce, so much so their technology is akin to a state secret. but price points us to a network of sensors, cameras and radar devices strapped to the outside of the rig, all of it hardwired to an internal ai supercomputer that drives the truck. it's self-contained — so a bad wifi signal won't wreak havoc on the road.
chuck price: our system can see farther than any other autonomous system in the world. we can see forward over a half mile.
jon wertheim: you can drive autonomously at night?
chuck price: we can. day, night. and in the rain. and in the rain at night.
chuck price shows correspondent jon wertheim the automated trucks. cbs news
and they're working on driving in the snow. chuck price has unshakable confidence in the reliability of the technology; as do some of the biggest names in shipping: ups, amazon and the u.s. postal service ship freight with tusimple trucks. all in, each unit costs more than a quarter million dollars. not a great expense, considering it's designed to eliminate the annual salary of a driver; currently around $45,000. another savings: the driverless truck can get coast-to-coast in two days, not four, stopping only to refuel—though a human still has to do that.
we wanted to hop in and experience automated trucking firsthand.
jon wertheim: i feel like it's our turn on space mountain.
chuck price was happy to oblige. we didn't know what to expect, so we fashioned more cameras to the rig than nasa glued to the apollo rockets...
maureen fitzgerald: is everybody buckled in?
we sat in the back alongside the computer. in the front seat: maureen fitzgerald, a trucker's trucker with 30 years experience. she was our safety driver, babysitting with no intention of gripping the wheel, but there just in case. riding shotgun: an engineer, john panttila, there to monitor the software. the driverless truck was attempting a 65-mile loop in weekday traffic through tucson.
maureen fitzgerald's foot while automated technology takes the wheel. cbs news
the route was mapped and programmed in before the run, but that's about it - the rest was up to the computer, which makes 20 decisions per second about what to do on the road. as we rolled past distracted drivers, disabled cars, slow-pokes and sheriffs, our safety driver kept vigil but never disengaged the driverless system.
john panttila: watching the front targets close in a hundred. yep. got to cut in right now. 55 mile an hour. bad cut-off.
jon wertheim: this guy just flagrantly cut off--
chuck price: he just really cut us off.
jon wertheim: we did not honk at him. did we disengage?
chuck price: we did not disengage. this vehicle will detect that kind of behavior faster than the humans.
jon wertheim: how far are we from being able to pick up the specific cars that are passing us? oh, that's joe from new jersey with six points on his license.
chuck price: we can read license plates. so if there was an accessible database for something like that, we could.
chuck price says that would be valuable to the company though he admits it could create obvious privacy issues. but tusimple does collect a lot of data, as it maps more and more routes across the southwest. their enterprise also includes a fleet of autonomous trucks in shanghai, as well as a research center in beijing. the data collected by every truck, along every mile, it's uploaded and used by tusimple, they say only to perfect performance on the road. maureen fitzgerald is convinced that tusimple's technology is superior to human drivers.
jon wertheim: you call these trucks your babies? what do your babies do well, and what could they do better?
maureen fitzgerald: this truck is scanning mirrors, looking 1,000 meters out. it's processing all the things that my brain could never do and it can react 15 times faster than i could.
most of her two million fellow truckers are less enthusiastic. automated trucking threatens to jack-knife an entire $800 billion industry. trucking is among the most common jobs for american's without a college education. so this disruption caused by the driverless truck, it cuts deep.
steve viscelli: as truckers like to say, if you bought it, a truck brought it.
steve viscelli is a sociologist at the university of pennsylvania and an expert in freight transportation and automation. he also spent six months driving a big rig.
jon wertheim: what segment do you think's gonna be hit first by driverless trucks?
steve viscelli: i've identified two segments that i think are most at-risk. and that's-- refrigerated and dry van truckload. and those constitute about 200,000 trucking jobs. and then what's called line haul and they're somewhere in the neighborhood of 80,000-90,000 jobs there.
jon wertheim: so you're talkin' 300,000 jobs off the top-- it's a big number.
steve viscelli: it is a big number.
the florida truckers we met represent 70 years experience and millions of safe driving miles. they say they love the job and when asked to describe their work they kick around words like vital, honest and patriotic.
eric richardson: it makes you feel like you could-- should just poke your chest out with the responsibility (laugh) that you're taking on kinda makes you feel like a-- like you're needed.
asked about driverless trucks, they feel like they are being run off the road. but another issue troubles them even more.
jeff widdows: i think that companies need to keep safety in mind… you have a glitch in a computer at that speed--
jeff widdows: (laugh) you can do some damage--
linda allen: there's too many things that can go wrong.
eric richardson: one of them semis hits something that's small, like a car or a passenger car, or anything like that, it's a done deal. i mean...
linda allen: i was on 75-- last month-- through ocala. and there was a bad accident so a state trooper came out. and he was hand-signaling people. you go here. you go there. how's an autonomous truck gonna recognize what the officer is trying to say or do? how's that gonna work?
jon wertheim: sympathy, empathy, fear, code, eye contact-- i don't know how you create an algorithm that accounts for all that.
jon wertheim: does the public have a right to know if they're testing driverless trucks on the interstate--
tanner widdows: that's-- well, that's our concern, is -- who's watching this? who's making sure they're not throwing something unsafe on the road?
sam loesche: i think a lot of it-- is being done with almost no oversight from-- good governance groups, from the government itself
sam loesche represents 600,000 truckers for the teamsters. he's concerned that federal, state and local governments have only limited access to the driverless technology.
sam loesche: a lot of this information, understandably, is proprietary. tech companies wanna keep, you know, their algorithms and their safety data-- secret until they can kinda get it right. the problem is that, in the meantime, they're testing this technology on public roads. they're testing it next to you as you drive down the road.
and that was consistent with our reporting.
jon wertheim: do you have to tell anyone when you test?
chuck price: no, not for individual tests.
jon wertheim: do you have to tell them where you test?
chuck price: we do not currently have to tell them where we test in arizona.
jon wertheim: or how-- how often you test?
jon wertheim: do you have to share your data with any state department of transportation?
chuck price: currently, we're not required to share data, we would be happy to share data.
jon wertheim: what about inspections? does anyone from the arizona dot come by and-- and check this stuff out?
chuck price: the dot comes by all the time. we talk with them regularly. it's not a formal inspection process yet.

we wanted to ask elaine chao, secretary of the department of transportation, about regulating this emerging sector. she declined an interview, but provided us with a statement which reads in part: the department needs to prepare for the transportation systems of the future by engaging with new technologies to address… safety… without hampering innovation.
to that point, chuck price is emphatic that driverless trucks pose fewer dangers.
chuck price: we eliminate texting accidents, no distraction--
jon wertheim: because there's no-- no texting while driving when there's a computer.
chuck price: there are no drunk computers. and the computer doesn't sleep. so those are large causes of accidents.
he adds that driverless trucks are more fuel efficient in part because they can stay perfectly aligned in their lane and unlike humans, are programmed never to speed, but he admits the profit motive is significant.
jon wertheim: you think there's a lot of money to be made here.
chuck price: there's certainly a lot of money to be made. there's a-- there's an opportunity to solve a very big problem.
steve viscelli says the industry may be imperfect, but he thinks the solution should not depend on driverless technology alone.
jon wertheim: what's your response to the technology companies that say, look, i'm trying to do something more efficiently, and i'm going to improve safety. this is american enterprise. what are you gonna get in the way of this for?
steve viscelli: i'd say that-- that's wonderful. (laugh) but that's not your job. right? your job's to make money. policy is gonna decide what our outcomes are gonna be trucking is a very competitive industry. the low-road approach often wins
jon wertheim: we talk about the internal combustion engine replacing the horse and buggy, and eisenhower's interstate system-- when we talk about these transformational markers in transportation-- where's driverless trucking gonna rank?
steve viscelli: it's gonna be one of the biggest.

six months after wdbj-tv correspondent alison parker and cameraman adam ward were gunned down on live television, parker's parents say they're on a mission to change gun laws, in an interview to be broadcast on cbs' sunday morning on march 13.
alison parker and adam ward cbs news
the interview is part of a special edition of sunday morning, titled guns and america, which looks at the role of firearms in the country from a variety of historical, cultural, political and personal points of view.
parker and ward were killed by a former coworker as they were reporting live on the morning news in roanoke, va., last august. the man who shot them had passed a background check and legally bought the gun he used to kill the two reporters and seriously wound another person, before taking his own life.
nonetheless, parker's parents, barbara and andy, have turned their grief into motivation to require tougher background checks for gun purchases, and to close loopholes in gun purchase requirements, in spite of strong lobbying by gun rights proponents (such as the nra) against such laws.
we're on a mission. i don't think it's quixotic, andy parker told correspondent erin moriarty. and i don't think we're going to fail.
we've seen this become a national conversation, added barbara parker. whereas, even a couple of years ago, no one would talk about it. but now people are all discussing it, and telling us, 'what you're doing is important.'
moriarty talks with the parkers about their lives after their daughter and ward were killed. moriarty also talks with chris hurst, parker's boyfriend and an anchor at wdbj-tv, a cbs affiliate.
hurst hadn't tuned in the morning news that day because, he explains, parker claimed she'd mess up if she knew he was watching. hurst added that he lost everything that day.
now, he watches the parkers honor their daughter's spirit by fighting for change. that fight, however, comes with risks, as they have become targets, he tells moriarty: but, we don't have any fear. we really feel like [alison]'s guiding us, and we're just following her lead.

a digital pioneer and philanthropist is trying to break the myths surrounding the road to success and changing the world. jean case, a former senior executive in the early days of aol and now the ceo of the case foundation, is out with a new book called be fearless: 5 principles for a life of breakthroughs and purpose.
everyone around the world, we found, has ideas about what they might do to change the world, but often they're stopped by the idea that maybe you need a special genius or wealth or certain connections or graduating from the right school, case said friday on cbs this morning. our research really uncovered that actually none of that is the case. and what i do in the book is i take readers behind the scene of famous success stories and not so famous success stories to point out that there's failures and fears along the way.
among the stories she shares is one of spanx founder and ceo sara blakely, who was wearing capri pants with sandals and wanted something with a slimming effect of pantyhose. she went on to create spanx and now has an estimated net worth of $1 billion, according to forbes.
she had no background in fashion. she didn't have an mba. she was selling fax machines at the time. but she took her idea forward sort of point by point. she went to neiman marcus and went in the dressing room and tried them on for someone and they made a big order, and then oprah chose her as one of her favorite things, case said.
among the other fearless leaders case profiles are chef josé andrés, airbnb co-founders brian chesky and joe gebbia, and equal justice initiative executive director bryan stevenson.
case also tells of her own story, jumping from a comfortable job at ge to a startup.
people thought i was crazy to leave what was really a good career trajectory at ge to take this big risk on a start-up. but actually i believed in my heart that i could achieve more of the goals i'd set out for myself and make a bigger difference in the world if i had done it, case said.
i was totally afraid to make the leap. what we talk about in the book or what i talk to readers about is getting outside of your comfort zone. it's so easy to get locked in a place where you're comfortable and everything's okay, but it's not really the life we aspire to. i like to say no things that are great come from the comfort zone. you have to get a little uncomfortable and push yourself.
she said she was totally afraid to make the leap, but she had to get outside her comfort zone.
i like to say no things that are great come from the comfort zone. you have to get a little uncomfortable and push yourself, case said.

the white house said thursday that they would declare a national emergency in order to fund a barrier along the southern border. but the move is almost certain to invite challenges.
president trump has long claimed that there is a crisis at the border due to the high number of people seeking to cross into the u.s. (though he does not differentiate between illegal immigrants and asylum seekers). and he has repeatedly threatened to bypass congress and use emergency funds to build a wall, which was one of his core campaign promises during the 2016 election.
amid urging from some congressional conservatives, the administration says it will move forward with an emergency declaration. the president is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country, white house press secretary sarah sanders said thursday.
what is the national emergencies act?
ironically, the national emergencies act of 1975 was intended to constrain the power of the presidency, to create a structure for the president to declare national emergencies in the post-watergate era. under that law, the president can declare a national emergency, but must outline the specific emergency powers he is using under existing statutes. so mr. trump would have to justify his actions using acts already passed by congress.
which statutes could mr. trump use to build the wall?
there are a few statutes which could allow the administration to use pentagon money to build the wall, once he declares a national emergency. one would allow the secretary of defense to undertake military construction projects which are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.
another statute allows the pentagon to apply the resources of the department of the army's civil works program, and to reprogram those resources to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense. despite its name, the army corps of engineers is made up almost entirely of civilians who administer construction contracts, so troops wouldn't actually be building the wall.
there are a couple of other smaller streams of money that would be available to the president, too, if he were to declare a national emergency. the defense secretary is permitted to undertake a military construction project if the project is vital to the national security, but only $50 million is allocated for that each year, far short of mr. trump's $5.7 billion request.
under the immigration and nationality act, the president can declare an immigration emergency, which is defined as when an actual or imminent influx of aliens which either is of such magnitude or exhibits such other characteristics that effective administration of the immigration laws of the united states is beyond the existing capabilities. a state attorney general can request the president's response to an immigration emergency and detail what is needed to address it. however, only $20 million is available under that statute.
could congress overturn the declaration of a national emergency?
congress can cancel a national emergency, but it would require a rare amount of bipartisanship. congress would have to approve a joint resolution disapproving the national emergency, which would easily pass the democratic-controlled house but could face opposition in the republican-majority senate. if both houses pass the joint resolution, it would require the president's signature, and mr. trump would be unlikely to sign a bill which overturns his own declaration.
congress would then have to pass the joint resolution with a veto-proof majority, meaning that two-thirds of both houses would have to approve the bill. some congressional republicans, such as sens. john cornyn and susan collins, have in recent weeks indicated that they do not support an emergency declaration.
some argue that legal precedent set by the 1953 supreme court case youngstown v. sawyer prevents the president from using this power. in that case, the court found that the attempted nationalization of steel mills by president harry truman using his commander-in-chief power was unconstitutional.
the decision imposed fundamental constitutional limits on the president's power to claim that a national emergency — in this case, the korean war — allowed him to override express provisions preventing him from using those powers domestically, said yale law professor bruce ackerman in an opinion piece in the new york times last week. democrats are also citing youngstown v. sawyer as evidence that mr. trump can't call a national emergency to build a border wall.
look, if harry truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion dollar wall on the border, rep. adam schiff, chairman of the house intelligence committee, told cnn sunday. so that's a non-starter.
ackerman also argued in his piece that calling a national emergency to build a wall would be illegal because of statutes saying that military forces could not be used for domestic purposes.
however heated the debate over guns and civilians, few question the importance of firepower for our armed forces. here's david martin:
there are gun lovers -- and then there are marines.
to a marine infantryman like sgt. joshua sherman, his weapon may mean the difference between success and failure, life and death.
our weapon system is basically your tool to keep yourself and your friends alive and then do the job at hand, he said.
marines refer to their rifle as she -- like a girlfriend.
when you push forward and you're actually in iraq, in afghanistan or wherever the marine corps might send you, that weapon never leaves your side, sgt. sherman said.
he's holding an m4, the newest rifle to be issued to marines. his battle buddy, corporal shamar methany, is carrying the older m16. the m4 has a slightly shorter range, but it's two pounds lighter.
two pounds is a lot when you're counting everything that you're trying to put on an infantry marine, sgt. sherman said.
the m4 is the latest rifle - shorter and lighter - to be issued to the corps. cbs news
the barrel of the m4 is also six inches shorter, which doesn't mean much out on the firing range, but could mean everything in urban combat.
if you're coming around a corner into a hallway, inches can mean a big difference when it's showing whether you're coming or not, he said.
all the rifles are becoming smaller and lighter, but col. roger turner -- the man in charge of developing new weapons for the marines -- says the addition of a telescopic scope is the biggest change. every rifle has one, not just sniper rifles, so that what would be considered a sniper-like effect can be achieved by this by every single marine, col. turner said.
the real snipers are creeping through the woods carrying a very different kind of weapon designed to pick off the enemy at long range. like the camouflage suit sgt. jacob ruiz is wearing, his rifle is custom-tailored.
i don't imagine there's anybody that has a closer relationship with his weapon than a sniper, martin said.
snipers definitely fire far more rounds with a lot more responsibility and understanding what that round is doing than any other formal infantry, sgt. ruiz replied.
as with the infantry rifles, the marines are switching to a smaller, lighter sniper rifle.
sgt. jarod chambers says he will miss his weapon (this is all i've known since i've came to this), but he can console himself with the fact the new model is four pounds lighter.
we have a thing over there: ounces equal pounds, and pounds equal pain, said sgt. chambers. so the less ounces you've got, the less pain you're going to have.
each rifle in a marine fire team has a different purpose. the snipers are usually first to fire, trying to pick off high-value targets, like enemy machine guns, giving the rest of the fire team a chance to move across open ground.
machine gunner ryan moore is the first to come up, laying down a base of fire.
that could be risky, said martin.
when i was in afghanistan it definitely seemed that a machine gunner had a nice target painted on his flak jacket for the enemy to shoot at, moore said.
the weapon's drum contains 200 rounds, which he fires in two- to three-second bursts. any longer and the gun's recoil will make his shots go wild.
in my opinion, for the most part machine guns will actually change or paint the actual outcome of the battle space, said moore. i'm going to instill confidence in my squad and their ability to move forward, and then i'm also going to put that fear in the enemy where they don't want to fight.
these marines could spend all day telling you about the intricacies and idiosyncrasies of their weapons, but here's the one thing you really need to know about a marine and his rifle:
it is a very personal thing, and it's something that you take ownership of, said sgt. sherman. if there's something wrong with it, it's something you didn't do properly, not the weapon itself. you fix it, you make it better, then you get back in the fight.
so the weapon is only as good as the marine? asked martin.
absolutely, sir. a weapon is going to do what it's designed to do. marines are trained to make it do what it's designed to do.

margaret brennan: i'm margaret brennan in washington. and this week on face the nation, the government's plan to vaccinate americans is already showing signs of strain, as the number of coronavirus cases and deaths climbs higher than ever, and concern over a new variant of the virus grows. it's been a sobering start to 2021. bad behavior over the holidays, as defined by cdc guidelines, threatens to make january the deadliest month, yet, in years since the virus was discovered. the u.s. has now recorded over twenty million infections, a number that's doubled in the last eight weeks. in some parts of the country hospitals, morgues, and funeral homes are at or overcapacity. health care workers are overwhelmed.
toya senior (cedars-sinai nurse): if you don't know, things are pretty bad. things are really bad. please, everyone, do your part. wear a mask, stay home, and help us reduce the strain on us because we need help.
margaret brennan: pictures of people waiting in long lines are now of those desperate for a covid-19 shot.
sylvester turner: even though that there's a-- there's a lot of vaccine hesitancy, there's still a strong desire from people to get the vaccine.
margaret brennan: but there is chaos and lack of coordination at all levels with the vaccine distribution. even those in charge of the efforts say it's not a question of availability.
moncef slaoui: there's a learning curve into the system and we're going through it, particularly, a number of days have been, quote, unquote, lost because of the holidays or snowstorms.
margaret brennan: we'll talk with the chief adviser or operation warp speed, doctor moncef slaoui. plus, we'll here from los angeles mayor, eric garcetti. his city is ground zero for the holiday covid-19 surge. arkansas republican governor asa hutchinson will also join us, as well as former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb, and the head of the association representing tens of millions of america's seniors, aarp's jo ann jenkins. then, a preview of tuesday's georgia runoff elections. those outcomes will determine control of the senate. will the state that went from red to blue in november see enough democrats turn out to defeat not one, but two republican senators?
it's all just ahead on face the nation.
good morning, and welcome to face the nation. as we begin the new year, optimism over the prospect of vaccinations is facing the reality of delays, confusion, lack of communication, and, once more, a federal government seemingly without a coherent plan for making the millions of doses already manufactured accessible to americans. overwhelmed states, many struggling with this latest surge, have been left in charge of getting the vaccine to americans, and they're having a hard time doing so. meanwhile, the death toll continues to climb. more than three hundred and fifty thousand people have now died of covid-19 in the u.s. california is the new epicenter of this latest outbreak. cbs news correspondent carter evans reports from los angeles.
carter evans: with a new year comes new hope.
carter evans: but while vaccinations are underway across the nation--
man: it means seeing my grandkids a lot. that means everything.
carter evans: --they're not happening fast enough. the trump administration promised twenty million doses would be given by the end of 2020. but the cdc says just over four million people have been inoculated. part of the problem is finding enough medical professionals to administer the shots.
rich mackinnon: the local boards of health have been overworked, a lot of them are understaffed.
carter evans: and there's the time involved, including a fifteen- to thirty-minute observation period after the shot is given. another delay: vaccine skepticism. a new survey finds twenty-nine percent of health care workers are vaccine-hesitant. the growing covid surge is pushing hospitals in southern california to the breaking point.
toya senior (cedars-sinai nurse): things are pretty bad. things are really bad. we're overwhelmed. we're stressed. we're-- we're stretched so thin. it's pretty unimaginable.
carter evans: some hospitals in the epicenter of l.a. county are already diverting ambulances. others are preparing emergency plans for rationing care. and now the army corps of engineers is mobilizing to update oxygen delivery systems at hospitals in l.a. new covid cases here are up almost one thousand percent since november. one in every five people tested is now positive, and statewide covid kills someone every three minutes. morgues are overflowing, the dead now filling refrigerated trucks outside. across the country in north carolina, workers are setting up field hospitals, preparing for a new surge after the holidays. same story in atlanta, where they're converting the convention center into a medical center again.
carter evans: today marks the end of the busy holiday travel period. the tsa says in the last two weeks, it's screened more than eleven million passengers. that, plus the tens of millions who likely traveled by road, has experts concerned another surge may be coming right about the time president-elect joe biden is being sworn in. margaret.
around the world, other countries--most notably israel--are outpacing the u.s. when it comes to vaccinating their populations. as a percentage of population, israel stands at 12.6 percent, while the u.s. is at just one percent behind bahrain, iceland, and the u.k. cbs news senior foreign correspondent liz palmer reports from london.
elizabeth palmer (cbs news senior foreign correspondent/@cbslizpalmer): good morning. those numbers point to the inequality of access to vaccine around the world. at this point, the developed countries with thirteen percent of the population have locked in more than half of the world's vaccine supply.
elizabeth palmer: it's india's giant pharmaceutical manufacturers that will be key to making enough vaccines, hundreds of millions of doses for the world, especially developing countries and, of course, for itself. the indian government staged a dry run for a gargantuan program that will try to inoculate a million and a half people a day.
woman #1: you see how short of breath you are.
elizabeth palmer: but as vaccinations gathered speed, so did the virus. extra contagious strains, one of them in south africa, have pushed up the death rate alarmingly.
woman #2: so, it's scary. it's scary for us all.
elizabeth palmer: one in london has hit hard, too, and hospitals are at full capacity. so, it was a huge relief when regulators approved the cheap and easily stored oxford-astrazeneca vaccine just before the new year. tomorrow, it will be rolled out in britain with such urgency that for now people will only get one shot of it or the pfizer vaccine, instead of the recommended two, to make supplies go further. israel's vaccine program is in full swing. it hopes to be the first country in the world to immunize all its citizens by sometime in march. that's likely to be before some countries in africa even get started. covid ruined most new year's parties. in london, small groups of people hoping for fireworks were chased away by mounted police.
man: start clearing the area please. you should not be gathering here.
elizabeth palmer: but here and there, as in taiwan, where covid is firmly under control, crowds welcomed what the rest of the world so craves: a healthy 2021.
elizabeth palmer: widespread and truly global vaccine has to be well underway before things like safe travel for all of us can resume. and epidemiologists say that's not likely to happen until at least 2023. margaret.
margaret brennan: liz palmer, thank you.
we want to go now to the chief adviser for the u.s. vaccine effort, that's operation warp speed. doctor moncef slaoui joins us from miami. good morning to you, doctor.
moncef slaoui, phd (operation warp speed chief adviser): good morning, margaret.
margaret brennan: have u.s. officials gotten any insight into how this more contagious version of the virus that's detected in the u.k. and south africa, what the impact is? we know it's from the u.k. at least-- that version is in at least three u.s. states.
moncef slaoui: yes, so that's the information we have. the virus-- this virus actually mutates as part of its normal behavior and, therefore, it is normal to expect that there will be variants. what's very important is to study those variants and understand how infectious they are, whether they have more impact in terms of morbidity or mortality, and critically now, whether they are still sensitive to the vaccines that have been developed. and on those three counts, based on the information shared with us by the u.k. scientists and early data that we have here, we think that these viruses, these various variants should be under control with this vaccine. fortunately, they are not more deadly--
moncef slaoui: --to the population. they are more infectious, and, therefore, they will further exacerbate the surge that we are having.
margaret brennan: there are reports, though, in the u.k. that more children are becoming ill. from the models you've seen, what does this new virus strain do to children?
moncef slaoui: well, its-- and its capacity to spread is higher. frankly, i'm-- i'm not very clear about the data showing a differential in accelerated spread between adults and children, but the fact of the matter is it will spread faster into the population. i think it should be a signal, again, to say what we need to do as a population is wear masks, distance ourselves, wash our hands, be very aware of people around us and continue to be very careful around the transmission.
moncef slaoui: this will continue to happen. the key to the solution is vaccination.
margaret brennan: well, let's get to that solution then because it is the fastest vaccine development in western history. congratulations to you as overseeing that part of it. now, we're at the really complicated part of actually getting it to americans. the president twice this week has blamed the states for failing to distribute it. if they're not up to the task, what are you doing in operation warp speed to help them?
moncef slaoui: well, first, as you said, i think let's-- let me acknowledge the progress that's been made, which has been remarkable, and it's the work of tens of thousand or probably hundreds of thousands of people--
moncef slaoui: --to have been able to have five vaccines in phase three trials, two approved, probably one more to be approved in the next four to six weeks and twenty million doses of vaccines that we-- as we had promised would be made available to the american people to be immunized with have been made available: seventeen and a half million have been shipped. now, we do acknowledge--
margaret brennan: right, but only a third of them have actually been used. so that's-- that's--
margaret brennan: --where the rubber meets the road.
moncef slaoui: we need to improve. exactly--
margaret brennan: so, what do you do in the states to help them?
moncef slaoui: we need to improve on that. i-- so, we have visited actually the states. and i know you have the governor from arkansas with you later on today. we, general perna and myself, have visited the department of health in arkansas. we have explained the process. this was on october 26th. arkansas has actually ordered from the central reserve about a hundred and fifty thousand doses of the vaccine. hundred and twenty some thousands have been delivered to the actual locations that they have told us. therefore, our assumption has been that there is a plan in place to immunize. we stand by here to help any specific request. we will do the best we can, as we have done over the last eight months, to make these vaccines, indeed, make it into the arms of people.
moncef slaoui: but we need to have a specific ask and maybe there will be one later on today.
margaret brennan: i-- well, we will ask him--
moncef slaoui: there hasn't been a specific request.
margaret brennan: but, sir, i know you know what these numbers are right now. we are at a peak level of infection. so figuring out the bureaucracy--
margaret brennan: --seems to be, you know, frustrating for people here because they want it now. so, what about jumpstarting--
margaret brennan: --the plan you have in place? you know, cvs and walgreens say they have-- they are expecting to get the vaccine in the spring to distribute to the population at large. why not give it to them now? if the states are having a problem, go to the private sector.
moncef slaoui: well, we, as you know, we have agreement with cvs and walgreens and we are starting to ship vaccines to those locations as allocated by the states. that's really the key point in-- in the approach--
margaret brennan: right, but that's the problem, isn't it?
margaret brennan: that's why i'm saying, like, why can't you help that?
moncef slaoui: i don't think it's a problem, frankly-- i actually-- well, we are here to help. let me just, for instance, say over the last seventy-two hours 1.5 million vaccine doses have been inoculated. even though there is a gap in reporting. that's quite an important number. that's five hundred thousand a day. we are optimistic as we go beyond this holiday season that the numbers will go up and we are standing ready to do what we are asked. where there is help to be given, we're standing by to help. i don't think we are able to identify exactly which long-term care facility or which cvs store should be getting more vaccine or less vaccine. that has to be done with people that have granular knowledge of their population, their movements, where the older people are, or, you know, the--
moncef slaoui --various groups at risk--
moncef slaoui: --and then we'll be there with them.
margaret brennan: okay, so you're saying that still has to be up to the states to figure out where they have the need. but let's talk about the portion you can control, and that is the federal supply. if the goal is preservation of life, how can you still justify holding back more than half of the manufactured doses that you have? you know we just heard from the u.k. that they're just trying to hit as many people at once. why not do something like that and space out the time between doses?
moncef slaoui: yes, so a scientific answer and then an alternative. i think it's not reasonable when vaccines have been developed with two doses given twenty-one days apart, or twenty-eight days given apart, and where we have the data on their safety and their efficacy and we have no-- after two doses. we have no data after one dose. if we leave people a month, two months, three months with maybe incomplete immunity, waning immunity, maybe even the wrong kind of immune response induced, that is then corrected by the second dose--
margaret brennan: but they've got zero immunity right now.
moncef slaoui: --to give them-- well, it is-- we-- i'm-- i'm going to tell you the alternative in one second. just let me finish the point i'm making, which is we always said that these vaccines will be developed on the basis of science and all decisions will be made transparently on the basis of data. changing the decisions made, the choices made, which was to give two doses of vaccine, the second dose gives you ten times higher immune response than the first dose, without any data i think would not be responsible. here is the alternative. we know that for the moderna vaccine, giving half the dose to people between the age of eighteen and fifty-five, two doses, half the dose, which means exactly achieving the objective of immunizing double the number of people with the doses we have. we know it induces identical immune response to the hundred microgram dose and, therefore, we are in discussion with moderna and with the fda. of course, ultimately it will be an fda decision to accelerate--
moncef slaoui: --injecting half the volume. i think that's a more responsible approach that will be based on facts and data--
moncef slaoui: --to immunize more people. and, of course, we continue to produce more vaccine doses.
margaret brennan: yeah. and, quickly, do you have a date for when you will know whether once you've been vaccinated, you can still give the virus to others? is there any timeline?
moncef slaoui: so that-- those-- no. those studies, frankly, are going to be based on observational data into the population. i don't think we will have data before late in the spring.
moncef slaoui: but i can't give you an exact date.
margaret brennan: doctor slaoui, thank you for your time this morning.
and face the nation will be back in a minute with los angeles mayor eric garcetti. so stay with us.
margaret brennan: we're back now with the mayor of los angeles, one of the cities struggling with the pandemic. eric garcetti is our guest. good morning to you.
mayor eric garcetti (d-los angeles/@mayorofla): good morning, margaret. good to be with you.
margaret brennan: you are at the epicenter of this outbreak right now; and i saw you said a high percentage of deaths are among people with no underlying conditions. why is the virus so deadly right now?
mayor eric garcetti: well, we're seeing a person every six seconds contract covid-19 here in los angeles county, i think the nation's largest county, ten million people. and it's two reasons, one is just simple density. we're the densest metro area in the united states. but we're also seeing the household spread now. one person is coming home, an essential worker, there might be five, seven, ten people in that household. and this is a worrying trend that the fatalities now are not just people with pre-existing conditions. ninety-two percent of previous deaths were people who had an underlying condition. that is rapidly falling. so, my message to everybody is this is not only going to come for somebody that you love. this is going to possibly come for you. and so everything we do is either lifesaving or life-taking at this point.
margaret brennan: is the higher incidence of death due in any way to the fact that you have a shortage of medical personnel?
mayor eric garcetti: there's no question that we have a shortage of medical personnel, but that's not yet why we think those deaths are happening. we think it is spreading. it may be mutating as well, but we do believe that this is just how widespread it is and that a lot of people who are younger or don't have pre-existing conditions have become very comfortable. this is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion. ninety-five percent of people can be doing the right thing. it's still dangerous.
mayor eric garcetti: if eighty percent are doing the right thing, it is disastrous. so, while we have high compliance here, we still have these tough months. and i think the vaccine has made everybody so hopeful that they can relax their behavior. we cannot. we cannot let up. this is the darkest month we will have, the toughest moment when both our country, its government and the nation-- our people will be tested.
margaret brennan: you have a mask mandate. i mean you're saying that some people are just not complying with some of the restrictions you've put in place. you had that targeted stay-at-home order in early december. do you think that you waited too long to institute that?
mayor eric garcetti: no. we have great compliance. we look at our data. people are moving less. i was talking to the head of the red cross out here who just moved from another state. she was blown away by how many people wear masks compared to where she was coming from. this is something now that really is spreading in the home. and once you get past that tipping point, and it's a message for all of america, we might not all have the same density as los angeles. but what's happening in los angeles can and will be coming to many communities across america. if you get two households together for christmas, if you went to a new year's gathering even if it was people you know and love so you thought it was okay. that's when this virus exploits that weakness and is going far. l.a. was the first place to close places down that-- where people meet, have a mask mandate, offer widespread testing to folks with or without symptoms, surge into our senior and skilled nursing facilities--
mayor eric garcetti: --where we arrested most of the deaths there. we've done everything right. but this virus doesn't care what you've done in the past, only what you're doing today.
margaret brennan: what about the vaccine that is being distributed now? you've publicly called for the vaccine manufacturers and the federal government to deliver more, but it's your governor who controls the distribution. is he not giving you what you need?
mayor eric garcetti: no, we-- we have not been delivered what was promised at the national level. i mean i know and thank god for the great work that was done nationally. let me give that praise for developing and helping the private sector get these vaccines. but we are at a pace right now to deliver vaccines in los angeles in over five years instead of over half a year at this pace.
margaret brennan: right, but you just heard the head of operation warp speed lay that firmly at the door of the governors in this country.
mayor eric garcetti: well, i respectfully disagree because i said six months ago, calling with senator chris coons and a bipartisan coalition in washington for a care corps, a cares corps that would have trained people for all sorts of things, including vaccine distribution, while washington dithered, while they went on vacations, while they didn't pass a relief bill for seven or eight months--
mayor eric garcetti: --we could have been training out of work folks and students to be ready. we knew that the surge was coming in the winter. we also knew that the same medical personnel who would need to give the vaccines, if we were lucky to get them by the end of the year and we did, would also be pulled into those hospitals to treat people.
mayor eric garcetti: where was the forward planning?
margaret brennan: well, the federal government keeps saying the forward planning was supposed to be with local government. and the city of los angeles, we know, you-- you were talking about the uniqueness of your city in terms of density. you also have a high homeless population. you've had sixteen-percent rise in the year past. well, how are you planning to deal with that problem and getting vaccine into those members of your community? because that's-- that's your problem as mayor?
mayor eric garcetti: absolutely. and we've actually had a lower incidence of covid-19 among our un-housed population than those of us in housing because of the way we did plan. and we did bring medical personnel to the streets and we have distributed masks. and that is a great platform to help make sure that vaccines are going to go to the most vulnerable. in fact, this week we stood up three and we're about to do four more seven community walk-up vaccine sites for folks that are working right now in some of our community clinics, working on places like skid row. but to go to your point earlier, the federal government can't tell the local governments and state governments to do something and not give us aid.
mayor eric garcetti: we were cut out of that federal assistance that we could have put into. i said the cares corps would have been--
mayor eric garcetti: --not federal people coming in, but local folks hiring locally. and they failed to do--
margaret brennan: governor, we wish you well. and i know-- i know your daughter was recently ill. i hope she is recovering. thank you for--
margaret brennan: --your time. we have a lot more face the nation.
mayor eric garcetti: thank you, margaret. strength and love to you.
margaret brennan: the house will convene today in a rare sunday session to swear in the new congress, but one person who will not be there is louisiana republican luke letlow. he died last week of covid-19. the congressman was forty-one years old, with a wife, two small children and no pre-existing conditions.
margaret brennan: welcome back to face the nation. we want to go now to governor asa hutchinson of arkansas, who is also the vice chair of the nationals gov-- national governors association. he joins us from little rock. good morning to you, governor.
governor asa hutchinson (r-arkansas/@asahutchinson): good morning, margaret. good to be with you.
margaret brennan: i'm glad we have you today to talk about the vaccine and distribution. i want to quickly ask you something though on the political front as a republican. nearly a quarter of senate republicans say they have concerns about voter integrity, and plan on wednesday to challenge joe biden's electoral college win. this is, to be very clear, all but certain to fail in terms of changing the outcome of the election. but other republican senators say this is destructive to do in the first place. where do you stand?
governor asa hutchinson: well, it's a-- a process that they have the right to initiate. i think it's a little bit of a don quixote jousting at windmills efforts. i think it is designed-- certainly it will fail. joe biden is our president-elect and he will be confirmed in that capacity. i do think that from a state perspective, the challenges have been initiated through recounts and court challenges. and that's how we work in our electoral college, state by state. and so when it gets to congress, it's really a limited opportunity to review the intricacies of the election process. we should have confidence in what has been done and the reviews and the recounts. and let's all recognize that while the system is not perfect, it worked state by state, and we should accept those results and move on to do some good things for our country.
margaret brennan: so i understand you do not support that effort. thank you for your clarification there, governor. i want to move on to the virus. the cdc says arkansas has only distributed a third of the vaccines that you have been given. what's the biggest challenge getting the doses into arms?
governor asa hutchinson: well, there are a number of challenges and we've got to do better both at the federal and at the state level. one of the challenges is that we have a limited supply. and when you have a limited supply that means you've got to prioritize and you've got to make sure you're giving it to those with the greatest needs, or those of the greatest risk. and that's a challenge in and of itself. secondly, you do have some reluctance and that creates some complications. we're focusing on our long-term care facilities and that has to have consents in many instances and that slows up the process. but even with that, we have to do better.
governor asa hutchinson: we have to act with a sense of urgency and we can do that. we have to learn whenever you're in a battle that you have to adjust to the circumstances of that battle.
governor asa hutchinson: and right now, we're going to have to make some adjustments in the plan to get these vaccines out.
margaret brennan: you heard the head of operation warp speed say that they were working under the assumption that there is a plan in place to immunize at the state level. was there not a plan in arkansas? i mean that seems to be the implication here, that it is the governors who are dropping the ball.
governor asa hutchinson: no, there has-- there is a plan and that plan has been coordinated at the federal level, but let me lay it out for you. in phase one, we're supposed to be doing our health care workers and we're doing our long-term care facilities, residents and staff. the federal government allocates that based upon where we want it to go, but they're working through the pharmacies and they made a contract with walgreens and with cvs, two major chain pharmacies. but the states can or-- or the local long-term care facilities can opt out. sixty percent of ours opted out for independent pharmacies. they're doing a better job of getting it out than the chain pharmacies. they are acting with more urgency. and so that's an example of where i have learned that whenever you look now at the challenges with a specific population, what it's going to be like when we move to essential workers and whenever we move--
governor asa hutchinson: --to the general population, we're going to have to utilize more resources to get this out than we've got planned right now.
margaret brennan: what-- what have the other states told you is their difficulty? is it all the same that you're laying out, the problems with the nursing homes?
governor asa hutchinson: yes. it is the-- the challenge of the work staff, the fact that we don't have enough right now for our nurses. we have to utilize our pharmacies because they have the capability and relationships to get it out. but we're going to have to look more broadly at how to utilize more resources, whether it is utilizing medical personnel that's already strained in terms of our national guard, whether it is--
governor asa hutchinson: --bringing on pharmaceutical students that can do more in terms of giving these vaccinations out. we've got to increase the capacity--
governor asa hutchinson: --of our human resources.
margaret brennan: you have the world's largest retailer headquartered in your home state. they have a massive logistics hub. have you asked walmart to help you out?
governor asa hutchinson: walmart is ready to help. this is an example of where--
margaret brennan: would it be better if the private sector took this over?
governor asa hutchinson: the private sector is very engaged. the private sector is doing it, both the independent pharmacies as well as the chain pharmacies. and so, the private sector is delivering it--
margaret brennan: but if the federal government gave directly to them versus you?
governor asa hutchinson: the federal government is giving directly to them. all we're doing as a state is telling them where it goes and allocate it.
governor asa hutchinson: the delivery is directly to the private sector and they're getting it out, but not as fast as we would like. and so it's a partnership. and you're going to see these numbers increase dramatically in the next week--
governor asa hutchinson: --ten days. i believe by the end of january, you'll have all of 1a vaccinated and we'll be moving on to essential workers, if not sooner than that.
margaret brennan: okay. i ask you that because the head of operation warp speed again said allocation came down to what the governors asked for and where they told them to send it. so, it just continues to be--
margaret brennan: --ping-pong here. so on the federal guidance, though--
governor asa hutchinson: now, it's-- it's saying the same thing, margaret, it's saying the same thing. we are allocating where it goes. they deliver it to where we say and that's to the private sector right now.
margaret brennan: okay. the federal government right now is telling states to prioritize people seventy-five years old and up along with front-line workers. there are state governors, florida, texas, who have moved the age qualification downwards, right, to hit more of their elderly population. are you going to do that or are you going to stick with what the federal government's telling you to do?
governor asa hutchinson: we're looking at reducing that to seventy, as well. the argument that it should be allocated seventy-five and up first is because there's a limited supply. it might be easier for you to distribute it and know exactly who you're distributing it to. but the seventy and up population we're looking at, we're trying to save lives getting to the most vulnerable first. and so we're still looking at that as to whether that should be lowered. that decision will be forthcoming.
margaret brennan: so you may endorse what governors abbott and desantis are doing?
governor asa hutchinson: we're looking at that.
governor asa hutchinson: it may happen. we're also looking at some other modifications to the recommendation of the cdc, which is simply recommendations to the governors.
margaret brennan: okay. governor hutchinson, thank you very much and good luck to you.
governor asa hutchinson: thank you, margaret.
margaret brennan: we'll be right back with former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb. stay with us.
margaret brennan: we want to go now to former fda commissioner doctor scott gottlieb. he's also on the board at pfizer and he joins us from westport, connecticut. good morning to you.
scott gottlieb, m.d. (former fda commissioner/@scottgottliebmd): good morning.
margaret brennan: you've said january is going to be the hardest month. i'm-- i'm looking at this slower-than-expected rollout and this new strain of coronavirus. does all of this come together to mean that the peak will be extended, that this is going to be painful for a longer period?
scott gottlieb: it's possible. you know we were hoping that we'd have more injections in people's arms at this point and the vaccine could be starting to have an impact on the trajectory of the epidemic. and the new variant certainly creates more risk that this epidemic peak could get extended. we're going to see the epidemic probably peak at some point this month, hopefully earlier in the month. i mean, that was the original estimates and the original modeling. but the lag in terms of the effect on a health care system is going to be about three weeks. and so the health care system is not going to see maximal resource utilization told closer to the end of the month. and that's when we're likely to see the peak number of deaths on a daily basis as well. so we still have a ways to go with this current surge of this epidemic until we start to see cases decline, hospitalizations start to decline, and, hopefully, deaths start to decline. the new variant does create a lot of risk, however, that we start to see accelerated spread.
margaret brennan: what new risks? doctor slaoui said that it seems the vaccines do work against it. what risks are you seeing?
scott gottlieb: well, we're not vaccinating quickly enough to create a backstop against the spread of this new variant. right now there's some estimates that the new-- new variant probably represents about one percent of all infections in this country. by march, it's going to be the majority of infections. it's going to grow quickly. and so one of the-- the real key to controlling this new variant is to control the epidemic. that means doing the things that we've been doing, mask wearing, social distancing, but it also means getting more people vaccinated quickly. i think that the-- the existence of this new variant that spreads more readily really creates more urgency around trying to get this vaccine out more quickly and get more people vaccinated, even if it's a more general population. there's a lot of excess demand for the vaccine right now, particularly in the elderly population. i think we ought to think about moving quickly through these phases that we've delineated and move more quickly into a general vaccination program for those sixty-five and above.
margaret brennan: i-- i thought it was, interesting. governor hutchinson sort of leaned into that concept, saying they were looking at what the governors of florida and texas have done with making this available to other age populations at this point. would you ask of-- other governors to do that? because governor desantis was really kind of hit hard by, you know, images of long lines of older people waiting. it didn't seem to be moving quickly in terms of vaccinations, though, he widened the number of people who qualify for it.
scott gottlieb: well, i think we can have a dual strategy here where we continue to prioritize certain hard to reach communities and have public health departments focus on that mission. and they're uniquely skilled to do that mission and then make the vaccine more generally available through the retail pharmacies, through walmart and walgreens and cvs, to a broader population, to a general population starting with age. we can walk it down the age continuum, make it available for seventy-five and above first, then seventy above, then sixty-five and above. there's fifty million americans sixty-five and above, a large percentage of them probably want to be vaccinated. at some point we need to allow supply to meet demand here and get the-- the shots into the arms of the people who really want to get vaccinated and are going to go out and seek out the vaccination. if we're pushing it through the retail pharmacies, you're not going to see the long lines. they're going to have a scheduling system in place and it's going to be a more orderly distribution. and then, commensurate with that, we can have the public health departments focusing on the critical mission of going into homes, reaching harder-to-access communities, people who are more reluctant and need a little bit more encouragement to get vaccinated.
scott gottlieb: that's someplace where the public health establishment can really focus on a discernible mission.
margaret brennan: but explain that because you have operation warp speed saying it is working with the private sector. you had the gov-- the governor of arkansas saying they are working with the private sector. are you saying that the private sector should just take it over at this point?
scott gottlieb: well, look, we've-- we have forty million vaccines that-- that were delivered in december. five million were injected into arms. that's thirty-five million vaccines sitting on a shelf somewhere. i'm saying that we can be delivering these vaccines directly to walmart and walgreens, and in new jersey they're shipping them through shoprite, and allow these retail establishments to start opening up more general vaccination programs for the broader public instead of working very slowly through these preordained phases that we've-- we've articulated. continue to-- to accomplish that mission because it's important, but also take some of this excess supply and push it through a retail channel to the general public. if someone who's seventy years old or sixty-five years old wants to schedule an appointment at cvs to get a vaccination, they should be able to do that this month. so i think we should start working through the age brackets and just work our way down until we work off some of the supply. there's more vaccine coming on the market every day. we're going to have a significant backlog right now or, you know, warehouse inventory of vaccines.
scott gottlieb: and that's tragic because these could be accomplishing an important public health purpose.
margaret brennan: right. well, because operation warp speed is already stockpiling half-- more than half of the supply that they have. what about vaccine-hesitancy? the-- the governor of ohio said sixty percent of nursing home staff members offered the vaccine in his state declined it. you're seeing similar hesitancy elsewhere. these are medical personnel and health care staff and they're saying no.
scott gottlieb: yeah, look, that's another reason to be making this more generally accessible. it is a reality that some people aren't going to want to get vaccinated, or are going to be reluctant to get vaccinated. it's going to take more work. there's about a hundred and fifty million americans who get vaccinated for flu each year. about sixty million of them are under the age of fifteen. so that's about ninety million people who get vaccinated for flu. i think that's your low hanging fruit for getting covid vaccinations out. some high proportion of the people who get a flu vaccine are also going to get a covid vaccine. if we just simply make this generally accessible to sixty-five and above this month, that's fifty million americans, probably about thirty million of them will take it. that's your low hanging fruit. that's the pent-up demand. we need to start working that off because trying to push it into, you know, very discrete populations, you're going to be bumping up against people who don't want it and it's going to create friction. it's going to create a slowdown in trying to get this vaccination out. we need to get more people vaccinated quickly and recognize that every vaccination--
scott gottlieb: --at this point really is a public health win.
margaret brennan: all right. doctor gottlieb, thank you for your analysis.
and we'll be back in a moment.
margaret brennan: we turn now to jo ann jenkins. she is the ceo of the american association of retired persons. you know it as aarp and she's at their headquarters in washington this morning. good morning to you.
jo ann jenkins (aarp ceo/@joann_jenkins): good morning, margaret.
margaret brennan: december was a very deadly month during this pandemic, particularly for nursing home residents. the federal government plan is to have pharmacies like cvs and walgreens set up clinics to vaccinate inside of these facilities. and it started in about thirty-six states just this past week. is it moving fast enough?
jo ann jenkins: well, i think by every mea-- questionable that it has not moved fast enough that, you know, forty percent of the people who have died in this country live in nursing homes. and so, we see this really as an unconscionable national disaster that three hundred and fifty thousand people in this country have died from covid-19 and forty percent of them have lived in nursing homes or work in nursing homes, and, yet, they only represent one percent of the population. so, no, we're not moving fast enough.
margaret brennan: i didn't hear a lot of specifics from-- from the-- the governor or from the head of operation warp speed on what they want to change. and i'm wondering from you what your view is because we did hear earlier in the week from operation warp speed saying that some nursing homes aren't vaccinating until they have enough doses for everyone in the facility. that's a federal requirement. should the government suspend it?
jo ann jenkins: well, i think that, you know, if you look at the data and the fact that that's where people are dying, you have to come to the conclusion that they should be doing everything that they can to be administering this vaccine as soon as possible. i know that there are 2.2 million doses that have gone out to nursing homes, and, yet, only thirteen percent of that has been administered. and so we have to find a solution and, you know, we need to stop pointing fingers and--
jo ann jenkins: --you know, looking at who-- who's to blame. and really all of us, whether it's mayors or governors or the federal or governors all across this country to really try to fix this problem.
margaret brennan: so that's a yes, they should lift that requirement?
margaret brennan: at-- at the state level you-- you heard a debate about whether the age qualification should be lowered more quickly, like it has been in texas and in florida. would you ask other governors to do that?
jo ann jenkins: well, i think if you look at the data of where people are dying and if, in fact we can stop people from dying of covid, we know that that will offer some relief to the hospitals all across this country. we have examples that we're hearing from thousands of our members, particularly like those in florida, who are standing in lines of three, four hundred of them at three and four o'clock in the morning trying to-- to get that vaccination. i think that we have to really solve this issue and really come together so that there is some standard for which the states and the local nursing homes know how they're going to get this vaccine and what it is they're supposed to be doing.
margaret brennan: there's confusion. i mean i know people who-- who ask-- where do i find out when i qualify? what do you tell your members? do they call their doctor? do they get an e-mail? who do they ask? their local health department?
jo ann jenkins: well, i think one of the things that we've tried to do at aarp is, you know, we have aarp.org/coronavirus where we're listing everything that we have from the states about what-- how the vaccine, the priorities in each of the states, how they're going to be able to get their vaccinations. clearly, we're hearing directly from our members that they are confused about whether or not they should be calling their physician, whether or not someone's going to contact them, which of the vaccines should they be trying to take if they live in rural america or in an urban city, just how that's going to happen. and i think that there could be some simple clarity and transparency about what is to be expected, the time frame that individuals all across this country should be thinking about. clearly, we need to keep up the protections of wearing mask and washing our hands and doing all of those things. we shouldn't let our guard down. but there needs to be further clarity about and-- and expectations set about when this vaccines are going to be administered widely.
margaret brennan: do you think that staff in nursing homes should be mandated to take the vaccine?
jo ann jenkins: well, i think that the data tells us that that's where the deaths are occurring and that for patients and people who work in nursing homes, they need to be protected in a way. but, clearly, it's not-- it's not ours to-- to mandate a vaccine--
margaret brennan: so, governors-- governors would have to mandate that, right? is that what you're asking governors to do?
jo ann jenkins: well, i think that we're saying to the governors that-- that this is a way to bring it under control and that while we at aarp don't have the authority to-- to mandate this, that this is one of the-- one of the only ways that we had that we know that this-- this particular covid-19 disease can be brought under control.
margaret brennan: right. and it may come down to employers. jo ann jenkins, thank you very much for-- for sharing what you're seeing out there.
we'll be right back with a look at tuesday's georgia's senate race. it's an important one. don't go away.
margaret brennan: in georgia a pair of runoff elections on tuesday will decide control of the u.s. senate and shape the agenda of the incoming biden administration. here's our senior national correspondent mark strassmann.
mark strassmann (cbs news senior national correspondent): republicans have a new year's resolution: keep georgia red as its clay.
senator kelly loeffler (r-georgia): we have to hold the line here against socialism. we need y'all to get out and vote.
mark strassmann: in dual runoffs here, if republican senators kelly loeffler and david perdue both lose, democrats will seize control of the senate. it would be a fifty-fifty split with vice president-elect kamala harris breaking any tie vote.
jon ossoff (democratic senate candidate): the whole country is watching georgia voters to see what we will do at this historic moment.
mark strassmann: democrats jon ossoff and raphael warnock each have raised more than one hundred million dollars over the last two months. their blitzkrieg of ads called both republicans corrupt.
woman (campaign ad): looting loeffler and chicken perdue.
reverend raphael warnock (democratic senate candidate): you can either help kelly loeffler to help herself or you can help me to help you.
mark strassmann: more than three million georgians have already voted. some in lines, almost four hours long. the wildcard: president trump's groundless griping about election fraud here and its impact on republican turnout this tuesday.
man: i don't believe he lost georgia. no, i don't.

you probably thought you were finished thinking about medicare when the 2018 open enrollment period ended on dec. 7. not so fast: medicare has another limited open enrollment that runs from jan. 1 through march 31, 2019, for medicare advantage plans. here's a brief review to help you understand your options.
you face a fundamental decision regarding how you receive medical treatment under medicare:
original medicare usually gives you the most flexibility to choose your health care providers, but it's also the most complicated way to receive benefits. it's recommended that you supplement original medicare with a medicare supplement plan to help cover medicare's substantial deductibles and copayments
a medicare advantage (ma) plan offers one-stop shopping, typically combining all parts of medicare and prescription drug coverage. however, ma plans usually limit you to seeing only the health care providers in the plan's network.
you do have the opportunity to change your mind if you elected an ma plan during the 2018 open enrollment period or if you simply allowed your 2018 ma plan to remain effective for 2019. during the 2019 medicare advantage open enrollment period, you can:
change from one ma plan to another
opt out of your ma plan and switch to original medicare
elect a stand-alone part d prescription drug plan if you lose prescription drug coverage due to opting out of your ma plan
your election becomes effective the month after you make the switch.
why would you want to move from one ma plan to another or to original medicare? here are a few possible reasons:
many ma plans change their benefits and coverage from year to year, and you may not have noticed until you tried to make a claim in 2019. often, changes are made to the prescription drug formulary
you might have incurred a serious medical condition and want more flexibility in choosing your providers under original medicare.
you might discover an ma plan that better meets your needs. for example, some offer limited vision or dental benefits that aren't covered by original medicare.
if you're new to an ma plan this year, try it out before march 31, recommended diane omdahl, president of sixty-five incorporated, an independent medicare consultancy. that way, you can test whether you like it and still have time to change if you don't.
note that if you opt out of your ma plan and switch to original medicare, you may have a challenge purchasing a medicare supplement plan. most states allow insurance companies to require that you satisfy medical underwriting requirements to obtain coverage (insurance companies are prohibited from applying medical underwriting only when you're first eligible to enroll in medicare at age 65). so if you have a preexisting condition, you may not be able to elect a medicare supplement plan.
here are a few things you can't do during 2019 medicare advantage open enrollment:
switch from original medicare to an ma plan
switch from one prescription drug plan to another, if you're in original medicare
join a prescription drug plan if you're in original medicare and previously declined to enroll in such a plan.
there's a lot to keep track of with medicare and all its various parts and features. if you're confused, which is understandable, it's a good idea to find a professional who can help you. it's part of your retirement job to spend time learning about your options. smart choices can save you thousands of dollars and help keep you healthy.
pence and coronavirus task force hold press briefing vice president mike pence and members of the coronavirus task force gave a press briefing monday where they emphasized that the risk to americans remains low. health and human services secretary alex azar did warn, however, the degree of risk has the potential to change quickly. watch their remarks.
editor's note: health officials' views on wearing face masks have shifted as the outbreak spreads. on friday, april 3, president trump announced that the cdc now recommends americans wear a basic cloth or fabric mask, not a medical-grade mask, in public.
as fears over the coronavirus outbreak spread, thousands of americans are clamoring to buy face masks in an effort to protect themselves, sending prices soaring and leading manufacturers like 3m to ramp up production. however, experts say stocking up on face masks is actually misguided — and there's a much simpler thing you could be doing right now to protect yourself.
there's a lot the general public likely doesn't realize about these masks — namely, that they are not the best way to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
wearing a mask is more for people already showing symptoms of coronavirus and their caregivers than for people trying to prevent it
the centers for disease control and prevention said it does not recommend that people who are well wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including covid-19, referring to the disease caused by the new coronavirus. rather, experts caution that putting on a face mask without proper fitting and training could actually increase your risk.
if it's not fitted right, you're going to fumble with it, explained health and human services secretary alex azar before a house appropriations subcommittee on wednesday. you're going to be touching your face, which is the no. 1 way you're going to get disease, is unclean hands touching your face.
on the other hand, if you are already coughing and showing symptoms of possible coronavirus illness, that's when wearing a mask could be helpful for protecting those around you.
the data on the effectiveness of masks for preventing respiratory virus infections is not very clear,  explains dr. andrew stanley pekosz of johns hopkins' bloomberg school of public health. the best data suggests that if you are ill and showing symptoms, wearing a mask can reduce the chances that you spread the virus to others.
cloth surgical masks are not helpful
the common surgical mask you might be picturing in your head will not help you at all, pekosz said.
a type called an n95 respirator mask, if properly fitted, can block large-particle droplets that may contain germs, but the fda warns they cannot filter out very small particles in the air that may be transmitted by coughs [or] sneezes.
an n95 mask is the one that is most practical, pekosz tells cbs news. it stops 95% of particles of a certain size. ... there is a n99 mask, which blocks 99% of particles, but that mask is difficult to wear for long periods of time because it is hard to breathe through it.
respirator masks are more expensive. the fda also notes they are not designed to fit children or people with facial hair.
even a good face mask isn't enough
masks shouldn't be considered to be the sole item that can protect you from infection, but it can be one of several things that can help you stay uninfected, said pekosz.
wash your hands frequently. practice social distancing — stay 5 feet away from people to avoid being close enough to be exposed to respiratory droplets from that person. more specific guidance will be given by the cdc soon, but those two things should be practiced by people on a daily basis to reduce the spread of respiratory viruses.
and he adds, get a flu shot — influenza has killed over 16,000 americans this year and is still causing disease across the u.s.
you have to change masks every few hours
if you do go the mask route in spite of expert advice, it's important to note that face masks have a very specific lifespan. while there are some with longer lifespans or that have replaceable filters, the most common face masks on the market are disposable and single use. each one of those is only good for a few hours.
you want to change masks every few hours to make sure that they are functioning properly and aren't getting contaminated with virus particles on the outside, pekosz tells cbs news. it's not like putting one on protects you. one has to follow specific procedures to ensure you are using them effectively.
buying face masks for personal use could cause a shortage at hospitals
there is a limited supply of masks and while companies are increasing their production, demand is increasing at a very high rate, cautions pekosz. there will most likely be shortages of personal protective equipment at medical institutions and this may in part be driven by supplies being purchased by the general public. emergency preparedness efforts will address supply chains, but there really is no reason for the general public to purchase large numbers of n95 masks.
the u.s. surgeon general put it bluntly: seriously people — stop buying masks!
seriously people- stop buying masks! they are not effective in preventing general public from catching #coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can't get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!

america's largest face mask manufacturer, prestige ameritech, is a small business based in texas with only 100 employees. and while they have no problem fulfilling america's normal demand for face masks and respirators, they are now struggling to keep up.
mike bowen, the company's executive vice president, told cbs news that they now field orders of up to 100 million face masks and respirators a day. he also noted that while the company does not ship its products internationally, in the last 30 days it has sold between 1 million and 2 million masks to buyers who then sent them to others in china and hong kong.
this huge spike in personal orders is precisely what experts fear will cause a dangerous inventory shortage in american hospitals — a shortage that is entirely avoidable, given that there are no proven benefits to the general public wearing masks.
the best way to prevent coronavirus: wash your hands
experts say washing your hands is the best way to prevent the spread of infectious illnesses like coronavirus. that's because one of the most common ways infections spread is when people touch a contaminated surface and then touch their mouth or nose.
wash your hands frequently and thoroughly. cbs news chief medical correspondent dr. jon lapook points out that it's especially important to make sure that you scrub the soap into your fingertips because they are simultaneously the part of the hand most often neglected and the part of the hand most likely to touch your face and spread disease.
soap and water is far more effective than hand sanitizer. if you're using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, you should make sure that it contains at least 60% alcohol.
beyond that, the cdc advises that, whenever possible, you should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, avoid contact with sick people, cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze, and disinfect objects and surfaces frequently.
one of facebook's early investors and a former mentor to ceo mark zuckerberg is warning of the social media giant's harmful and potentially irreversible effects on society. roger mcnamee told cbs this morning on wednesday that facebook not only needs to take action, it needs to fix the product.
mcnamee, managing director of private equity firm elevation partners, argues that facebook has prioritized advertisers and not protected users.
the facebook stakeholder said he spent years helping to build the company and finds it unbelievably painful to think about where it is today.
i'm sitting in the front row like, wow, this is the greatest thing i ever did. then right in the beginning of the presidential campaign in 2016 i see things going wrong and it makes me very concerned. and eventually in october i go to them and say, 'you know i think we have a structural problem here' and they treat it like a pr crisis rather than like a business problem,' mcnamee said.
in a new year's pledge, zuckerberg admitted facebook has a lot of work to do this year. he vowed to take action against offensive content and false news articles that could reach the site's more than two billion monthly active users.
but it's not just political ads that mcnamee was seeing that concerned him.
i also saw people scraping facebook about black lives matter and selling it to police departments, i saw financial institutions using facebook tools to discriminate in housing. it was a wide range of things. basically, facebook created tools for engagement and in order to get people engaged they used things that effectively addicted them, mcnamee said.
he also believes users lost the power to discern what they were seeing.
people get trapped in this place where they think everyone agrees with them because facebook only shows you stuff you think you want, he said.
part of what fuels that addiction, mcnamee said, is content that appeals to people's fear and anger, because that's what motivates and engages users.
you need to fix the product. you need to change the way the algorithms work. you need to change the business model, he said.
in a statement to cbs news, a facebook spokesperson said: we've made major progress in combatting false news, fighting harassment, bringing more transparency to advertising and stopping bad actors from meddling in foreign elections. we know we have more to do and we will put our heads down and do the work.

6:15 p.m.: justin timberlake won't use prince hologram at super bowl
sheila e. says justin timberlake reached out to her after she tweeted that prince didn't want to be turned into a hologram and says she wants people to know there was no hologram. her comments come after tmz reported saturday that timberlake was set to use a hologram of prince during his halftime know performance sunday. but sheila e. tells the associated press that prince told her didn't want to be used as a hologram for religious reasons.
timberlake said he looked up to prince and admired him during a press conference days ago in minnesota. it was the same day the pop star held a listening party for his new album at paisley park.
holograms of a-list celebrities have appeared in recent years, from tupac shakur to roy orbison, whose hologram is set to go on a tour.
in an ap interview saturday, sting said he would not want to have his likeness portrayed in a hologram.
i don't want to be hologrammed. i really don't. god knows who they will team me up with, you know. no. i'm going to write in my will that i am not to be hologrammed, he said.
roy wouldn't have even known about it, he added. how would he know?
6:10 p.m.: kelly clarkson supports flu-stricken pink
kelly clarkson says she's not worried about pink nailing the national anthem at the super bowl despite having the flu.

clarkson added: i would take pink's voice on a flu day any day.
pink performed sick at a concert friday in minnesota and said it's easy to become under the weather when you're a mother of two children. clarkson echoed her sentiments.
our babies are right in our face, like the saliva, the mucus membranes are all around us, she said. we both have toddlers and i mean, they're literally little petri dishes of disease walking, they just have everything. so we're sick sometimes.
clarkson was one of the tailgate performances sunday at nomadic live at the armory. she said she enjoys performing for sports fans.
the fun thing that you can always expect is it's never going to be a dead crowd because either a, they're drinking already or b, the energy of sports fans in general, they're just excited to be here (and) they're excited for their team, she said.
though clarkson is a dallas cowboys fan, she said she's rooting for the philadelphia eagles over the new england patriots.
my nanny is a huge eagles fan, so we're all eagles today. and they're the underdog, right? so, you know, it's kind of cool, she said.

5:55 p.m.: protesters have been removed
police in minneapolis have removed protesters who locked themselves across a light-rail line near u.s. bank stadium, temporarily halting trains carrying fans to the super bowl.
live footage from the scene sunday showed police working to unlock or cut locks the protesters had used at the stop near the university of minnesota's west bank station. that's about a half-mile from the stadium.
the footage showed protesters in zip ties waiting to board a bus to be carried from the scene.
protesters blocked the line shortly after 2 p.m., saying they were protesting police brutality as well as the light-rail line being turned over to super bowl fans for the day.
metro transit was busing fans the rest of the way to the game.
5:45 p.m.: protesters shut off rail line serving super bowl
a small group of activists protesting police brutality have shut down a light-rail line carrying fans to the super bowl in minneapolis.
about 30 activists walked onto the city's green line at the stadium village stop shortly after 2 p.m. sunday, stopping trains in both directions.

the line runs from downtown st. paul to the heart of minneapolis, and is a main way some fans are getting to the game between the new england patriots and philadelphia eagles.
chinyere tutashinda, a spokeswoman for the activists, says some chained themselves along the track.
metro transit spokesman howie padilla says the agency has contingency plans to get riders the rest of the way to u.s. bank stadium. he says he's confident they'll be there for kickoff.
sacramento, calif. - the announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts pacific gas & electric co.'s problems squarely in the hands of gov. gavin newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink california's energy picture in the face of climate change.
this issue is all about three fundamental things: it is about safety, it's about reliability and it's about affordability, newsom told reporters monday afternoon after spending the day in and out of meetings with lawmakers about the pending bankruptcy.
earlier in the day, pg&e announced it will file for chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic california wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. the announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.
we'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. i respect the taxpayer, i respect the ratepayer and i'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.
the filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. it would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. that could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.
the chances of victims getting what they would've gotten without a bankruptcy are not good, said state sen. bill dodd, a napa democrat.
how much and what the state can do remains to be seen. lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened pg&e bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. democratic assemblyman chris holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on monday he said he has backed off that idea.
clearly pg&e has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about pg&e's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.
in a tuesday morning note, height securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for pg&e's complex problems. as of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.
pg&e serves about 40 percent of california's utility customers, newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. it operates in three-quarters of california's land most vulnerable to wildfires, newsom said. while pg&e's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending california's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.
state officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in california history, a november blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.
newsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. but no one has yet figured out the future of california energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.
democratic sen. jerry hill said a pg&e bankruptcy may turn out to be a good thing. hill represents san bruno in the san francisco bay area, where a pg&e natural gas pipeline exploded in 2010 and killed eight people.
this company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. i don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.
newsom agreed pg&e hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. he noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including chief executive geisha williams, who resigned on sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.
chapter 11 reorganization represents the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders, richard kelly, chairman of pg&e's board of directors, said in a statement.
the chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.
regardless of the solution, the process is likely to be long: 18 years after the company's last bankruptcy filing, pg&e customers still see a small fee on their monthly bills to pay for it, labeled the energy cost recovery amount.
the natural resources defense council warned that bankruptcy could threaten billions in funding for pg&e's clean energy initiatives, which are key to california's environmental goals. pg&e is the state's largest investor in energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, said the nrdc's ralph cavanagh.
the bankruptcy is different from pg&e's bankruptcy in 2001, when california faced an energy crisis that caused power outages. newsom said the state has an abundance of energy and power shutoffs are not imminent.

this month, workers put the finishing touches on the museum of the american revolution. it took them eight hours to hang a painting of george washington at the end of the war, and it's taken more than a decade to get to this point.
in 2012, collections director for the museum scott stephenson gave cbs this morning: saturday co-host anthony mason a preview of some of the items that will go on display.
some of the historic items include a musket used in the battles of lexington and concord -- the first action in the war of independence -- and a soldier's canteen inscribed with the word ustates, one of only three known to have survived.
stephenson, now the vice president of collections, exhibitions and programming, said, if you think about it, at this point the united states is still just an idea.
for years, the 3,000 items in this collection have been looking for a permanent home. this week, they'll finally have one in what will be the first national museum to tell the entire story of the american revolution.
it's been a long time coming but i'm glad it's here, said brown university professor gordon wood.
wood, a scholar of the revolution, said, there have been museums for almost every conceivable event in american history or person in american history. but not the american revolution. which is extraordinary when you think of the revolution as the most important event in our history.
the museum's collection will include a letter, written in washington's own hand, celebrating the french joining the cause. the original enlistment form for recruits to an uprising printed in the spring of 1775 will also be featured, according to stephenson.
a portion of the document reads, and enlist ourselves as soldiers in the massachusetts service for the preservation of the liberties of america. the beginning of the army.
the carvings on a soldier's powder horn show that the stakes were high, with phrases like kill or be killed and liberty or death.
the museum will also feature the faces of the revolution -- pictures taken of revolutionary war veterans during the earliest days of photography. some of these former soldiers were more than 100 years old when they posed for these pictures.
a 20-foot piece of canvas was general washington's home during the war.
personally, i think it's chilling to think about the emotions that were felt underneath this canvas, stephenson said.
now, out of storage, the tent is once again set up -- this time not on the fields of valley forge, but behind a layer of thick protective glass.
to be an american is not to be somebody, but to believe in something. and the things we believe in came out of that revolution, wood said.
washington's victories led to the birth of a nation, and that story is written in this collection -- artifacts of an act of defiance that would literally change the world.
robots aren't replacing everyone, but a quarter of u.s. jobs will be severely disrupted as artificial intelligence accelerates the automation of existing work, according to a new brookings institution report.
the report, published thursday, says roughly 36 million americans hold jobs with high exposure to automation - meaning at least 70 percent of their tasks could soon be performed by machines using current technology. among those most likely to be affected are cooks, waiters and others in food services; short-haul truck drivers; and clerical office workers.
that population is going to need to upskill, reskill or change jobs fast, said mark muro, a senior fellow at brookings and lead author of the report.
muro said the timeline for the changes could be a few years or it could be two decades. but it's likely that automation will happen more swiftly during the next economic downturn. businesses are typically eager to implement cost-cutting technology as they lay off workers.
some economic studies have found similar shifts toward automating production happened in the early part of previous recessions - and may have contributed to the jobless recovery that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
but with new advances in artificial intelligence, it's not just industrial and warehouse robots that will alter the american workforce. self-checkout kiosks and computerized hotel concierges will do their part.
most jobs will change somewhat as machines take over routine tasks, but a majority of u.s. workers will be able to adapt to that shift without being displaced.
the changes will hit hardest in smaller cities, especially those in the heartland and rust belt and in states like indiana and kentucky, according to the report by the washington think tank. they will also disproportionately affect the younger workers who dominate food services and other industries at highest risk for automation.
some chain restaurants have already shifted to self-ordering machines; a handful have experimented with robot-assisted kitchens .
google this year is piloting the use of its digital voice assistant at hotel lobbies to instantly interpret conversations across a few dozen languages. autonomous vehicles could replace short-haul delivery drivers. walmart and other retailers are preparing to open cashier-less stores powered by in-store sensors or cameras with facial recognition technology.
restaurants will be able to get along with significantly reduced workforces, muro said. in the hotel industry, instead of five people manning a desk to greet people, there's one and people basically serve themselves.
many economists find that automation has an overall positive effect on the labor market, said matias cortes, an assistant professor at york university in toronto who was not involved with the brookings report. it can create economic growth, reduce prices and increase demand while also creating new jobs that make up for those that disappear.
but cortes said there's no doubt there are clear winners and losers. in the recent past, those hardest hit were men with low levels of education who dominated manufacturing and other blue-collar jobs, and women with intermediate levels of education who dominated clerical and administrative positions.
in the future, the class of workers affected by automation could grow as machines become more intelligent. the brookings report analyzed each occupation's automation potential based on research by the mckinsey management consulting firm. those jobs that remain largely unscathed will be those requiring not just advanced education, but also interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence.
these high-paying jobs require a lot of creativity and problem-solving, cortes said. that's going to be difficult for new technologies to replace.
new york -- for all its six seasons, downton abbey has been a graciously paced time-scape through early 1900s britain.
home base, of course, was the grand estate that lent the series its name. there the aristocratic crawley family and their household servants felt the world changing -- however incrementally -- under their feet.
spanning from 1912 to the dawn of 1926, downton abbey was always about change. the old versus the new. time-honored values accosted by modernity. social graces under fire.
what to make of the encroachment of a telephone, or the very idea of a lady out pursuing a career! the changes navigated by the downton denizens provided us viewers, a century removed, with the opportunity to measure ourselves against them as we, too, cope with change that alternately gladdens and confounds us. and as we, too, cut ties with the past.
now it takes nothing away from this glorious series to recognize that change, and a resistance to changing, has paved the way for the show's impending end.
the world is a different place from the way it was, my lord, says the butler, carson (jim carter), to his boss robert crawley, the earl of grantham (hugh bonneville). then, with stiff-upper-lip resolve, he adds, downton abbey must change with it.
not so with downton abbey the tv series, which gloried in staying put.
airing sunday at 9 p.m. est on pbs' masterpiece, the conclusion is tender, upbeat and mostly satisfying, with no loose ends, nothing left to doubt, nothing likely to ignite water-cooler debate come monday morning. this is no head-scratching finale as with lost or the sopranos.
of course not. throughout its run, downton always knew what it was, as did its audience, which loved it for its steadfast clarity and sense of purpose.
it was steadfast with savory writing by series creator julian fellowes, who authored every script, and with its splendid cast and lush production values.
it was steadfast, too, in its posh confinement to downton abbey, where, even as change gradually imposed itself, the narrative refused to change, and -- let's face it -- eventually began to feel repetitive. even at that sprawling country estate (with occasional excursions to london) there was only so much fresh story to tell.
asked a couple of years ago how long the series might run, executive producer gareth neame cited a familiar principle of drama in replying, there are only seven stories, and i think the challenge with a long-running tv show is to retell those seven stories without anyone noticing. but there could come a time where we'll be going, 'what do we do now?'
downton abbey may well have reached a what-do-we-do-now point in its told-and-retold cycle of ailments, heartache, duplicity and politesse, plus withering commentary from the dowager countess, as played by maggie smith (who in the finale weighs in on what makes the english the way they are by observing tartly, some say our history. but i blame the weather).
the show, in short, was proudly tradition-bound, and prevailed to the end as a tv tradition for the faithful fans who watched it every week and, during each offseason, eagerly sought its return.
bonneville has said the series is about family -- both the literal family and the staff as family. it explores the minutiae of those social structures, the nuances of the system as to whether someone's in or out.
we saw ourselves in them all -- in or out, elite or commoner, 1-percenters or the 99 percent. we were constantly reminded that now, as way back then, change is willing to spare no one. everyone feels the hot breath of progress.
now we are left on our own to face today's version of progress, a world of upheaval from which we found weekly refuge on downton. and after sunday we can ponder the parting words from cora, countess of grantham (elizabeth mcgovern) as expressed to her husband: i think the more adaptable we are, the more chance we have of getting through.
part of our delight from downton was following the struggle of getting through as waged by those who seemed to have it all. we feasted on how the 1-percenters of that day kept up appearances, however much they seemed to be living on borrowed time.
downton abbey is smart to bring its saga to a close before it lets more time pass. it has gotten through in magnificent fashion, albeit more and more predictably. now it's adapting to obligatory change on its own classy terms: by saying goodbye.
the $600 stimulus checks that are going out to millions of people can now be individually tracked through the irs' get my payment website, which reopened on monday afternoon. the site informs people about the date of their payment and whether they will receive it via direct deposit or the mailed payment date.
still, there are some glitches that are delaying the payments of the stimulus money and creating confusion and questions for consumers. chief among them: some people who had their 2020 tax returns filed through tax preparers like h&r block may have had their stimulus check sent directly to the tax firm, rather than their bank account.
this echoes a glitch that impacted payment of the first stimulus check for some people who used tax prep services and for whom the irs didn't have direct-deposit information. with the second round of stimulus checks, a similar issue may impact some people, with h&r block warning its customers who used a service called a refund transfer that they might see an account number you don't recognize on the get my payment website. refund transfers are offered to allow people to tap their refund to pay their tax prep fees, according to h&r block.
as many as 13 million people may experience a delay in receiving their money after the irs sent the funds to closed or invalid bank accounts, according to tax-prep company jackson hewitt.
the irs get my payment website may display an account number you don't recognize. if you took a refund transfer, it may be reflecting that account number. check your 2019 return to confirm. — h&r block (@hrblock) january 5, 2021
intuit's turbotax on tuesday also tweeted that some customers were having problems receiving their stimulus checks. the irs announced yesterday that due to the speed at which they issued this second round of payments, they sent some payments to an account that may be closed or no longer active, the tax-prep service said.
the irs said checks sent to closed or inactive accounts can't by law be held by the financial institutions and redirected to consumers. instead the funds will be returned to the irs, and people who didn't receive a check must wait until they file their 2020 tax returns to get the stimulus money in a refund. because of that, it's likely that those customers will face a delay.
some customers responded on social media that they had panicked after failing to receive their funds as expected, with some expressing concern they had been a victim of fraud.
meanwhile, the irs said on monday that the direct deposits could take several days to post to individual accounts after the official payment day of january 4. it added that some people may see their stimulus checks listed as pending or as provisional payments in their accounts.
here's what to know about tracking your payment.
how can i get my stimulus check?
the irs says people will automatically get their payments in the second round of stimulus checks. one way to track the status of your payment is to visit the get my payment site.
as with the first round, you will need to enter a few pieces of personally identifiable information, such as your social security number, date of birth and address. the site will then provide you with the status of both your first and second stimulus payments.
what will get my payment tell me?
the get my payment site will inform you about the date of the payment and the method, which the irs says will either be the mailed payment date or the date of direct deposit to your bank account. checks sent in the mail will need more processing and mailing time, although the irs didn't specify the length of time that will be needed.
the irs says it is prioritizing direct deposit payments to people with valid routing and account information.
can i change my bank account information?
the irs says that option isn't available this time around because the tax agency is issuing the checks based on information it already has on file from the first round of checks. in the first round of checks directed by the coronavirus aid, relief and economic security act (or cares act), people could enter or correct their bank account information at the get my payment site.
however, that's not an option in the second round. you will not be able to add new routing or account information and cannot request to receive your payment by eip card, the irs said on december 30.
what if the irs sent the check to a closed account?
because people can't update their bank account information on the get my payment site, there's concern that some checks might be sent to accounts that were recently closed. if that's the case, the irs says you'll have to wait until you file your 2020 tax returns.
the stimulus checks are actually a tax rebate that can be applied to your annual tax returns — but that means people may be waiting weeks or even months for their stimulus money to show up through their tax refund.
why is it saying payment not available?
this was a message that frustrated many consumers in the first round of checks, and resulted from a number of issues, such as if the irs was still verifying whether a person qualified for a check.
some people are receiving this message with the second round of stimulus checks, which the irs says either means the person doesn't qualify for a check — such as if their income exceeds the eligibility threshold — or the irs says it was unable to issue you an eip 2 payment, which is the irs' term for the second stimulus check.
the irs said that it might not be able to issue a second stimulus payment if it is still processing your most recent tax return.
what if i receive social security through the direct express debit card?
the irs says that people who receive government benefits such as social security, railroad retirement benefits, supplemental security income or veteran's benefits through direct express — a debit card that automatically receives payments — will get their second stimulus checks deposited onto that card.
but the irs cautioned, the bank information shown in get my payment will be a number associated with your direct express card and may be a number you don't recognize.
lansing, mich. --- larry nassar, the sports doctor accused of sexually assaulting more than 150 women and girls, will be confronted again this week by scores of victims as he faces another prison sentence for molesting gymnasts, this time at an elite michigan club run by an olympic coach. judge janice cunningham has set aside three days for roughly 60 people who want to confront nassar or have their statement read in court.
the event could unfold much the same as a hearing last week in another county that ended with nassar getting sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison. the judge in that case described it as signing the doctor's death warrant.
inaction is an action. silence is indifference. justice requires action and a voice -- and that is what has happened here in this court, judge rosemarie aquilina said last week before announcing the sentence. she said it was her honor and privilege to sentence nassar.
the practice of allowing accusers to speak even if they are not tied directly to a case has raised questions about fairness. but attorneys say the victim statements probably pose little risk on appeal, especially since nassar pleaded guilty, agreed to allow the statements and is expected to get another long prison sentence as part of his deal with prosecutors.
if you get what you bargained for, then you really can't argue that you were prejudiced in any way, said margaret raben, former leader of a michigan association of criminal defense attorneys.
it's not uncommon for prosecutors to introduce aggravating evidence at sentencing to support their request for a severe punishment. but the parade of victims offering emotional accounts of their abuse to the face of an abuser went well beyond the typical hearing.
raben said there was a horrible dynamic last week in judge rosemarie aquilina's courtroom, even if the judge had the option to allow so many people to speak in a case that involved just seven victims.
her obvious delight was just off the wall, raben said, referring to aquilina's death warrant remark and others. i am not defending larry nassar at all, but what i saw with her was a real abandonment of judicial demeanor. ... the process doesn't change because everybody hates the defendant. that is the absolute glory, or should be, of the american justice system.
a fellow ingham county judge, william collette, said aquilina's handling of the hearing was outrageous. others, however, have praised her treatment of victims and their parents.
the case on cunningham's docket wednesday in eaton county centers on nassar's assaults at twistars, a lansing-area gymnastics club that was run by 2012 olympic coach john geddert. nassar admits penetrating three girls with his hands when he was supposed to be treating them for injuries.
so far, 57 victims want to speak in court or submit statements. attorney mick grewal said 11 of his clients have signed up, including some who were inspired by the 150-plus young women and girls who appeared in aquilina's court. he called it a cathartic experience.
now they're at a point in their healing process where they want to confront larry, and they want to show the world that they are survivors and they are strong and they are part of this movement, grewal said. it helps them through the healing process.
he said the nassar cases are extraordinary in the number of victims who have come forward.
the only case that's out there that's even similar in stature is penn state, and this is now six times as big as penn state, maybe seven times, grewal said, referring to boys who said they were sexually abused by assistant football coach jerry sandusky.
the last witness to speak at nassar's sentencing hearing last week was rachael denhollander, a kentucky lawyer and one of the first women to publicly identify herself as one of nassar's young victims. denhollander contacted michigan state university police in 2016 after reading reports about how usa gymnastics, which trains olympians, mishandled complaints of sexual misconduct. nassar worked at michigan state and also was the national gymnastics squad's doctor.
denhollander said nassar groped, fondled and penetrated her with his hands when she was a 15-year-old gymnast in michigan.
larry, i can call what you did evil and wicked because it was, denhollander said wednesday.
you have become a man ruled by selfish and perverted desires, she said.
the nassar scandal has continued to trigger developments across the country, from texas to the nation's capital. texas gov. greg abbott ordered a criminal investigation tuesday after victims said they were assaulted by nassar at the karolyi ranch, a famous texas facility that was the training ground for u.s. women's gymnastics. the ranch is owned by former national team coordinators bela and martha karolyi.
usa gymnastics cut ties with the ranch earlier this month, a few days after olympic champion simone biles said she dreaded the thought of having to return there to train.
it is impossibly difficult to relive these experiences and it breaks my heart even more to think that as i work towards my dream of competing in tokyo 2020, i will have to continually return to the same training facility where i was abused, biles said in a statement.
in michigan, former gov. john engler was expected to become interim president at michigan state, according to a high-ranking school official involved in the plan. the official told the associated press that trustees would vote wednesday to hire engler. the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the decision had not been publicly announced. the school's top post is vacant after lou anna simon resigned last week.
engler will head the school as it confronts lawsuits filed by more than 100 women and girls, and investigations by the state attorney general, the ncaa and congress.
in washington, the senate considered a bill that would require governing bodies for amateur athletics to quickly report claims of abuse to law enforcement.
moonlight is a coming-of-age movie that's come in for a lot of critical acclaim, not to mention a bundle of oscar nominations.
so, will they call out its name after they ask for the envelope please? here's nancy giles:
a timid boy named chiron is having a tough time growing up in liberty city, one of miami's poorest neighborhoods.
kevin: you just is, that's all.
the other kids taunt chiron because he's different.
paula: you ever see the way he walk, juan?
juan: you watch your damn mouth.
paula: you gonna tell him why the other boys kick his ass all the time, huh?
his single mom is a crack addict, his surrogate parents the local drug dealer and his girlfriend.
moonlight is one of the season's most-talked-about films. it won the golden globe for best picture-drama, and it was just nominated for eight academy awards, including best picture. not bad for an independent film made in just 25 days for less than $5 million.
in addition to best picture, barry jenkins has two more oscar nominations for moonlight: best director and best adapted screenplay.
giles asked jenkins, have people noticed, by the way, that there are no white characters in the movie?
people have noticed, yeah, he replied. you know, it wasn't a conscious decision, but, you know, i didn't know any white people who weren't teachers until i was, like, a freshman in college. and i walked in and my roommate was white. i didn't have any white friends. there were just no white people around. and we tried to have fidelity to the world the characters live in.
moonlight, director barry jenkins' evocative tale of a young man's coming-of-age. david bornfriend/a24
jenkins and playwright tarell alvin mccraney both grew up in liberty city; they know the neighborhood where the film takes place. they both attended the same elementary school, at different times.
mccraney wrote the original script upon which barry jenkins based moonlight. they lived a few blocks away from each other in liberty city, but didn't actually meet until they started working on the movie. while mccraney is gay and jenkins is straight, they say they put a lot of themselves into the story, such as a fight scene involving the central character.
it happened in that space, mccraney said. and it was probably one of the most terrifying moments for me, 'cause it was always -- you just never knew what was gonna happen.
so lunch time could be a really terrifying time for you? giles asked.
yeah, lunch time was never a time for eating.
mccraney, a macarthur genius grant recipient, and jenkins share a terrible coincidence: both of their mothers were crack users, and both became hiv positive as a result.
i do know that there was a deep pain that she was trying to hide, that she was trying to alleviate, mccraney said.
british actress naomie harris has portrayed a sea goddess in pirates of the caribbean and winnie mandela, among other roles. to play chiron's mom (for which she's received a best supporting actress oscar nomination), harris watched youtube interviews with crack users, and met with a woman who struggled with addiction.
i couldn't understand this concept, harris said. we know how destructive drugs are. so how does somebody get attracted to that, you know? and she has a son. and so i had so much judgment, actually, and i really had to work very hard to overcome that judgment.
what you do as an actor is you're inhabiting souls. and you're asking those souls to come into your space. and you could only do that in a non-judgmental way.
chiron is actually portrayed at three ages by three different actors. but to play little chiron, 12-year-old alex hibbert didn't do the preparation that the other, more experienced performers did.
how did he do it? i don't know, he said. i don't know. i just went with what they told me to do, and then i just got into the character that they told me to be, and just went on from there.
hibbert, also from miami near liberty city, had acted in school plays, but never in a movie.
mahershala ali said, alex is the best scene partner that i've ever had. i say that sincerely. he's so wise for his age. he was such a professional, but he's also a kid.
ali, whom you may recognize from hidden figures and house of cards, plays the hibbert's character's father figure.
what i learned in working with him was to try to do less and work to not act, ali said. and that's an important reminder for someone like myself who's been very fortunate to be working for a couple of decades now.
giles asked hibbert, how does that make you feel?
amazing, because same to him, he replied.
ali (now a best supporting actor oscar nominee) shares two memorable scenes with hibbert: one in which chiron learns to swim.
jenkins explained, what's happening is alex hibbert, our non-actor, actually does not know how to swim. and mahershala is actually teaching him how to swim as this storm is coming in off the coast.
and there's another scene, in which chiron learns who he is.
juan: a faggot is ... a word used to make gay people feel bad.
juan: no. no. you could be gay, but don't let anybody call you no faggot.
giles asked, when you typed the word 'faggot' for the first time, and you saw it on the page, what did you think?
bomb! jenkins laughed. i thought it was a bomb. yeah, it was scary.
hibbert added, at first i was watching to see if my mom was there, 'cause my mom is very strict and she doesn't like me saying 'words.'
ali said of filming that scene, it felt sacred that day, it really did. i felt like we made a little bit of magic that day.
moonlight is far from a blockbuster; it's made just $16 million so far. but its eight oscar nods and critical acclaim may help the movie reach a larger audience.
it's an opportunity for us to learn about people who haven't had an opportunity to speak for themselves, ali said.
jenkins said, i think it's really important to remind, reinforce people that their lives have value, you know? that their lives have worth.
harris added, it bypasses the mind and it speaks straight to your heart, and also it shows just how, like, we all on some level are damaged. and we are all coming from this wounded place in our search for connection and love. and i think just seeing that really helps people understand their journey and helps people understand each other. and i think now, more than ever, we need that reminder.
giles asked hibbert, how are your friends reacting to all of this?
oh, they're all, like, 'alex, you're a big movie star now. slide me some change!' he laughed.
and what do you do when they say, 'slide me some change'?
i be, like, 'i got you,' but … hibbert laughed.
she's best remembered for her iconic tv roles, but mary tyler moore also found success -- and some setbacks -- on broadway and in the movies.
when moore jumped from the small to the big screen, she stepped into new roles -- and a new image far from the sweetheart mary, revealing something her fans had never seen before.
in flirting with disaster, she plays a crazy mom … and she's wonderful, exclaimed david edelstein, a movie critic for cbs sunday morning and new york magazine.
in terms of movies, how will mary tyler moore be remembered? cbs news correspondent peter vant sant asked edelstein.
as a cautionary tale, he remarked.
cautionary, edelstein says, because mary tyler moore struggled on the big screen.
she just wasn't comfortable with that kind of acting, he explained. the elvis movie 'change of habit' really sank her movie career. … elvis, you know, in the ghetto with a nun played by mary tyler moore was just too much.
one notable exception was moore's oscar-nominated role in the critically acclaimed 1980 movie, ordinary people, where she left her cheerful laura petrie character lying on the kitchen floor.
by not doing what she usually did, she was able to give an extraordinary performance, said edelstein.
it's a performance she talked about with charlie rose in 1995:
mary tyler moore: i came through that thinking that i was playing my father … and was shortly thereafter to realize that i was playing myself.
mary tyler moore: expectations, perfectionism, loath to communicate any failings.
in 'ordinary people,' you know, she dug pretty deep in herself, i think, for that character. but she should have won an oscar for it, said actor dick van dyke.
throughout her long acting career, moore produced and starred in plays, including sweet sue. she won a tony award for a role as a quadriplegic in the play, whose life is it anyway?
in 2012, moore was honored for her remarkable body of work.
she did win the screen actors guild lifetime achievement award, which includes big screen and small screen right? van sant asked edelstein.
the screen actor's guild was not for the big screen, trust me, edelstein replied. it was for laura petrie and it was for mary richards. …anyone who, in this lifetime, gives us a character like laura petrie and mary richards, can really die happy, you know?
new york governor andrew cuomo said tuesday a new covid-19 strain that was detected in the state after it was first identified in the united kingdom last month could be a game changer. he called it highly problematic.
this is a virus we have to be extra careful with, the governor said at a press conference.
the state's first confirmed diagnosis of the contagious new strain was detected in saratoga springs. the man who tested positive is affiliated with a jewelry store there, cbs new york reported. the person had no known travel history, cuomo said.
the governor urged anyone who was exposed, or who was exposed to someone who was exposed, to contact state officials. there's nothing to be ashamed of, he said. this is a virus that travels. but we have to know. containment is vitally important here.
experts say there's no evidence the new strain is resistant to the vaccines and the infections are no more severe. but the governor said this week since it is more transmissible it could lead to more cases and more hospitalizations.
even if the lethality doesn't go up, the fact that it is so much more transmittable is a very real problem, he said.
apparently the u.k. strain can actually overtake the original covid strain in a matter of weeks, he said tuesday. that's how quickly it can transmit.
it dramatically increases our challenge and we have to be aware of it, he said.
in late december, colorado became the first state to confirm a case of the variant, in a man in his 20s with no travel history. southern california reported a case soon after in a 30-year-old man with no travel history, and public health officials in florida said they had also discovered evidence of a case in a man in his 20s with no travel history.
democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg says he would pay more to uncle sam under his plan to raise taxes on wealthy americans. what the former new york city mayor hasn't said: he'd pay as much as $3.5 billion less under his wealth tax than he would under similar proposals from senators bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, two of his rivals for the party's nomination. bloomberg's plan would also generate far less government revenue.
bloomberg, who released his tax plan last week, said the proposal targets the very rich. that includes him: bloomberg is worth an estimated $61 billion, according to forbes.
much of that fortune is tied to bloomberg llc, the global financial data and media empire he founded four decades ago. the candidate owns 88% of the company, which generated an estimated $3.8 billion in income last year alone, according to industry consultant douglas taylor. and his nearly 90% ownership stake in the media enterprise entitled him to about $3.3 billion of that income stream.
bloomberg would certainly pay significantly more in taxes under his tax proposals than what he is paying under the current tax code. but that's not unique. all of the major democratic presidential candidates are proposing tax plans that would raise taxes on the wealthy.
what's more, even outside his proposed wealth tax, bloomberg's broader tax plan could save him and his company millions versus what he would pay under plans proposed by his rivals. for instance, bloomberg would raise the corporate tax rate to 28% from a current 21%, but not all the way back to the 35% where it was before president donald trump and congressional republicans lowered it in late 2017. (rivals like pete buttigieg, sanders and warren would like to roll back mr. trump's corporate tax cut completely.) that 2017 corporate-rate change saved bloomberg's company roughly $550 million last year.
bloomberg's campaign declined to comment on what he would personally pay under his tax plan or that of other candidates.
we don't have nor discuss mike's personal financials, a bloomberg campaign spokesperson said. mike is in the highest tax bracket now, and he would be in the highest tax bracket under the plan he released.
the bloomberg campaign also hasn't released a detailed explanation of his tax plan, while independent tax experts have yet to evaluate it. here's a breakdown of what we currently know — and don't know — about bloomberg's wealth tax proposal and how it compares to what other democratic candidates have proposed, including sanders and warren as well as joe biden, pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar.
how much more bloomberg would pay under his proposed wealth tax: $1.2 billion per year, compared to his current tax bill.
how it would work: a key in understanding bloomberg's plan to tax the rich is that it isn't really a wealth tax — it's simply an income tax. that means it would be easier to administer than a wealth tax.
bloomberg's wealth tax is an incremental change, and that's an advantage because it won't require the construction of a new administration of the irs to put in place, said janet holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the urban-brookings tax policy center. but it will also create a lot less new tax liability for the wealthy.
currently, the top tax rate for all income over $500,000 is 37%. bloomberg's proposal adds a new tax of 5% on incomes over $5 million a year. he calls that a new surtax on high incomes, but it's essentially just adding a higher tax bracket.
bloomberg also plans to raise that base rate — before the surcharge — for income above $500,000 to 39.6%, which is what it was under president barack obama. that would bring the highest income tax rate under bloomberg's plan to 44.6%. that's still less than sanders's top proposed income rate of 52%, but more than what the other campaigns are proposing.
how many people would pay bloomberg's wealth surcharge: income taxes generally hit a larger portion of the population than wealth taxes. but that might not be true for bloomberg's wealth surcharge, even though it is structured as an income tax.
roughly 11,000 americans earned at least $5 million in 2017, according to the latest available statistics from the social security administration. include investment income from things like gains on stock sales or flipping houses, and many more people would pay bloomberg's wealth surcharge — it just isn't clear how many.
as of 2017, there were 143,000 tax fillings that reported income of $2.4 million or more, and 14,300 with that nearly $13 million or more. so the number is likely somewhere between those two.
how much government revenue it would raise: bloomberg's tax proposals would generate a total of $5 trillion in new government revenue over a decade, according to his campaign. but that is for all of his proposals — not just the wealth tax.
based on earned income alone, bloomberg's surcharge targeting the rich wouldn't raise much, maybe around $4 billion a year, or $40 billion over a decade. consider all forms of income, however, and the potential haul could be roughly $1.8 trillion over a decade, based on the university of pennsylvania's penn wharton budget model estimate of $200 billion a year from just raising the capital gains tax to 42% (slightly less than the 44.6% top rate that bloomberg is proposing). about $140 billion of that would come from the top 1% of all earners.
how much more bloomberg would pay under sanders's proposed wealth tax: $4.7 billion.
how it would work: sanders's plan is a true wealth tax. after that, it gets complicated.
sanders is proposing eight wealth tax brackets that start at 1% for couples with wealth above $32 million, and goes up to 8% for wealth above $10 billion. tax thresholds are cut in half for individuals, who would start paying his 1% wealth tax at $16 million.
the advantage of a wealth tax is that it taxes all types of assets, not just income. for instance, it would capture those who have inherited their fortune or got to eight figures from investments.
the disadvantage is that the government would have to create a whole new system to asses wealth — including real estate and private business ownership — and then tax it. that wouldn't be cheap. and many experts say it's even easier for rich people to avoid a wealth tax than an income tax as they can shelter much of their wealth overseas.
how many people would pay the wealth tax: the sanders wealth tax would likely affect more americans than those who would pay bloomberg's surcharge. the sanders tax would be paid by the 180,000 wealthiest american families, according to his campaign and an independent assessment from economists and income-inequality experts emmanuel saez and gabriel zucman. that's about 40,000 more households than bloomberg's wealth tax.
how much government revenue it would raise: the sanders campaign says $4.4 trillion over a decade. penn wharton's analysis puts the revenue projection at $3.3 trillion, and possibly as low as $2.8 billion if the wealth tax slows the economy.
how much more bloomberg would pay under warren's proposed wealth tax: $3.7 billion.
how it would work: warren's plan, like sanders, is a direct tax on wealth. but her blueprint is simpler.
there are just two brackets for both couples and individuals: warren is proposing that millionaires pay a 2% tax on all their wealth above $50 million. billionaires would pay 6%. that should make administering a wealth tax slightly easier, but still more complicated than just raising income tax rates, as bloomberg proposes.
how many people would pay: the warren campaign, as well as economists saez and zucman, say her tax plan would affect 70,000 households. but another study by a trio of economists estimated that nearly 300,000 people would have to pay warren's wealth tax for it to generate the total money warren says it could.
how much government revenue it would raise: saez and zucman peg the expected revenue from her wealth tax at $4 trillion. penn wharton estimates it at $2.7 trillion, and $500 billion less, or $2.3 billion, if her wealth taxes slow the economy.
how much more bloomberg would pay under the other candidates' proposed tax hikes: $1 billion.
how their plans would work: neither joe biden, pete buttigieg nor amy klobuchar are proposing a designated wealth tax. of the three, only klobuchar has said she is open to one. buttigieg called warren's wealth tax extreme.
in fact, biden and buttigieg are proposing to tax billionaires like bloomberg less than what the media mogul has outlined. klobuchar is proposing a 30% minimum alternative tax for those earning more than $1 million a year, but hasn't given many details on how it would work.
instead, and like bloomberg, all three want to raise income taxes on the wealthy, mostly by taxing investment gains at the same rate as wages. that would hit the rich more than average americans who may not participate in the stock market beyond their 401(k)s, iras and other pre-tax retirement plans.
the candidates have also proposed returning income tax rates for top earners to where they were before president trump took office. that would raise the tax on capital gains to 39.6% from its current top rate of 20%.
how many people would pay more tax: the biden, buttigieg and klobuchar plans are by far the broadest because their additional tax revenue would come from raising the capital gains tax on all americans, not just the super wealthy.
as of 2017, some 1.4 million american households had annual income of more than $500,000. nearly all of them would likely pay more under the three candidates' plans.
how much government revenue they would raise: penn wharton has said biden's total tax plan can generate $2.6 trillion over a decade. but that includes everything from raising the corporate income tax to eliminating tax breaks for companies that produce fossil fuels. about half of that, or $1.3 trillion, would be raised from top wage earners, according to penn wharton's calculations.
the buttigieg and klobuchar plans have not been analyzed by an outside group. neither campaign responded to comment for this article.
editor's note: cbs moneywatch senior reporter stephen gandel is a former employee of bloomberg llc.
correction: an earlier version of this story said that candidate mike bloomberg wanted to maintain the current 21% corporate income tax rate. in fact, the candidate has said he would like to raise it to 28%.
a condition that doctors used to only see in factory workers is becoming more widespread.
the pain that comes from the repetitive movements of texting has been dubbed smartphone thumb by doctors.
it's actually tendinitis, when the tendon that bends and flexes the thumb becomes inflamed. more and more people are complaining about this type of pain in their thumb each year, say doctors at the mayo clinic.
my phone is a huge part of my life, scott seehusen told cbs minnesota recently as he sat alone with his smartphone at a picnic table by lake calhoun, in minneapolis.
i do everything from texting to emails, social media. everything, he said.
dr. kristin zhao, a biomedical engineer at the mayo clinic in rochester, minnesota, explained what might be happening inside the hand to cause smartphone thumb.
one of the hypotheses is that the joints get loose and lax, and because of that, the bones kind of move differently than they would in a normal situation, said zhao.
zhao and a team of colleagues have been studying smartphone thumb for the last seven years. she says the movements we require our thumbs to make as we hold our phones are awkward.
it's also a movement that requires some force through the thumbs. so when you press on your phone, you know, you're interacting with your phone. it's not just free movement in space, she said.
mayo clinic researchers began using a dynamic imaging technique in 2010 to watch the bones of a healthy patient move so they could document what's normal and compare it with what's not.
our hypothesis is that abnormal motion of bones in the thumb could be causing pain onset and eventual osteoarthritis, zhao said.
could too much texting lead to more cases of arthritis in the thumb? zhao says maybe.
there is a high incidence of osteoarthritis in the thumb, and we just want to make sure we aren't encouraging that onset by our daily activities, she said.
another concern the researchers want to address is the impact of so much thumb movement on children. what it will mean for them later in life is unknown.
we really don't understand why adults get pain, and so children, if you start earlier, you may get pain younger, she said.
to prevent problems, start by giving your thumbs a break, doctors say. mix up your method by using your forefinger to peck the screen, or use your voice to dictate a message.
you can also perform daily stretching exercises with your wrists and fingers to keep your tendons limber.
think about wow often you're using your joints and how often you are resting them, advises zhao.
are we taking periodic rests, or are we just exposing continually over the course of the day? she asked.
it could be a tough habit to break, though.
frequent texter samantha alsadi, who was walking her dog and using her phone at the same lake where cbs minnesota found seehusen, said, i don't know if it will change people's, like, habits or addiction to their phone, but it's nice to know that we're already thinking ahead about that.
the mayo clinic study is ongoing, and researchers have not yet reached any conclusions. but what doctors do already know about osteoarthritis in the thumb is that it occurs more in women than men.
reverb is a new documentary series from cbsn originals. watch the latest episode, rising tide: priced out in miami, in the video player above.
alba hernandez lives in one of miami's few affordable pockets. she's owned her mobile home in the city's little river neighborhood since 2003. when she moved in, rent for the patch of land under her house was $245 a month — below what she'd pay for an equivalent apartment in the city.
hernandez was used to the less-than-$20-a-month increases she would get every year. but two years ago, she got a rude surprise. the trailer park had a new owner who wanted to hike hernandez's rent to $700 — a nearly 50% increase.
i can't find the money at this moment. that is impossible for me in this moment, said hernandez, who lives on a fixed income and says medical issues prevent her from working.

hernandez and many of her neighbors in the community of 800 are fighting the hike in court. the new owner, miami soar management corp., responded by sending more than 100 eviction notices. the case is ongoing, and hernandez said the stress from the twice-a-week letters from the landowners exacerbates her health issues.
they don't like us. they don't worry about us. they want more money, she told cbs news.
the scenario is a common one in many low-income communities in increasingly pricey cities. but in low-lying miami, it's more than real estate speculation driving the new owners. it's also the fear of climate change.
the city, whose most exclusive neighborhoods are close to the sea and barely above sea level, is increasingly getting flooded during high tides. the city is moving to raise streets and sidewalks by two feet, at a cost of about $1 million a block, but adaptation will only be a partial help. water is rising right through the ground, permeating the porous limestone on which much of miami sits. the sea walls other cities are considering won't work here.
increasingly, the wealthy residents living near miami's shores are looking at another option: move inland to higher ground, to historically less desirable neighborhoods populated by working-class people.
even mobile home parks, because of where they are, are vulnerable to such gentrification.
residents of a mobile home community in miami's little river neighborhood are concerned about being pushed out. cbs news
you don't really find mobile home parks in miami beach. you find them more inland. and now as developers are looking inland for long-term development, these mobile home parks are vulnerable, said nejla calvo, an attorney representing hernandez and the 800 other residents of the soar mobile home park.
in the last five years, greater miami has lost seven mobile-home parks, or about 700 housing units, calvo estimated. one of these parks is now home to magic city, a multimillion-dollar development that will eventually include 2,600 housing units. rents for those are not yet set.
mobile home parks are one of the few affordable options in a country that's seen skyrocketing housing costs. in florida, 1 in 6 housing units is a mobile home, calvo told cbs news.
despite their name, most mobile homes are affixed to the ground and not readily moveable. so if a homeowner loses the land they've been renting, their options are to abandon the site and move in with relatives in miami or leave the city altogether, calvo said.
i, unfortunately, expect to see more in the years to come because there's a limited amount of space in miami that's developable, calvo said. these mobile home parks are located in areas that are more and more desirable, especially with climate change and with flooding and areas in highlands are more attractive to developers.
just the dirt of the land itself is worth far more than the original owner could ever have imagined 50 years ago, said martin feldman, an attorney for miami soar management corp. you're talking about a million dollars of square foot property here.
the company plans to develop the plot in the next three to four years, building luxury housing along with up to 2,500 units of affordable housing, feldman said. he added that none of the mobile home residents would be forced to move if they didn't want to. he also denied that mobile home residents have been evicted, describing the eviction notices as a negotiating tactic.
but some residents of the park, unwilling to fight the rent hikes, have already left, calvo said. while about half of the 100 eviction attempts were dismissed, about 20 are still pending, she said.
for hernandez, whose only child lives in honduras, leaving isn't option, and neither is moving into her sister's already full house. they've looked for someplace else to live, but so far, they've had no luck.
it's the same problem, she said. the money. the money is a problem in this country.
cia director gina haspel has named cynthia didi rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the directorate of analysis. rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months.
didi rapp brings broad, deep expertise from across the agency and the intelligence community to her new role as the head of our directorate of analysis, said cia director of public affairs brittany bramell. with her engaging leadership style and reputation for objectivity, didi will excel in leading our talented analytic cadre.
rapp previously served as deputy chief operating officer at cia and headed up intelligence integration at the office of the director of national intelligence, where she helped oversee the production of the president's daily brief (pdb). the third woman to hold the post since 2002, rapp succeeds longtime incumbent richard hoch, who will serve as chief strategy officer for the agency.
as head of the directorate of analysis – which was once known as the directorate of intelligence – rapp will oversee the agency's efforts to synthesize intelligence from the cia's operations arm and other elements of the intelligence community, including open source data and satellite imagery. agency analysts take raw intelligence from abroad, offer regional expertise and put it into context. they interact directly with policymakers throughout government and play a lead role in informing the pdb.
the deputy director for analysis is one of the most important positions at cia, said michael morell, a former cia deputy and acting director who also served as the agency's head of analysis from 2008 to 2010. didi has extensive experience as an analyst, she has deep integrity, and she has the confidence of the director — all things necessary for someone to effectively lead the da. morell is also a cbs news senior national security contributor.
rapp will be the first to newly assume the role since former cia director john brennan's modernization push, which shifted some oversight away from larger directorates and funneled them into discrete mission centers focused on some of the thorniest issue areas in national security. under that structure, analysts and operations officers work side by side.
analytic issues facing the agency range from the threat posed by near-peer competitors like russia and china, to persistent proliferation concerns from north korea and iran, to the national security implications of climate change, to incorporating big data and other analytic inputs into its assessments, said david priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer during the clinton and george w. bush administrations. the new dda will have to see how well analysis is being incorporated into ops, and vice versa.
rapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. a former clandestine operations officer who in may became the first female director of the cia, haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many cia veterans and insiders.
thirty-four-year agency veteran beth kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in december. sonya holt, who likewise spent over three decades at cia, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in august, when similarly long-serving cia officials vaughn bishop, now deputy director, and andy makridis, now chief operating officer (coo), were also named.
you've got a director, deputy director and coo who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, priess said. this is also leadership at cia at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. this could have gone in a very different direction.
haspel's immediate predecessor, mike pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, brian bulatao, to serve as coo. brennan chose associates from within the treasury department and national security council to be his deputies.
though some former intelligence officials have raised concerns about excessive insularity and the risks of creating an echo chamber at the agency, others praised the relative conservatism of haspel's choices at a time when the churn of personnel at a number of other government institutions have plunged them into turmoil.
the leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said ned price, a former cia analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the trump administration. they help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest.
now is not the time to radically remake the agency, price, who is now a fellow at the new america foundation, said. there's enough going on outside its walls.
although the cia and haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding president trump's decision to revoke brennan's security clearance last august; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist jamal khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, haspel's own involvement in the cia's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. in doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.
pompeo, during his year-long tenure as cia director, made both public appearances and unusually personal statements with some regularity. he sent a letter to the harvard kennedy school announcing his withdrawal from a speaking engagement and denouncing the school's decision to name chelsea manning, a former soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to wikileaks, a visiting fellow.
pompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to benjamin wittes, the editor-in-chief of lawfare, after wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card pompeo distributed to cia's workforce.
for her part, in the nearly eight months since she became director, haspel has issued only a handful of brief statements and made public remarks essentially once – at her alma mater, the university of louisville, in september.
i think director haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, morell said. in this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-trump or anti-trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.
former senior cia official carmen medina, who spent over three decades at the agency and served as deputy director of intelligence, agreed.
with this administration maybe the best thing she can do is make sure all the 'i's are dotted and 't's are crossed – it's a difficult time, medina said. you need a really firm foundation and to make sure everything is being done well before you have the space to innovate.
medina also applauded haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up.
it's unfortunate we still have to talk about gender, because it's not really relevant to the quality of the work – it's relevant to the diversity of the work. but i think she's very brave for appointing so many women, medina said of haspel's leadership choices.
she doesn't have to do that, and the fact that she is doing it is kind of awesome.
netflix boss reed hastings isn't happy with a recent rule change for the cannes film festival regarding distribution -- even though his streaming platform got a pass for this year, at least.
after fielding complaints from french exhibitors about the growing footprint of streaming studios like netflix and amazon, the prestigious festival's board decided to adapt its rules regarding french distribution.
any film that wishes to compete in competition at cannes will have to commit itself to being distributed in french movie theaters, the board said in a statement, explaining that the new rule would go into effect for the 2018 festival.
the issue was raised by france's exhibitors' association, which disagreed with the festival including two netflix titles -- bong joon-ho's okja and noah baumbach's the meyerowitz stories -- that would go on to be released on the streaming platform.
cannes is aware of the anxiety aroused by the absence of the release in theaters of those films in france. the festival de cannes asked netflix in vain to accept that these two films could reach the audience of french movie theaters and not only its subscribers, the statement said. the festival regrets that no agreement has been reached.
hastings responded to the rule change with a pointed facebook post. the establishment closing ranks against us, he wrote wednesday. see 'okja' on netflix june 28th. amazing film that theatre chains want to block us from entering into cannes film festival competition.
as cannes' rules now stand, netflix will have to agree to strict french theatrical distribution deals in order to have its films included in the festival in 2018 and beyond.
fotis dulos, who was charged three weeks ago with killing his estranged wife, denied the allegations against him in a suicide note, according to a photograph of the note provided to cbs news by dulos' attorney. after apparently attempting suicide tuesday in his connecticut home, dulos was pronounced dead by his attorney on thursday.
if you are reading this i am no more, dulos wrote in the note. i refuse to spend even an hour more in jail for something i had nothing to do with. enough is enough. if it takes my head to end this, so be it.
police found dulos unresponsive tuesday, while he was sitting in his running vehicle inside the garage of his mansion. dulos had been on house arrest after he was released from jail on $6 million bond in early january.
dulos' attorney, norm pattis, told cbs news that dulos apparently tried to kill himself by carbon monoxide poisoning.
dulos' estranged wife jennifer was last seen dropping her five children off at school in may. police said in dulos' arrest warrant that they believe her estranged husband drove his employee's truck to their home and waited for his wife.
investigators added that they found evidence of a clean up in the garage. prosecutors added that investigators also found jennifer's blood mixed with fotis' dna on a sink.
the arrest warrant also claimed that dulos had his employees truck washed and detailed, and tried to get the employee to change the truck's seats. police later found jennifer's dna in the truck, according to the warrant.
dulos' ex-girlfriend, michelle troconis, and his friend and former attorney, kent mawhinney, were also charged with conspiracy to commit murder in her death, and have been released on bail.
in the note, fulos insisted that troconis and mawhinney had nothing to do with jennifer's disappearance, and asked the state to let the pair free of any such accusations.
please let my children know that i love them, i would do anything to be them, but unfortunately we all have our limits. the state will not rest until i rot in jail, he wrote.
i want to thank all my family and friends that stood by me... he added. i am sorry for letting you down and not continuing the fight.
indianapolis -- usa gymnastics says its entire board of directors will resign as requested by the u.s. olympic committee. the move came friday in the fallout from the larry nassar sexual abuse scandal.
the former usa gymnastics sports doctor pleaded guilty to molesting girls and young women. some of the nation's top gymnasts, including olympians aly raisman, mckayla maroney, simone biles and jordyn wieber, said they were among his victims.
the usoc had threatened to decertify the gymnastics organization, which besides picking u.s. national teams is the umbrella organization for hundreds of clubs across the country. a handful of board members had stepped down, but the usoc said a wholesale change was needed. the usoc has also demanded much tighter reporting from usa gymnastics on reforms it is making. it also required all usag staff and board members to complete various safety and ethics training courses over the next six months.
nassar was sentenced to 40 to 175 years in prison wednesday -- the seventh day of a remarkable hearing that gave girls, young women and their parents a chance to confront nassar in court.
i just signed your death warrant, judge rosemarie aquilina said as she sentenced nassar.
i find that you don't get it -- that you're a danger. you remain a danger, she said.
aquilina said it was her honor and privilege to sentence nassar.
on friday, michigan state athletic director mark hollis announced his retirement in the wake of the nassar scandal. he was the second university official to step down this week amid sharp criticism over the school's handling of allegations against the former doctor.
hollis, who had been in the job for 10 years, disclosed the move during a meeting with a small group of reporters on campus. he was asked why he would not stay on.
because i care, hollis said, holding back tears. when you look at the scope of everything, that's the reason i made a choice to retire now. and i hope that has a little bit, a little bit, of helping that healing process.
on january 2, 2021, earth is closer to the sun in its elliptical orbit than on any other day of the year, marking an annual event known as perihelion.
the word perihelion is translated from ancient greek, meaning near the sun. according to earthsky, earth was expected to reach perihelion on saturday morning at 8:51 a.m. et.
the sun is about 3% larger in the sky on saturday — not enough to be noticeable with the naked eye. remember: you should never look at the sun without proper eye protection, and sunglasses are not a sufficient replacement for solar-viewing glasses.
earth's orbit is not a perfect circle, meaning sometimes the planet is a bit closer to our star, and sometimes it is farther away. the distance varies by about 3 million miles over the course of the year — nearly 13 times the distance from earth to the moon.
perihelion also marks the moment when the earth is moving at its fastest in its orbit around the sun. the planet is currently racing around the sun at almost 19 miles per second — about .6 miles per second farther than when it reaches its farthest point from the sun in july.
✨ this new year comes with cosmic treats! in january, our planet will be at its closest point in orbit around the sun, known as perihelion. we'll also get a chance to see uranus near the moon and mars and spot a fast-moving mercury. 🔭 skywatching tips: https://t.co/htlepz1khx pic.twitter.com/bx3wdud7ue — nasa jpl (@nasajpl) december 31, 2020
if you run east at local midnight, you will be moving about as fast as you can (at least in sun-centered coordinates) for your location, nasa said.
because of this, summer in the northern hemisphere lasts about five days longer than winter, according to earthsky. the opposite is true in the southern hemisphere.
although sunlight is more intense on saturday, winter in the northern hemisphere is unaffected, due to the 23.5-degree tilt of earth's axis. being closer to the sun does not change the earth's tilt, so the north pole is still tilted away from the sun.
six months from now, on july 5, earth will be at its farthest from the sun, known as its aphelion, meaning far from the sun. at perihelion, earth is about 91.5 million miles from the sun, and at aphelion, it is around 94.5 million miles away.
between perihelion and aphelion, there is about a 6.7% difference in the intensity of the sunlight as it hits our planet. according to nasa, this is one explanation for more extreme seasons in the southern hemisphere compared to the northern hemisphere.
the perihelion isn't the only celestial event this weekend. saturday night into sunday morning also marks the peak of the quadrantid meteor shower — one of the best of the year.
