Earlier in the day, PG&E announced it will file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as it faces at least $30 billion in potential damages from lawsuits over catastrophic California wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that killed scores of people and destroyed thousands of homes. The announcement kicked off a 15-day window before the official filing. Newsom said he would like to stave off the bankruptcy but it may not be possible.
Former senior CIA official Carmen Medina, who spent over three decades at the agency and served as Deputy Director of Intelligence, agreed.
Mobile home parks are one of the few affordable options in a country that's seen skyrocketing housing costs. In Florida, 1 in 6 housing units is a mobile home, Calvo told CBS News.
For Hernandez, whose only child lives in Honduras, leaving isn't option, and neither is moving into her sister's already full house. They've looked for someplace else to live, but so far, they've had no luck.
Clearly PG&E has made a decision that the legislative arena is not where they feel they're going to get the kind of results that will go far enough, he said, adding that the decisions about PG&E's future now appear to be in the hands of bankruptcy court.
For her part, in the nearly eight months since she became director, Haspel has issued only a handful of brief statements and made public remarks essentially once – at her alma mater, the University of Louisville, in September.
Biggest issues in Michigan ahead of the Democratic primary CBSN's Elaine Quijano sits down with Jonathan Oosting, Michigan politics reporter for Bridge magazine, on Red and Blue. He talks about the significance of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's endorsement of Joe Biden, how Biden's and Bernie Sanders' climate change policies would affect autoworkers, and other key factors for Michigan voters.
Increasingly, the wealthy residents living near Miami's shores are looking at another option: Move inland to higher ground, to historically less desirable neighborhoods populated by working-class people.
Alba Hernandez lives in one of Miami's few affordable pockets. She's owned her mobile home in the city's Little River neighborhood since 2003. When she moved in, rent for the patch of land under her house was $245 a month — below what she'd pay for an equivalent apartment in the city.
You don't really find mobile home parks in Miami Beach. You find them more inland. And now as developers are looking inland for long-term development, these mobile home parks are vulnerable, said Nejla Calvo, an attorney representing Hernandez and the 800 other residents of the SOAR mobile home park.
It's the same problem, she said. The money. The money is a problem in this country.
Haspel's immediate predecessor, Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state, named Haspel as his deputy, but brought in his longtime business partner, Brian Bulatao, to serve as COO. Brennan chose associates from within the Treasury Department and National Security Council to be his deputies.
Sacramento, Calif. - The announcement by the nation's largest utility that it's filing for bankruptcy puts Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s problems squarely in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers, who now must try to keep ratepayer costs down, ensure wildfire victims get the money they're owed and rethink California's energy picture in the face of climate change.
CIA director Gina Haspel has named Cynthia Didi Rapp to the agency's senior-most position atop the Directorate of Analysis. Rapp, a career intelligence official with an analytic background, is not the first woman to hold the role, but she is the third female official and the fifth career intelligence official Haspel has named to a leadership post at the agency in recent months.
You've got a director, deputy director and COO who are all career intelligence officers, and two-thirds of whom are analysts – you'd have to go back decades for that to be true, Priess said. This is also leadership at CIA at a time of unprecedented institutional tension with the president – it's meaningful that it's not being run by the president's own people, but by career officers. This could have gone in a very different direction.
The Chapter 11 process allows us to work with these many constituents in one court-supervised forum to comprehensively address our potential liabilities and to implement appropriate changes.
The Deputy Director for Analysis is one of the most important positions at CIA, said Michael Morell, a former CIA deputy and acting director who also served as the agency's head of analysis from 2008 to 2010. Didi has extensive experience as an analyst, she has deep integrity, and she has the confidence of the director — all things necessary for someone to effectively lead the DA. Morell is also a CBS News senior national security contributor.
The leadership positions that she has filled give tremendous credibility to the idea that she is trying to keep the agency down a professional, honest path, said Ned Price, a former CIA analyst who resigned in protest and with some controversy at the start of the Trump administration. They help ensure the agency remains a bastion of unvarnished analysis and operational proposals that are in our best interest.
Just the dirt of the land itself is worth far more than the original owner could ever have imagined 50 years ago, said Martin Feldman, an attorney for Miami SOAR Management Corp. You're talking about a million dollars of square foot property here.
Analytic issues facing the agency range from the threat posed by near-peer competitors like Russia and China, to persistent proliferation concerns from North Korea and Iran, to the national security implications of climate change, to incorporating big data and other analytic inputs into its assessments, said David Priess, a former analyst and daily intelligence briefer during the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations. The new DDA will have to see how well analysis is being incorporated into ops, and vice versa.
Regardless of the solution, the process is likely to be long: 18 years after the company's last bankruptcy filing, PG&E customers still see a small fee on their monthly bills to pay for it, labeled the energy cost recovery amount.
Rapp's appointment, announced internally last month, underscores Haspel's apparent commitment to guiding the agency down a trajectory rooted in stability and deep institutional knowledge. A former clandestine operations officer who in May became the first female director of the CIA, Haspel has surrounded herself by officials with whom she has worked for decades. Seldom in history have the agency's most senior ranks been filled with as many CIA veterans and insiders.
Pompeo also personally wrote and sent a condescending missive to Benjamin Wittes, the editor-in-chief of Lawfare, after Wittes publicly questioned the contents of a holiday card Pompeo distributed to CIA's workforce.
They don't like us. They don't worry about us. They want more money, she told CBS News.
The scenario is a common one in many low-income communities in increasingly pricey cities. But in low-lying Miami, it's more than real estate speculation driving the new owners. It's also the fear of climate change.
Now is not the time to radically remake the agency, Price, who is now a fellow at the New America Foundation, said. There's enough going on outside its walls.
This issue is all about three fundamental things: It is about safety, it's about reliability and it's about affordability, Newsom told reporters Monday afternoon after spending the day in and out of meetings with lawmakers about the pending bankruptcy.
The bankruptcy is different from PG&E's bankruptcy in 2001, when California faced an energy crisis that caused power outages. Newsom said the state has an abundance of energy and power shutoffs are not imminent.
The city, whose most exclusive neighborhoods are close to the sea and barely above sea level, is increasingly getting flooded during high tides. The city is moving to raise streets and sidewalks by two feet, at a cost of about $1 million a block, but adaptation will only be a partial help. Water is rising right through the ground, permeating the porous limestone on which much of Miami sits. The sea walls other cities are considering won't work here.
Hernandez was used to the less-than-$20-a-month increases she would get every year. But two years ago, she got a rude surprise. The trailer park had a new owner who wanted to hike Hernandez's rent to $700 — a nearly 50% increase.
In the last five years, greater Miami has lost seven mobile-home parks, or about 700 housing units, Calvo estimated. One of these parks is now home to Magic City, a multimillion-dollar development that will eventually include 2,600 housing units. Rents for those are not yet set.
Medina also applauded Haspel's decision to name both more experienced analysts and more women to senior leadership roles. Overall, about half of the agency's analysts are women, as are about half of the directorate's senior managers, according to those familiar with the agency's make-up.
But some residents of the park, unwilling to fight the rent hikes, have already left, Calvo said. While about half of the 100 eviction attempts were dismissed, about 20 are still pending, she said.
Chapter 11 reorganization represents the only viable option to address the company's responsibilities to its stakeholders, Richard Kelly, chairman of PG&E's board of directors, said in a statement.
I, unfortunately, expect to see more in the years to come because there's a limited amount of space in Miami that's developable, Calvo said. These mobile home parks are located in areas that are more and more desirable, especially with climate change and with flooding and areas in Highlands are more attractive to developers.
The chances of victims getting what they would've gotten without a bankruptcy are not good, said state Sen. Bill Dodd, a Napa Democrat.
I think Director Haspel's decision to largely stay in the shadows is the right one, Morell said. In this political environment, where most public statements are labeled as pro-Trump or anti-Trump, it is wise to stay silent, particularly when running an agency whose credibility depends as being seen as an independent voice at the policy table.
In a Tuesday morning note, Height Securities noted the difficulty of finding a legislative fix for PG&E's complex problems. As of today, it wrote, we do not see a clear path to action that would avoid a bankruptcy filing.
Didi Rapp brings broad, deep expertise from across the agency and the intelligence community to her new role as the head of our Directorate of Analysis, said CIA Director of Public Affairs Brittany Bramell. With her engaging leadership style and reputation for objectivity, Didi will excel in leading our talented analytic cadre.

Newsom and legislative leaders carefully avoided laying out potential solutions in the hours after the bankruptcy announcement while stressing the importance of ensuring wildfire victims get the money they are owed. But no one has yet figured out the future of California energy policy as the state faces increasing threats -- and more wildfires -- as it copes with climate change.
It's unfortunate we still have to talk about gender, because it's not really relevant to the quality of the work – it's relevant to the diversity of the work. But I think she's very brave for appointing so many women, Medina said of Haspel's leadership choices.
She doesn't have to do that, and the fact that she is doing it is kind of awesome.
How much and what the state can do remains to be seen. Lawmakers last year tried to prevent a threatened PG&E bankruptcy resulting from the 2017 fires by letting the utility pass on some of its costs to ratepayers, a move some critics dubbed a bailout for the utility. Democratic Assemblyman Chris Holden had considering introducing a similar bill that would pass on the costs of 2018 fires, but on Monday he said he has backed off that idea.
The company plans to develop the plot in the next three to four years, building luxury housing along with up to 2,500 units of affordable housing, Feldman said. He added that none of the mobile home residents would be forced to move if they didn't want to. He also denied that mobile home residents have been evicted, describing the eviction notices as a negotiating tactic.
Even mobile home parks, because of where they are, are vulnerable to such gentrification.
We'd like to see it avoided, but we're not naive, he said. I respect the taxpayer, I respect the ratepayer and I'm absolutely cognizant of those that lost their homes.
PG&E serves about 40 percent of California's utility customers, Newsom said, making it the nation's largest utility. It operates in three-quarters of California's land most vulnerable to wildfires, Newsom said. While PG&E's equipment has been named the cause of multiple recent fires, experts blame climate change for extending California's wildfire season and making blazes more deadly and destructive.
Rapp will be the first to newly assume the role since former CIA Director John Brennan's modernization push, which shifted some oversight away from larger directorates and funneled them into discrete Mission Centers focused on some of the thorniest issue areas in national security. Under that structure, analysts and operations officers work side by side.
Thirty-four-year agency veteran Beth Kimber became the first woman to lead the agency's directorate of operations earlier in December. Sonya Holt, who likewise spent over three decades at CIA, assumed the role of chief diversity and inclusion officer in August, when similarly long-serving CIA officials Vaughn Bishop, now deputy director, and Andy Makridis, now chief operating officer (COO), were also named.
This company has been dishonest, it has prioritized profits way over safety and there has been no effort on their part to change that, he said. I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.
Climate change a key issue as voters head to polls on Super Tuesday Environmental policy is set to be a key issue as voters head to the polls on Super Tuesday. CBS News meteorologist and climate specialist Jeff Berardelli joins CBSN to discuss why climate change matters more this year than ever before.
As head of the Directorate of Analysis – which was once known as the Directorate of Intelligence – Rapp will oversee the agency's efforts to synthesize intelligence from the CIA's operations arm and other elements of the intelligence community, including open source data and satellite imagery. Agency analysts take raw intelligence from abroad, offer regional expertise and put it into context. They interact directly with policymakers throughout government and play a lead role in informing the PDB.
The Natural Resources Defense Council warned that bankruptcy could threaten billions in funding for PG&E's clean energy initiatives, which are key to California's environmental goals. PG&E is the state's largest investor in energy efficiency and electric vehicle infrastructure, said the NRDC's Ralph Cavanagh.
With this administration maybe the best thing she can do is make sure all the 'I's are dotted and 'T's are crossed – it's a difficult time, Medina said. You need a really firm foundation and to make sure everything is being done well before you have the space to innovate.
Pompeo, during his year-long tenure as CIA director, made both public appearances and unusually personal statements with some regularity. He sent a letter to the Harvard Kennedy School announcing his withdrawal from a speaking engagement and denouncing the school's decision to name Chelsea Manning, a former soldier convicted of leaking classified documents to WikiLeaks, a visiting fellow.
The filing wouldn't make the lawsuits disappear. It would result in all wildfire claims being consolidated into a single proceeding before a bankruptcy judge, not a jury. That could shield the company from excessive jury verdicts and buy time by putting a hold on the claims.

I can't find the money at this moment. That is impossible for me in this moment, said Hernandez, who lives on a fixed income and says medical issues prevent her from working.
Despite their name, most mobile homes are affixed to the ground and not readily moveable. So if a homeowner loses the land they've been renting, their options are to abandon the site and move in with relatives in Miami or leave the city altogether, Calvo said.
Hernandez and many of her neighbors in the community of 800 are fighting the hike in court. The new owner, Miami SOAR Management Corp., responded by sending more than 100 eviction notices. The case is ongoing, and Hernandez said the stress from the twice-a-week letters from the landowners exacerbates her health issues.
Newsom agreed PG&E hasn't been a trusted actor in the past, but he said the state must work collaboratively with the utility. He noted that a portion of its leadership is gone, including Chief Executive Geisha Williams, who resigned on Sunday with a $2.5 million severance package.
Democratic Sen. Jerry Hill said a PG&E bankruptcy may turn out to be a good thing. Hill represents San Bruno in the San Francisco Bay Area, where a PG&E natural gas pipeline exploded in 2010 and killed eight people.
Though some former intelligence officials have raised concerns about excessive insularity and the risks of creating an echo chamber at the agency, others praised the relative conservatism of Haspel's choices at a time when the churn of personnel at a number of other government institutions have plunged them into turmoil.
State officials are investigating whether the utility's equipment sparked the deadliest, most destructive wildfire in California history, a November blaze that killed at least 86 people and burned down 15,000 homes.
Rapp previously served as deputy chief operating officer at CIA and headed up intelligence integration at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, where she helped oversee the production of the President's Daily Brief (PDB). The third woman to hold the post since 2002, Rapp succeeds longtime incumbent Richard Hoch, who will serve as chief strategy officer for the agency.
Although the CIA and Haspel herself have been occasionally thrust into fundamentally political controversies – including those surrounding President Trump's decision to revoke Brennan's security clearance last August; the ongoing, highly-charged fallout from the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi; and, especially during her confirmation hearings, Haspel's own involvement in the CIA's post-9/11 enhanced interrogation and rendition programs – she has consistently avoided public exposure. In doing so she has arguably bucked a trend set in motion by her more press-friendly predecessors.
