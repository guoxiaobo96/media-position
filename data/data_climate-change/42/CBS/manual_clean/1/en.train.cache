With that warmth comes a surprising twist: Unusually warm Arctic winter temperatures are linked to bitter cold and snow in other parts of the Northern Hemisphere, such as the northeastern U.S., parts of northern Europe and northern Asia, according to an analysis of 66 years' worth of climate data.
These CBS News surveys were conducted by YouGov between January 16-23, 2020. A representative sample of 2,500 registered voters in Iowa was selected, including 1,401 self-identified Democrats, as well as registered voters who lean Democratic or plan to participate in the Democratic caucus this year. A representative sample of 14,575 registered voters was selected in 14 states expected to hold primaries on Super Tuesday (Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia). This sample includes 8,593 Democrats, and registered voters who lean Democratic or plan to vote in their state's Democratic primary. Both samples were weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based upon voter registration lists and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2016 presidential vote. Likely voters were determined using a model that takes into account self-reported likelihood of voting, along with other individual- and aggregate-level factors. The margins of error are 3.9 points in Iowa and 1.6 points in the Super Tuesday sample.
James Shaw, New Zealand's climate change minister, said the only reason 2016's Winston -- the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the Southern Hemisphere -- wasn't a Category 6 was because there is no such category. But we might need one in the future, Shaw said at the conference in New Zealand, The Guardian reported.
The climate is changing, and so are the turtles.
This week's election saw near record participation fueled in large part by voters under the age of 30 seeking change.
Is the impeachment trial putting Sanders at a disadvantage?
Incoming New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has quickly become a leading progressive voice in the freshman class, also said that she would not vote for the package on Twitter. In her tweet, Ocasio-Cortez said that the PAYGO rule is a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.

In 2010, she returned to office as a member of the Hawaii City Council. In 2012, she was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives. She comes from a multicultural, multi-religious family and, as a practicing Hindu, was the first Hindu elected to Congress.
Well, it's a song about wanting to be loved, but any time that I have a song that is meaningful to me, I try to turn it into something positive, says Lovato. So, to me, it's about vulnerability and I'd also like for the message to be about learning to love yourself.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness, I could have thrown up that morning. (LAUGH) I was so nervous. But— I kept kind of just coming back to the idea that what they're fighting for wasn't wrong. And I— I had also sat down with— with Leader Pelosi beforehand and she told me her story. She came from activism. And I knew that she would absolutely understand how advocacy can change the needle on really important issues.
Birds may have the gift of flight, yet Franzen points out they are unable to master their own environments. Humans are responsible for the climate changing too quickly for birds to adapt. Franzen wonders if birds are valued enough for us to make the effort to protect them.
Davenport says that the flood damage cost from rainfall in Hurricane Harvey, which dumped up to 60 inches of rain on Texas's Gulf Coast, made up about 20%of the $199 billion evaluated in her study. A series of studies after Harvey found that climate change resulted in the storm dumping up to 38% more rainfall than it otherwise would have.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'd like to welcome our reporters' panel now for some political analysis, Dan Balz is the chief correspondent for The Washington Post, Ed O'Keefe is the political correspondent right here at CBS News, Shannon Pettypiece is a White House reporter for Bloomberg News and Mark Landler covers the White House and foreign policy for-- at The New York Times. So, Ed, I'll start with you. Did you hear any points of agreement or were Democrats and Republicans just talking past each other on the show?
Much of BlackRock's investment is through typical index funds. But at least $16 million of BlackRock's Bunge holdings have been made through two index funds, the iShares MSCI USA ESG Select ETF and iShares MSCI USA ESG Optimized ETF. BlackRock's website says those funds invest in companies that have positive environmental characteristics.
SCOTT PELLEY: He-- he said the-- the Democrats making so much of it is a Democratic hoax, not that the virus was a hoax.

Anderson Cooper: I mean unemployment is at record lows.
Character is on the ballot, Biden said in Waukee on Thursday in a speech aimed at President Trump, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Bo Erickson. Does it matter if a president lies? Does it matter if a president has no moral compass? Does it matter if a president believes they're above the law? Does it matter if a president is petty? Mean? Cruel? Spiteful? Does the character of a president matter? I believe the answer to each and every one of those questions is yes.
Ninety-three percent of the excess heat trapped in the Earth's system by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions is stored in the oceans. If it weren't for this ocean buffer absorbing so much heat, our atmosphere would be roasting us by now.
Like Sen. Bernie Sanders, Ocasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist. She believes in universal healthcare, tuition-free public college, and massive government investment to combat climate change. She's been described as both an inspiring and idealistic insurgent, and as a naïve and ill-informed newcomer — as the future of the Democratic party, and as a potential obstacle to its success. Few rookie members of Congress have put such bold ideas on the national agenda and stirred up so much controversy before they were sworn in.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. And just growing up that way and with my cousins, who were all my age too, feeling like we all had kind of different opportunities, depending on where we were physically located.
Our government, at the highest levels, knew and was briefed on it regularly by the national security community, by the scientific community, Olson said. They have known for a very long time that it was a big threat.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: You can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown, doesn't make any difference to me. Just words.
He recognizes he has an uphill battle selling this to Congress. But he says, You can't solve big challenges without ambitious solutions. That's what this seeks to do.
Climate change, Oppenheimer says, is the major reason we'll see more floods for the ages across the globe, like the one that hit Venice two months ago.
One major concern is that this trapped mercury could seep into nearby waterways and transform into methylmercury, a toxin that can cause motor impairment and birth defects in animals, Edda Mutter, science director for the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council, said in a statement. Such contamination could travel swiftly up the food chain from microorganisms to humans, said Mutter, who was not involved in the new study.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would accept it?
MARGARET BRENNAN: How is a mistake like that made? Because people are very nervous right now and getting some of these basic facts right affects public trust.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: A treatment or a vaccine. But a-- a therapeutic-- a treatment is going to be more likely to be available in the fall. A vaccine is a much longer way off. And we always knew when that once in a generation strain came along, and this might be that strain, that what we were going to have to depend on was our science and something to stop it like a treatment or a vaccine. A treatment, again, we could have by September, October, potentially.
BlackRock holds $337 million worth of shares on behalf of its clients in Bunge Limited, making it the third largest shareholder of the agricultural company, which is based in St. Louis.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We pay more per capita in health care and education for lower outcomes than many other nations. And so for me, what's unrealistic is— is what we're living in right now.
On Thursday Democratic committee chairs — newly vested with subpoena power — began to lay out their plans to investigate President Trump and his administration. They filed legislation to go after the president's tax returns and vowed to reopen a Russia probe House Republicans closed last year. As special counsel Robert Mueller continues his investigation, Pelosi disputed the Justice Department's claim that a sitting U.S. president cannot be indicted.
Coral is very sensitive to increases in water temperature. When the water is too warm the corals bleach, turning white. A 2016 study estimates that 98 percent of coral reefs worldwide will experience bleaching-level stress each year by 2050.

The plan claims, Over two-thirds of American households would be financial winners under a carbon dividends program, including the most vulnerable. The aim is to increase the cost and disincentivize use of products that generate carbon pollution, encouraging industries and consumers to opt for greener alternatives instead.
NASA, NOAA and Berkeley Earth all released their assessments of Earth's temperature in 2020 on Thursday. The conclusion: 2020 was nearly tied with 2016 for the warmest year globally on record.
A BlackRock spokesperson said the firm is in the process of rebranding a number of its funds as environmentally and socially aware to let customers know that these funds include companies with favorable characteristics but are also optimized to offer a similar risk and return profile to broad market indices.
Michael Oppenheimer: So by the year 2050, which is only 30 years into the future, many places around the world, including in the U.S., are gonna experience their historical once in a hundred year flood level once a year or more frequently. Let me repeat that. An event that used to cause severe flooding once a century, we're gonna get that same water level once a year.
It was the experience of seeing a brightly colored warbler sitting in a tree 18 years ago that changed Franzen's life forever, reports CBS News' Alex Wagner. He had walked by that same tree hundreds of times before.
Yes. I'm filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States — tonight, she said.
MIKE POMPEO: The public-- the public document--
Most of his opponents' supporters in both states think that Sanders' positions are too progressive to win over swing voters, were he to become the Democratic nominee. But that may not matter much: large majorities of voters in California and Texas think a candidate is more likely to win in November by motivating Democrats to turn out in 2020, rather than by convincing Trump voters to vote Democratic. Over eight in 10 Sanders supporters think he has the best chance to beat President Trump in November.
From the start, Bloomberg bucked the political norms of presidential campaigning. Opting to skip the first four early voting states entirely, Bloomberg flooded television, radio and digital markets nationwide and in the Super Tuesday states, outspending every other candidate in the field, to the tune of tens of millions of dollars in some states.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: We were really working on the classic American dream. And overnight it was all taken away. My mom was back to cleaning homes and driving school buses to keep a roof over our heads.
This is not to say that winters are getting colder in the mid-latitudes. To the contrary, overall winters are warming due to climate change, although some pockets are indeed warming more slowly because of this effect. That's because these types of mid-latitude cold air episodes are made more likely by Arctic amplification, and research has found an increasing frequency in weak polar vortex states over the past four decades, linked to human-caused climate change.
DAN BALZ (The Washington Post/@danbalz): There's not at this point other than that both sides believe in border security.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: That is the goal. It's ambitious. And...
The sum total of the top 10 charitable donations last year — $2.6 billion — was the lowest since 2011, even as many billionaires vastly increased their wealth in the stock market rally that catapulted technology shares in particular last year.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary, thank you for coming on to talk about it. We'll be right back.
And with much more climate heating anticipated in the future, the team says the proportion of costs due to extreme events will only get worse.
If Biden is successful on Monday night, his campaign will argue that voters believe he has the best chance of beating Mr. Trump. While many important issues come up in conversations with Iowans, polls suggest caucus-goers are more concerned about finding an electable candidate. The Biden campaign hopes those Iowans will turn out for the former vice president.
MIKE POMPEO: We want-- we want women--
Over the past decade major Northeast snowstorms have increased. There are likely a number of reasons for this, from natural variability to a warming climate. But evidence shows that a warm Arctic leads to more extreme winter weather in the eastern U.S. NOAA and Judah Cohen

DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: That's the challenge here. You don't. You know there isn't-- the spectrum of disease here is very wide. A lot of people are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, but they shed virus and they're still infective. They can still transfer the virus and a small percentage get very sick. And so, it's probably the eighty percent that are mildly symptomatic or even asymptomatic that are the ones that are spreading it. The other thing is that people who get very sick, don't get very sick right away. The time to hospitalization in-- in different studies was nine to twelve days. So they start off with cold-like symptoms and then they progressively get more ill. And it's in that phase that people are spreading it. There was a very interesting analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine about two weeks ago that looked at viral load and viral shedding--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you have anyone in mind from your home state?
Anderson Cooper: Do you believe it?
John Dickerson: Oh yeah, the intensive care unit.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES (D-Connecticut/@JahanaHayesCT): Well I think-- I apologize I lost my voice yesterday. But I think the government shutdown is a sobering reality of where we are right now. We have to get to work. We cannot keep operating in hard lines. We cannot keep saying nobody's willing to move. We have to move. That's why we were elected. That's what we were sent here to do. We have to get back to work.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We continue our conversation now with our panel of new House members. Earlier this week we asked them about their priorities in Washington.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I don't see that. But I will tell you we've offered 1.3 billion with very specific limits which would not include a concrete wall. The President could have taken this long ago and we could have moved forward. But he said, No, I'm going to shut down my own government. That's what he's done.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Have you seen the more specific financial request that the White House says they were giving to Democrats?
However, Chris Brandolino, the principal scientist at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research in New Zealand, said, if we are seriously to consider this it requires a holistic approach, looking at the whole scale, not just adding a category.
In response to CBS MoneyWatch's questions, a BlackRock spokesperson pointed to a report the company put out last year that said the firm had reached out to five Brazil-based agribusiness companies and that each company stated their operations were not the cause of, or directly impacted by, the recent fires [in the Amazon]. BlackRock at the time said it will engage further as necessary to ensure the adoption of sound business and governance practices.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: No, that's a huge problem here, Margaret. Think back to what happened when Hurricane Dorian was hitting the United States last summer President Trump made an inaccurate comment about the hurricane's path and was criticized for it. And then a day or two later, he's holding up a map showing the storm's forecasted path in the Oval Office and it appears to have been doctored with just the kind of sharpie pen that President Trump loves to use to sign documents. It really looks like they were altering information they were giving the public to make the President look good, to cover up for a mistake he had made. And President Trump has repeatedly bungled basic facts, including numbers of victims in the country. Yesterday he got the gender wrong of the person who died in Washington although he may have been briefed inaccurately. I will say, Margaret, that I do think that that briefing yesterday was a step in the right direction. Having all those health experts there--
Shaul Bassi: So I think that people now feels far more vulnerable. We're hearing the sirens now (SIRENS IN BACKGROUND). Acqua alta's coming back. You see? This is what happened. It's happening every day now. This never happened like that. You know, it happens one, two, three days. Now, it's like, over a week that every day we have that. This is new.
O'Donnell: It was also mentioned by Senator Hillary Clinton, who said that while you two were campaigning against each other that you also said that she was unqualified to be president. She said that you foster a toxic culture in your campaign where your prominent supporters, Bernie bros, attack women. And will you denounce those attacks?
There's not enough words in the dictionary to describe what Hope Town looked like after that storm, Vernon Malone told correspondent Bill Whitaker.
As she was speaking, Pelosi's office released a letter saying that she would not consider a concurrent resolution authorizing the President's State of the Union address in the House Chamber until government has opened. For the president to address a joint session of Congress, the House and Senate must pass a joint resolution to create the session for him to speak.
Since 1990, the eastern U.S. has been visited by winter storms so severe that they earned highly dramatic nicknames, such as Snowzilla, Snowmaggeddon and Snowpocalypse. The increase in incidences of extreme storms with heavy snowfall corresponded with periods of excessive Arctic warmth, the study authors wrote.
The senator said last week's riots underscore the need for Mr. Biden's nominees to key national security posts to be swiftly confirmed, including his picks to lead the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State and Justice.

So, what do you do to prevent a thing like that? he asked.
If BlackRock's voting record and shareholder engagement isn't strong and effective on climate change, then it wouldn't be a stretch to call Fink's words empty and hypocritical, said Amazon Watch's Birss. There is more that BlackRock could and should be doing.
EDWARD WONG: --tried to warn health care professionals in a private chat group about it. And then he was even taken in by the police because of that and admonished.
The typical locust season ends around June — when drier conditions naturally return — but action is needed sooner. By April it will be too late, Patta said.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.
That human impact is piled on top of two naturally occurring patterns which made for abnormally hot and dry conditions in Australia. In fact, 2019 was both the hottest and driest year for Australia on record.
A powerful storm that lashed the Caribbean before it barreled into Florida in September prompted the National Weather Service to issue a warning amid false reports of a Category 6 storm: Keep your eyes out for fake forecasts. At least one meteorologist sought to set the record straight: There is no such thing as ... a Category 6 or higher hurricane, he posted on Facebook.
Anderson Cooper: Do you call yourself a radical?
That's always the question, Minnis said. Where do we begin?
We need to act immediately because the locusts don't wait, they will come and they will destroy, said Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General for Climate and Natural Resources, in the appeal. We need to tackle the emergency but we need to think about livelihoods and the long-term.
We are seeing the possibility of genocide happening, Vargas said.
I don't see prepping as something that's all about bullets and bunkers. It's more about, you know, beans and Band-Aids and proper products that can fill you in, in these funny times and these less secure times, he said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --in the U.S. that aren't reported?
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, one of the other things that may not be breaking through but is a big headline today is the National Security advisor in Israel making an announcement that seems to be yet another change in the Syria policy. The President said he was pulling troops out in thirty days, then we stretched that to a hundred and twenty days. Now what's being described as a total indefinite stay of U.S. troops in Syria. What are people of the Pentagon actually being told to do?
We now know that women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since Donald Trump was elected, Warren said in Davenport on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Zak Hudak. Warren also reintroduced her argument, which she frequently made over the summer, that she's a fighter who can defeat Mr. Trump and deliver progressive victories in Washington.
The Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale, which is used to estimate potential property damage, rates hurricanes on a scale of 1 to 5 based on a storm's wind speed, according to the National Hurricane Center. The scale tops out at Category 5 for any hurricane with sustained winds of 157 mph or higher. But that September storm, Hurricane Irma, hit 185 mph, breaking the Atlantic Ocean record, and other parts of the world have seen even worse.
Rising Tide: Priced Out In Miami Miami is often seen as ground zero for the impacts of climate change in the U.S., but the fallout goes well beyond flooded streets. As real estate developers head to higher ground, rising rents in low-income communities there are threatening to push vulnerable residents out of their homes. In this episode of CBSN Originals' REVERB series, Adam Yamaguchi explores climate gentrification in Miami.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Scott's interview with Mayor Bloomberg will air tonight on 60 MINUTES.
Teen climate activist Greta Thunberg squashed criticism from President Trump and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on the last day of the World Economic Forum on Friday, saying it's had no effect on her. She also took part in a climate march, days after calling for world and business leaders at the event to divest from fossil fuels.
Previous studies have attempted to account for the billions of tons of carbon dioxide, methane and even zombie pathogens that could be loosed into the air and the oceans by melting permafrost. The environmental impact of a large-scale mercury leak, however, remains an unpredictable problem.
There was some good news in Aon's report. While 10,000 people died in natural disasters around the world in 2018, that loss of life ranked well below the average,. 2018 ranks among the lowest disaster-related fatality totals since 1950, the company concluded.
Candidates receiving 1% or less support in the poll are not pictured.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this an admission that the President made a mistake?
Anderson Cooper: What you are talking about, just big picture, is a radical agenda — compared to the way politics is done right now.
Gritzo says the one natural hazard they can't always protect against is an F-5 tornado, the strongest kind. One of the company's clients is a Missouri hospital destroyed by an F-5 tornado in 2011. FM Global says it paid that claim, and now the hospital has been rebuilt, with some lessons learned.
Ted Cruz and I agreed on how to end sexual harassment in Congress, which ultimately passed. Me and Ted Cruz! Gillibrand said. Colbert quipped she cared about something so much she would talk to Ted Cruz.

BlackRock runs the index funds, but separate companies like S&P Global choose the companies in the index. Passively managed funds, according to the rules of index investing, have to buy the shares of all the companies in the index, whether those companies are burning the Amazon or not.
The report warns that even if all the commitments made by countries for the Paris Agreement are met, the world is still on a course to warm by more than 3°C this century. Even half that amount of warming would be more than enough to cause widespread risks to health, livelihoods, and food security, according to U.N. climate experts.
MARGARET BRENNAN: In the middle of the funding standoff, the one hundred and sixteenth Congress gavels in, Nancy Pelosi reclaims the title of speaker as Democrats take control of the House and usher in the most diverse Congress in history. A panel of freshmen members weighs in on inheriting a shutdown and early calls to impeach the President.
Exactly six months ago this evening, Hurricane Dorian slammed into the northern Bahamas. It was the fifth Category 5 Atlantic hurricane in just the last three years. Before that, there hadn't been a single Cat-5 storm in nearly a decade.
In an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday night, Wheeler said the change was in the interest of transparency.
ED O'KEEFE: --who has a name ID in the network. Can I somehow distinguish myself in the field that will feature numerous women, several different minority candidates, I have to find a way to play in the south, at the same time I have to find a way to play in California, in Georgia and all these other places because of early voting. It's going to be a tremendous competition and one that I think a lot of people are surprised hasn't been joined by others yet but I think that's because they realize this-- this is going to be a tremendous exercise for them.
Prime Minister Minnis and Viana Gardiner, a top aide, visited Marsh Harbour with Whitaker and pointed to one huge priority: restoring electric power.
The GOP senator warned that these factors -- compounded with the threats of Russia and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) -- are actually working to undermine our energy industry.
In Siberia, temperatures were off the charts in 2020, finishing the year a remarkable 5 °C (9 °F) above normal. The graph below shows just how abnormal the heat in Siberia was in 2020.
ANTHONY SALVANTO (CBS News Elections and Surveys Director/@SalvantoCBS): Well, that remains a key difference between these candidates which is that Bernie Sanders' supporters are the most enthusiastic of all the top candidates. That's why his numbers remain so stable. Those folks turn out for him. But Joe Biden still has a challenge in that regard. His supporters are less enthusiastic about him. Can he motivate them to turn out? I think it remains a key question. And, look, to that point, when you look at California, Texas, at these big delegate hauls, the Democrats give out delegates just to top finishers. And so they could very conceivably end up splitting the delegates along with some of these other candidates and then we move on into the spring.
Washington may have a new Congress, but it's stuck in the same shutdown.
The New York Times reports that 28 curators at the New York City museum said in a Jan. 19 letter to leadership they are concerned about Rebekah Mercer's donations to organizations they say challenge and politicize climate change science.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I don't think that that tells the whole story. When you can't provide for your kids working a full-time job, working two full-time jobs. When you can't have healthcare. That is not — that is not dignified.
Some of the warmer weather in the mid-latitudes of the U.S. and Europe can be explained by abnormally strong polar vortex winds in the Arctic, which lassoed cold air, trapping it far north. These sporadic strong polar vortex patterns are most likely part of a natural cycle.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is this now a two man race?
Joe Biden could get a boost from his status as the second choice of those backing Amy Klobuchar, as well as from those polling lower. If they move to him on caucus night, he could see gains. Meanwhile, Warren is right on the line, and her backers' second choice is Sanders, more so than Biden or Buttigieg. That would mean Sanders could stand to pick up even more delegates if Warren backers don't make the cut in some places. If Warren holds at her current level or gains, this race will remain tight. All told, the caucuses look like they might very likely be decided by these kinds of local-level movements.
Of course, simply replacing our electronic gadgets with solar-powered versions won't stave off the climate crisis. Even with the record drop in greenhouse gas emissions last year, 2020 tied for the hottest year on record. The year began with record-setting wildfires in Australia and ended with rolling blackouts in California just to keep the state's power grid from being overloaded.
ALEX AZAR (Secretary of Health and Human Services/@SecAzar): Glad to be here. Thank you for having me.
A teenager part of one of the largest indigenous tribes in the Amazon has died after testing positive for COVID-19, according to Brazilian health officials. There are fears the coronavirus, which has already devastated much of the world, could wipe out remote indigenous tribes in South America.

Whitaker also found an American who'd made the trek from the United States to Austria. Howard Morris, a librarian from Minnesota, dreamt of skating the Elfstedentocht when he began speed skating. A Dutch friend told him he'd have to go to Austria to find ice. It's the reality of the times, says Morris. I know some people fear that the whole tradition of skating will die out because of the change in winters.
MIKE POMPEO: Don't trust anything. We're going to deliver. It's about actions. The agreements that set out, the conditions that set out the space. But, no, this deal doesn't depend upon trusting anyone. It has a deep, complex, well-thought out, multi-month negotiated verification complex and mechanism by which we can observe and hold every member of the agreement accountable. We'll do that. It's not about trust. It's about what happens on the ground to not only yesterday, which was an important day, but in the days that follow.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So has the administration been slow in its response?
But how much of the financial toll of disasters like these is due to climate change making things worse, and how much is due to socioeconomic factors like increased population and value of assets? This study helps to clarify this debate among many experts who work in disaster-related fields. That's important because, with the impacts of climate change continuing to mount, there's an urgency among scientists and economists to quantify how much climate change is costing us and how much it may cost us in the future.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. And we are continuing our conversation with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is just back in the U.S. after signing a deal with the Taliban in Doha. And-- and-- just that statement alone is kind of amazing. You were the first U.S. cabinet official to ever meet with a member of the Taliban. I think you actually met with one of the founding members of the Taliban who is involved in this.

The collapse of the 74,000-square-mile Thwaites — which some scientists see as the most vulnerable and significant glacier in the world when it comes to sea-level-rise — could release a mass of water roughly the size of Florida or Great Britain. Its melting would raise global sea levels by more than three feet, enough to potentially overwhelm vulnerable populations, the researchers said.
O'Donnell: Let me ask you about Vice President Joe Biden. He is looking for an apology for a video circulated by your campaign that he says takes his position on Social Security out of context. Will you apologize?
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Right. Well, certainly expanding the diagnostic capability is the right move. We're going to have the capacity by the end of this week to diagnose probably ten thousand people a day or screen ten thousand people a day with the public health labs. Hundred labs doing hundreds tests a day. By the end of the week after that, we'll probably bring on another ten thousand. So we'll have testing capacity of, perhaps, as much as twenty thousand a day by the end of the next two weeks. Once we bring on the academic labs, that was really a critical step, bringing on those academic labs--
The entire world will be watching...to see if people of this state are prepared to fight back, Sanders said in Storm Lake on Sunday, according to CBS News Campaign Reporter Cara Korte. He has also emphasized that the Democratic establishment is worried about the strength of his movement. We are their worst nightmare! This is their 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' Sanders said in Sioux City on Sunday, Korte reports.
The polar vortex is a huge low-pressure gyre of cold winds spinning counter-clockwise, which rotate quickly around the Arctic Circle from west to east. But when an SSW occurs, if it is a strong enough event, winds will often reverse and become easterly, and the polar vortex will split into two or three separate vortices, which then drift southward towards the mid-latitudes carrying cold air along with them.
Michael Oppenheimer: Sea level is rising almost everywhere on Earth. Not only is sea level rising the rise is accelerating. It's happening faster and faster.

They flew in, and it sounded like some meteorological event. Their, their wings are so huge. It's this woof, woof, woof as they come in….And I became aware that somebody was shouting, he said. And I realized I'm shouting. That is spontaneous joy that I am emitting.
MIKE POMPEO: --the work that we did against Qassem Soleimani. This is a President who is committed to defending and protecting the American people. We'll do that every place we battle against terror whether that's Afghanistan or any of the other dozens of places we push back each and every day.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan. We can beat Trump.
Using extrapolation, Dr, Robert Rohde, the author of the Berkeley Earth report, estimates that at the current rate we will surpass 1.5 °C of warming in just 15 years and exceed 2 °C of warming by 2065. But that pace can be slowed to some degree depending on how fast we reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.
O'Donnell: We don't get to see your colleagues during the trial. The cameras are not pointed at the senators. Take us inside. I mean, what is everybody doing?
Gillibrand is the second U.S. senator — and second female senator — to announce plans to begin the legal process of running for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. The 52-year-old is one of the most active and outspoken critics of President Trump and she earned acclaim from party activists when she began voting against all of the president's cabinet and senior government nominees in early 2017.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB (Former FDA Commissioner/@ScottGottliebMD): Thanks.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --and a Republican President.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And there are a lot of delegates at stake here on Tuesday. A thousand three hundred forty-four, it's about thirty percent of what's needed for the nomination. So, Ed, how do the candidates sort of crack the threshold? Explain some of the math here.
LNP news reports Millersville University officials on Monday night fielded concerns from students and apologized for unsatisfactory responses to the Feb. 1 incident. Officials say two female students wearing charcoal facial masks posted a Snapchat photo with a Black History Month filter that read Young, Black & Proud.
The ground floors in this stooped and shrinking city have already been abandoned. Life is lived on the first story and above. Artisans like Saverio Pastor, one of the last who patiently crafts oar locks for the city's gondolas, are becoming scarce. While residents weigh moving out, the tourists keep marching in, donning neon booties and learning to walk on water or in single file on the hastily assembled footbridges that lace through what may be a doomed city.
If Klobuchar is successful on Monday, it will likely be because her decision to tour every corner of the state, her focus on pursuing more moderate policies, and her message of uniting the country at a time of deep partisan division. She has campaigned relentlessly, holding more events than any other candidate in the top tier, and her campaign believes they'll see an advantage in rural areas because they visited every one of Iowa's 99 counties.
We turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.

SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Right. At this point, both side think they have a winning hand politically. No one is facing any real political pressure. And part of that, again the holidays, people weren't really paying that much attention. But for the White House, they see this (INDISTINCT) politically. Democrats, you know, they are not really feeling any political pain at this point. So that changes at the end of this coming week when Friday, when federal employees start missing their first paycheck. There are services. People will start noticing getting their passport renewed, going to a national park on the weekend. So then, you get the political pressure starting to ratchet up. But because the sides are so far apart, I don't think this ends without one side caving under political pressure, and right now no one's feeling it. So it goes on and-- and-- and there's no urgency.
Vargas stressed that it's in the whole planet's best interest to keep indigenous peoples safe.
Pierpaolo Campostrini: I'm emotional. I'm also a bit angry about this.
Much of the concern about taking action to limit global warming has been framed around how much it will cost to transition from fossil fuels, Diffenbaugh added. Indeed, It will cost too much is a familiar refrain among those who oppose action to combat climate change, to which the climate-concerned always counter: We can't afford not to. That's because as the planet gets warmer, the impacts of climate change increase exponentially.
The weather agency also said that 2017 was the third hottest year in U.S. records for the Lower 48 states, with an annual temperature average of 54.6 degrees Fahrenheit, or 12.6 degrees Celsius -- 2.6 degrees higher than the 20th century average. Only 2012 and 2016 were warmer. The five warmest years for the Lower 48 states have all happened since 2006.
While there's been some limited study of the survival of this virus, both aerosolized in the air or on a surface — which has shown the virus remains viable for hours and that airborne transmission is certainly possible — its survival has not been tested under diverse climate conditions. Consequently, its sensitivity to temperature and humidity conditions aren't known. It would be great to see these experiments repeated under different temperature and humidity conditions.
BlackRock has been in the crosshairs of climate change activists in the past. Last year, as raging wildfires charred vast swaths of the Amazon, protestors blocked the entrance to BlackRock's New York headquarters. The protestors accused BlackRock of funding companies responsible for the destruction of the Amazon and other natural forests.
The early spring is getting a boost from a winter with very little cold and snow in most of the country and around the world. In the U.S., the winter was nearly 4 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, ranking as 6th warmest since the late 1800s. Washington D.C.'s snowfall was measly — less than an inch — and Boston registered its second-lowest snow total on record.
Anderson Cooper: What was it that— that brought your parents here?
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): I think so. I think-- I think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised whether it's judgeships with Mitch McConnell, whether it's compromising on climate change I think we've-- there's some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on but am I open to compromise on-- on certain ways to get things done, absolutely. Absolutely.
ALEX AZAR: And I-- I appreciate that people are concerned of that, and that-- that is why we're being radically transparent about what we know and also what the full range of potential scenarios could be. And that's why we say might be, but also might not be with aggressive containment and mitigation steps. Right now it's important for people to understand we're not advising any types of particular measures in the United States like travel restrictions or closures. State or local public health offices, which are the frontlines of response, might make their own decisions to do that. But, at this point, we do not have sufficient spread in the United States that would indicate those measures. But we're not taking any of them off the table. The full range of options will always remain on the table.
Just a few days later, as soon as she got to Washington, she paid a visit to climate change activists who were occupying her party leader Nancy Pelosi's office. She was the only newly elected member of Congress who decided to drop by during the sit-in, and she called on Pelosi to create a select committee on climate change without any members of Congress who accept money from the fossil fuel industry.
Shaul Bassi: Absolutely. I think that it was more heartfelt. I think a lot of people this time felt, you know, 'This might not be there forever.' I think this is what has perhaps changed, that a lot of us are feeling, 'Well, we cannot take this for granted.'
She added some indigenous organizations have reached out to Amazon Watch about groups of missionaries that are trying to reach them, even though they're in isolation.
It's an ongoing discussion, Minnis said. It's an ongoing discussion.
She'll also refer to the For the People agenda, which Democrats campaigned on nationally, a package including bills on infrastructure, ethics reform, lowering health care costs and protecting those with pre-existing conditions.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who represents a district in California, condemned Mr. Trump's tweet Wednesday, calling it a threat insults the memory of scores of Americans who perished in wildfires last year & thousands more who lost their homes. She called on House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, also of California, to join her to condemn & call on POTUS to reassure millions in CA that our govt will be there for them in their time of need.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think if we're going to win as Democrats, we need to run the kind of races that form broad coalitions. The way we took back the majority of the House is through districts like mine. The eleventh district of New Jersey, where I ran on a-- with a broad coalition of people on issues that everyone in my district, from progressives to conservatives agree on. Things like infrastructure reform, things like bringing down health care costs, things like really, you know, focusing on our environment and how we move forward now, not in fifty years. Making sure we have universal background checks for gun purchases. These are things that the majority of Americans agree on and the Democrats are always at their strongest when they're focused on families and they're focused on issues that are going to move people forward.
There is one main issue that is central to the rest, and that is the issue of war and peace, Gabbard added. I look forward to being able to get into this and to talk about it in depth when we make our announcement.
It is truly a wall of fire, said Louis Gritzo, who creates disasters regularly for his clients.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I think it's important to see what's in the package. And it's- I think it's hard for any of us to say. I think all of us at this table came to Congress to work in a bipartisan fashion, to get things done. We're trying as hard as we can right now to be bipartisan. We need some bend from the other side as well.
Water board chairwoman Felicia Marcus said the restrictions are hardly a long-term solution to California's drought problems but the least we should do.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --based on the-- the rundown of candidates.
Elizabeth Warren, who has also been tied up with the impeachment trial, has sent a flood of surrogates to the state, including former Democratic rival Julian Castro. She built up an early operation in Iowa, but has seen poll numbers dip since the fall. At events in Iowa last weekend, Warren addressed the electability argument head on and stressed that she believes Democrats need to nominate a woman to beat Mr. Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you support a drawdown?
MARGARET BRENNAN: And his chief of staff went out and-- and said the media's covering this--
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: When you see Dick Durbin and others in the room not a bunch of staffers. When you see this rhetoric that those who want to build a wall are racists stop. When you see the idea one dollar is enough for the wall. When that stuff ends, the real negotiations begin. Right now, the people running the show on the left are radical, liberal Democrats who don't see a border security problem. They see their own government being the problem--
According to the FAO, a new generation of locusts is expected to hatch in February, and new swarms are expected in early April. If they are not controlled soon, more vulnerable countries will be targeted next.
But there are signs of growing support for market-driven solutions among younger conservatives. According to the Pew study, Republican Millennials are less inclined than their elders in the GOP to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling, hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. For example, 75% of Republicans in the Baby Boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling, compared with 44% of Millennial Republicans.

Mayor Luigi Brugnaro (Translation): I don't want to worry anybody, but I think that I'd like a different message. Let's save Venice to save the world.
Like weather and climate, there are two factors in sea level rise: year-to-year small rises and falls that are caused by natural events and larger long-term rising trends that are linked to man-made climate change. Nerem's team removed the natural effects of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo volcano eruption that temporarily chilled Earth and the temperature variations linked to El Nino and La Nina, and found the accelerating trend.
60 Minutes cameras capture the excitement of the race, the different kinds of skaters and the exuberant crowds drawn to the hamlet for perhaps the biggest skating party in the world. The boisterous celebration after the race is called The Blister Ball.

A news release on the findings called it an alarming discovery.
In the study, researchers drilled 13 permafrost soil cores from various sites in Alaska between 2004 and 2012. Then, they measured the total amounts of mercury and carbon in each sample, which proved consistent with thousands of other soil cores taken from other sites around the world, the paper said. Using the mercury contents of their 13 cores as a springboard, the researchers estimated the total amount of mercury sealed away below North American permafrost to be roughly 793 gigagrams — or more than 15 million gallons.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS (I-Vermont/@BernieSanders/Democratic Presidential Candidate): Good morning, Margaret.

Don't confuse weather -- which is a few days or weeks in one region -- with climate, which is over years and decades and global. Weather is like a person's mood, which changes frequently, while climate is like someone's personality, which is more long-term, Furtado said.
Klain said the president-elect would continue to roll out other executive actions throughout the first two weeks of the new administration.

Her $4.2 billion was divvied among 384 organizations she describes in her post as having dedicated their lives to helping others, working and volunteering and serving real people face-to-face at bedsides and tables, in prisons and courtrooms and classrooms, on streets and hospital wards and hotlines and frontlines of all types and sizes, day after day after day.
I think there was a song about that, Nicklen said jokingly.
In geology, permafrost is defined as any soil that has been frozen for more than two years. In the Northern Hemisphere, permafrost accounts for about 8.8 million square miles (22.79 million square kilometers) of land — or roughly 24 percent of exposed Earth, according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center. Over time, naturally occurring compounds in the atmosphere, such as mercury and carbon dioxide, can bind with organic material in the soil and be frozen into permafrost, potentially remaining trapped underground for thousands of years before it thaws, the new paper said.

How do you bring this back? Whitaker asked.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely important. And whenever I make a mistake. I say, Okay, this was clumsy. and then I restate what my point was. But it's— it's not the same thing as— as the president lying about immigrants. It's not the same thing, at all.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You have to have that long-term strategy and that is a piece that's missing.
Two years ago, Brazil fined Bunge and other large grain buyers $29 million for contributing to deforestation in that country. Bunge said at the time it believed the grain it bought had not come from a protected area.
When viewed over a longer period of time, Europe's record warm winter stands out even more starkly. Compared to normal conditions at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (1850-1900), before human-caused greenhouse gases started to warm the planet, this winter was a remarkable 8 degrees Fahrenheit above normal across the whole continent.
EDWARD WONG: Right. And I think that they're trying to adjust the language now from what I can tell. But I think that, you know, there's valid criticism of that. And I think if you compare that to the way Beijing reacted, there are some parallels in that communist party officials, Chinese officials really covered up the start of the virus, and there's a lot of information coming out these days that perhaps it started earlier, and that they kept the public from learning about it. We know that one of the key whistleblowers, Dr. Li--
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The president just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
Sanders: You've obviously seen the latest polls, right?
Michael Oppenheimer: Venice is facing an existential threat essentially to the city as it has been.
Last year certainly created believers. Losses from Hurricane Harvey alone totaled $125 billion. Historic flooding caused much of the damage.
Because the oceans are so large and less variable than the atmosphere, it makes ocean heat content a much better gauge for the pace of global warming.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Ed, can four hundred million dollars in ad spending close that gap? That's a big gamble.
I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country.
John Dickerson: If Venice is a patient, is it time to call the ambulance?
In much of the eastern United States, spring leaf out — the season's first blossoming of several plant species — has sprung more than 20 days early. In parts of the Southeast, this year's spring bloom is the earliest in the 39-year record, according to the National Phenology Network, an organization that studies the impact of climate on nature's cycles.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I do want to open up the government but the goal is not to open up the government. The goal is to fix a broken immigration system to bring reality to this table. That ICE is not the problem, it's the solution. The goal is to repair a damaged, broken immigration system. It's to implement policies--
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: No. As a matter of fact, the meeting yesterday between Vice President Pence and the staff, they agreed that today they would produce it, finally produce documentation backing up what the President's latest demand might be. But Vice President Pence said at one point a few weeks ago, two billion will do it, 2.1. And then within a matter of hours, the President reversed and said, No, it has to be 5.6. That's what we're up against. There doesn't seem to be a consistent message and-- and it doesn't seem to be a message consistent with border security. If we're talking about border security, the overwhelming number of undocumented people in the United States overstayed visas.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --and-- and leveraging their capacity. These are the major medical centers. What we need to do now is make a real concerted effort to get a therapeutic. We know when this started, but we don't know when this is going to end. And what's going to end it is our technology. Our savior here is going to be our technology. And we need to make a really robust effort to try to develop a therapeutic.
And on the night of Barack Obama's victory in 2008, CNN brought a correspondent onto its set by using hologram technology.
DAN BALZ: That's never the way these kinds of things end. We'll see whether this is a different situation.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, two points. I'm a member of the Democratic leadership. I've been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress 30 years ago and from- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats and have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, MARGARET, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people are working 11, 12 bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare. They can't afford healthcare. They're scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump.
The Trump administration's rollback of environmental laws and decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accords play a role in the increase. But the main culprit is last year's spike in economic growth. Between 2007 and 2015, U.S. emissions came down 12 percent as utilities brought on clean-energy technology and the Great Recession dampened demand for power. In 2016 and 2017, emissions still decreased, but more slowly. Last year, as the economy expanded at the fastest pace in 15 years, boosted by tax cuts and other measures, emissions also grew at a record-setting pace.
Democratic Senator Jerry Hill this week accused the PG&E of being dishonest and prioritize[ing] profits way over safety, he told the Associated Press. I don't believe it will change unless there is some sort of restructure.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to also ask you about some of the things you campaigned on. Congresswoman, as we said, you're from Connecticut. In your home state that was the site of the Sandy Hook shooting. I know you've talked a bit, given your time in the classroom, and you've thought a lot about this. What is it that you think can actually get done? What are you going to try to do about gun control?
WASHINGTON -- With three devastating hurricanes, extreme wildfires, hail, flooding, tornadoes and drought, the United States tallied a record high bill last year for weather-related disasters: $306 billion. The U.S. had 16 disasters last year with damage exceeding a billion dollars each, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported Monday.
What makes the polar vortex move?
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump?
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi agreed to create it, but it's not nearly what Ocasio-Cortez had in mind. Pelosi granted the committee limited powers and did not ban members who take money from the fossil fuel industry.
Shaul Bassi: So I (pointing), you know, now it really makes me feel very nervous.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --to that compromise you just floated there?
This is not record-breaking for Canada or Alaska or northern Siberia, it's just misplaced, said Cohen, who had forecast a colder than normal winter for much of the U.S.
Some scientists at the American Geophysical Union meeting last year said Antarctica may be melting faster than predicted by Monday's study. Greenland has caused three times more sea level rise than Antarctica so far, but ice melt on the southern continent is responsible for more of the acceleration.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But more testing means more positive results. I mean you're saying, basically, expect the number of those who've been diagnosed with the virus to also increase?
MARGARET BRENNAN: --how are we on shortages? You may not want to tell me the number, but you have one in your head--
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: Well, I think that, any conversation about arming teachers is not the response to gun control. I think we have to have background checks. We have to make sure that we are getting guns off the street.
Monday's scientific papers don't provide new data, yet show a big but incomplete picture of a problem starting to get attention. Scientists have identified 1 million insect species, while probably 4 million more are still to be discovered, Berenbaum said.

In any case, this could amount to about the same handful of delegates being parceled out among these candidates, so the real prize out of Iowa would be, as ever, attention and bragging rights.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --do you expect this to actually happen?
Low-cost energy makes us more competitive in the global economy across the board in all industry sectors, he said. You do that by building the kind of legal tax and regulatory climate that attracts investment, innovation and jobs. You do that by reforming the tax code to make it simpler, flatter and fairer so that the American people have the motivation to compete and win.
If Sanders is successful on Monday night it will show that caucus-goers back his message of changing the system and believe he will fight for issues that matter to working class Americans. The campaign also has an aggressive ground game in Iowa, one that includes hundreds of staffers and volunteers spread across the state looking to turn out his fervent supporters and first-time caucus-goers. Although it is a comparatively small demographic in the state, the campaign's outreach with Latino voters in the state could also prove to be essential come Caucus Night.
Sanders: That's right. I mean, that's what politics is about. You know, unfortunately, that's the way it is. But I have no doubt that if I become the nominee, we're gonna be able to unite the party because, number one, every Democrat and a majority of independents know how dangerous Donald Trump is. How he's trying to undermine democracy. How he's running a corrupt administration. How he is a racist and a sexist, and so forth. We're gonna unite the Democratic Party. And the issues that we are talking about, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, health care for all, dealing with the global crisis of climate change, that is an agenda that will bring the American people together to defeat Trump.
CBS News asked Dr. Theresa Crimmins, director of the USA National Phenology Network, if such a widespread early arrival of spring is unusual. Yes, she replied, this year stands out, because so much of the country is showing such an early spring. Huge swaths of the Southeast have had the start of spring arrive 2-3 weeks and more early.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Hundreds or low thousands of coronavirus cases--
Western wildfires fanned by hot, dry conditions racked up $18 billion in damage, triple the previous U.S. wildfire record, according to the NOAA.
Wagner said scientists need to figure out if the rate of the insect loss is bigger than with other species. There is some reason to worry more, he added, because they are the target of attack with insecticides, herbicides and light pollution.
All the major candidates are blanketing the state this weekend and making their closing arguments to fire up supporters and try to win over some of the voters still trying to make up their minds.
Insects are absolutely the fabric by which Mother Nature and the tree of life are built, Wagner said.
We expect economic activity to pick up again in 2021, but without meaningful structural changes in the carbon intensity of the US economy, emissions will likely rise again as well, the report says.
That heat build-up has a debilitating impact on many aspects of ocean life. Coral reefs are a good example.
Dating back to 1880, 2018 was the fourth-warmest year on record, according to the report.
Almost two years since her first school strike, Thunberg concluded her week in the Swiss Alps by participating in one of her signature climate action protests with other young people. During a news conference before the march with fellow youth leaders, Thunberg fielded a question from a reporter who asked about the effect Mr. Trump and Mnunchin has had on targeting her publicly. She said it's had no effect on her.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you don't want to--
Rural communities in Alaska and other northern areas have a subsistence lifestyle, making them vulnerable to methylmercury contaminating their food supply, Mutter added.
Rising sea levels are on track to affect about three times more people by 2050 than originally thought. Research suggests that 300 million homes will be affected by coastal flooding in the next 30 years — and 630 million by the year 2100 if carbon emissions don't decrease.
To find out more about how the change of seasons might affect the spread of the virus, CBS News spoke with Dr. Jeffrey Shaman, an expert on infectious disease transmission and director of the Climate and Health Program at Columbia University. The following is an abbreviated version of the conversation.
MIKE POMPEO: --security forces and the Taliban.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid I spent time in Israel. I am not in-- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You got seventy percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we-- continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even-handed policy.
However, before Pelosi can achieve any of these goals, the partial government shutdown must end. President Trump is refusing to sign any legislation which does not include funding for a border wall, which Democrats in the House and Senate are unwilling to provide.
O'Donnell: You don't know… You don't know how much your plan costs?
MARGARET BRENNAN: That sounds like what the Trump administration is suggesting.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I can't say that we're close because President's made it clear he doesn't care. He's prepared to see a shutdown for months and he even said years, and reaffirmed that before the cameras. It was stunning to hear a President of the United States say that about his own government, the government we elected him to lead. But that is his position. Think about the hundreds of thousands of people who will be entitled to income tax refund checks who won't receive them because the Treasury Department has been shut down, the Internal Revenue Service is shut down, the unfortunate end and unfair results here are just across the board.
MIKE POMPEO: Yes, Ma'am. This was a historic day. American blood and treasure have been expended in this place for an awfully long time. We went there after 9/11. No one still feels the anger of that day any more than I do. But it was time. And the Taliban knew it was time. President Trump has allowed us to take the fight to the Taliban these last two years. And we have done so. It's why they, for the first time, have announced that they're prepared to break with their historic ally, al-Qaida, who they've worked with much the det-- detriment of the United States of America. You can see, go read the document, the Taliban have now made the break. They've said they will not permit terror to be thrust upon anyone, including the United States, from Afghanistan. This is historic in that way and no one should underestimate the Trump administration. You can see our work on counterterror, whether it's al-Baghdadi, Qassem al-Rimi--

I would say this album is about growing up and becoming an adult, the pop star told CBS News of her new album, Tell Me You Love Me. There's songs on the album that represent past relationships that I've been through. There's some about sexuality, but also there's ones about overcoming obstacles.
Yes, but more for how long -- about 10 days -- the cold has lasted, than how cold it has been. On Tuesday, Boston tied its seven-day record for the most consecutive days at or below 20 degrees that was set exactly 100 years ago.
MIKE POMPEO: It says that we will work with all relevant parties to build on confidence, to create confidence-building measures amongst all of the parties, the Afghan government, non-Taliban, and others in the Afghan. We-- we want this to be an inclusive process.
She has also courted controversy by picking a fight with Hawaii Sen. Mazie Hirono. Gabbard, in an op-ed in The Hill, accused Hirono of fomenting religious bigotry by questioning one of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees about his membership in the Knights of Columbus.
We're creating a giant biological desert except for soybeans and corn in a giant area of the Midwest, he said.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, MARGARET, it is not only- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions for more than $40 billionaires. What we have done is received more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and 50 cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working class people all across this country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --that will be shared with Congress?
Before 2018, the U.S. had three straight years of emissions declines despite economic growth. But last year the economy grew faster, illustrating the difficulty of kicking our addiction to fossil fuels when our economic engine revs up. Rhodium Group explains, Some of this was due to unusually cold weather at the start of the year. But it also highlights the limited progress made in developing decarbonization strategies.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So Ghani-- what he is saying is wrong?
Washington — Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who will take over as the chamber's majority leader in the coming weeks, laid out Tuesday the agenda the new Democrat-controlled Senate will pursue once President-elect Joe Biden is sworn into office, setting as the first priority the approval of another coronavirus emergency relief package with $2,000 checks to the American people.
The findings were published online today (March 13) in the journal Nature Communications.
But at least there is a plan to defend Venice. We headed out to one of the three inlets where the tides from the Adriatic Sea flow into the lagoon that surrounds the city. This is where Venetians hope that a controversial project called Moses will part the waters. More than 30 years in the making, Moses is supposed to deploy 78 retractable gates to block exceptional high tides, as this animation illustrates. Construction finally began in 2003 but corruption scandals and engineering challenges have delayed moses years past its due date.
MICHAEL CROWLEY (The New York Times/@michaelcrowley): Thanks, Margaret.
In these proceedings, the government accepts as fact that the United States has reached a tipping point crying out for a concerted response—yet presses ahead toward calamity, she wrote. It is as if an asteroid were barreling toward Earth and the government decided to shut down our only defenses. Seeking to quash this suit, the government bluntly insists that it has the absolute and unreviewable power to destroy the Nation.
Our study highlights the need for immediate management strategies aimed at lowering incubation temperatures at key rookeries, the researchers wrote, to boost the ability of local turtle populations to adapt to the changing environment and avoid a population collapse — or even extinction.
This feels like a furnace right now, said correspondent Tony Dokoupil.
If you look at the temperature map for the climate as a whole right now, the entire rest of the planet is warmer than the historical average with the exception of the Eastern United States and Canada, and the last three years -- 2014, 2015 and 2016 -- have been consecutively the warmest years on record, atmospheric scientist and Columbia University professor Adam Sobel told CBS News last week.
MIKE POMPEO: They have an enormous amount of American blood on their hands.
When all the numbers are crunched, 2020 will be one of the warmest if not the warmest year on record in the Arctic. This is especially true in northern Asia near the Barents, Kara, Laptev and Siberian Seas, where parts of the region averaged a remarkable 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.

SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, look, Mister Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his sixty billion dollars and that's legal. All I can say is at this point we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working-class and middle-class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--
A huge part of Vladimir Putin's power base on the world stage is the fact that so much of Europe depends on oil and gas from Russia, Hoeven said. And [ISIS] is relying on oil and gas dollars to fund its brutal terrorist activities in the Middle East and beyond.
How does this relationship work? As the scientists' observations reflected only the comparison of weather patterns over time -- and not what was driving them -- the researchers could not conclude that a warmer Arctic was directly responsible for harsh winter storms in the U.S., they reported in the study.
She has emphasized that she believes the election is a decency check on Mr. Trump and in order to send a strong message, Democrats need to win big. Last thing that I will say is just that we want to win, Klobuchar said in Waterloo on Sunday. And my profound advice to you is we'd better not screw this up. And we better put someone at the top of the ticket, and this is my piece for me, someone at the top of the ticket that has the record of bringing people with her and winning big.

Now in the 2009 [flu] pandemic the only occasions we documented outbreaks in the summertime were in places where there was close contact, such as military ships and dorms. So contact is obviously a very important issue, but there may be this overlying effect of the environment, like the climate of a place, that acts as an upper boundary as to how much virus activity there can be.

There has been a clear top tier of Democratic hopefuls in Iowa since the early fall: former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Two of those candidates, Sanders and Warren, have been stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial the past two weeks, while Biden and Buttigieg have been able to camp out in the state. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who has also been in Washington for impeachment, has been working to break into that top tier for several months.
His battle with Joe Biden on Social Security
However, the broad scale and intensity of overall warmth across the Northern Hemisphere cannot be explained without climate change. Each year more signs emerge that human-caused climate change is playing a bigger role. A peer-reviewed paper published March 10 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters shows the climate-warming signal is becoming more apparent, with many regions already experiencing a climate which would be 'unknown' by late 19th century standards.
In other words, the oceans were just hiding the heat and now new tools have enabled scientists to find it.
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Two of their best spokespeople were talking past each other this morning, yes, and I think elsewhere as well. Look, the staff meetings that are happening this weekend that the vice president is chairing is usually the kind of thing you see on maybe day two or day three of a shutdown. We can forgive the holidays, we can forgive the fact that people weren't in town. Maybe that's the delay. But what are we on, day sixteen now? And-- and this continues to stretch out and-- and given that they're still at that very preliminary point, where they are still only beginning to define what border security means to everybody--
When asked how she would address a government shutdown, Gillibrand reiterated she would try to find common ground between differing parties. She gave examples of her own bipartisanship, such as working on sexual harassment legislation with a Republican unpopular with Democrats.
You can keep reminding people of data and science that climate change is happening and that polar bears are going to ultimately disappear, but at some point, you have to slap people in the face and just say, 'This is what's happening, this is what climate change looks like,' Nicklen said.

Hurricanes were only part of the natural disaster landscape described by Aon. In the past year alone there were typhoons in Japan and East Asia, flooding in Japan and China and drought in Central Europe. All told, the company tallied 394 significant natural catastrophes in 2018, costing a total of $225 billion.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the UN says of you that you're not welcome in that country and Anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?
Well, there's some different solutions. And if you really have to do it yourself and you have half-inch plywood, just put up two, Gritzo said.

The pay as you go rule, commonly known as PAYGO, requires that any increase in entitlement spending be offset by cuts in other entitlement programs, or by new revenue raisers, in order to prevent the deficit from increasing. The deficit jumped by 17 percent in 2018, after the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul passed in 2017. While managing a yawning deficit may be a priority for presumed incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi, it angers progressives who oppose cutting some entitlement spending in order to increase funding for other programs.
Schumer said the security failures were unacceptable and pledged that the events would be fully investigated and every necessary security measure taken for Mr. Biden's inauguration inauguration in just over a week.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: It remains a multicandidate race. There's no question about it. And I think part of that is you look at Bernie Sanders and you look at, despite that enthusiasm that he has, can he grow it? Can he draw people to him? And when we ask folks, most of the people supporting Sanders say they've already liked him. They've liked him for a long time. But far fewer say they've taken-- taken a second or third look at him as he's won these early states. So can he translate any success he's had into momentum going forward and build on that twenty-five, that thirty percent that he's already got? That, I think, remains a key question.
Zuckerberg, whose wealth nearly doubled to $105 billion in the March-to-December period according to Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, has been widely criticized and been called to testify before Congress for his company's handling of disinformation in the runup to the 2020 presidential election.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan in Washington and this week on FACE THE NATION, the coronavirus has now claimed the life of an American within the U.S. and the number of infected has increased and now includes cases of unknown origin. Meanwhile, the Trump administration scrambles to calm fears of Americans concerned with the spread of coronavirus and its impact on the economy as the stock market has its worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. Plus, it's a big win for former Vice President Joe Biden in South Carolina. As the candidates head to Super Tuesday, can he stop Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders?
Natural gas, which has become a cheap and attractive competitor to coal, is cleaner-burning, but it is still a fossil fuel, emitting about half the carbon dioxide that coal does. Earlier studies have found that switching over all the world's coal plants to natural gas would do little to curb climate change.

If you take the oceans out of the equation, on land 2020 was far and away the warmest year on record, having warmed almost 2 °C above pre-industrial levels. This warming dries out vegetation and soil, expands deserts and inflames wildfires like those that tore through the western U.S. in recent months.
Anderson Cooper: These are politically dangerous tactics that you're using...
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, if a compromise is reached in the Senate, where you see some kind of increased funding for border security, call it a wall, call it some kind of fence, but something put on the table for Democrats. Do you see your-- your fellow House members getting on board?
If the pandemic and economic recession had never happened, the report estimates U.S. emissions would have dropped only about 3%, driven mainly by the decline of coal-fired power plants as well as lower heating demand due to a warmer winter.
And this disturbance of the polar vortex could end up shaping conditions that worsen winter weather in the U.S.
Miraculously, it didn't. And with vacuums running around the clock, the water went down so the curtain could go up. The opening scene from Verdi's Don Carlo? A prayer for the dead.
There are four endemic coronaviruses [a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses] that circulate within humans. Studies and data I have seen show three or even all four of them circulating seasonally, peaking during the wintertime and pretty much disappearing during the summer months. And it's an even more marked seasonality than we see for flu, which also in temperate regions is like that.
If there had been these micro grids might it have been that PG&E would not have had to cut off power to millions of consumers? Whitaker asked.
NOAA says 2017 was the second-warmest year on record worldwide.
Given the groundwork we already laid and the growing investment risks surrounding sustainability, we will be increasingly disposed to vote against management when companies have not made sufficient progress, the spokesperson said.
In 2016 there was a super El Niño — one of the strongest on record. The event released vast amounts of heat which easily propelled 2016 to the warmest year globally on record. This year, despite the cool La Niña event in the Pacific, 2020 still managed to tie 2016. Without the La Niña cooling, 2020 would have been solidly in the No. 1 position. This illustrates just how powerful human-caused warming has become.
ALEX AZAR: So this individual and we just want to express our sympathy, certainly for his family and for all who are suffering from the coronavirus, this individual was in the hospital out in Calif-- out-- out in Washington. We do not know how he contracted the virus, yet. And so that's why we and the State of Washington are deployed out there to try to trace who he had contact with and how he might have gotten the virus. That's why we call it right now a potential community case, meaning we don't have a discernible connection to any travel to Korea or China or any other impacted area.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But words so far have produced no solution as a quarter of the U.S. government remains shuttered for the third week. President Trump warns it could last months or years and Democrats dig in.
MIKE POMPEO: --never got to see. John Kerry never got to see those side deals. This is-- this is not that. This is a fully transparent arrangement. And as for-- and as--
Shaul Bassi: The real, real threat, as far as I'm concerned, is that it may actually push even more people away and will leave the city as a kind of ghost town, as a beautiful empty museum.
Biden leads on perceived ability to protect the U.S. from terrorism, and 84% of Democrats say he's prepared to be commander-in-chief – though this measure doesn't really explain the caucus vote, since even those who are not backing him overwhelmingly think he's prepared. About two-thirds of Democrats say Warren and Sanders each are prepared. Buttigieg lags all the other top-tier candidates on this preparedness measure.
Anderson Cooper: But being factually correct is important—
At another stop, Turman reports, Buttigieg again went after Biden and Sanders. He framed Sanders' vision as a revolution where nothing counts unless you go all the way. Buttigieg took on two of Sanders' signature policy proposals: Medicare for All, the ambitious and expensive plan for the government to provide health care to all Americans, and free public college.
A genetic test won't offer any insight into a given turtle's sex, since sea turtles don't carry their sexes in their genetic code. But the researchers found that if they brought blood plasma samples back to their lab, they could use hormonal differences to distinguish male and female turtles.
And the title track, with its infectious R&B hook and powerhouse vocals -- that's no simple love song either.
Nationwide, our utilities are cutting their emissions, cutting their carbon. It's a glorious success system for the country as a whole, he said. Trying to maintain that momentum without your hometown utility is a losing proposition.
But topping the agenda for the Democrat-controlled Senate will be coronavirus relief legislation that includes $2,000 direct payments to Americans. Congress passed another emergency package at the end of 2020 that included $600 checks, but efforts to boost the payments — pushed by President Trump and Democrats — failed.

Antarctica seems less stable than we thought a few years ago, Rutgers climate scientist Robert Kopp said.
While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, natural gas not only beat out renewables to [replace] most of this lost generation but also fed most of the growth in electricity demand, the report said.
News of the internal letter comes after a group of 200 scientists and academics called for the removal of Mercer from the museum board in an open letter last week.
First World nations-- and this is what I said at the U.N. I said, 'First World nations make the greatest contribution to climate change,' Minnis told Whitaker. They are the ones responsible for the changes that we see. The increase in velocity and ferocity of the hurricanes and the different-- and the changes, typhoons that we see today, but we're the innocent victim. We're the ones that are being impacted by what you have created.
ALEX AZAR: That is absolutely not the case. So, first, we take the protection of our employees very seriously. Second, we want to make sure isolation and quarantine procedures are followed as appropriate. Third, we appreciate the whistleblower bringing forward any concerns. We are aggressively looking into any-- if-- to see whether there's validity to the concerns. But what the American people should need to know is that we now have passed well over fourteen days since any HHS employee had contact with the individuals involved. They are not-- nobody is symptomatic. Nobody has a disease. Even if these allegations prove to be true, there was no spreading of the disease from this.
However, it still falls short of the goal the U.S. set in the 2015 Paris Agreement of a 26% to 28% drop below 2005 emissions levels. While President Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement in 2019, President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to rejoin it. Still, even with 2020's reduced emissions levels, the U.S. does not appear to be on track to meet the agreement's 2025 goal as economic activity picks back up, according to Rhodium Group.
Over the past 40 years, damage from major weather and climate disasters has cost the United States nearly $2 trillion dollars. A closer look at the data reveals that recently the cost of such incidents has been escalating quickly, due in part to human-caused climate change.
Former national security adviser John Bolton's book manuscript has piqued the interest of Joe Biden, who mentioned it today at a campaign stop in Fort Madison, Iowa, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson noted. It's the timing that caught his attention. According to a New York Times report, in early May last year, President Trump told Bolton to call the Ukrainian president, a political neophyte who had just won the presidency, in order to ensure that he'd meet with the president's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.
BRITISH COLUMBIA, Canada -- Only on CBS This Morning, National Geographic Adventure is revealing its eight most inspiring Adventures of the Year. They're chosen for embodying the spirit of adventure in groundbreaking ways.
Two recent disasters that come to mind in which flooding made up the vast majority of economic damage include 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which cost the U.S. a staggering $125 billion, and the historic 2019 Midwest floods which devastated the heartland and cost around $3 billion.
That's actually two and a half houses, Brian Malone said when Whitaker pointed out a pile of rubble. Mine's on the bottom.
Then just three days later the opposite occurred: the North Pacific and Alaska recorded their lowest pressures on record as a huge Aleutian low reached a pressure as low as a Category 5 hurricane.
John Dickerson: How much faster has that pace quickened?
This is an area of hot debate and research among scientists and probably is a mix of human-caused climate change and natural variability, said Furtado. Climate change hasn't made the polar vortex more extreme, but it probably is making it move more, which makes the weather seem more extreme, he said.
Two of them did so as a couple. Paul Nicklen and Cristina Mittermeier are photographers. They met in the cafeteria of National Geographic's headquarters. Their dramatic images of the natural world have won millions of social media followers, turning them into conservation superstars.

Another topic, of course, all of you haven't been on the job very long, but very quickly--we did see one of your colleagues introduce articles of impeachment. The House Oversight Chairman, Elijah Cummings, said that's premature. What do you all think? Is that too soon?
While Earth's surface temperature is at the mercy of fluctuations on natural climate cycles, which is why temperatures go up and down year to year, the ocean is a lot more stable. As a result the oceans have been warming at a more steady rate.
Global temperature departures from average in 2020 Berkeley Earth
Past climate projections predicted that, in a warming world, winters would be the seasons to heat up the fastest -- and yet recent winters in the Northern Hemisphere were more severe than scientists anticipated, said Judah Cohen, the study's lead author and director of seasonal forecasting at Atmospheric and Environmental Research, an organization that assesses risks from weather events and climate change.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --the first ten days.
Mr. Biden, too, has vowed that another coronavirus relief measure will be a foremost priority for him once he is sworn in January 20.
It's one of my, probably, my favorite things on this planet to do, is to swim with leopard seals, Nicklen said. I took Christina down there last year and she jumped in the water, and that's when I knew Christina was the girl for me 'cause there are not many people who are going to stick it out with that animal!
The new data could also help researchers understand how hurricane patterns will change as the climate warms, the researchers said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The U.S. pledged in this agreement, which is public, as you say, that it will help to get up to five thousand Taliban prisoners released. The president of Afghanistan, Ashraf Ghani, says no way, no how. He-- nothing like that was agreed to. All of this is supposed to happen in the next ten days. Did the U.S. agree to help release five thousand prisoners?
On average during the winter there is a typical jet stream pattern across Europe and Asia with a ridge to the west and a trough to the east. But because of Arctic Amplification from climate change this jet stream can be magnified (made more extreme) which has implications for weather around the Northern Hemisphere. CBS News
MARGARET BRENNAN: --to voting for increased border security beyond the 1.3 billion that all of you signed off on already?
But, Monteleone said, geopolitics plays a huge role in why China is pushing the project. This is the thing: It looks like an economical initiative, but in fact it is probably more of a foreign policy initiative. This is leverage China will have on countries once they start economic relations.
Anderson Cooper: When people hear the word socialism, they think Soviet Union, Cuba, Venezuela. Is that what you have in mind?
Additionally, WHO predicts that between 2030 and 2050 climate change is expected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year, from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea and heat stress.
DAN BALZ: And-- and whatever-- and-- and frankly-- and, yeah. So whatever that means. And I think it's-- it is remarkable that we have gone now two-plus weeks and there has been absolutely no indication of where the negotiating could actually take place. Every time they sit down, they seem to be farther away than they were and more dug in. It feels as though each side still believes that this can be a win-lose proposition. I win, you lose.
Trouet said she and her colleagues first got the idea while at a conference for tree-ring researchers. At that meeting, Trouet mentioned that the National Hurricane Center began tracking Caribbean hurricanes only in 1850, making it hard to understand how climatic change had affected hurricane season. But one of her colleagues, dendrochronologist Grant Harley of the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, noted that in the Florida Keys, people kept tree-ring data going back to 1707. And because hurricanes can stunt trees, hurricane intensity can be gleaned from those tree rings.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That DACA and TPS for a wall?
I placed my bet on American manufacturing, Mr. Obama said in the Saturday video. In exchange for help, we demanded responsibility. We said the auto industry would have to truly change, not just pretend that it did. We got labor and management to settle their differences. We got the industry to retool and restructure.
So you have this initial big outlay to build these panels, Whitaker said to Heastie. But over time, the cost of generating power actually goes down?
The EPA has been one of the most active agencies in carrying out President Trump's mandate to roll back regulations that conservative groups have identified as being unnecessary and burdensome to industry.
John Dickerson: Was it more well-attended this year than it woulda been in the past?
The largest emissions growth was in sectors that don't get much attention outside climate policy circles: Industry and buildings. The industrial sector added 55 million metric tons of carbon last year, more than four times its annual average in the past decade, because of an uptick in industrial activity. The sector is predicted to grow its gassiness and to become the leading carbon emitter in Texas within three years, according to Rhodium.
Before the argument, Biden was greeted by hundreds of hooting-and-hollering IBEW members excited to meet the Democratic frontrunner.
While all the world is telling people to stay at home, those indigenous people are suffering from people trying to invade their forest, she said. And if that happens, we already know that boy... he's from the Yanomami people. Miners are all over the place. They have people who are in contact with them.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that we have serious issues throughout the country. The point here is that what I'm not willing to do is spend billions of dollars on what amounts to a vanity project--a fifth century solution to a twenty-first century problem. What, you want to also bring horses back to the United States cavalry?
NASA's GIS dataset shows 2020 as the warmest year, but only by a minuscule margin, whereas the NOAA and Berkeley Earth data show 2020 a hair behind 2016 for the warmest year globally on record. Just last week the European climate agency Copernicus showed 2020 tied with 2016.

The remarkable event is called a Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW), and it involves the temperatures 50,000 to 100,000 feet above the ground. It disrupts the typical winter climate pattern in the Arctic stratosphere famously known as the polar vortex, and typically leads to more extreme winter weather in parts of the United States.
NANCY PELOSI: We're not a doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?
Gillibrand would join a Democratic presidential field beginning to take shape. Over the weekend, former Housing and Urban Development (HUD) secretary Julián Castro formally launched his presidential bid, while Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren launched an exploratory committee on New Year's Eve. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii said over the weekend she plans to form an exploratory committee in the coming days. Several other senators, current and former governors and mayors, and former Vice President Joe Biden are still mulling potential campaigns.
The insurance industry is demonstrating one way to handle rising costs: pass them on to homeowners in the form of high wildfire deductibles. Some insurers, faced with higher payouts, could outright refuse to insure homes in wildfire-prone areas.
SEN. SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel. I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.
The novel coronavirus has brought life to a standstill around the world and left millions of people wondering when things will return to some semblance of normal. One hope is that the virus could perhaps behave somewhat like the seasonal flu — taking a break during the warmer summer months, lessening the threat and giving society time to mount a systemic response. But there are many unanswered questions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Given that it is so fast moving, what are your projections now? How many Americans do you expect to come down with this virus?
But it wasn't just one flood. For days in November, Venetians woke to the sound of tones warning of more record breaking tides. Venice has always been vulnerable. The city is also slowly sinking, but the water is rising higher and more frequently. Three of the eight highest tides in Venice's recorded history occurred just in November. This is becoming the new normal. And water-logged Venetians wonder how much more this ancient city can take.
Burgess and Justin Locke run the 'Islands Energy Program' for an American non-profit called the Rocky Mountain Institute. They have solar projects throughout Hurricane Alley. After Category 5 Maria hit Puerto Rico in 2017, they put microgrids on the roofs of ten schools. Maria also brushed St. Vincent, which has now installed its first microgrid. Now, the Islands Energy Program has come to Marsh Harbour.
These extreme events are damaging many of Venice's masterpieces, like the 900-year-old Basilica of St. Mark, known as the Church of Gold. Its marble floors were swamped on November 12, and downstairs water buried the crypt for only the second time ever. The water receded but left behind salt, which italians call the cancer because it eats away at mosaics and foundations. Pierpaolo Campostrini, who helps manage the basilica, pled for his church and his city.
All in all, the various reports lead to the same conclusion: Earth's temperature continues to march upwards due to continued greenhouse gas emissions. The good news, scientists say, is that if society chooses to reduce emissions to near zero in the coming decades, the global warming trend could be stopped rather quickly, lessening the most severe impacts of climate change.

The microgrids Prime Minister Minnis is talking about are small-scale systems. More and more, they're solar arrays with battery storage for when the sun's not shining. They can either feed electricity into the larger grid or operate independently to power a single facility or a neighborhood. The way electricity has been produced in the Bahamas is with diesel-fueled generating stations on each inhabited island, about 30 in all, feeding power to everyone through overhead lines.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But is the President open--
In the Arctic the sudden warming in the stratosphere typically leads to blocking areas of high pressure — like a mountain of warm air — known as the negative Arctic oscillation, or -AO. As it turns out, the -AO is already underway and this SSW episode should act to prolong it. This blocking pattern forces and redirects the jet stream and cold Arctic air southward.
Eliminating the influence of corporate money in politics is another one of Ocasio-Cortez's signature issues. Most of her campaign funds came from small donations of $200 or less. She did accept some money from labor unions, but she refuses to take any contributions from corporate political action committees. She's angered some of her colleagues in the House by encouraging primary challenges of Democrats who accept corporate money or oppose progressive policies.
O'Donnell: So you believe it is wrong that Vice President Biden supported a freeze of cost-of-living adjustments in Social Security?

If we are able to close our homes and shut off our offices and be safe at home from the virus, those communities are not having the same safety because the government and the authorities are not able to take from their territories the invaders, she said Friday. The miners and illegal loggers — they don't do home office, so they're in their territories.
Sanders: No, of course, I won't. Not on that one, I won't. For many, many years as a United States senator, Joe Biden has been on the floor and elsewhere, talking about the need to freeze or cut Social Security benefits. He voted for the Balanced Budget amendment.
Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos made the single-largest charitable contribution in 2020, according to The Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual list of top donations — a $10 billion gift aimed at fighting climate change.
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ: I think so. I think — I think we've compromised things that we shouldn't have compromised, whether it's judgeships with Mitch McConnell, whether it's compromising on climate change. I think we've — there are some things that we've compromised a little bit too much on. But am I open to compromise on certain ways to get things done? Absolutely. Absolutely.
Generally, first-time offenders would get warnings, while repeat offenders risk fines.
O'Donnell: President Obama's former campaign manager, Jim Messina, said-- this about you in a matchup with President Trump, I'm a business guy, the economy's good, and this guy's a socialist, that that's what Trump would say about you. Do you acknowledge it would be an uphill battle against President Trump?
Because each agency uses slightly different data and different methods to analyze that data, the assessments differ slightly, but all fall within a few hundredths of a degree of each other.
Anderson Cooper: You're talking about zero carbon emissions— no use of fossil fuels within 12 years.
Co-author and University of Illinois entomologist May Berenbaum, a National Medal of Science winner, said, Insect decline is kind of comparable to climate change 30 years ago because the methods to assess the extent, the rate (of loss) were difficult.
Support for clean energy in the U.S. has risen to record highs in recent surveys, but adoption of those clean energy sources is lagging far behind.
Absent a significant change in policy or a major technological breakthrough we expect the industrial sector to become an increasingly large share of US greenhouse gas emission in the years ahead, the report found.
Ed Maibach is a professor at George Mason University's Center for Climate Change Communication and co-author of the Politics and Global Warming study. Commenting in general on policy, not specifically on the Climate Leadership Council plan, he says his public opinion research finds strong support for a range of climate solutions policies, even when we mention the costs explicitly. Sometimes, policy support actually increases when we mention the estimated cost per household, for example, about 50 cents per day, probably because the projected costs strike people as a good deal.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --but it will include a wall. And if there is no wall in this deal we'll never have a deal.

ANTHONY SALVANTO: And that Bloomberg number that you talk about is so critical because if he does do just well enough to pick up delegates, if he picks up delegates in some regions of these states, even if he doesn't win them, then that changes the math for everybody else. Now he is a player. But if he falls just short of it, then all those delegates can go to other top candidates, to a-- to a Biden or to a Sanders and that changes the math going forward for them.
The Bahamas' goal is to produce 30% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. Justin Locke and Chris Burgess of the Islands Energy Program believe the country can do even better.
ALEX AZAR: No we don't. We- we don't-- we do not use-- because it is an unknown, the epidemiological spread of this virus in a highly developed health care system that was on it with-- at the most aggressive containment measures in the history of the United States. It is unknown how that will spread. In terms of testing kits, we've already tested over thirty-six hundred people for the virus. We now have seventy-- the capability in-- out-- in the field to test seventy-five thousand people. And within the next week or two we'll have a radical expansion even beyond that of the testing that's available.
Our first month's filing represents a down payment and commitment in all 50 states to defeat Donald Trump, and it shows we have the resources and plan necessary to take him on, Bloomberg 2020 Campaign Manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement released by the campaign.

Detroit — Joe Biden had a heated exchange with a construction worker who accused him of trying to take Americans' guns away during a campaign stop in Michigan, one of six states holding primaries on Tuesday.
Cohen theorizes that the warming process underway in the stratospheric Arctic right now was initiated in October. In northwest Russia and Scandinavia, the warmer Arctic Ocean results in an enhanced heat dome which pushes the jet stream north.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, you have to have a number you're working with in order to make sure that you have adequate supply, things like testing kits, right? So--
MIKE POMPEO: You saw what the document says. It says, we will work with all relevant--
Incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain distributed a memo Saturday that reiterated Mr. Biden's intention to fulfill several of his promises — some geared toward immediate action to arrest the surging coronavirus pandemic, some to roll back the actions taken by President Trump in the last four years, and others to address problems that have persisted over several administrations.
Taken together, 2017 and 2018 were the costliest years for weather-related disasters on record, with total losses of $653 billion, according to a new analysis
The museum said in a statement that it does not make appointment decisions concerning trustees based on political views, and that funders do not shape curatorial decisions.
Other expenses include $14 million in payments to his private company Bloomberg LP. A campaign aide tells CBS News that these expenses include air travel, as Mayor Bloomberg travels on a plane owned by Bloomberg LP and it also includes personnel costs, for employees who switched over to Bloomberg's presidential campaign. Hawkfish LLC, a tech start-up launched by Bloomberg also received $12 million for its advertising work for the campaign. The campaign also disclosed $679,000 in spending for some campaign staffers living in New York City, the location of the campaign headquarters. Housing and furniture were offered to some staffers who relocated to the city, regardless of seniority. The campaign listed the merchandise it sold as other receipts, saying that the products were union-made in the USA, and priced at cost.
Environmental groups urged officials to crack down more aggressively on wasteful water use rather than rely on policies that encourage neighbors to develop good practices.
After the new House is seated, one of the first orders of business will be approving the new rules package governing the House for this term. Assuming none of the 197 Republicans vote to approve the rules package, the 234-member Democratic conference cannot afford to lose more than 16 votes in order for it to pass.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And it's off to the races as the battle for the 2020 presidential contest begins to take shape. One high-profile Democrat jumps in.

This is a very ugly picture in terms of the water supply management, Leahigh said.
The UN is stressing that it needs the money immediately, reports CBS News foreign correspondent Debora Patta.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- A proposal to make California's drought-era water restrictions permanent could allow the state to chip away at long-held water rights in an unprecedented power grab, representatives from water districts and other users told regulators Tuesday. Members of the state Water Resources Control Board delayed a decision about whether to bring back what had been temporary water bans from California's drought, spanning 2013 to 2017. The plan is part of an effort to make water conservation a way of life, with climate change expected to lead to longer, more severe droughts.
MARK LANDLER: Yeah. No, the President said in essence that the Soviet Union has been right to invade Afghanistan. He offered a series of reasons for that that were not factually based. He said it was an anti-terrorism move, it really wasn't. And-- and he also attributed the collapse of the Soviet Union to their misadventures in Afghanistan which is not right, it's not totally wrong but there were many other reasons for the collapse of Soviet Union. But to-- to get back to the political point you were raising, I think the troop withdrawal debate is an interesting one because it is true that he ran on withdrawing American troops from foreign conflicts. I think it's--
China is the biggest trading partner for all of its Asian neighbors and a growing investor. But some Asian governments are uneasy about Beijing's strategic ambitions, especially after it built artificial islands and military bases in the South China Sea to enforce its claim to most of the region.
Making matters worse is that in many cases, people hate bugs, even though they pollinate the world's foods, are crucial to the food chain and get rid of waste, she said.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: And it cost us seven hundred and fifty dollars a day to house these minors and only God knows what they go through to get here. The Democrats see our law enforcement officers as the problem, we see the illegal immigrants, the coyotes, and the drug dealers as a problem--

Why chemical engineers are now studying coffee The University of California-Davis hopes to become the worldwide epicenter of coffee research, just as climate change threatens the multi-billion dollar industry. With the land in some countries that farm coffee eroding, researchers hope to find an environmentally-friendly solution that will also let you still have your regular morning cup. Dana Jacobson speaks to scientists who are working on the coffee genome.
The most extreme events have been intensifying more rapidly as a result of climate change, and this is a pattern that is true across the country, even in regions where average precipitation has not changed or has decreased slightly, explains the study's lead author, Frances Davenport, a PhD student at Stanford Earth.
ED O'KEEFE (CBS News Political Correspondent/@edokeefe): Well, his team would tell you this is the momentum they need to convince any late-deciding voter who is not a fan of Bernie Sanders to side with them instead. Their hope is that by the end of Tuesday, he emerges as the clear alternative to Sanders. It's pretty mathematically impossible, based on what polling is showing us right now, for somebody to surpass Sanders, especially because he is going to have such a big win, it looks like, in places like California. But they are hoping, the Biden team is, that in the next few days they are able to raise millions of dollars and again convince people that he is the leading alternative.

As a result of the unusually warm weather this winter, seasonal rhythms have been thrown off kilter. As CBS News reported earlier this week, in places from Moscow to the U.S. bears have been seen coming out of hibernation early. Connecticut's Beardsley Zoo says its native black bears emerged in early March — almost a month earlier than usual.

Dokoupil asked, So, the solution is, get a friend to help you pick up the one-inch plywood?
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --including walls and fences. Except now when Trump is President.
Absolutely, Heastie said. By using what God has blessed us with, which is the natural sun.
We are thrilled that voters could soon have the chance to see Mike Bloomberg on the debate stage, hear his vision for the country, and see why he is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump and bring our country together, Bloomberg's campaign manager Kevin Sheekey said in a statement. Mike has run for office three times and never taken a dime from special interests, allowing him to act independently, on the merits, without having to do what donors expect. He is proud to be doing the same with this campaign.
Even in Weissensee, there are worrying signs. High in the mountains, there was almost no snow in the village and ice wasn't thick enough in some parts of the lake to use its entire surface for the race.
Since the scale is now used as much in a scientific context as it is a damage assessment context, it makes sense to introduce a category six to describe the unprecedented strength 200 mph storms we've seen over the past few years both globally [Patricia] and here in the southern hemisphere [Winston], said climatologist Michael Mann, director of Penn State University's Earth System Science Center.

Chinese officials insist the initiative is purely commercial, but foreign diplomats and political analysts also see an effort by the Communist Beijing government to promote its ambitions to rewrite global rules on trade and security and reduce the U.S. presence in Asia.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's absolutely risky. it requires risk to try something new, but also we— we know so much of— of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked, either.
According to Berkeley Earth, global mean temperature in 2020 — which includes both surface air and ocean temperatures — is estimated to have been 1.27 °C (2.29 °F) above the pre-industrial 1850-1900 average. Pre-industrial is the time before greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels started to impact the climate. That means the planet is only a quarter of a degree away from surpassing the Paris Agreement goal of staying below 1.5 °C of warming.
When you see the extent of the destruction, where do you even begin? Whitaker asked Bahamian Prime Minister Hubert Minnis. How do you even begin?
Just weeks after Dorian hit, Prime Minister Minnis spoke at the United Nations. He emphasized that most of the Bahamas was not damaged and eager for tourists, the lifeblood of the economy. Then he said that first-world countries and their pollution are at least partly to blame for the threat of ever-stronger hurricanes.
Many Americans support making that transition. A March 2018 study, Politics and Global Warming, by researchers at Yale and George Mason Universities, finds majority support across party lines for developing cleaner energy.
This is a public health decision for clean air and clean water; an economic decision for America's global preeminence in green technology; a security decision to keep us safe; and a moral decision to be good stewards of God's creation, Pelosi will say about the need for Congress to combat climate change.
Harry also allegedly told the prank callers he and his wife Meghan had not been stripped of their royal titles, as had been widely reported.
After Ragged Island was devastated, I made a statement: Let us show the world what can be done, Prime Minister Minnis said. We may be small, but we can set an example to the world.
MIKE POMPEO: I don't know when. I don't know where. I-- I'm very confident. President Trump wants to make sure that everyone in Afghanistan understands that the United States is committed to making sure that this conversation take place. We have been at this for an awful long time. You recounted the loss of American life. There's a better path forward. The Taliban now know this because of the work that we've done. And President Trump will be actively engaged in helping us get the conditions right and beginning this journey that the first step was taken in Doha yesterday.
There are also takeaways for consumers. One machine can test shingles against hurricane-force winds. Dokoupil watched during one test in which a roof was ripped off.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Do you expect drug shortages, as some senators have highlighted concerns there could be because of disruption to the supply chain?
Dr. Shaman: There's something to that that might be intriguing. If you look at Southeast Asia, the countries that have cases of COVID-19 but have not gone out of control are Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand and Taiwan; they have kept the growth of the virus linear. Korea and China, on the other hand, are further north and more temperate and have had bigger outbreaks to deal with. This could be a manifestation of differing climates, but it's pure speculation. This may much more reflect that they [Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand, Taiwan] have engaged in much more proactive control of the virus and are successful at it. The Japanese have also kept the growth of cases linear even though they have had a substantial number of cases. They have managed to control it, even though they are a temperate [colder and less humid] country. So, although there is this tantalizing possibility that the virus spreads less in warmer or more humid climates, it could also be linked to a country's response to the outbreak.
Siberia temperature departure from average Berkeley Earth
Gov. Jerry Brown lifted California's emergency drought status a year ago, after a wet winter. Strict 25 percent conservation orders for cities and towns and other restrictions then were phased out.
For example, it's estimated that rainfall from Hurricane Harvey was 15 percent to 38 percent greater because of climate change. As the ocean and air warms, extreme flooding events will increase.
A constant target of Mr. Trump, Bloomberg made his intentions clear from at every speech that his focus was beating Mr. Trump in the general election.
If there was a window behind it, this 2x4 would have smashed through the plywood and glass, exposing the inside to additional damage from wind and rain.

The Democratic National Committee is switching the qualifications for candidates to participate in the Nevada Democratic presidential primary debate, including eliminating the unique donor threshold, which paves the way for Mike Bloomberg to potentially qualify for future presidential debates.
NOAA's data shows global temperatures were just 0.04 of a degree Fahrenheit below the record high set in 2016 — making it officially the second warmest ever, but so close that it's effectively tied, according to scientists from Berkeley Earth.
Among the causes raising those risks: shifts in population to vulnerable locations such as low-lying shorelines, as well as a changing -- and warming -- climate that is contributing to more volatile weather patterns, Aon said.
Since our plan went into effect, our automakers have added more than 640,000 new jobs, Mr. Obama said. We've cut the Detroit-area unemployment rate by more than half. The Big Three automakers are raising wages.
Her victory made national news, and she soon had a higher media profile than many veteran lawmakers. Some saw in her primary victory a craving for change within the Democratic Party. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi drew a more limited conclusion:
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --across a spectrum of disease. And the people who are mildly symptomatic shed as much virus as the people who are very sick and that's atypical. Typically, the amount of virus you have and shed to-- in-- in some diseases comports with how much-- how much of virus you have.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --an indefinite timeline of U.S. troops staying in Syria.
A 2015 study led by Cornell University's Dr. Toby Ault found a regional trend in earlier leaf out, indicated by the orange colors in the map below, by up to 1.6 days per decade due to a warming climate on top of natural fluctuations.
The group tracked the real-time energy and emissions impact of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout 2020. It estimates that the historic shock to economic activity led to a 10.3% drop in U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2020. This finding is based on preliminary economic and energy data.
And microgrids in the Caribbean are starting to show their value. When earthquakes struck Puerto Rico in January, the entire island's big electrical grid was shut down for days. But remember those solar microgrids installed at schools? They kept providing power. The lessons can really apply anywhere.
The presidential candidates' faces were super-imposed onto characters from Game of Thrones or made to look as though they were jogging the streets like Rocky.

Alvanei Xirizana, 15, died on Thursday in a hospital in the state of Roraima, Reuters reported, citing local health authorities. He belonged to the relatively isolated Yanomami tribe, whose more than 38,000 members occupy rainforests and mountains in northern Brazil and southern Venezuela, according to human rights group Survival International. Advocates say deforestation and development by miners and loggers, encouraged by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, have threatened indigenous people's territory.
ED O'KEEFE: Yeah. I mean, Senator Warren was the first-- second to do it actually, Julian Castro, the former HUD secretary, was the first before Christmas, and will make it official next weekend. But where is everybody else? You might ask. And-- and they are still mulling it. I think we have at least seven Democratic senators who are thinking about it, some big city and small city mayors, Governor Inslee of Washington State said this week he's still thinking about it. So you will see in the coming weeks continued discussions about this people saying, yeah, I'm still thinking about it. Unless you think it's just empty talk, I-- I heard a story from somebody who met the former vice president at an event and said to him, my mother really wants you to run.
Instead, BlackRock has said it is asking companies to better disclose to investors their environmental risks and the costs those may entail in the future. BlackRock has not said what it would do if it turns out those costs are high — or if companies are unwilling to make those disclosures at all.
Although Bloomberg used his large network of support from mayors across the country and organizations like Every Town and Moms Demand Action, the former mayor and one-time Republican had a hard time distancing himself from his past.
Sea level rise, more than temperature, is a better gauge of climate change in action, said Anny Cazenave, director of Earth Science at the International Space Science Institute in France, who edited the study. Cazenave is one of the pioneers of space-based sea level research.
Even for an Arctic that is warming at three times the pace of the rest of the globe due to climate change — a phenomenon known as Arctic amplification — this is an extreme departure from normal. The result was record-breaking low sea-ice extent near the Siberian coast.
The man repeated his accusation that Biden was trying to take our guns, and Biden pushed back. I did not say that. I did not say that.
JOE BIDEN: You launched Bill Clinton, Barack Obama to the presidency. Now you launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump. This campaign has taken off.
Last June, the chemical engineer became what's believed to be the oldest American ever awarded a patent. He says that system could be a big step in saving the world from climate change.
During our eight days in Venice, we found the city on edge because the water keeps defeating the accommodations residents have already made to it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You're waiting on the Mueller Report?
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yes, he is.
This is no reason to panic.
This year's devastating hurricanes in the U.S. -- Florence, which hit the Carolinas in September and Michael, which roared through the Florida Panhandle the following month -- cost $15 billion and $17 billion, respectively, professional services firm Aon said in a report that evaluates the impact of natural disasters. But they were dwarfed by 2017's Hurricane Harvey, which flooded Houston and resulted in losses of $125 billion.
In that survey, 87 percent of registered voters (94 percent of Democrats and 79 percent of Republicans) favor funding more research into renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power.
Ever since the fifth century, Venice has depended on the water for survival. This improbable Italian city, knit together between islands, used water as a barrier against invaders to become a jewel of the world. Then came the night of November 12.
The 116th Congress was sworn into office this past week, even as the government remained in a partial shutdown. A record number of women have been elected to the House of Representatives. So far, one newcomer is getting most of the attention, from both the left and from the right. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is 29 years old. She'd never run for elective office before and was working as a waitress and bartender when she launched her campaign. She unseated one of the most powerful Democrats in the House in the primary.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But here's-- here's the shock-- here's the shocking thing, though--2016 and 2018 were not that different. It's just different political parties run-- won. If you think about what Donald Trump ran on, okay? If you put some of the racist stuff aside for a moment, which is difficult, I know. But he spoke about infrastructure, he spoke about drug costs, he wants to protect Medicare and Social Security, draining the swamp. We ran on many of those same things, the American people right now are united, that they want sensible solutions to deal with the things that really cause them pain and suffering. And now it's our responsibility to actually do something about it.
Pelosi sent a letter to Mr. Trump on Jan. 16 requesting that he delay the address because of potential security concerns, as the government shutdown has affected the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Secret Service. However, Mr. Trump said in his letter on Wednesday that DHS and the Secret Service had told him there would be absolutely no problem regarding security with respect to the address. Therefore, Mr. Trump said he would fulfill Pelosi's original Jan. 3 invitation for him to speak and appear in the House chamber to deliver the address on Jan. 29.
Extreme winter weather pattern coming up
If you look at it right now, you are seeing outbreaks in the Northern Hemisphere countries, which is not unexpected. You are seeing it in Europe and Iran, which are colder, but you are not yet seeing large numbers in Australia, which is in summer right now, and you are not seeing it in the deep tropics where it's warm all year round. This suggests that maybe this coronavirus has some temperature or humidity sensitivity that limits its circulation when conditions are warmer or more humid.
In the image below the purple line shows the abrupt heating this past week, compared to the much flatter black line which is the average temperature.
Here are some specific results of the study:
Alessandro Soru: Say an average of 10 days a year.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The NIH director, Anthony Fauci, a doctor, said that from what he's seen, if you get infected, you likely won't get reinfected. But there seems to be so much we don't know. If someone has just sort of mild or moderate symptoms, how do they last? How do you know to go and get tested?
Several students at the forum criticized university President John Anderson for his perceived inaction. Others questioned the campus' climate and ongoing problems with discrimination. Anderson promised to change the culture after apologizing to students.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's exhausting, but it's beginning.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I think that there's the potential that it could happen. We've only been governing now for twenty-four hours. There's the potential that we could say, man, there's all this opportunity for consensus, think about draining the swamp, right? Everybody is running on anti-corruption now. But in order for us to do something we have to be bipartisan, which means everyone is going to win. If all we're thinking about is 2020, that's going to be a big, big problem and the American people are going to suffer.
A different type of health threat is posed by climate change and air pollution, which also made the list of biggest concerns.
It should be noted that this trend in bigger snowstorms is likely also due to other factors related to a warmer climate like warmer ocean temperatures, more available moisture and more intense storms due to extra energy in the system.
Tuesday's remarkably candid exchange in Detroit comes just a few hours before Biden is scheduled to meet with the leaders of gun control organizations at a stop in Columbus, Ohio.
Then the Trump administration signs a peace deal with the Taliban to end the war in Afghanistan. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from that signing ceremony with the Taliban, and we will talk to him.
Anderson Cooper: You don't talk about President Trump very much.
The fact that such warm water was just now recorded by our team along a section of Thwaites grounding zone where we have known the glacier is melting suggests that it may be undergoing an unstoppable retreat that has huge implications for global sea-level rise, David Holland, director of New York University's Environmental Fluid Dynamics Laboratory and NYU Abu Dhabi's Center for Global Sea Level Change, which conducted the research, said in the news release.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, putting five thousand or up to five thousand fighters back on the field is, obviously-- would have a significant impact on-- on any of the implementation, one would think. So, are-- are--
Earth has a fever in more ways than one. Some places averaged + 5-7 °C warmer than normal for the ENTIRE YEAR of 2020.

This study is a reminder that the state of our oceans is the best bellwether of our changing climate. And the evidence shows our current climate is changing much faster than at any time in human history.
Biden has repeatedly said the values that uphold American democracy are on the line and he's in the strongest position to restore them.
Sitting there with these powerful Polynesian, Hawaiian surfers on the beach and, you know, they would be out looking across the water and they said, 'You know, we never realized that we were poor until somebody from the mainland came over and told us,' Nicklen said.
The transportation sector was the largest source of carbon emissions last year, with a slight drop in gasoline demand more than offset by increased trucking and air travel. Transport-sector emissions grew 1 percent last year, the same as 2017, according to Rhodium. In this sector, increases in efficiency—doing more with less power—and a move toward electric transport is beginning to make a dent, although a small one.
U.S. District Court Judge Josephine L. Staton wrote a scathing dissent, rebuking the notion that the courts can play no role.
The chair of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security, Hoeven added that energy security is a vitally important part of national security.
But you are never going to accomplish any of these things if you don't take on the systems of power which make all of that impossible, she continued. Which means taking on institutional racism, it's taking on the corruption and greed in Washington, and taking on the special interests that write legislation in the dead of night, and I know that I have the compassion, courage, and fearless determination to get that done.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: It's going to increase. This-- right now, there's probably hundreds or low thousands of cases. Everyone's--
Arctic scientists like to say that what happens in the Arctic doesn't stay in the Arctic, but the interconnectivity between Earth's dynamic atmospheric systems is no laughing matter, Cohen said. The complexity of these systems is reflected in emerging disruptions that are likely the products of climate change, though there is still much to be learned about how climate change could shape weather patterns around the world, the study authors reported.
O'Donnell: I know. The primary stretched through the summer.
Campus officials say the students in the photo could face judicial sanctions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: He is cited as someone open to the deal you described of-- of DACA for wall.
Two feet of sea level rise by the end of the century would have big effects on places like Miami and New Orleans, but I don't still view that as catastrophic because those cities can survive -- at great expense -- that amount of rising seas under normal situations, Nerem said. But when a storm hits like 2012's Superstorm Sandy, sea level rise on top of storm surge can lead to record-setting damages, researchers said.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. Yeah. No question.
The U.S. was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets. The gap is even wider headed into 2019, it said.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: If people want to really blow up one figure here or one word there, I would argue that they're missing the forest for the trees. I think that there's a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.
Art, science and conservation, Nicklen said. It's gotta be beautiful, it's gotta teach you something and it's gotta make you care.
The reduction means the U.S. is now expected to exceed the target set in a 2009 U.N. agreement known as the Copenhagen Accord of cutting emissions 17% below 2005 levels, with 2020 instead hitting 21.5% below 2005 levels.
Sanders: You know, Norah, as you well know, when there are camp-go back to 2008 and look at Obama and Clinton. You think there was criticism between the two? There was bitterness between the two.
THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES' CLOSING IOWA ARGUMENTS
MARGARET BRENNAN: So would all of you--yes or no--vote for something that put an offer on the table for Democrats, like protections for DREAMers or protections for those coming here under extraordinary circumstances like temporary protected status.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --because they think it's going to take down the President.
He was also never able to completely put behind him his mayoral administration's implementation of the controversial policing practice, stop-and-frisk. Questions surrounding past comments he is alleged to have made to women who worked for his company, Bloomberg LP, also surfaced as his campaign built momentum. In February, after pressure from fellow Democratic contender and Elizabeth Warren, Bloomberg released three women from non-disclosure agreements in an effort to promote more transparency at his company.

MARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah. It's not clear if the order has been given to troops to not pull out because they had been ordered to pull out.
Oldenborgh was one of a team of 17 climate scientists from a collaborative group called World Weather Attribution (WWA), which conducted the study. The WWA was founded in 2015 to perform forensic analyses on extreme weather events like heat waves, droughts and floods.
Many of them sell their products, she said. If they're not able to go to the cities, there's a big crisis.
ALEX AZAR: Yes, we are-- we are looking into these allegations. I am personally involved in doing so. First--
My personal opinion, and I know that my district and my community feels this way as well, is that we as a party have compromised too much, and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. And —
Mini Mike Bloomberg just 'quit' the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn't have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost, he wrote on Twitter. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe's campaign, hoping to save face. It won't work!
Norah O'Donnell: So impeachment's now gonna keep you here in Washington for about 10 days and not in Iowa. Does that place you at a distinct disadvantage?
John Dickerson: So how many days a year was it planned that Moses would be used?
MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the rest of you?
ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ (60 MINUTES): Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. It's just about what we choose to compromise. My personal opinion. And I know that my district, my community feels this way as well is that we as a party have compromised too much and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are. And--
When asked how much of the increased extreme rain was due to climate change versus natural pattern changes, Davenport said, While natural climate variability has also had some effect on precipitation over the historical time period, the observed changes in extreme precipitation are very consistent with what we expect to occur as a result of human-caused climate change.
All that, plus, analysis on the week's other news coming up now on FACE THE NATION.
Looking at 2100 UTC obs in Mongolia, Tosontsengel is reporting 1089.5 hPa. This station is the record-holder from 2001 (1084.8 hPa). Further, Tsetsen Uul (labelled w/ H) is reporting 1093.5 hPa (32.29). These, along with other reports, if verified, would break the world record. pic.twitter.com/jXx24W4JP5 — Mike Adcock (@MikeAdcockWx) December 28, 2020
To see the prime minister's green experiment, Whitaker flew to Ragged Island with Whitney Heastie, CEO of government-owned utility Bahamas Power and Light. Engineer Burlington Strachan met them there and took us to what he calls the very first hurricane-proof solar microgrid being installed in the Bahamas.
However, Newsom has been harshly critical of Mr. Trump since taking office this week. He signed two executive orders related to wildfire management, and joined a partnership with the governors of Oregon and Washington asking for double the current federal funding to manage forestlands in their states.
In those purported calls, the partial audio of which was published online by The Sun, Prince Harry allegedly said the mere fact that Donald Trump is pushing the coal industry is so big in America, he has blood on his hands. But Trump will want to meet you to make him look better but he won't want to have a discussion about climate change with you because you will outsmart him.
I think this year, we've been home less than two months, Mittermeier said. But, you know, because we work together, home is wherever we are.
The pivot temperature where a population will turn out 50 percent females and 50 percent males is based on genetics and varies with species and even individual nesting groups, the researchers wrote. Turtles seem to target their breeding periods to times when the sand is slightly warmer than their pivot temperatures, resulting in populations moderately skewed female. But shift the temperature of that period just a few degrees and the resulting baby turtles will be not just a bit female — instead, hardly a male will appear in the whole group.
ANTHONY SALVANTO: Good morning, Margaret. Big keys for him. First of all, overwhelming support from black voters. That was key and they make up most of the electorate in South Carolina. That was really helped by an endorsement from Representative Jim Clyburn, the most influential African-American politician in the state, more saying that was important than not. And then, finally, big support among those looking for electability that somebody they feel can go on to beat Donald Trump in November. The question now, Margaret, is can Joe Biden parlay that argument into Super Tuesday?
The activist has been criticized by Mr. Trump, who took a veiled swipe at her remarks when he spoke at Davos. Mr. Trump said it was time to reject the warnings of prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Oh my goodness—
Sanders: I have, of course. I am sorry for what Secretary Clinton had to say. I know she said that nobody likes me, right? I mean, this is not the kind of rhetoric that we need right now when we are trying to bring the Democratic Party together to defeat the most dangerous president in American history.
MIKE POMPEO: We want-- we want--
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, said she is running for president in an interview slated to air on CNN's The Van Jones Show Saturday evening. A source close to Gabbard confirmed to CBS News that she is running.
The most recent salvo between BlackRock and its environmental critics started in January when co-founder Larry Fink published a letter to CEOs calling climate change a bigger structural, long-term crisis than any he has seen in his 40-year financial career. He said BlackRock would immediately begin pushing sustainability as a core goal at all of the companies it invests in.

She doesn't seem to be viewed as a radical by her constituents in New York 14 – the racially diverse, liberal, and reliably Democratic congressional district that includes parts of Queens and the Bronx. Ocasio-Cortez was born in the Bronx. Her parents had met in Puerto Rico. Her father owned a small architectural business. Her mother cleaned houses to help make ends meet. By the time she was ready for preschool, her parents had made a downpayment on a small house in the Westchester suburbs. It was 30 miles and a world away from her extended family still living in the bronx.
President Trump sent a tweet Wednesday morning announcing that he has ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency not to send funding to California to assist in the aftermath of deadly wildfires.
MARGARET BRENNAN: In Washington State, in places that have declared emergencies, even shutting down schools I mean they are projecting numbers themselves.
The world's vital insect kingdom is undergoing death by a thousand cuts, the world's top bug experts said. Climate change, insecticides, herbicides, light pollution, invasive species and changes in agriculture and land use are causing Earth to lose probably 1% to 2% of its insects each year, said University of Connecticut entomologist David Wagner, lead author in the special package of 12 studies in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences written by 56 scientists from around the globe.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --this would be a spoiler in just--
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: They sent staff. They sent staff people to do the negotiation. The vice president's in the room with a bunch of staffers.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean, that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota and other states around the country.
Pierpaolo Campostrini: It's the fault of my generation. So I don't want to leave to my children this responsibility. My generation should act.
Olson told Kroft that a trove of documents she has collected proves every president since Lyndon B. Johnson has known about the potentially catastrophic effects of fossil fuels.
A new Alaska land-based low pressure record has been set! Shemya, AK dropped to 924.8mb at 2159Z (1259 AKST) today. The previous accepted record was from a ship in Dutch Harbor at 925mb in 1977. Pressure is now slowly rising at Shemya. #akwx #hurricaneforce pic.twitter.com/1yiYOPvsTr — NWS Anchorage (@NWSAnchorage) December 31, 2020
John Dickerson: After all the tests are done, when are you saying that Moses will be ready?
In response, the deputy White House press secretary said, Cong. Ocasio-Cortez's sheer ignorance on the matter can't cover the fact that President Trump supported and passed historic criminal justice reform… and ... has repeatedly condemned racism and bigotry in all forms.
These air-temperature changes close to the surface led to similar changes higher up in the atmosphere. This, in turn, affected the jet stream -- a conveyor belt of wind that carries warm air and moisture around the globe -- by increasing its waviness, making jetstream waves dive farther south and stretch farther to the north. In turn, this extra amplification can alter the movement of cold air masses near the pole, otherwise known as the polar vortex, Cohen explained.
Congress overturned a two century-long ban on hats so that Minnesota's Ilhan Omar could wear her hijab on the House floor. Twenty-five new members are under the age of 40, their youth reflected by the swarm of congressional offspring who filled the chamber.
For Ocasio-Cortez, it was an early lesson in congressional politics. And another one came when she defied Pelosi and voted against the speaker's new House rules, but was not joined by many other progressive Democrats. Ocasio-Cortez told us she's determined to keep fighting for what's being called a Green New Deal — a highly ambitious, some would say unrealistic, proposal that would convert the entire U.S. Economy to renewable sources of energy in just 12 years, while guaranteeing every American a job at a fair wage.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congresswoman, you've also served, as we said in the introduction. What do you think? Do you support not just Afghanistan, a drawdown but a withdrawal in total?
Sanders: Course I will. Do you know exactly what health care costs will be, one minute, in the next 10 years if we do nothing? It will be a lot more expensive than a Medicare-for-all single-payer system.
Amazon Watch singled out Bunge in a recent report on the destruction of the Brazilian rainforest, saying it was among a number of the largest companies responsible for widespread deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and noting the Brazilian fine.
In what may seem paradoxical, as global warming has intensified in recent years, the number of big Northeast snowstorms has increased. In fact, many of the biggest snowstorms in New York City history, like the January blizzard of 2016, have happened in the past two decades. While some of this may be related to natural variability, Cohen feels changes in the Arctic clearly play a role.
For years, BlackRock basically said that, even as the largest owner of stocks in the world — investing the assets of big customers like public pension funds and corporate 401(k) plans that hold the assets of millions of workers — it had little ability to push social issues like climate change or gun regulation. That's because BlackRock offers what are called passive index funds that track everything from the S&P 500 to the companies in fast-growing economies like Brazil and China.

It was significant devastation on this island As you can see, some of the poles snapped right at the very base of the pole, Strachan said. That happened throughout the island.

These views are echoed in a recent Pew Research Center study which found large majorities of Americans favor expanding at least two types of renewable sources to provide energy: solar panel (89%) and wind turbine (85%) facilities.
Bernie Sanders has seen a boost in support in the weeks leading up to the caucuses and sat atop many of the polls that have come out in January. While he has been one of the candidates stuck in Washington, his campaign has flooded the state with high level surrogates like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, filmmaker Michael Moore, and Sanders' wife, Dr. Jane Sanders. The Vermont senator has spent some of his final days in Iowa stressing that his political revolution can begin here.
The viral video the man mentioned appears to be a clip that has been inaccurately characterized by guns-rights groups and on social media in recent days. The clip was taken from a livestream by Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman and presidential candidate who endorsed Biden last week. The video shows Biden in a restaurant with O'Rourke and Amy Sanders O'Rourke, his wife. Biden looks into the camera and praises O'Rourke for his stance on gun control and climate change, and says he will recruit him to work in his administration if elected.

Anderson Cooper: How to pay for it.
I hear generators everywhere, Whitaker said to Brian Malone and Matt Winslow, an American who owns a vacation home on the island. Is this how you guys are getting through?
ELIZABETH WARREN: Hello, Council Bluffs. Whoo.
Colbert asked Gillibrand to name the first thing she would do as president. She mentioned restoring American leadership in the world and addressing climate change, but first trying to reunite the country.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro (Translation): Why don't we do it here? Let's do it here, let's study it here. Let's study the water, let's study the pollution, the rising waters, the temperature. It could be an example of great mobilization at a world level.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?
These CBS News surveys were conducted by YouGov between February 27-29, 2020. A representative sample of 2,200 registered voters in California was selected, including 1,411 self-identified Democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the Democratic primary this year. A representative sample of 1,600 registered voters in Texas was selected, including 635 self-identified Democrats, as well as independents who plan to vote in the Democratic primary this year. Both samples were weighted according to gender, age, race, and education based upon voter registration lists and the U.S. Census Current Population Survey, as well as 2016 presidential vote. Likely voters were determined using a model that takes into account self-reported likelihood of voting, along with other individual- and aggregate-level factors. The margins of error are 4.0 points in California and 6.2 points in Texas.
When making their decision on whom to support, Iowa Democrats cite policy positions as the most important factors, chief among them their health care proposals, followed by economic policy positions and their approach to climate change. Foreign policy ranks lower, as does a candidate's personal qualities.
The need for these calculations is becoming more and more important, because as the climate warms, Diffenbaugh says, the costs of inaction continue to increase.
In the southern U.S., a wind chill advisory was in effect Wednesday from Orlando down to Boca Raton as a bomb cyclone storm was expected to swirl up the East Coast, said CBS News weather producer David Parkinson. He said when a storm system loses 24 millibars of pressure, which is to say it gets that much stronger, in under 24 hours, you have what's called a 'weather bomb,' and so that's where you get the term 'bombogenesis' – that's where we talk about storms 'bombing out.'
So, the researchers developed a new technique: Studying the turtles' hormones.Proving that the increasing temperatures actually changed the turtle population proved challenging, though. Turtles don't wear signs of their sex as obviously as humans; researchers can't tell just by looking between their legs. And the easiest method — cutting them open — isn't really an ethical way to approach an endangered turtle population.
The following is a transcript of an interview with Sen. Bernie Sanders that aired Sunday, March 1, 2020, on Face the Nation.
A few cold days doesn't disprove climate change, Furtado said. That's just silly. Just like a couple down days on the stock market doesn't mean the economy is going into the trash.
A brutal winter storm dumped snow, sleet and freezing rain from normally balmy Florida up the Southeast seaboard Wednesday, delivering a white coating that some cities hadn't seen in decades. Cars spun out of control on icy overpasses from Texas to Georgia. Forecasters warned that conditions could worsen, especially in the Northeast.
In the computer simulations, Otto explained, we can take these greenhouse gases out of the atmosphere of our different climate models, and so we can simulate possible weather in the world that might've been. In a hypothetical example, Otto said, it might be that in the world today it's a 1 in 10 year event but in a world without climate change its a 1 in 100 year event. Then we can attribute this change in likelihood to climate change because that's the only thing that's different in these two worlds we look at.
The idea is to keep carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, Bliss said.
In the Northern Sierra Nevada, the winter so far has been the third-driest on record for the year's wettest three months -- December, January and February -- produced very little rainfall, said John Leahigh of the California Department of Water Resources.
We'll be right back with our reporters' panel.
We cannot afford it, Minnis said. We recognized from day one that we cannot do it alone.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, of course, there was agreement to continue the conversation. But what we've said is open the government and let's have a fulsome debate and deliberation. This gun in our head approach with closing down the government is the thing we most opposed, and-- and we wish incidentally that the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, would step up and be part of this conversation. He's used to-- he's going to stand on the sidelines and wait for instructions from the President. He is part of a branch of government and a leader in the Senate, he should be a participant in this conversation from the start. As of last night, three Republican senators have said they don't like this approach of shutting down the government and they're talking about joining in a bipartisan effort to end it.
We're not going to have ridiculous snow totals that we've never seen before … But what we are gonna have is a lot of wind, a lot of low visibility and what I suspect will be a lot of traffic accidents, Parkinson said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --open the government and then continue talking?
Our analyses show that exceeding the 2 degrees Celsius level of global warming identified in the U.N. Paris Agreement is likely to result in further intensification of extreme precipitation, says Diffenbaugh. So, if the future is anything like the past, we can expect continued increases in flood damages from future changes in precipitation.
Along with the serious intent that drives their work, their photographic expeditions are filled with inspiring encounters.
Paula Vargas, the Brazil program manager at Amazon Watch, an organization focused on protecting the Amazon and advancing the rights of indigenous people, told CBS News that COVID-19 is a huge threat to the over 850,000 indigenous people in Brazil.
Sanders: You don't know. Nobody knows. This is impossible to predict.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Talk about-- or--
What would be lost is a city where so much of the art interprets the natural beauty of light that arrives twice a day, once from the sun and once as it is reflected back off the water, but Venice is no longer just something beautiful to look at. Its fragility is a warning to the rest of the planet that this ancient city is under pressures from forces it cannot control. Venice is not alone. In a world of warming temperatures and sea level rise, no place is an island.
The increase in eco-friendly gadgets at the largest consumer electronics event in the U.S. continues an improbable trend begun during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite a broad economic decline, many green industries — from rooftop solar to bicycling — have thrived. Once the pandemic is curbed, environmentalists say keeping these green habits going will be key if humans are to stave off another existential crisis: climate change.
House Democrats are also planning to vote to fund the parts of the government that have been shut down for two weeks. But the Democratic bill doesn't contain the border wall money the president is looking for, so the president said it's a non-starter. He's invited House and Senate leaders to the White House on Friday to continue negotiations.
The jet stream is a river of fast-flowing air in the upper atmosphere which guides storms from one place to another. Just like waves in the ocean, it undulates up and down, from north to south, as it flows around the Earth. These undulations are known as atmospheric waves. And while most of the energy flows around the globe horizontally, some of the wave energy can move vertically, transferring energy upward or downward, especially when those waves are amplified.
The core tenets of our system of government have been challenged, Schumer said. 'Violence descended on Capitol Hill, the sacred temple of our Democracy. A once-in-a-century pandemic continues to devastate our nation. The work of the 117th Congress will begin in the wake of a devastating attack, on the heels of a devastating year. 
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL (D-New Jersey/@RepSherrill): Well, I don't think it's a waste of time. We voted on the most bipartisan bill we could vote on, the one that was passed recently by the Senate, within the last month. And so I think what we're asking Congress to do is its job, and pass a bill that's going to re-open the government.
With Super Tuesday only two days away, Bernie Sanders leads in both California and Texas, the two states that will award the most delegates when 14 states go to the polls on Tuesday. In California, Sanders holds a 12-point lead over his closest rival, Joe Biden. Polling in these two states concluded before Biden's victory Saturday night in South Carolina, though few voters said those results would impact their decision.
Everything costs more in the islands. The bill to install one new solar microgrid on Ragged Island is $3 million. Heastie insists it's money well spent.
Super cold air is normally locked up in the Arctic in the polar vortex, which is a gigantic circular weather pattern around the North Pole. A strong polar vortex keeps that cold air hemmed in.
Absolutely. After which, we can expand it. We can expand it, Minnis said.
In his new work, Costello is aiming to advance a plan by former GOP Secretaries of State James Baker and George Shultz, fine-tuning the details of a bill which would put a fee on carbon dioxide emissions and return the proceeds to individuals and families on a quarterly basis.
Last year, two companies in the S&P 500, fast food giant Yum Brands and snack maker Mondelez International, faced shareholder resolutions specifically on deforestation. BlackRock voted against both.
Now, I have to caution that although seasonal flu peaks during the winter and it peters out in spring, when we have a pandemic influenza outbreak such as what happened in 2009, it can penetrate farther into the summer. The reason for this is there is heightened susceptibility in the human population that allows for transmission even as humidity conditions rise. The pandemic flu doesn't disappear until June, and then resurges again in late August and September as humidity starts to drop. So, if this novel emergent coronavirus were to follow this pattern, then it would probably continue circulating until May or June, then we'd get a break, and then we might get a second wave of it in September. If it doesn't have this characteristic then none of this will happen. Also, this novel coronavirus appears to be more transmissible than influenza, which might preclude any disappearance during summer.
I loved the whole thing about making new memories, says Lovato. And I'm playing songs off my new album, Tell Me You Love Me, and a lot of those are more mature. So, they do well in really intimate settings.
The president continued his trend of attacking Bloomberg after he announced his decision to leave the presidential race and rejected the notion that Biden will ensure he is a one-term president.
MIKE POMPEO: We want women to be involved. They-- there will be lots of people say things. There will be lots of noise. Everyone is competing for attention and time in the media. What matters is the actions that we take, the discussions that we had. We have come a long ways and we have worked not only yesterday. While I was in Doha, Secretary of Defense was in Kabul, along with NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg. They made a declaration. There was a commitment from the Afghan government, too. We've made a lot of progress. No one is under any illusion that this will be straightforward. We've built an important base where we can begin to bring American soldiers home, reduce the risk of the loss of life of any American in Afghanistan, and, hopefully, set the conditions so the Afghan people can build out a peaceful resolution to their, now what for them is a forty-year struggle.
They have the strongest leader in Xi Jinping they've had at least since Mao [Zedong], Eurasia Group president and CBS Contributor Ian Bremmer said in an interview with CBS This Morning last week. And because the United States is America first, it's transactional. It's unilateral. It's undermining a lot of alliances. You put those things together, and suddenly you actually have a China that is willing to engage in what is increasingly a geopolitical vacuum.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --on Friday with the President.
Colbert also gave her joking campaign gifts, like a plane ticket to Michigan and granite from New Hampshire. He also gave her a pin saying, I announced on the 'Late Show with Stephen Colbert.'
In a tunnel 60 feet below sea level, we met Alessandro Soru, the project's lead engineer.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You served in the Trump administration. What do you think the administration is doing now that is right, wrong in its handling of the virus?
MARGARET BRENNAN: New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has made a name for herself taking on Republicans in her own party. Tonight, she sits down with 60 MINUTES. Here's part of her interview.
A royal source said Buckingham Palace would not comment on the pranksters' call, and CBS News could not independently verify the audio or The Sun's reporting.
MARK LANDLER: So did Obama. And so do-- as you say many Democrats. What I don't think has been tested maybe at least I'd love to see it--
Plus, as the coronavirus crisis prompts questions of whether or not the U.S. is ready to handle a pandemic, the politics of preparedness becomes a big issue.
This is not OK, alright? the man said, to which Biden replied, Don't tell me that, pal, or I'm going to go outside with you, man.
But Bloomberg said Wednesday that it had become evident Biden is the candidate to unite behind with the best chance at defeating Mr. Trump in November.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back with our panel. We brought in two of the big guns from the New York Times today. Edward Wong is a diplomatic correspondent, and Michael Crowley is a White House correspondent covering foreign policy. Good to have you both here.
The shift to work-from-home could have long-term environmental benefits — the equivalent of taking 14 million cars off U.S. roads every year, according to one estimate. But there's also a downside for those white-collar workers, mainly in the form of their work-from-home power bill.
As has been the case in other contests, Sanders is boosted by solid support from younger voters. Nearly half of voters under 45 in California — and more than half in Texas — pick Sanders as their first choice. In California, Sanders is the first choice among white and Hispanic voters, while he trails Biden among black voters. In Texas, he polls about evenly among white voters with Biden and Warren, but leads among Hispanic voters.
Colbert also asked more joking questions, asking her what swear word she would miss the most if she tried not to swear on the campaign trail.
Billions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen, Mr. Trump wrote. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!
SHANNON PETTYPIECE: Well, yeah. Well, I mean, and-- we can talk about this. Meanwhile, at the White House, they are very clearly in 2020 mode. I mean, we could say they were in 2020 mode, you know, two years ago today, but the White House is transitioning into 2020 mode. And while you have these Democrats who are exploring, and making their first trip to Iowa, now you have a President Trump who has a real campaign infrastructure behind him. It's not the Trump Tower, you know, papers flying all over the place, no one know who's in charge, they have an actual campaign. They have raised millions and millions of dollars. They have a big data operation. They are out of the gate and running and the Democrats are still kind of trying to find where the starting line is or decided if they're going to show up at the race. So, I mean, that's what they're going to be up against. And they also feel like despite how much criticism and how unpopular the President might be, they also feel like they have something really to run on, the whole slogan for 2020 is this, promises made, promises kept. You might not like the promises that he kept but they are going to say that he did what he said he was going to do. He was not one of those politicians who came to Washington and-- and-- and, you know, did a flip flop.
MIKE POMPEO: Oh, I remember it well, yes.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the-- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, Margaret, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I-- I speak of somebody help lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care--
180 mph winds are an even harder punch than when Irma landed back in 2017.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room.
For people, corporations, and governments to take action they're going to have to have incentives, William Nordhaus, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics for his work on putting a price on carbon, wrote in a recent Yale Alumni Magazine article.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: You know, it— you look at our tax rates back in the '60s and when you have a progressive tax rate system. Your tax rate, you know, let's say, from zero to $75,000 may be ten percent or 15 percent, et cetera. But once you get to, like, the tippy tops— on your 10 millionth dollar— sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate, but it means that as you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Graham, thank you for joining us.
MIKE POMPEO: Thank you very much, Margaret.
From the mundane to the fanciful, these CES technologies could help humans leave a lighter footprint.
Sanders: I think it's unusual for a senator, especially somebody who's running for president (I think we have four or five of those on the floor right now) to be seated for nine hours. It's just not the way the Senate usually works. So I think what people are trying to do is to listen as intently as they can.
Electric vehicles are getting plenty of play at CES, with exhibitors including Lightyear One, an electric car covered with solar panels that is being developed in the Netherlands; and Geotab Energy, a fleet-management system that promises to manage charging for large numbers of electric vehicles.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the Coast Guard? Who are not going to get paid.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I-- I think so. I'm a former federal prosecutor and we certainly never made charging decisions before the FBI finished their investigation. I think we've got to let Mueller finish his investigation, see what evidence he finds, and then we can make some decisions.
In his own video, Mr. Obama championed initiatives that have helped prop up another industry tied heavily to U.S. oil production: America's auto manufacturers.
On the campaign trail, he spent little time in the photo line taking pictures with voters, and declined to take questions, something most of his competitors did. Instead, Bloomberg held comparatively short events that had the production value of a general election rally. Bloomberg focused heavily on Super Tuesday and battleground states. During an election night event in West Palm Beach, Bloomberg showed no signs he planned to drop out.
The result isn't surprising if you know a bit about turtle biology, but it is alarming. Sea turtles, like these green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas), don't have genetically determined sexes, the way mammals do. Instead, the researchers wrote, In sea turtles, cooler temperatures produce more male hatchlings while warmer temperatures produce more females.
The speed of climate change is accelerating says Dr. Peter Gleick, a climate scientist and founder of the Pacific Institute, a sustainability nonprofit in Oakland, California.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. But what he's not open to is a lecture by the Speaker of the House. I'll give you a dollar. He's not open to the people on the left accusing his border patrol agents of being Gestapo agents gassing children. He's not open to the idea that the wall is immoral. So if you bring Dick Durbin's to the table, we'll fix this.
The warmth caused difficulties for reindeer herding in northern Sweden, the failure of the ice-wine harvest in Germany, and forced organizers to import snow for sporting events in Sweden and Russia. Parts of Russia near Moscow experienced a winter of 10 degrees Fahrenheit above normal.
In the span of a week, from late December to early January, temperatures high in the atmosphere above the Arctic jumped by 100 degrees Fahrenheit. While this may sound alarming, it's a natural phenomenon that happens every couple of years, but experts say human-caused climate change may be making these events more likely.

The candidates were particularly focused on engaging young voters and they did it through music, through K-pop and popular media. It worked.
Officials from several irrigation and water agencies said the restrictions are reasonable, but not the plan to impose them under the state Constitution's prohibition on the waste or unreasonable use of water. That would create a slippery slope of allowing the board to repeatedly chip away at California's historic protection of water rights for landowners, they said.
Larry Fink's letter was a sea change, said Moira Birss, a director at environmental group Amazon Watch. The follow-through remains to be seen.
Cohen explains that any given time the wave pattern is naturally elongated over Eurasia as compared to the rest of the globe. In a typical pattern this would have no impact on the stratosphere. But when this already large wave becomes even more enhanced by Arctic amplification, the energy in the wave can propagate upward into the stratosphere and cause chaos.
MARGARET BRENNAN: For a closer look at how prepared we are for the coronavirus here in the U.S., we turn to former FDA commissioner and physician Doctor Scott Got-- Gottlieb. Good to have you here.
Under California law, utilities must pay for wildfire damage if their equipment caused the fire, even if negligence wasn't involved. In most other states -- and for other types of natural disasters -- liability requires evidence that the utility was negligent. That system no longer works in a world where wildfires are more frequent and more destructive, said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the climate and clean energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
Sanders: Here? Well, of course, it is. And I am accepting my constitutional responsibility. But what I'm saying, obviously, it's at a disadvantage.
I've had countless delays on our projects when we're trying to get infrastructure built or work, and we have a call from PG&E that they have to postpone that work because of a mudslide, or downed power lines, said Brian Curtis, CEO of Concentric Power. When you're doing that all the time, it's hard to keep up with preventative maintenance.
MIKE POMPEO (Secretary of State/@SecPompeo): Thank you.
The water content of the Sierra snowpack, which feeds water supplies, is about 20 percent of normal for this time of year, he said.
The improvement in the four new datasets examined in this study is due partially to new analysis methods and partly due to the development of a vast network of ocean sensors called Argo. It's a global array of nearly 4,000 temperature and salinity profiling floats measuring temperatures as deep as 2,000 meters down.
The physics are also clear in this test of a 2x4 piece of lumber being shot out of a cannon, aimed at a half-inch sheet of plywood.
Besides work on the bill, Costello plans to spend his time on education, advocacy and building grassroots coalitions that allow people to kick the tires on climate policy.
ALEX AZAR: --the state and local government will take measures appropriate to contain the spread of the disease.
We did a study last year with some worldwide experts and showed that in the U.S., the precipitation patterns are such that extreme precipitation -- in other words, when it rains, it's going to rain heavier -- is on the rise, Gritzo said. And there's good sound physics and good sound data behind that.
Australia is burning. An area about as large as West Virginia has been blackened by the fires and according to a University of Sydney scientist it's estimated a billion animals have died. The blazes are bigger than the ones that torched California and the Amazon, events that took place on different continents, but are part of the same story: global climate change. It's a story not just of fire but water. Before climate scientists worried about Australia burning, they warned that Venice, Italy, is drowning. Man's most beautiful artifact, built on millions of pylons in the middle of a lagoon, may be vanishing before our eyes. The periodic floods of Venice have become more threatening and more frequent. This past November, a sudden storm surge overwhelmed nearly 90% of the city. Climate scientists say what happened that night exactly two months ago in Venice is a warning to the world of what's to come – and not just in Venice.
NOAA said the 16 billion-dollar disasters included eight severe storms, three tropical cyclones, two flooding events, one wildfire event, one drought and one freeze event. These events resulted in the deaths of 362 people and had significant economic effects on the areas they affected, the NOAA said.
Some water users also said permanent mandates would be too rigid in a sprawling state with needs that vary by region.
We'll be back in a moment with a look at Super Tuesday and more.
Wednesday marks the 33rd day of the partial government shutdown, the longest in American history. Mr. Trump offered a deal to Democrats over the weekend extending temporary protections for the Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program and the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. While the Senate will vote on the deal this week, Democrats have already expressed opposition due to the temporary nature of the extended protections, and the $5.7 billion border wall funding request.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: This is a national disgrace.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that is not a small ask either to get diplomatic talks with the-- with the Taliban underway, and the administration is trying to do that--
On the firm's voting record, the BlackRock spokesperson said shareholder votes do not fully reflect how it engages with companies. The spokesperson said BlackRock has been successfully pushing for changes on sustainability issues for several years, but the firm expects to be more proactive when it comes to shareholder votes in the future.
Shaul Bassi: It really was the major historic turning point in the recent history of the city. And we thought that something like that would not happen again.
While it's essential for television news outlets to have clear, concise and accurate graphics on election nights, vote-counting has also been a time to try out new ways to present information to viewers.
If Buttigieg prevails on Monday, it will show there's a desire among some voters for a more moderate message carried by a new voice. The campaign's focus on rural areas and swing counties, combined with aggressive campaign schedule in the final few days, will give many Iowans one more chance to hear from him before making up their minds. He also built an extensive field operation, with 34 offices placed around the state.
And by the way, this guy can change the face of what we're dealing with, with regard to guns, assault weapons, with regard to dealing with climate change, and I just want — I'm warning Amy, if I win, I'm coming for him, Biden says in the video. The quote has been widely misconstrued to claim Biden said, I'm coming for them.
$100 million: Jeff Bezos gift to Feeding America COVID-19 Response Fund
As Gritzo demonstrated, You can see that this projectile, which is moving according to a storm that has about 100 mph wind speed -- went right through that half-inch piece of plywood.
Working with President-elect Biden and our House Democratic colleagues, the U.S. Senate will finally address the major challenges facing our country that have too long been ignored, Schumer said.
New York — After spending more than half a billion dollars and winning an estimated 31 delegates on Super Tuesday, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg ended his presidential run in the face of a stinging rejection by Democratic primary voters, saying he no longer has a path to the nomination.
MARGARET BRENNAN: According to the White House, so, you know, this centers on what they see as some hypocrisy among Democrats, right? They point to in 2006, there were about, you know, ninety Democrats who did sign on to a secure fencing act that talked about barriers and reinforced fencing at borders. Their argument is if you agree to it, then why can't you agree to something similar now? What-- what is your response to that?
SEN. SANDERS: We're beating them in battleground states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. We can beat Trump.
On his role in the impeachment trial
Most Iowa Democrats do not think candidates who have to be in Washington for the Senate impeachment trial will suffer much of an impact on their fortunes in Iowa.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Who do you think, as people who just ran competitive and successful races, how do you win as a Democrat in 2020 in a presidential race?
ALEX AZAR: --I'm not able to because it's commercially confidential information that's submitted voluntarily to us, I'm not able to discuss that. But this is a drug in a class where there are many, many, many alternatives available. It's a generic drug. Very available.
Emissions also shrunk globally during 2020, with the world expected to see the largest yearly global decline ever — as much as 17%, according to an estimate by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President says he could bypass Congress by declaring this national emergency. So what would you do if he-- he went that route?
O'Donnell: On Saturday, the president's legal team will make their presentation. Is there anything they could say that would change your mind?
Repeal transgender military ban enacted by President Trump; Mr. Biden would also restore Obama-era guidance for transgender students in schools, to protect students' access to sports, bathrooms, and locker rooms in accordance with their gender identity; and Environment: Enact an executive order to conserve 30% of America's lands and waters by 2030.
We will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from – and in that spirit, Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today – to meet the needs of the American people, and to protect our borders, Pelosi will say about the Democrats' immediate agenda.
While the United States has been in the deep freeze, the rest of the globe has been toastier than normal. The globe as a whole was 0.9 degrees warmer than normal Tuesday and the Arctic was more than 6 degrees warmer than normal, according to the University of Maine Climate Change Institute's analysis.
WASHINGTON -- Melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica are speeding up the already fast pace of sea level rise, new satellite research shows. At the current rate, the world's oceans on average will be at least 2 feet -- 61 centimeters -- higher by the end of the century compared to today, according to researchers who published in Monday's Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences.
They also used the model for a counterfactual analysis in which they calculated what the damages would be if there were no changes in extreme precipitation.
O'Donnell: Thank you. Your agenda has promised free health care for everybody, free college tuition, and to pay off people's college loans. The price tag for that is estimated to be $60 trillion over ten years, correct?
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Bring some rowboats to the Navy? We can put Trump's name on it. This is far more serious than just political brinkmanship, okay? Let's get back to work. It's why we all ran and I know it's what the Republicans are interested in doing it-- doing as well. And I promise you, if they did that their voters will reward them, okay. This is not political suicide.
On this Face the Nation broadcast moderated by Margaret Brennan:
To make the debate stage in Las Vegas on February 19, CBS News Political Unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says candidates need to meet either a new polling threshold or received pledged delegates. Presidential hopefuls must receive either 10% in four state or national polls or 12% in two state polls out of either Nevada or South Carolina from a list released by the DNC. Those polls must be released between February 15 and 11:59 p.m. ET on February 18.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, I'm from Staten Island. I have no problem with profanity, okay? Well what-- what I have a problem with though is the fact that she is talking about this issue and urging action on this issue before the investigation has been completed, that will just continue this era of hyper-partisanship that we have to move away from. I-- I-- I certainly object to it.
Michael Oppenheimer: Those are the stakes.
ED O'KEEFE: So there is, essentially, two numbers to look at on Tuesday night. There's the perception number, who wins the state? Who can say that they walked away winning the most states? But the more important number, ultimately, is the nomination number. Who gets closest to getting the one thousand nine hundred ninety or ninety-one delegates you need to get over the threshold and-- and win that nomination.
Curtis, whose company builds microgrids, advocated for letting private customers build out parts of the grid, which they would then be responsible for maintaining. If you're an industrial consumer and you want to build your own generation or even just connect to the grid, the utility ends up building the infrastructure, but you're the one who ends up paying for it, he said.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: You know, I-- I think that 2020 is going to be about 2020, and it's not going to be about 2018. And there are certainly lessons you can learn, I think, from some of our races. I think there--
To understand what might be driving these unusual episodes, Cohen and his colleagues looked at pulses of warmth in the Arctic during winter months, to see how they lined up against weather anomalies elsewhere in the globe.
So long as the economy is growing, that dynamic isn't going to change without a lot of breakthrough technology innovations or federal policy actions, John Larsen, one of the report's authors, told Greentech Media.
Cory Booker's former supporters are picking new favorites in Nevada this week, among the new endorsements rolled out Friday by the Elizabeth Warren and Joe Biden campaigns. Included are two women of color in the state: state Assemblywoman Selena Torres, now backing Biden, and Reno-Sparks NAACP President Patricia Gallimore, now behind Warren. CBS News Campaign Reporter Alex Tin says a quarter of the Nevada's Democratic electorate is estimated to be women of color, with 22% of likely caucus-goers in the demographic still undecided in a recent poll by advocacy group She the People in the state. Biden and Bernie Sanders virtually tied for the lead in the survey, with only Warren (10%) and Tom Steyer (14%) also clearing double digits.
University of Delaware entomologist Doug Tallamy, who wasn't part of the studies, said they highlight how the world has spent the last 30 years spending billions of dollars finding new ways to kill insects and mere pennies working to preserve them.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: --particularly Doctor Fauci. There were questions about whether he was being muzzled. He said he was not, one of the nation's foremost authorities on these things. And I think President Trump understands he doesn't-- he wants the markets to bounce back. The markets want to see that kind of expertise in Trump-- expertise and-- and-- and credibility. And at least yesterday, there was a step in that direction.

O'Donnell: I want to turn to your feud with Senator Warren. Did you and Senator Warren ever discuss her allegation that you said a woman couldn't win the presidency?
The key game changer has been battery storage, Locke said. Battery storage has decreased in cost over 60% over the last five years. And what battery storage does is it enables the sun to shine when the sun is not shining. Renewables make more sense here than anywhere else in the world.
He says the beginnings of the sudden warming in the stratosphere starts much closer to the ground, in a layer of the atmosphere called the troposphere. But in order for this abrupt disruption to reach upward from the troposphere into the stratosphere, you need the excess energy of an extreme weather pattern — something that has been in no short supply lately in the Arctic.
MARK LANDLER: --apparatus kind of grinds on, the timetable suddenly slow down, it's a lot more complicated. His words meet reality on the ground and I think that's the moment we're at but it must be a very confusing one for our allies and for our adversaries.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the President really seemed to shoot that down in the Rose Garden the other day.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is the President open to--
Bloomberg comes in fourth in this poll, behind Warren in both California and Texas. More than four in 10 voters in these states see Bloomberg's campaign spending as a sign that rich people have too much influence in politics, more than those who think it either shows his dedication to the effort, or that he is independent from big donors. In CBS News polling after the debate last Tuesday, Bloomberg did not impress as many voters as other top candidates did.
But that doesn't mean that humans aren't affected by birds. Franzen remembers one experience in east India when he was approached by two great hornbills.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Dick Durbin is a good guy. He's a reasonable guy. But Nancy Pelosi has made progress. She's gone from not a penny to a dollar. Nancy Pelosi sees the border crisis as manufactured. President Trump sees it as real. Until we see the same movie you're never going to reach a conclusion. The President is right to dig in to get money for a wall as part of border security. It will not be a concrete wall it will be steel barriers. And every plan I've supported in the past with Dick Durbin has had money for physical barriers--
CBS News: Is it possible that people being in more confined spaces and packed closer together in winter is more of a factor in the spread of the virus than the actual effect of climate?
In his 562-day presidential campaign, Mr. Biden made other day-one promises, too — here's the list:
MARGARET BRENNAN: Secretary Pompeo is here for more on ending America's longest war, and then a look at politics and Super Tuesday.
Venice has survived before. Every November, Venetians flock to the Santa Maria della Salute church, which was built to commemorate the end of the 17th century plague that killed 50,000 citizens. This year's ceremony, in the wake of the flood, had a special resonance.
Climate scientists meeting in New Zealand have floated the idea, The Guardian reports.
ED O'KEEFE: --where they are still defining how 5.6, 5.7 billion dollars would be spent. We got a ways to go. Congress doesn't get back till Tuesday night, Wednesday morning that would suggest that you're going to have meetings and maybe some initial votes. I am thinking a week from today government's probably still shuttered unless something urgent suddenly arises that forces them to move faster.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And we don't know who the secretary of defense will be, either.
John Dickerson: Explain how it was different this time from previous acqua altas…
According to Nicklen, a seal tried to feed him during their expedition.
And despite a state of constant crisis for infrastructure, other spending priorities -- often for more immediate needs -- mean it's almost inevitable that maintenance and investment get shifted to the back burner.
In 1952, CBS used one of the earliest computers to accurately predict Dwight Eisenhower's election victory over Adlai Stevenson.
The persistent warmth over Siberia was one of the most remarkable weather/climate events of 2020. It's no surprise that sea ice averaged the lowest on record along its coast. Plenty more graphics in the coming weeks to summarize this event... pic.twitter.com/NwNHQqT6Fr — Zack Labe (@ZLabe) December 29, 2020
John Dickerson: Is the message to the rest of the world, if you don't save Venice, it will happen to you next?
MARGARET BRENNAN: That was businessman Tom Steyer doing a little pre-primary dance in South Carolina. He did come in third, but he had hoped to do better and he dropped out of the race last night but rest of the candidates have moved on to Super Tuesday, and that's this Tuesday, when fourteen states will hold contests. Among them California and Texas. We have some new CBS News Battleground Tracker numbers for both of them. Out in California Senator Bernie Sanders is up with thirty-one percent support. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren come in behind Sanders with nineteen and eighteen percent, respectively. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg has twelve percent, and the rest of the field comes in at under ten percent. Looking to Texas, the race is tighter. Bernie Sanders is in the lead here with thirty percent, but Joe Biden close behind him with twenty-six percent and Elizabeth Warren comes in at seventeen-percent support. Michael Bloomberg is at thirteen percent, and the rest of the field comes in at six percent or less. Joining us once again is CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto. We want to bring in CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe. Ed, this was a big and much-needed win for Joe Biden in South Carolina. What does this mean for him going into Tuesday?
Sanders: Well, look. We have political opponents.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, I don't have enough details and the- and that peace agreement, needless to say, is going to have to go through the Afghan government. We don't know what's going to happen. One of the difficulties, to be very honest, MARGARET, in dealing with Trump, it is very hard to believe anything that he says, whether it's the coronavirus, whether what's going on in Afghanistan. But it is my view that the United States and I- I speak as somebody who helped lead the opposition to getting us into the war in Iraq. It is my view that we've got to end endless wars, that when we have five hundred thousand people in America sleeping out on the street and people can't afford health care, we got to invest in this country, not in endless wars.
I started watching and listening to the candidates, he said on 60 Minutes on Sunday. And they had ideas that made no sense to me whatsoever. Donald Trump is going to eat them for lunch.
Sanders outpaces the field on being seen as someone who fights for people like you — and Warren and Buttigieg both do better than Biden on this metric.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Good question. We'll be right back.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: They did not cross the border. The solution to that is not a concrete wall it's a computer program that needs to track these people who have received the visas. And this wall, incidentally, when you have people coming to the border looking for a border official to present themselves and they make their claim for asylum or refugee status, this wall is no deterrent.
More recently, as the firm's profile has grown along with scrutiny of its influence, BlackRock has pledged to do more to improve corporate behavior, though there hasn't been a lot of measurable follow through. Two years ago, Fink said executives need to put social purpose on par with profits. This year his call to action was climate change.
Other campaigns including Sanders' and Steyers' have slammed the decision to remove a donor qualification, calling it wrong.
So far, two other indigenous people — an 87-year-old woman from Para and a man from Manaus — have died from coronavirus. Brazil has had more than 19,600 confirmed cases and over 1,000 deaths from COVID-19.
In the bar graph below, the Northeast Impact Snowfall Scale (NESIS) is plotted for each decade from 1958 through 2018. You can clearly see the spike in activity in the last decade shown, 2008 to 2018.
ANDERSON COOPER: You're willing to compromise?
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: I think we need to look at the companies that-- that can develop antibody-based prophylaxis as well. We did that against Ebola. That is actually what we could potentially have for the fall-- fall or a small molecule drug that's currently on the shelf, trying to repurpose it for this.
A group of Bernie Sanders supporters who now call themselves Justice Democrats encouraged Ocasio-Cortez to run for office and gave her training and support. She built a grass-roots coalition that took on the Democratic machine by going door to door arguing that she could represent the district better than a ten-term incumbent who spent most of his time in Washington.
A well-cited study by highly respected NOAA climate modeler Tom Knutson shows that by late this century the number of Category 4 and Category 5 hurricanes may increase by 42 percent in the Atlantic Basin and over 300 percent in the Eastern Pacific. This is due to warmer water which acts as high-octane fuel to power storms. Stronger storms mean exponentially more damage.
Locust swarms have taken over parts of eastern Africa. The insects are rapidly eating the only source of food for many people in a region that is already food insecure.
ANDERSON COOPER: The Democratic Party has lost too much —
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when he brings those--
Researchers have already observed climate-change-induced permafrost thawing, and there is likely more on the way: According to a 2013 study, the Northern Hemisphere will lose anywhere from 30 to 99 percent of its permafrost by 2100, assuming current human greenhouse-gas emissions continue unabated.
And you have to love the adventure of it, Mittermeier added.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's a first step.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Why would you negotiate with somebody who calls you a racist if you want a wall? Who gives you a dollar for a wall when the Democratic Party supported twenty-five billion dollars in the past? We're not going to negotiate with people who see the world this way. We'll negotiate with Dick Durbin but I'm not going to negotiate with somebody who calls the Border Patrol agents a bunch of Nazis when they're trying to defend the border against a mob. These caravans have changed everything. The reason you need five billion dollars now and not 1.6 is the border is deteriorating in terms of security. We've got eleven thousand unaccompanied minors coming from Central America.
She said that while Democrats support border security, they will not support building a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico -- which she called a campaign applause line. Mr. Trump is refusing to sign any government funding bill which does not include money for a wall.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What drug is that?
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: It's going to require a lot of rapid change that we don't even conceive as possible right now. What is the problem with trying to push our technological capacities to the furthest extent possible?
ALEX AZAR: We have no evidence so far that establishes a connection to somebody who traveled to an impacted area. And so we do not know how he contracted the virus. That's really what we do. That's the basic blocking and tackling right now of public health is we're going to trace the people that he had contact with. We're going to trace the other cases. There is a nursing home that sends patients to this hospital. And there are cases in that nursing home. But who spread to whom? We do not know yet.
I've known Joe for a very long time. I know his decency, his honesty, and his commitment to the issues that are so important to our country — including gun safety, health care, climate change, and good jobs, he said in his statement. I've had the chance to work with Joe on those issues over the years, and Joe has fought for working people his whole life. Today I am glad to endorse him — and I will work to make him the next President of the United States.
But the fear is if the Adriatic continues to rise past projections, the Moses gates may have to be raised nearly every day by the middle of this century. It was not designed for that kind of wear and tear.
Biden and Sanders have improved on their perceived electability among Iowa Democrats in recent weeks. More now think each would probably win against President Trump than said so earlier this month, particularly of Biden. Democrats are more confident (71%) now than they were in November (62%) that the party will nominate someone who can defeat the president.
But in this new analysis, the authors of the study say, Although climate model results have been criticized during debates about a 'hiatus' or 'slowdown' of global mean surface temperature, it is increasingly clear that the pause in surface warming was at least in part due to the redistribution of heat within the climate system.
Now, the mounting intensity and lifespan of tropical cyclones has sparked the question among climate scientists: is a new classification needed? Should there actually be a Category 6 storm?
Industry, too, is looking to cut its power use. Home and kitchen appliance maker Bosch on Monday unveiled an energy-management platform for factories that use artificial intelligence to cut factory emissions. The system is in use in Hamburg, Germany, and Charleston, South Carolina, said the company's chief technology officer, Michael Bolle. At the same event, Bosch pledged to reduce emissions along its supply chain by 15% within the decade.
Donors have broadened their philanthropic scope beyond the universities, medical centers and other organizations that typically comprise the year's list of top beneficiaries, according to the Chronicle. Joining the list of top beneficiaries of 2020, were a new environmental grant maker, a nonprofit dedicated to modernizing elections, a network of food banks, and a charity that builds housing for people experiencing homelessness.
Unlike other solar designs, it's very low to the ground, Strachan said. So this installation is rated to withstand 180 mile an hour winds.
O'Donnell: Do you think it places Biden at an advantage over you?
Scott, whose wealth is valued at $57 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, said in a blog post in December that she had increased her charitable donations for the year to $4.2 billion, in response to the wrecking ball effect of the coronavirus, which she also acknowledged substantially increased the wealth of billionaires.
He said he's lost count of how many times he's retired over the years.
Toto Bergamo Rossi: Intensive care (laughs) exactly. Now we are in intensive care. Completely.
$99.6 million: George and Renee Karfunkel, real-estate investors Congregation Chemdas Yisroel, gift to an Orthodox Jewish Synagogue
Sanders: Sure, it might be a hard sell. The American people want a health care system that works for them, not for huge profits for the drug companies who are ripping us off every day and the insurance companies. At the end of the day, we will create more jobs. Will there be some job loss? Yes, there will. We're gonna create more jobs. We need more doctors. We need more nurses. We need more psychologists and psychiatrists to help us deal with the opioid epidemic. There'll be a net plus of jobs.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, what I just saw was a announcement about a withdrawal like that, which took everyone by surprise. I believe that that's playing politics and that's a shame. I don't want to see Americans put at risk. I've watched loved ones get hurt. I don't want to see that if it's unnecessary. But I just want us to have a long-term strategy--
The perfect setting for them to tell her they love her.
In response to the results of the study, he told CBS News he agrees that the models are underestimating the trends. Current-generation climate models are simply not up to the task of extreme event attribution. They are not capturing key atmospheric mechanisms behind these extremes that are almost certainly being influenced by climate change.
Do you ever have clients that just don't believe it until you show it to them?
NOAA announced its figures at the society's annual conference in Austin, Texas.
Climate experts have warned that unpredictable weather will continue in the Horn of Africa, making it very difficult to predict when the locusts will breed again in such quantities.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: The room for compromise is talking about how we can deal with the crises that we are currently facing. Right now at our ports of entry fentanyl and other very serious drugs is just streaming right in. We don't--
MARGARET BRENNAN: So lots of exploring without declaring, Ed?
One of the first things that I think everyone can agree on is everything has to go underground, Matt Winslow said.

More than 1,600 daily records for cold were tied or broken in the last week of December, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). For Greg Carbin of the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center, the most meaningful statistics are how last week's average temperature was the second coldest in more than a century of record-keeping for Minneapolis, Chicago, Detroit and Kansas City, third coldest in Pittsburgh and fifth coldest in New York City.
Rep. Nancy Pelosi is expected to be elected Thursday as speaker of the House of Representatives for the second time, cementing her legacy as one of the most effective female legislators in American history. In her prepared floor speech upon accepting the speaker's gavel Thursday, Pelosi will outline Democratic policy priorities, including addressing income inequality and climate change. She's also anticipating a new dawn in the House after her party's net 40-seat gain.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean, I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we've got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, MARGARET, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think we'll have offers on the table when we find somebody that's not crazy to deal with. We're not going to put any offers on the table as long as people in charge of these negotiations accuse all of us who want a wall of being a racist and see our border patrol agents as gassing children. Until you get that crowd put to the sidelines, I don't see anything happening.
The change could limit not only future public health protections, but force the agency to revoke decades of clean air protections, Chris Zarba, former head of the EPA's Science Advisory Board, said in a statement.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --that we don't need a wall.
O'Donnell: But you've been confronted by voters on the campaign trail and acknowledge that there will be job losses as a result of such a plan. Is that a hard sell, that your plan?
Sherwin even nodded to disaster preparedness becoming more accepted in the U.S.
After years of studying these phenomena, Cohen says a clear pattern has emerged. Warm Arctic conditions and a weaker stratospheric polar vortex, is linked to more cold extreme episodes in some parts of the mid-latitudes.
O'Donnell: You're gonna propose a plan to the American people, and you're not gonna tell 'em how much it costs?
There is a blizzard concern along the coast – in Cape Ann, Mass., and along the state's southern coast. Winds are expected to be 40-70 mph.
Beyond the impact from flood events, Diffenbaugh says the study goes further by establishing a methodology for economists to apply on various forms of extreme weather going forward. The study provides a framework for calculating how much climate change is likely to cost in the future, as well as the economic value of reducing emissions in order to limit the level of global warming, he said.
To help, Schneider is rolling out its Wiser Energy Center, a home power management system that can analyze which appliances are using the most power and when, and can be programmed to turn certain circuits off at certain times of day. For $299, plus added costs to add smart switches or integrate solar or battery power, Schneider is pitching the system as a cheap alternative to upgrading your home appliances.
Then another colleague, Marta Domínguez-Delmás of the University of Santiago de Compostela in Lugo, Spain, noted that she dated old shipwrecks by analyzing the tree rings in the wood found underwater. The team wondered whether perhaps tree-ring data from Caribbean shipwrecks could push the region's hurricane history further back in time.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You had Senator Durbin saying he doesn't see a way to get to five billion. You had Senator Graham saying no wall, no deal. Is there any point of agreement anywhere in here, Dan?
Then when it weakens, it causes like a dam to burst, and the cold air heads south, said Judah Cohen, a winter storm expert for Atmospheric Environmental Research, a commercial firm outside Boston.
In other words, processes in the atmosphere do not happen in a vacuum — everything is connected — so one extreme can sometimes help yield another. And this one-two punch was an amplified enough pattern to send energy into the stratosphere, causing the sudden warming and polar vortex disruption.
Unfortunately, the world is being led by some very sick people, so people like yourselves and (the) younger generation are the ones that are going to make all the difference, Harry said in the phone calls, according to The Sun.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah I think so.
Outside scientists said even small changes in sea levels can lead to flooding and erosion.
Dr. Shaman: Like I said, I'd really like to see laboratory experiments on coronavirus survival repeated but this time with different temperature and humidity conditions. That would be much more compelling to me than any other studies done so far which try to tease apart various effects from population-scale data. There are a number of studies posted on medRxiv related to this which can provide some perspective.
The president also previewed his trip to Detroit later this month to visit the city's annual auto show, saying his attendance would allow him to see this progress firsthand.
Everybody that saw that video, that saw those photographs, we recognize the fear and the pain that we're feeling about climate change in this animal and that's why it probably galvanized public attention, Mittermeier added.
MIKE POMPEO: Yep, they said yesterday, signed a document. The gentleman whom I met with agreed that they would break that relationship and that they would work alongside of us to destroy, deny resources to and to have al Qaeda depart from that place.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --when they're going to get paid. So--
Hotels would have to ask guests if they really need their towels and sheets washed each day. Running an ornamental fountain without a recirculating system would be barred, as would watering outside within 48 hours of a good rain. Another measure would give cities and counties until 2025 to stop watering ordinary street medians.
Preliminary data from the Rhodium Group, a research consultancy, found that emissions rose 3.4 percent last year. That's even as Americans' reliance on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, hit a 40-year low.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM (R-South Carolina/@LindseyGrahamSC): Yeah. It was pretty clear to me that we're never going to have a deal unless we get a wall as part of it. Dick Durbin is a reasonable guy, but he's not leading this parade. We're having to negotiate with people who want to abolish ICE, not support ICE. We're having to negotiate with people who see the border patrol agents gassing children, rather than defending our borders as professional law enforcement officers and we're negotiating with people who will give us one dollar for the wall, even though, it's immoral and accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racist. As long as the radical left is in charge we're never going to get anywhere. The President will compromise but he will not capitulate. So that's where we're at.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --to provide the freedom and the space for that political reconciliation to be realized. And I intend on playing a part in trying to contribute to that.
Tom Steyer has presented himself as the unconventional politician who can go head-to-head with President Trump on the economy. Steyer also points to his work building grassroots coalitions and reminds Iowans at nearly every town hall that he's the only candidate who will make tackling climate change his number one priority.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: I'm supporting Mikie.
Experts say the short-term decline will not be enough to make a lasting impact on the acceleration of climate change.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So there is no deal to keep a certain U.S. military presence in Afghanistan?
Much sort of like a Sandy or a hurricane or something like that, it gets really strong really quickly, and when that happens you have these bursts of intense snow, he said.
It's breathtaking and heartbreaking the damage that's been done. … A tipping point is playing out right now, the world-renowned climate scientist Dr. Michael Mann, from Penn State University, said in an interview with an Australian TV network. By chance, Mann happened to be on sabbatical in Australia studying bushfires during the most intense part of this fire season.
You mustn't believe what you read, no one has stripped us of our titles, he reportedly said.
O'Donnell: Do you think it's important to have her supporters if you were the nominee?
Ancient Spanish shipwrecks and tree-ring data have revealed an unusual low in hurricane activity during the golden age of piracy, new research suggests.
Vernon's son, Brian, had a home just around the corner. Had a home.
Many of the changes face court challenges and can be reversed by executive action or by lengthier bureaucratic process. But undoing them would take time and effort by the incoming Biden administration, which also has ambitious goals to fight climate-damaging fossil fuel emissions and lessen the impact of pollutants on lower-income and minority communities.
Some industry and conservative groups have long pushed for what they called the transparency rule. Opponents say the aim was to handicap future regulation.
MARK LANDLER: And I think that also explains this decision before Christmas to announce this troop withdrawal. I just would be interested to see a little more maybe researching to how much is-- how much his voters really care about pulling troops out.
But critics say the New York-based money manager is already showing weakness in its commitment to environmental issues. Specifically, they say BlackRock is being too passive in pushing for change in the agricultural and commodities industry, which many believe to be the second-largest contributor to climate change after the energy sector.
Biden declared he was running for president on April 25, days before the meeting described by Bolton.
Berners-Lee sees such budding social consciousness as a silver lining in a year filled with chaos and tragedy.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, can you say that this wasn't something that tipped off the spread on the West Coast?
FM Global uses these tests to show its clients -- including Fortune 500 companies -- how they can better protect themselves. A better protected business is less risky to insure.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Okay. Doctor, thank you very much for coming on and giving us--
It's possible that over in Great Abaco we could put, you know, a solar array, 18 acres, Winslow said. That power is piped through... preferably a new undersea cable to the island. And that could be a main source of our power.
Beijing intends to connect more than 60 countries, with a collective population of 4.4 billion people -- more than half of the world. It's expected to spend close to a trillion dollars on the initiative, primarily focused on major infrastructure development projects including thousands of miles of railroad tracks to create routes from China all the way to Western Europe.

The group told 60 Minutes they plan to appeal the decision.
While Sanders has come under criticism from some opponents because he identifies as a democratic socialist, majorities of Democratic primary voters in California and Texas have at least a somewhat favorable view of socialism, and it is viewed more positively than capitalism. This is related to vote: Sanders' supporters have generally more positive views of socialism than do Biden's.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You-- you called them terrorists in the past. Do you still consider the Taliban terrorists?
The study examined four new or updated Ocean Heat Content records — a fancy term for measuring how warm the ocean is, taking into account deeper water, not just surface temperatures — and finds the ocean warming is significantly higher than estimated in the last comprehensive report by the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2013.
The good news is, with the exception of climate change, individuals can do much to reverse insect declines, Tallamy said in an email. This is a global problem with a grassroots solution.
It's been a little over three months since Bloomberg joined the Democratic primary race. Though he had initially declined to run in 2020, the billionaire entered the campaign fray because he had no confidence that anyone in the field could beat President Trump in November.
The new rule would require the release of raw data from public-health studies whose findings the EPA uses in determining the danger of an air pollutant, toxic chemical or other threat. Big public-health studies that examined results from countless people, who were kept anonymous, have been instrumental in setting limits on toxic substances, including in some of the nation's most important clean-air protections.
However, there may be considerable reporting discrepancies among countries. Many countries in the deep tropics have less developed medical and public health infrastructure and may be less able to test and report infections. In some of these countries many infections may go undocumented.
MARGARET BRENNAN: He was on Friday. He was--
Washington — House Speaker Nancy Pelosi regained the gavel on Thursday, announcing a dramatically new direction for the House after eight years of Republican control. She promised to end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, address gun violence and climate change.
He allegedly said he and Meghan left Britain because it was the best decision for their family, and that normal life was better than life as a royal.
MIKE POMPEO: And there-- the document that was made public yesterday is the complete agreement. The implementing elements of that will be available for every member of Congress to see. Know this. I saw what Congresswoman Cheney said, and I have an enormous amount of respect for her. The American people should know Donald Trump is not going to take words on a paper. We are going to see if the Taliban are prepared to live up to the commitments they've made. The Bush administration and the Obama administration both tried to get the words that were on the paper yesterday that the Taliban would break from al Qaeda publicly. We got that. That's important. Now, time will tell if they'll live up to that commitment is our expectation. They have promised us they will do so and we'll be able to see on the ground everything they do or choose not to do.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Well, I would just say, do you remember the President's words, how could you forget, a concrete wall, two thousand miles long from sea to shining sea, paid for by the Mexicans. How many times did he say that to the American people? That is not what any of us have ever voted for in the past.
@SecPompeo Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, @ScottGottliebMD
We're the first to use shipwrecks to study hurricanes in the past, lead author Valerie Trouet, a dendrochronologist at the University of Arizona Laboratory of Tree-Ring Research, said in a statement. By combining shipwreck data and tree-ring data, we are extending the Caribbean hurricane record back in time, and that improves our understanding of hurricane variability. [A History of Destruction: 8 Great Hurricanes]
Sanders also leads the field in Texas, though in this state he enjoys just a four-point edge over the former vice president. About half of voters in both states say they have definitely made up their minds already, and many have already cast their ballots.
And the scales had fallen from my eyes. There was this other world….It was like being introduced to sex, he said.

The letter got wide attention because of Fink's prediction that climate change was already having an impact on the stock market and the long-term outlook for investors, and because Fink said his company was going to do something about it.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But President Trump said he's going to meet with the Taliban in the near future. When? Where? Is that Camp David?
According to Cohen's theory, the lack of sea-ice and the fact that it took a few weeks longer than typical to recover this autumn set into motion a chain of events where the typical prevailing winter jet stream pattern across Asia was enhanced. That enhancement in turn helps initiate the Sudden Stratospheric Warming.
With an average temperature 4 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, this winter ranks first among the warmest winters on land in the Northern Hemisphere, beating the very mild winter of 2015-2016.
President Trump at rally in Nevada: Venezuela, Venezuela how does that sound? You like Venezuela?
MARGARET BRENNAN: So from what you're describing, it doesn't sound like there is any progress. How close are we to ending this shutdown?
People ask me, is this a new normal for Australia? It's worse than that, Mann said. For Australia, dangerous climate change is already here. It's simply a matter of how much worse we're willing to allow it to get.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: Listen, Senator Graham and I could not be more different politically. He's a conservative Republican from South Carolina; I'm a progressive Democrat from Illinois. But we've teamed up time and time again to try to solve this problem. And a year ago-- a year ago, we presented to the President on January, the eleventh, 2018, I do remember the day, a bipartisan proposal to deal with DACA and many other aspects of the reform and the President rejected it. He said, I'll go with my approach. His approach ended up with thirty-nine votes in the United States Senate. It wasn't even accepted by his own party anonymously. So we're in a position now where when the President makes these claims and promises a lot of us, I hope I could speak for Senator Graham, are a little bit skeptical.
When our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed, and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class, she will say in her speech, according to prepared remarks. As speaker, she'll preside over the swearing in of new members of Congress.
Amy Klobuchar has pitched herself as a candidate with a strong electoral record and Midwestern roots. At nearly every event she has told people that she has won every race, every place, every time and talks about the surge she sees in Iowa in polls and her endorsements.

When he'll be 103, and still working to save the world.
Swarms were first spotted about a year and a half ago on the Arabian peninsula. By July of last year, they were reported in Yemen. Once the swarms arrived in Yemen, the FAO warned that if preventative measures weren't put in place, the insects would migrate to Kenya next.
Warm waters in this part of the world, as remote as they may seem, should serve as a warning to all of us about the potential dire changes to the planet brought about by climate change, he said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would be open--
SEN. SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is- I didn't say that. What I would say--
Hope Town has been Malone's home for all of his 82 years. His family has lived here since 1785. He's the town baker and grocer, and he and his wife rode out the storm in his store. It survived, but their home just up the street did not.
But answers may lie in another atmospheric disturbance linked to a warming Arctic, Cohen said.
La Niña and El Niño are semi-annual natural oscillations in the tropical Pacific Ocean. La Niña is characterized by cool surface waters in the eastern tropical Pacific, while El Niño is the opposite, characterized by warmer than normal surface waters. Because they cover a vast area in a very heat-rich part of the world, they have the ability to affect global temperatures.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What about the tone of this conversation? One of your colleagues, Congresswoman from Michigan, was speaking to supporters and used a profanity, and said you know, impeachment should be what we're talking about. What do you think of, maybe not the language, but the-- the premise of what's being talked about?
If the storm moves just 25 miles in one direction or the other when it gets to the Northeast, that could be the difference between four and eight inches of snow, Parkinson said.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, look, Mr. Bloomberg is free to do anything he can with his 60 billion dollars, and that's legal. All I can say is at this point, we are confident that we can receive the kind of campaign funding that we need from working class and middle class people, that we don't have to be beholden to any powerful special interests. Look, one of the things that upsets people--
DAN BALZ: That-- that is such an interesting question because I think we are going to go through a period in which there is great hunger among Democratic activists to figure out who the best person is to take on President Trump in 2020, and I think there is such a range of opinions on who that will be. We saw in Iowa this weekend tremendous crowds that turned out for Elizabeth Warren. I think that is emblematic of the interest that people have and a desire to hear from the candidates. I think that people are approaching this with an open mind, we know this is going to be a very wide open race, there are a few people like Elizabeth Warren or Vice President Biden, Bernie Sanders who have standing and networks and-- and certain amount of name identification. But there are all kinds of other people who are going to be in this with different kinds of messages. And my sense is that people are going to be reluctant to jump too quickly to one candidate and get behind that candidate and they are going to say as-- as they all talk about in Iowa, they're-- they're going to kick those tires for some months as they watch and wait and listen to what people are doing.
Hope Town is on one of several small islands ravaged by Dorian, which then moved across 7 miles of open water to Marsh Harbour, the largest town in the Abacos. At least 60 people died in Marsh Harbour, and destruction is still everywhere. Total damage and loss from Dorian is estimated at $3.4 billion.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, I certainly like my former boss, Julian Castro--
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, we're going to see. I mean I think based on the polling, we're doing pretty well in Virginia. I think we got a shot in North Carolina. All I can say is the issues that we are talking about and that is health care as a human right, raising the minimum wage to a living wage, dealing forcefully with the existential threat of climate change. Those are ideas, Margaret, that I think are resonating all across this country. I think we have an excellent chance to do well on Tuesday and to win the Democratic nomination.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you'd suggest that's the conversation the President should have tomorrow with the pharmaceutical companies--
The team that found the warm water created a nearly 2,000-foot deep access hold to conduct unprecedented research, part of a multimillion-dollar initiative between the United States and the United Kingdom. Using an ocean-sensing device, scientists recorded waters more than two degrees above freezing flowing beneath the hard-to-reach glacier in early January.

For this particular SSW event it appears the main Arctic outbreak will occur first over Europe and eastern Asia through mid-January. But then computer models show a shift occurring, with the potential for Arctic invasions in the U.S. later this month.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?
The prospect of reducing emissions by up to 28 percent from their 2005 levels—as the U.S. would be required to do under the Paris climate agreement—will require a radical shift. It would mean cutting emissions at nearly double the pace of their 2007-to-2015 decline. That prospect, while not impossible, would require an immediate policy shift or a technological breakthrough, Rhodium found.
Anderson Cooper: You want folks to underestimate you?
If Warren is successful on Caucus Night, it will be partly due to her organizing strength in the state. Her team built a large operation early in the process and deployed organizers around the state before many campaigns built out their Iowa infrastructure. Her broad range of policy proposals has resonated with voters around the state, even if they don't agree with all of her views.
Amid the recent dust-up between Sanders and Warren about whether a woman can win, 54% of Iowa Democrats say it would be harder to beat Mr. Trump in November if the nominee is a woman. It is Biden supporters who are the most likely of the top-tier candidates' backers to say it would be harder. And Democratic women are more likely than men to think it would be harder for a woman to defeat Trump.
That would coincide with the next season of planting. At that time, the seasonal winds will have shifted to the north, which is likely to allow the newly formed swarms in Kenya to reinvade Ethiopia and Somalia as well as to migrate to new areas of South Sudan and Sudan, according to the FAO appeal.
Dr. Shaman: That is one of the critical questions we would like to answer and I would love to see some virus survival experiments that elucidate and show evidence one way or another.
Exactly 100 years ago Saturday, the U.S. government passed a groundbreaking law to protect migratory birds that fly across the Atlantic. To mark the anniversary, National Geographic magazine helped declare 2018 The Year of the Bird. It kicked off the observance with an essay from acclaimed author Jonathan Franzen, who's also a bird lover and a conservationist.
Alessandro Soru: It's now planned for the end of 2021.
MARGARET BRENNAN: You have rallies planned out in California. There is very much a concern about the spread of the coronavirus on the West Coast. Is it safe for you? Have you spoken to any government officials about whether people can really appear at your rally and not worry about their own health?
MARGARET BRENNAN: With fourteen states up for grabs in just two days, Biden's victory gives a boost to establishment Democrats hoping to deny Bernie Sanders the nomination.
Pelosi will say Democrats must be pioneers of the future and accelerate a future that advances America's preeminence in the world by improving public education and workforce development. She also sounds a warning on climate change, calling it a crisis manifested in natural disasters of epic proportions.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're going to take a break and continue the conversation on the other side of it. Please stay with us. We hope you will, too.
I've actually birded on all seven continents, he said. There is a bad kind of birder who only cares about increasing the length of his or her list of birds seen….I have a little bit of that but there's another part of me that, I think, is a good birder which is – this is a way to have an experience.
Experts agree that a changing climate has made wildfires more frequent and more damaging. Longer, drier summers have extended the typical wildfire season and made trees more susceptible to burning, according to a recent U.S. government report on climate change. But wildfires aren't just a seasonal event anymore. Now they're a year-round threat -- and not just in the West. The Southeastern U.S., which has historically not seen wildfires, is increasingly at risk, as the 2016 fires in Tennessee demonstrate.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to start on what we haven't mentioned thus far in the show, that the President has made a choice to run the intelligence community. He's going to renominate a congressman, John Ratcliffe. Is he actually going to go through and get nominated and-- and confirmed?
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, at this point, you don't know if this person came into contact with anyone. He just showed up sick at the hospital?

While she's been in Washington for the impeachment trial, her family members and local legislative endorsers have held events on her behalf. Klobuchar has also urged supporters to help push her into the top tier while she's busy with the impeachment trial by volunteering for her campaign. And she's told undecided Iowans to call friends and family in Minnesota for a performance review.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll?
The warmth wasn't just confined to Siberia. Rohde from Berkeley Earth says 87% of the Earth was significantly above normal in 2020 and 10% saw record average annual warmth. No region experienced a record cold annual average.
This connection between the warm Arctic, low sea-ice cover and an amplified jet stream is the reason why Cohen believes climate change is leading to more frequent SSWs. But he acknowledges that the topic is controversial.

MARGARET BRENNAN: There has been speculation and-- and our next guest, Senator Lindsey Graham, has proposed this idea of a wall for DACA, sort of, a trade here. The President stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said he wants to wait until the Supreme Court rules on DACA before he comes to any kind of proposal here. Do you agree that we need to wait on the courts there? And is there any room for that kind of swap, that kind of deal?
There's a growing anger, Steve Zeltzer, a longtime Bay Area activist, told CBS MoneyWatch recently. People feel like there's no accountability, and these executives violate the law and get off scot-free while lives have been destroyed and communities have been destroyed.
The animation below is an idealized illustration of the effect, in which there is an enhanced heat dome (known as a ridge) over northwest Russia and an enhanced dip in the jet stream (known as a trough) in eastern Asia and the North Pacific.
Global sea levels were stable for about 3,000 years until the 20th century when they rose and then accelerated due to global warming caused by the burning of coal, oil and natural gas, said climate scientist Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute in Germany, who wasn't part of the study.

MIKE POMPEO: --there have been prisoner releases from both sides before. We have managed to figure our path forward. We'll know who these people are. We are working to build out a set of confidence measures that will do for America what President Trump has committed: reduce our cost in blood and treasure and keep America safe from terrorism. I don't think any American can doubt President Trump's seriousness in that.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I really understood the frustration that working people had across the political spectrum. When anybody is saying, The economy is going great. We are at record levels. There's a frustration that says, Well, the economy's good for who?

Commenting on the importance of climate attribution studies, co-author Dr. Friederike Otto, from Oxford University in the U.K., said, We do not need to do an attribution study to know that climate change is happening, but to understand what climate change means where people live, we do.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE (D-New York/@ RepMaxRose): Absolutely. Look we all are. We all have federal workers in our district. This is a national disgrace. There's a lot of talk here about national security and border control and we need that. But we also have to talk about the fact that a shutdown should never be used in this country as a negotiating tactic.
Back in Hope Town, Winslow said they have the funds to bury their lines. Americans with second homes here add a lot to the economy, Winslow's family foundation has donated nearly a million dollars to rebuilding efforts.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi addressed the U.S. Conference of Mayors Wednesday afternoon, hours after President Trump wrote a letter to Pelosi saying he would conduct the State of the Union in the House chambers despite Pelosi's request to postpone the speech. She did not address the State of the Union in her speech.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, I bring that up first because it gets to some of what we have been talking about today in terms of confidence in professionals versus political choices made for political reasons, and-- and confidence in-- in hard fact and in intelligence. Ed, I know you've been following, as you always do, you lived in China for so long, and you followed the origins of this outbreak of corona, when you heard the administration this week change its language so many times in describing and characterizing response, what did you make of that? And what do you make of what is actually known in terms of what China is sharing with the U.S.?
MARGARET BRENNAN: --from that war zone. What do you think of that idea of a drawdown or a full withdrawal?

The restrictions, punishable by a $500 fine, include prohibitions on watering lawns so much that the water flows into the street, using a hose to wash down sidewalks or using a hose without an automatic shut-off nozzle to wash cars. A final decision is now expected by April 17.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you can watch more of that interview tonight on 60 MINUTES.
WHO also warns of the dangers of influenza — a century after the 1918 flu pandemic killed millions of people around the globe. The world will face another influenza pandemic — the only thing we don't know is when it will hit and how severe it will be, the report states. The authors stress the importance of getting a flu shot each year for the best protection against the virus.
Schumer said the Senate will also provide further support for vaccine distribution and assistance for American families, small businesses, school and state and local governments dealing with the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
Mnuchin dismissed her remark and said she could explain it after she goes and studies economics in college. Thunberg fired back on Twitter, as experts in the field, including a chief economist at Mnuchin's former employer, Goldman Sachs, touted the benefits of policies to fighting climate change and its positive impact on the global economy.
Because of a technicality within the family, if we are earning money separately from within the family structure, then we obviously have been asked not to use our titles in order to make money, which we would never do. But the press managed to jump on that to make it look like we had been stripped.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It sounds like you're saying you would be open to more border funding if it were spent in a different way, could you get to that five-billion-dollar number?
The Elfstedentocht is the longest, most punishing outdoor speed skating race in the world. And it's been an essential part of Dutch life since 1909. Held in the northern province of Friesland, the 125-mile race links 11 cities over frozen canals and waterways. But climate change has changed all that, and now the race is under threat. Bill Whitaker reports on an alternative race in the Austrian Alps that's drawing thousands of Dutch skaters on the next edition of 60 Minutes Sunday, March 8, at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.
The cold air that's normally confined to the Arctic, it's kind of dammed in by the polar vortex itself -- because winds normally blow from west to east inside the polar vortex, so it acts as barrier, keeps the cold air to the north and the mild air to the south, Cohen said. When it breaks down, the cold air that's penned up in the Arctic spills to lower latitudes, and that's when you get those episodes of severe winter weather.
Biden thanked Bloomberg for his support and praised the former New York City mayor for his work combatting climate change and ending gun violence. This race is bigger than candidates and bigger than politics. It's about defeating Donald Trump, and with your help, we're gonna do it, Biden said in a tweet.
Scientists have found warm water beneath Antarctica's doomsday glacier, a nickname used because it is one of Antarctica's fastest melting glaciers. While researchers have observed the recession of the Thwaites Glacier for a decade, this marks the first time they detected the presence of warm water – found at a vital point beneath the glacier.
He touted the fruits of the auto industry bailout, countering critics who called it a road to socialism and a disaster waiting to happen.
In recent decades, heavy rain and snow events are increasing due to a warmer atmosphere. This is especially true in the Midwest, Great Lakes and Northeast. Climate Central
And that is where this study lays to rest a misconception about whether there was a global warming hiatus between 1998 and 2013. If you look at a short-term snippet of the surface temperature record, one could conclude that warming was negligible during that 15-year period. Those skeptical of climate change often refer to this to poke holes in the evidence.
This was the third straight year that all 50 states had above-average temperatures for the year. Five states -- Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and New Mexico -- had their warmest year ever. Temperature records go back to 1895.
We will turn now to South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who joins us from Clemson. Senator Graham is someone, as we've been describing, who-- who speaks to the President, often shares his advice. Senator, did you speak to the President this weekend about this shutdown?
Climate change's impact on Iowa voters CBS News' Natalie Brand traveled around Iowa speaking to farmers, environmental activists, business owners and the state's secretary of agriculture about extreme weather conditions and how those situations and climate change are impacting voters.
ED O'KEEFE: It was his test that if he could do it there, he could do it anywhere. He couldn't.
Observational analysis shows the 2019-2020 Australian heat wave was 10 times more likely now than in 1900 because of greenhouse warming. In addition, statistical analysis of real-world observations indicates that the probability of a Fire Weather Index as high as the 2019-20 bushfire season's was at least 4 times higher now than in 1900.

From our observations into the ocean cavity at the grounding zone we observed not only the presence of warm water, but also its turbulence level and thus its efficiency to melt the ice shelf base, said Aurora Basinski, an NYU graduate student who made the turbulence measurement.
They're making no bones about it, they need that money now, Patta said from Johannesburg, South Africa. It's the worst (locust outbreak) in 70 years for Kenya, and a quarter of a century for Somalia and Ethiopia.
When the Arctic pulse is warm, you tend to get an increase in occurrences of extreme winter weather across the midlatitudes, including the eastern U.S., northern Europe and northern Asia, Cohen told Live Science.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, with that in mind, with them in mind why can't you reopen the government while you argue about the things you just laid out?
The nation's 644 billionaires have enjoyed a staggering rise in wealth since the pandemic shuttered the economy in March, with the group gaining almost $1 trillion in total net worth, according to a recent analysis. The spike in wealth coincides with what some economists are calling a K-shaped recovery, with the rich regaining their footing while poorer Americans struggle with lost wages and jobs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Yesterday, the U.S. signed a deal with the Taliban that may lead to a full withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan. Since it began in 2001, the war has claimed the lives of more than two thousand four hundred American troops. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is just back from the signing ceremony in Doha. He got off the plane just a short while ago. And thank you for being here, Mister Secretary.
Understanding how changes in heat affected the hurricane seasons in the past could help with regional hurricane-prediction models in modern-times, the researchers said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Is it just a matter of semantics here? Border fence, some kind of barrier? I mean is there movement for Democrats to support what the President in some way is asking for?
Part of what attribution studies do is use specialized computer programs to model what would happen under different climate conditions.
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. Top White House officials and senior congressional aides will meet again today to try to find a way out of the shutdown. So far their talks have yielded nothing. Yesterday the administration stuck to its demand for 5.7 billion dollars to build a border wall. Democrats insisted the government needs to reopen while negotiations continue. With no deal in sight, trash is piling up at the nation's national parks and some eight hundred thousand federal workers won't receive paychecks until the government reopens.
Asked what it was like facing the jaws of the beast, Mittermeier responded: She's just letting you know that this is her territory, you know, and if you wanna be here, you're going to play by her rules.
Realizing that I couldn't catch a live penguin, she started to bring me tired penguins, exhausted penguins, he explained. And she's just staring at me with this dejected look on her face that I'm this useless animal in her ocean who's going to starve to death. She's trying to feed me penguins and take care of me.
In order to calculate which portion of the flood damage between 1988 and 2017 was due to increases in extreme events on a warmer planet, the team started with higher resolution climate and socioeconomic data and then applied advanced methods from economics and statistics. Using these tools they constructed an economic model to analyze the relationship between observed precipitation and flood damage month by month and state by state.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: So, I am pro-Israel; I am pro-Palestinian. I want to bring people together to finally achieve peace in that region.
How do we want to live?
Bloomberg had hoped for a strong showing in Virginia, where he announced his candidacy in late November, and in other states like Tennessee, North Carolina and Oklahoma. But Biden won all of those states on Tuesday. Bloomberg captured only American Samoa.
It's a big deal because the projected sea level rise is a conservative estimate and it is likely to be higher, said lead author Steve Nerem of the University of Colorado.
O'Donnell: Can you unite the Democratic Party? We've just talked about criticism from Senator Warren, criticism from Senator Clinton, criticism from the Obama camp.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: The gravity of that word is too big and too important to just throw it around.
Following the results in Iowa and New Hampshire, which showed Sanders in a strong position, the Bloomberg campaign saw an opportunity to capitalize on moderate candidates splitting the rest of the field, calling on others to drop out and rally behind him as the only viable alternative to Sanders. A campaign memo suggested the race for the nomination was between two candidates, Bloomberg and Sanders, and also warned that if Sanders were the nominee, he would eventually lose to Mr. Trump in the fall.
Mini Mike Bloomberg just quit the race for President. I could have told him long ago that he didn't have what it takes, and he would have saved himself a billion dollars, the real cost. Now he will pour money into Sleepy Joe's campaign, hoping to save face. It won't work! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2020
The substation in Marsh Harbor which feeds us the power's destroyed, Winslow said. And then, of course, you can see all the utility poles-- are pretty much destroyed. So this isn't a case where you-- you come in and replace some poles, and you flick a switch. This is months, and months, and months of-- of work.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: (CHUCKLE) When you look at the words that he uses, which are historic dog whistles of white supremacy. When you look at how he reacted to the Charlottesville incident, where neo-Nazis murdered a woman, versus how he manufactures crises like immigrants seeking legal refuge on our borders, it's— it's night and day.
We're in the business of protecting businesses from every hazard they can throw at them, so that's all the things that Mother Nature does and all the things that people do, he said.
You can think of attribution as a sort of CSI — Climate Scene Investigation — in which scientists attempt to separate what's natural from what's human-caused in these extreme events. So far the collaboration has investigated 230 extreme events around the world, including 2019's Tropical Storm Imelda in Texas which dumped 43 inches of rain.
ED O'KEEFE: It's a warning sign because South Carolina was his-- was his petri dish.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, we will see when markets open tomorrow what they thought of it. But, certainly, for the public, we'll continue to follow the details of this as we have on FACE THE NATION.
Another notable provision would change the process to vacate the chair, a process to force out the speaker. Instead of only one member being able to trigger the process, the new rule would require motion to vacate to only be offered on the House floor if a majority of either party conference agrees to do so.
MICHAEL CROWLEY: Well, that's a big question. You know, President Trump was getting close to nominating Congressman Ratcliffe back in the summer, and met so much resistance from senior Republicans in Congress who said this man is not qualified. He's only been on the Intelligence Committee for a year, may have inflated his resume, and is much more partisan around the people who've held that job. The President pulled back and didn't do it. The question is now has Ratcliffe changed any minds? There's not a lot of evidence to that, but there may be a little bit of a game going on here because the President has installed Richard Grenell, his ambassador to Germany, in that job, in an acting basis and because of complicated things that have to do with the-- the-- how long acting directors can serve. By nominating a new person, even if President Trump doesn't think Ratcliffe can get confirmed, that allows Rick Grenell to stay in that job for a longer amount of time. There's another theory that Rick Grenell is even more unpalatable to people in Congress than Ratcliffe. So Ratcliffe may be the more acceptable alternative. So there's a lot going on here and people are trying to figure out what's real and what isn't.
It's not clear yet, the researcher wrote, how exactly the wild female swing will impact the sea turtles' future. Males breed far more often than females, but researchers don't know to what extent the handful remaining can make up for all their missing brothers. It's also possible, the researchers wrote, that females will seek out mates in cooler climates to the south.
It's a tight and fluid race heading into the final week in Iowa for a lot of reasons. Bernie Sanders is attracting 26% support, with Joe Biden at 25%, as the top preferences of likely caucus goers. Pete Buttigieg is right there within striking distance at 22%. Elizabeth Warren has 15% support and Amy Klobuchar has 7%, but because of the way caucuses work, these are critical numbers with implications for the race.
Inside the facility's fire lab, one of the world's largest flames tears through two shelves stacked high with boxes. It looks like a catastrophe, but this is only a demonstration.
Nos. 7 - 10 on the Chronicle of Philanthropy's list:
Those three elements came together in heart-wrenching fashion this past December when the couple released a video of a starving polar bear on social media. They photographed it on a recent arctic expedition and it was viewed more than 30 million times on National Geographic's social media and web platforms.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It's Sunday, January 6th. I'm Margaret Brennan and this is FACE THE NATION.
And the reason behind it? Climate change is certainly at play — there is a clear trend toward an earlier start to spring, Crimmins said.
Today, the president said, the American auto industry is back.
Winslow said that would be enough to power the island.
The relationship between spiking Arctic warmth and pockets of cold to the south was really, really strong -- and it was strongest in the eastern U.S., Cohen said.
But President Trump rarely missed a chance to suggest that all Democrats were socialists who'd lead the country to ruin.
MARGARET BRENNAN: When is that going to be put on the table? That offer.
John Dickerson: When people look at Venice and what is happening in Venice, more floods, faster and higher, what message should they take for the rest of the world?
Senator Bernie Sanders: Look, I am functioning as a jurist. I want to hear all sides. But I will tell you right now what has upset me the most and upset the American people is: How do you have a fair trial when you don't have witnesses when you can't get documents? What is the President, what are the Republicans hiding?
Sanders: Absolutely. Bad vote. I voted against it. There are ways to raise money in order to protect the working families of this country. Cutting Social Security ain't one of 'em.

WMO also warned the shutdown's impact on the concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere was no bigger than the normal year to year fluctuations.
It starts before dawn with skaters wearing helmet lights and ends well after dusk. For the top-notch racers skating 125 miles, it takes about seven hours to finish. Others aim to skate half that distance or a personal best. Many skaters start in the dark and end in the dark. There was even one veteran skater who fixed blades to his walker.
Examination of the trends in real-world observations revealed somewhat different results than the climate model portion of the study, but both point to a human fingerprint of varying degrees on the extreme bushfire behavior.
Lovato is also teaming up with American Airlines and Mastercard through their #MilesMakeMemories program to offer fans the chance to experience her music in a more intimate setting than they may have ever seen her before.
The anti-vaccination movement made the list of the World Health Organization's top threats to global health in 2019. The organization said some people's reluctance or refusal to vaccinate threatens to reverse progress made against a host of preventable diseases.
Right, and that isn't price gouging, Burgess said. I mean, that's just inherent cost.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: He's not in the room. Neither one of them are in the room.
Bloomberg released a statement saying he would be leaving the race and endorsing Joe Biden.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Would you be taking a creep shot of Steny Hoyer's behind and sharing it around? Why is there more comfort in doing that to me than there is in doing it to— any other member of Congress?
According to NOAA's assessment of the biggest U.S. weather disasters — those with an inflation-adjusted cost of a billion dollars or more — the economic toll rose from an average of $17.8 billion a year in the 1980s to over $81 billion a year in the 2010s.
In the below graph for the city of Boston, the blue lines indicate a cold Arctic, the red lines indicate a warm Arctic, and the green lines represent the Accumulated Winter Season Severity Index (AWSSI), a measure of snow and cold. Cohen points out just how straightforward the trend is: As the Arctic warms (red), cold and snow (green) increase in Boston. This is especially true following episodes of major Arctic warming, as is happening now. This is also the case for much of the eastern U.S.
New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced she is forming an exploratory committee to run for president, throwing her hat in the ring for the Democratic nomination in an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that aired Tuesday night.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I am here to tell you--
While much of WHO's list focused on infectious disease, it also included the increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases like diabetes, cancer and heart disease. These types of conditions, linked to lifestyle factors like obesity, alcohol and tobacco use, are collectively responsible for over 70% of all deaths worldwide, or 41 million people, the report said.
ALEX AZAR: And we have offered, even though it is not medically indicated, we have offered to test any HHS employees involved if they would like that extra piece of mind. We want to do that for our employees.
What the world can learn from the flooding in Venice Flood waters are rising higher and more frequently in Venice because of global climate change. John Dickerson reports on how the city is trying to fight the water and why the rest of the world needs to pay attention.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But the people in the room are your colleague Senator Durbin along with--
I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new, Buttigieg said in Decorah on Thursday, according to CBS News Reporter Jack Turman. But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up, is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.
O'Donnell: Are the senators staying awake?
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, Margaret, it is not only-- it is not only the amount of money that we raised, and that is a phenomenal amount, it's how we raised it. We don't have a Super PAC like Joe Biden. I don't go to rich people's homes like Joe Biden. I think Joe has contributions from more than forty billionaires. What we have done is receive more campaign contributions from more Americans than any candidate in the history of the United States, averaging eighteen dollars and fifty cents. This is a campaign of working people and by working people. And I'm extraordinarily proud of that. But we have enough money now not only to take us through Super Tuesday, but take us through the entire process fueled by the contributions of working-class people all across this country.
This study shows that changes in precipitation are already costing billions of dollars, and that we can expect more global warming to further intensify the precipitation events that are driving those climate-related costs.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --those people who work for homeland security who are carrying out the policies you're talking about who are not going to get paid?
If case one doesn't work out, we have other options.

The researchers dug up classic books -- such as Shipwrecks in the Americas: A Complete Guide to Every Major Shipwreck in the Western Hemisphere (Dover, 2011) and Shipwrecks of Florida: A Comprehensive Listing (Pineapple Press, 2015) -- to amass a detailed record of Caribbean shipwrecks.
To the extent that there is still a natural world, the birds are the best ambassadors for it because you can't go anywhere on this planet without running into birds. You can be 90 miles inland in Antarctica and there are the emperor penguins, he said. You can be in the most bleak South Pacific ocean and there are the albatrosses, there are seagulls nesting in the desert….I've seen great birds outside my window on the Upper East Side in Manhattan. They're everywhere and always not really caring very much about us. They're just being themselves.
This microgrid will produce enough electricity for Ragged Island's roughly 100 residents. The prime minister calls it a laboratory for the solar future. The past is a diesel generator needing boats to deliver fuel from hundreds of miles away, a system Whitney Heastie says is a nightmare.
After dropping for three years in a row, U.S. carbon emissions spiked in 2018, demonstrating how hard it can be to move away from fossil fuels while the economy is growing.
In an interview with CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell, Senator Bernie Sanders talked about the cost of his health care plan, his relationship with former rival Hillary Clinton and the impact of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. Sanders told O'Donnell it's disappointing to not be meeting with voters in Iowa, but acknowledged the importance of attending the trial in Washington, D.C.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Absolutely. That's how I won my primary. (LAUGHTER)
Climate change-driven drier weather in the U.S. West means less milkweed for butterflies to eat, Wagner said. And changes in American agriculture remove weeds and flowers they need for nectar.
And in the current social climate, that message may be more relevant than ever.
Other administrators also spoke and acknowledged the school's shortcomings.
SCOTT PELLEY (60 MINUTES): How do you view this emergency?
We've had so many shocks to the system, he said. People have had a chance to reflect, to say, 'When we do get our lives back, where do we want to live and how do we want to live?'
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We are preparing for the worst. We are ready. We are ready.
Bolsonaro, who took office at the beginning of 2019, has pushed for development over the conservation of the rainforest. Experts have linked the staggering number of fires in the Amazon last year to the rush to exploit the resources in the rainforest.
Amid the worldwide pandemic, many indigenous peoples quickly organized to self-isolate, cancel big events, and translate health guides into native tongues, according to Vargas. However, hunger during the quarantine also poses problem, forcing indigenous people to ask for donations of food and clean water.
However, the extra energy in the Earth system goes a step further. A warmer atmosphere and ocean can also power more intense weather systems, which increase rainfall rates and also the overall precipitation which falls in a storm. So, even if a region's average rainfall is decreasing, individual storms still tend to produce more precipitation.
ED O'KEEFE: It's going to be really difficult for a lot of these people to somehow make a mark here and somehow deal with maybe fifteen, twenty people who are running for-- for President and their party. And it's going to make things quite uncomfortable for them.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Michael, I mean does the President now have the credibility and-- and the trust of the public at a moment of crisis when you need it most?
Pelosi also administered the oath of office to members of the most diverse new Congress ever. More than 100 female House members were sworn in, including the first two Native American women and the first two Muslim women.
MARK LANDLER (The New York Times/@MarkLandler): Well, it's-- it is interesting. It's-- it's as though we have come full circle from where we are, where on December 19th when President Trump announced this pull out and put a thirty-day deadline on it. I think there's probably a great deal of confusion at the Pentagon and I think it's not an accident that we have not seen a single four-star general come out and speak publicly about what the strategy is in Syria. There's been a great lack of-- of-- of synchronicity between the White House and the Pentagon all along. The question I have now is, how in sync is the National Security advisor--
The strike caps off a newsworthy week for Thunberg. On Wednesday, she accused politicians of all stripes of making promises but failing to deliver any results, saying, Our house is still on fire. She also demanded companies and governments divest from fossil fuels, as well as immediately end all fossil fuel subsidies.
EDWARD WONG (The New York Times/@ewong): Thanks, Margaret.
MARGARET BRENNAN: That's it for us today. Thank you all for watching. Until next week for FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.
London — Two Russian prank callers claim Britain's Prince Harry told them that U.S. President Donald Trump had blood on his hands because of his response to climate change, according to the British tabloid newspaper The Sun.
So how big will this solar array be? Whitaker asked.
Now, there's reasonable evidence with the flu that it's not actually linked to temperature, but rather linked to humidity levels and that these viruses thrive in conditions that are very dry, which is what we get in the wintertime. Why that is for flu, we don't know, and if that is the mechanism that extends to coronavirus, we don't know either. Either way it leads to the enticing possibility that maybe this novel coronavirus will also be affected by ambient conditions which lead to it dissipating during summertime.

MARGARET BRENNAN: But passing a bill that re-opens the government comes up against this hard line position the President has taken which is he wants border security, specifically, a border wall, adequately funded. Do you see, Congressman, room to move beyond that existing level of 1.3 billion dollars, how do you get to the five he wants?
ANTHONY SALVANTO: A very long night with delegates coming as we go, as we go.
Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective ways of avoiding disease — it currently prevents 2-3 million deaths a year, and a further 1.5 million could be avoided if global coverage of vaccinations improved, WHO said in a statement.
EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler is expected to formally announce completion of what he calls the Strengthening Transparency in Regulatory Science rule in an appearance before a conservative think tank on Tuesday. The EPA completed the final rule last week, but so far has declined to make the text public.
According to Kevin Trenberth, a senior scientist from the National Center for Atmospheric Research and co-author of the study, the increase in ocean heat content observed since 1992 is about 2,000 times the total electricity generation by U.S. utility companies in the past decade.
Unlike the surface temperature record which can vary dramatically from year to year, the Ocean Heat Content record acts a bank and steadily accumulates heat. So, if the Earth is trapping excess heat, the Ocean Heat Content record will tick upward, with no ambiguity.

You know, in summer we're almost on the verge of running out of fuel in some of these islands, because bad weather sometimes prohibits the ships from actually getting to some of these locations, Heastie said.
McCarthy has not yet responded to Mr. Trump's tweet.
That microgrid will satisfy 10% of Marsh Harbour's total power needs, and will be built right between its government center and hospital, both of which were without power for weeks after Dorian.
She moved back to the Bronx after graduating college and spent the next few years working as a community organizer and advocate for children's literacy. In May of 2017, the one-bedroom apartment she shares with her boyfriend became her makeshift campaign headquarters as she launched a seemingly improbable run for Congress. She was working as a waitress and bartender at the time. Like many members of her generation, she says, she had student loans to pay and no health insurance.
The two-year whammy indicates that worse might come as the world's climate continues to change, with Aon meteorologist Steve Bowen noting that catastrophe risks continue to evolve.
This means, for now, climate change can lead to bigger snowfalls for areas where there's more moisture and it is still cold enough to snow, like the Midwest and Northeast. But in areas where temperatures are warming above thresholds for snow more often, like the nation's midsection, the trend in snowfall is downward. The below image makes this trend clear.
If we care about that, we wouldn't be able to do what we do, she said. We cannot care about those kinds of things. If we put ourselves in this spotlight, then we know that people do not understand the situation. The situation is not being treated as the crisis it is.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --because that's significant what you said there--
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --until that changes there's--
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with two veteran deal makers who are trying to break the impasse and reopen the government. The Democratic whip, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And, apparently, in a partnership still with al Qaeda?
You've got this incredible outlay to rebuild these islands that were devastated by Dorian, Whitaker said to Prime Minister Minnis. Can you afford to bring on a new form of electrical generation?
Anderson Cooper: Do you believe President Trump is a racist?
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: You know what I would add to what Max is saying, and what I think is lost a little bit in the discussion of Trump's strategy, is this idea that we don't have a good plan with our allies. We are always at our strongest as a country when we are moving forward with our traditional allies and NATO, for example, that is when we're able to get the space to have diplomatic relations, which-- which when we bring world approbation to bear. And so when we're in an era where we're treating our traditional adversaries better than our allies, I think that is making it more and more difficult for us to operate from a point of power on the world scene.
ED O'KEEFE: You know, to your point about campaigning in Congress, that panel, discussion you had with those freshmen members, three of those four replaced Republicans and will go home in 2020 and run again in districts that favor Republican candidates. To-- to watch those kinds of Democrats now in Congress twist in the wind as candidates go out and talk about a progressive tax rate, Medicare for All, agreeing with the President maybe we should withdraw all our forces from Syria.
Former Congressman Ryan Costello (R-Pennsylvania) just left the U.S. House of Representatives and is now the new managing director of Americans for Carbon Dividends, an advocacy affiliate of the Climate Leadership Council. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed this week he laid out the case for a Republican plan to tackle climate change, citing, in part, the need to keep younger Republicans on board.
Anderson Cooper: How is that possible? Are you talking about everybody having to drive an electric car?
MARGARET BRENNAN: We want to take a closer look at the growing fears over COVID-19, commonly referred to as the coronavirus. Last week the World Health Organization said the global risk of the virus spreading is now very high. Here in the U.S., there are now seventy-one cases of coronavirus and worldwide the death toll is almost three thousand. There are also concerns about the global economy. Here in the U.S., the stock market took its biggest hit last week since the 2008 financial crisis. We begin today with Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar. Good to have you here.
Luigi Brugnaro, a conservative and former businessman, is Venice's elected mayor.

There are a lot of reasons for me to make this decision. There are a lot of challenges that are facing the American people that I'm concerned about and that I want to help solve, she told Jones, listing issues such as health care, criminal justice reform and climate change.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Now the Trump administration faces a crisis of its own: Calming and reassuring the American public.
Since 1970, the ocean has warmed 40 percent more than previous estimates, according to climate scientist Zeke Hausfather, one of the authors of the study.
Keeping Buttigieg squarely in the mix are, in part, older Democrats — among whom he is second only to Biden — and would-be first-time caucus-goers, on whom he is especially dependent.
ANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): The Democratic Party has lost so much.
Trenberth says, The warmer ocean is the memory of the past climate change and the ocean heat content is breaking records every year.
The physical and emotional damage done by these domestic terrorists to the U.S. Capitol and all who lived through it was despicable. The loss of life that occurred as a result of this attack, including one Capitol Police officer, was needless and tragic, he said. As we continue to take action to address these events – including action to mitigate and hopefully remove the immediate and ongoing danger President Trump poses to our country – we must remain vigilant against potential threats and future violence in the lead up to the inauguration.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And other potential candidates near their own decisions.
This decision certainly wasn't the easy one but it was the right decision for our family, the right decision to be able to protect my son, and I think there's a hell of a lot of people around the world that can identify and respect us for putting our family first. But, yeah, it's a tricky one, but we will start a new life, he said, according to The Sun.
Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed regional trade pact, has left Asian governments that want to use ties with Washington to offset China's growing dominance off balance.
His elaborate plan is designed to capture carbon dioxide emissions from power plants that burn fossil fuels like coal and oil, preventing them from entering the atmosphere where they are a major cause of global warming.
New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress, recently sat down with Anderson Cooper for an interview airing Sunday on 60 Minutes. See the full interview at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.
There's a growing consensus among scientists that climate change is what's making hurricanes stronger and more destructive. That's very bad news for the Bahamas, a string of more than 700 low-lying islands stretching from Florida nearly down to Cuba, in the heart of what's come to be known as Hurricane Alley.
MIKE POMPEO: So, there have been-- there-- there-- there have--
John Dickerson: You say Venice is dying. Those are the stakes for you?
She's been accused of being dishonest about the true cost of her proposals and the tax burden they would impose on the middle class. She's also been criticized for making factual mistakes.
Study aims to examine links between climate change and clouds An unprecedented study was recently launched to explore clouds, which cover two thirds of the Earth's surface on average. Scientists still understand precious little about the phenomenon, but most climatologists believe they hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of climate change. CBS This Morning: Saturday took a closer look at where scientists are conducting the study out in the Caribbean.
Good morning and welcome to FACE THE NATION. It was a knockout win for former Vice President Joe Biden last night in the South Carolina primary. He got nearly half the vote coming in close to thirty points ahead over his closest competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders. CBS News elections and surveys director Anthony Salvanto is here to tell us more. So, Anthony, how did Joe Biden do this?
The Desert Locust upsurge represents an unprecedented threat to food security and livelihoods and has the potential to become a regional plague that could lead to further suffering and displacement, reads the organization's appeal for aid.
ALEX AZAR: So what your viewers need to know is the risk to average Americans remains low. We are working to keep it low. We will see more transmission of cases in the United States. We've got the finest public health system in the world here. This is what we do. We cannot make predictions as to how many cases we'll have but we will have more and we will have more community cases. It's simply just a matter of math.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So in France, they shut down the Louvre Museum. They're telling people, don't kiss, don't shake hands. In Japan, they're closing schools for a month. Canada's health minister told his people to start stockpiling food. In the U.S. there are closures, as we just said, in Washington and in Oregon. They've declared a state of emergency out there. And the CDC said this week, disruption to everyday life might be severe.
I'm not working for you, Biden said. Don't be such a horse's ass.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to Senator Bernie Sanders. He is on the campaign trail in Norfolk, Virginia. Good morning to you, Senator.
In a separate report released on Wednesday, 20 scientists from 13 institutions from around the world reported that 2020 had the highest upper ocean temperatures on record. The study focused on the upper 2,000 meters of the world's oceans. The oceans act like a bank account accumulating interest — more than 90% of excess heat from climate change is stored in the oceans.

2020's global temperature was especially enhanced by astonishing warmth in the Arctic and Russia. Because of Arctic amplification, a phenomenon where decreased ice and snow leads to a warming feedback, the Arctic is warming at three times the pace of the global average.
She made waves recently for saying in a tweet that President Trump is Saudi Arabia's bitch for announcing the U.S. will stand with Saudi Arabia, regardless of any intelligence community assessment on Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's involvement in the killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.
The Fire Weather Index is based on weather conditions like temperature, wind, humidity and rainfall combined with the moisture content of vegetation, or lack thereof. This numerical index is used worldwide to estimate fire danger.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Yeah. You know, if that's what radical means, call me a radical.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --of annex-- she says there are secret annexes to this deal.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, and the Senate would say--such as, me winning or losing--this is all campaign 2020 that they're gesturing towards and immigration is one of those issues that divides people. But it makes them emotional and fired up, as well. Is that actually a conversation about border security or is it a conversation about politics?
Bliss and business partner Charles Moseley, who's a mere 81, are known as the thermodynamics duo.
Pelosi then outlined priorities for Congress and for mayors across the country, including infrastructure, public education concerns and immigration reform. he said mayors needed to address three major issues in coming years: economic inequality, climate change and housing crises in cities across the country.
Hey @realdonaldtrump: being Saudi Arabia's bitch is not America First, Gabbard tweeted.
Unlike with coal, BlackRock has not pledged to sell off its investments in companies in the industry, including companies that have been tied to fires in the Amazon, such as Bungee Limited and Archer Daniels Midland. It also has not mandated that companies revamp their operations.
The world is watching closely as China begins investing billions of dollars into a hyper-ambitious New Silk Road aimed at broadening the country's financial scope and enhancing global trade. The plan is called One Belt, One Road and is essentially a network of land and maritime routes to improve the flow of goods and access to Central Asia, Europe and the Middle East.
In Virginia, Bloomberg spent nearly $18 million on advertising in the weeks running up to Super Tuesday. The deluge of spending did little to persuade voters in the state — exit polling showed 56% of them had a negative view of Bloomberg, compared to 39% who viewed him favorably.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --who you know well, wasn't very happy with you this week, though, because she released a public letter saying that there are problems with this, that you-- you-- you are pretending that the Taliban can be counterterrorism partners and saying, you know, the Taliban is still allied with al Qaeda and pointed out you personally when you were a member of Congress--
Maybe the whole scale gets rejigged to reflect the times, Brandolino said.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: --that aren't reported yet. It's a big country three-- three hundred and forty million people, three hundred and thirty million people, so anyone's individual risk is-- is still very low. But we need to get those cases diagnosed and identified so we could start getting people quarantined and into treatment and prevent more spread. We need to start mitigating the implications of the spread. There was an analysis out today by Trevor Bradford, very good researcher out of the Hutch, looking at the genetic strains in Washington State. And by looking at the strains and the drift between the different strains for the people who have been diagnosed there, he's suggested that there's perhaps hundreds and maybe low thousands of cases. It's an interesting analysis. There probably are more cases. We have community spread now in Washington State, California, perhaps, Illinois, Oregon. So certainly hundreds of cases.
Nicklen and Mittermeier take care of each other in the field, but they also complement each other. While Nicklen specializes in wildlife at the frozen ends of the Earth, Mittermeier captures the lives of indiginous people all over the world.
As average temperatures rise across the planet, the frozen Arctic is heating up faster than anywhere else.
One of the few things Ocasio-Cortez has in common with the president is an active and often combative presence on social media. When a conservative writer tweeted this photo of her, saying, That jacket and coat don't look like a girl who struggles, she called him out for what she said was misogyny.
You are actively trying to end our Second Amendment right and take away our guns, the worker told Biden.
Anderson Cooper: —for misstating some statistics about Pentagon spending?
So, whatever the politics of climate change, the insurance and risk picture is pretty clear, said Dokoupil.
Former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg filed his fourth-quarter FEC report. Although he was late entering the Democratic field, launching at the end of November, his campaign spent nearly $188 million, including over $140 million dollars on television and digital advertising says CBS News Campaign Reporter Tim Perry.
Bowen might also have been referring to California, where drought, heat, high winds and untamed brush caused the state's deadliest and most destructive fire on record, according to Aon. The Camp Fire destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and other structures in Paradise, California, killing 88 people and resulting in $15 billion in losses. That and other California conflagrations charred 1.8 million acres in the state, a record.
These more extreme precipitation events more easily overwhelm infrastructure like flood barriers and drainage, which were built for the tamer climate of the 1900s, not the souped-up climate of the 2000s. The image below shows this is also true for rivers and streams, many of which have seen an increase in streamflow since the 1980s.
Of the 3 inches -- 7.5 centimeters -- of sea level rise in the past quarter century, about 55 percent is from warmer water expanding, and the rest is from melting ice. But the process is accelerating, and more than three-quarters of that acceleration since 1993 is due to melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica, the study shows.
If this winter season was not very wintery where you live, you're certainly not alone — that was the experience for most of the people in the Northern Hemisphere. According to NOAA, the winter of 2019-2020 was the warmest on record across all continents north of the equator.
Bezos, the world's richest person, used the contribution to launch his Bezos Earth Fund. The fund, which supports nonprofits involved in the climate crisis, has paid out $790 million to 16 groups so far, according to the Chronicle. According to the left-leaning Americans for Tax Fairness and the Institute for Policy Studies, from March 18 through December 7 of last year, Bezos' wealth on paper surged by 63%, from $113 billion to $184 billion.
Cohen says that after a stratospheric warming event, the biggest impacts typically follow in about two weeks as the atmosphere shuffles systems around and new patterns become established. The timing and degree varies from event to event.
REPRESENTATIVE MIKIE SHERRILL: I think we certainly need to be talking about how we end these wars, but I don't think you can do it and say, you know, as-- as we just announced in Syria we're just pulling out.
ED O'KEEFE: It could, potentially. Look, and, tonight, he is-- he is doing something that hasn't been done in a while. He is buying three minutes of advertising on NBC and CBS to talk about the coronavirus. And trying to cast himself as somebody who is a competent manager, who could probably help solve this problem, and would have tackled it sooner than the President. He can spend as much as he wants. But if he doesn't hit fifteen percent in these states on Tuesday, it will have been for naught, essentially. Certainly, they believe that they can go on into Florida and Arizona and Illinois next and-- and try to compete in later March contests. But, perhaps, the biggest loser last night in South Carolina was Mike Bloomberg because Joe Biden did so well. They needed Biden to stumble or to only win narrowly to help make the argument that he is the better moderate alternative.
NOAA concludes the United States had its fifth warmest year on record, with all five of the warmest years occurring since 2012. This warmth was boosted by severe heat waves across the Southwest last summer, with much of the southwestern quarter of the nation experiencing its hottest year on record.
We have to decide whether to give into the fear or whether to fight back, Warren said on Saturday in Muscatine. Me, I'm fighting back. That's why I'm in this.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (60 MINUTES): I find it incomprehensible that the President would do something as inane as calling it a hoax, which he did last night in South Carolina.
Warmer water also holds less carbon dioxide, meaning more heat-trapping gas escapes back into the atmosphere, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop of perpetuated warming.
Across the Super Tuesday states — the big delegate haul that comes after opening contests in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina — the top tier remains Biden, Sanders, and Warren. Warren currently polls better across those contests than she does in Iowa, bolstered by support from college-degree-holding and post-graduate voters, and she runs even with Sanders among the very liberal.
Winning that primary shocked the Democratic establishment, and in November, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.
Rich Korthauer, vice president of Final Distribution Business at the energy-management company Schneider Electric, said the pandemic has galvanized customers' desires to use power more sustainably.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --it doesn't have to be concrete.
While some rivers have seen a decrease in streamflow, the majority of U.S. rivers are seeing increases, which are leading to more flooding events. Climate Central
So part of my mission has become to try to remind people that there are other things to think about if you care about nature than just climate change, he said.
But many people living in the region fear that China is also attempting to gain overwhelmingly political power that could threaten their current way of life.

O'Donnell: When's the last time you spoke with Senator Clinton?
Here in the Bahamas there are still huge economic obstacles. Losses from Dorian equal nearly 30% of the country's entire annual GDP.
After years of criticism from environmentalists, the world's biggest investor finally embraced the challenge of battling climate change in January. That's when BlackRock, with a massive $7.4 trillion in client assets, announced it would sell off $500 million in coal industry stakes and push more of the thousands of companies it invests in to make environmental sustainability a top priority.
Hoeven proposed taking more proactive steps to growing domestic oil production. He pointed to such legislative maneuvers like Congress' recent lifting of the U.S. ban on crude oil exports, which passed after GOP leaders struck a spending deal with Democrats that also extended renewable energy tax breaks.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So, Speaker Pelosi has called the wall an immorality. She said, no way, no how, is the President going to get money for it. That's a pretty hard line position versus where the President is. Do you find any room for compromise in the middle?
Before [COVID-19], you spent from eight to five in an office. Your heating and cooling was taken care of, your power for your computer was taken care of, you left the lights on, he said. Now that consumers can see those costs, they want them lowered, he said.
She did well in school, and with the help of scholarships, loans and financial aid, attended Boston University. But in her sophomore year, her father died of cancer.
The power, Minnis said. We had to make determination to set up micro-grids.
Locusts are similar to grasshoppers, but differ in that they have the ability to change their behavior and can migrate over large distances. The swarms over the Horn of Africa are made up of desert locusts, which are known for forming swarms that can be highly dense and mobile, according to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization desert locust information center.
We begin today with Senate Democratic whip Dick Durbin who is in Springfield, Illinois. Senator Durbin is among a group of senators talking to the White House about how to end this shutdown. Senator, welcome to FACE THE NATION. The President said this morning that he's considering declaring a national emergency depending on what happens in the next few days. If he tries to build this wall without congressional approval, what will Senate Democrats do?
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll continue that conversation in our next half hour. So, stay with us.
MICK MULVANEY: The press was-- was-- was-- was-- was-- was covering their-- their hoax of the day because they thought it would bring down the President.
Democrats secured their razor-thin majority in the Senate after Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock unseated incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, respectively, in Georgia's January 5 runoff elections. With the Senate split 50-50, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will be the tie-breaking vote, giving Democrats an edge.
It's unusual for a senator to be seated for nine hours
Minnis and leaders of other island nations have proposed that the U.S. and European countries contribute to an insurance fund – think of it as a really rainy day fund – to help rebuild from future storms.
According to a new study published Feb. 5 in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, there may be more than 15 million gallons (58 million liters) of mercury buried in the permafrost of the Northern Hemisphere — roughly twice as much mercury as can be found in the rest of Earth's soils, ocean and atmosphere combined. And if global temperatures continue to rise, all that mercury could come pouring out.

It is highly unlikely that an extreme fire season like this would have happened without human-caused climate change, the study's lead author, Geert Jan von Oldenborgh, of the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute, said in a phone conversation with CBS News.
Now a new study from Stanford University puts a number value on the portion of the increasing costs caused specifically by the rise in floods linked to climate change. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, examines flooding related to rain and snow events and finds that of the $199 billion in U.S. flood damage from 1988 to 2017, more than one-third is directly related to trends in intensifying precipitation.
According to the majority opinion, written by Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz, the plaintiffs have made a compelling case that action is needed. But he continued: Reluctantly, we conclude that such relief is beyond our constitutional power. Rather, the plaintiffs' impressive case for redress must be presented to the political branches of government.
Plenty of people in California fault PG&E for not doing enough to mitigate the fires. Hearings before California's utility regulator have been flooded with people calling for criminal prosecution of the utility's executives.
Use a shingle that's designed for those higher wind speeds, Gritzo replied. It's going to be stiffer. It's going to have a little more adhesive.
Meanwhile, infrastructure hasn't kept up. A 2015 review of U.S. infrastructure found that the biggest threat to it, by far, was climate change. And that's complicated by the reality of more people living in wooded and fire-prone areas, in houses that are increasingly more expensive and may not be fireproof.
On average the pattern the next few weeks should feature a ridge of high pressure with warm and dry conditions in the U.S. West and a dip in the jet stream, called a trough, in the east with disturbances (areas of low pressure) rotating around the trough. Any of these disturbances has the potential to turn into a winter storm. CBS News
Lawmakers recently let PG&E raise rates to cover the costs of the 2017 wildfires, but they balked at repeating that after the vastly more expensive disasters of 2018. Vox asked: How does a utility price in the risks of rising temperatures and stay in business?
In just three months, we've gone from 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president, Bloomberg told the crowd of supporters Tuesday. If I'm the nominee, let me make you this promise: we will beat Donald Trump here in Florida and in swing states around the country.

Locusts can move about 90 miles in just one day.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: They can't afford health care. They are scared to death about their retirement. They want a government that represents them, not just billionaire campaign contributors. That's how you win. You put together that coalition, multi-generational, multi-racial. That is what we're doing. No campaign out there has a stronger grassroots movement than we do. That's how you beat Trump. And, by the way, almost all of the national polls out there, you know, I've had last seventy polls, sixty-five of them, I think, have us beating Trump.
Phil Knight, who with his wife, Penny, made the second- and third-largest donations last year according to the Chronicle, saw his wealth grow by about 77% over the same March-to-December period. Knight and his wife gave more than $900 million to the Knight Foundation and $300 million to the University of Oregon.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, he now says--
I tell people I like retirement so much I do it often, Bliss said.
Anderson Cooper: Do you have a specific on the tax rate?
15 acres, Burgess said. Right through here.
With less sea-ice cover due to a warmer Arctic, the overlying atmosphere absorbs more moisture from the Arctic Ocean and, when it is cold enough, dumps more snowfall east of the heat dome. That snow cover, Cohen says, creates an extra-cold air mass over interior Siberia, Kazakhstan and Mongolia. This colder air has the opposite effect on the jet stream in eastern Siberia and the northern Pacific, pushing it south.
Incentives require specific government policy action. We can find clues to why this is tough to come by deeper in the Pew study. While Democrats are generally supportive of policies to combat climate change, most Republicans are skeptical. Nearly three-quarters of Republicans or Republican-leaning voters say these policies either make no difference or do more harm than good, and 57 percent think such policies harm the economy.
Emissions from buildings increased by 54 million tons last year, a sevenfold increase from its typical rate of increase. That's partly because of weather, with a colder winter requiring more heating, but Rhodium expects population growth to keep driving emissions in this sector.
Sanders: I want the United States to do what every other major country on Earth does: guarantee health care to all people as a human right.
Scientists recently suggested that corporations have vastly underestimated the costs of climate change. The impending bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric could be proving them right.
If popular culture can be used to engage young people, get them excited about politics and help inform them about the issues, then what's wrong with that?
Worldwide, WHO plans to ramp up its work in 2019 to eliminate cervical cancer by increasing use of the HPV vaccine. The organization also hopes this is the year the transmission of poliovirus is finally stopped in its last two holdouts, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Last year, fewer than 30 cases of polio were reported in both countries.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --whether conservative or progressive, is-- I didn't say that. What I would say--
John Dickerson: When you hear the sirens, does that take you back?
Pete Buttigieg's argument is that he has the ability to unite the country and appeal to moderate voters, including future former Republicans. Buttgieg, the other top candidate who has been free to roam Iowa during impeachment, has made final trips to some of the counties that voted twice for President Obama before switching to Mr. Trump, and the campaign has emphasized their organizing strength in Iowa's pivot counties.
Love and adventure. This couple has plenty of both.
Since all California utilities face similar challenges, Cavanagh is worried that crippling PG&E wouldn't only eliminate a major investor in the state's clean-energy infrastructure. It could also spell doom for some of the very companies that have been at the forefront of decarbonizing the economy -- an effort that's key to the fight against climate change.
The push to build storm-proof solar microgrids in the Bahamas began in 2017 after Hurricane Irma, another Category 5 storm, tore through tiny Ragged Island, at the southern tip of the island chain.
That's because the Arctic's deeply frigid weather escaped its regular atmospheric jail that traps the worst cold. It then meandered south to the central and eastern United States. And this has been happening more often in recent times, scientists say.
MIKE POMPEO: Who I know well.
I would argue that all these events are linked, says Cohen, A strengthened Siberian high coupled with a deep Aleutian low are critical for triggering a Sudden Stratospheric Warming. Most important in my opinion is the Siberian high but coupled with a deep low in the North Pacific is a one-two knockout punch.
The Midwestern former mayor has argued that it will take nominating someone from outside Washington for Democrats to win in November. He also has pushed back against criticism that he lacks the experience to be president. And in the final days before the Iowa caucuses, Buttigieg began to draw finer distinctions between himself and some of his top rivals.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: --is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, Margaret, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.
This past November, Venice nearly lost another of its gems. At La Fenice, where Verdi debuted his operas La Traviata and Rigoletto, November's flood hit days before the season opener. Once the danger was over, Fortunato Ortombina, La Fenice's artistic director, relived the drama of the panic backstage.
I'd argue that our expectations for climate change were overly simplistic, Cohen said. It was kind of expected that if you warm the Arctic, the only thing that's going to lead to is just milder temperatures everywhere -- and that's not a complete picture.
Extreme weather and natural disasters are among the most significant threats facing the world this year, according to a recent survey of global experts and decision-makers. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria -- along with 13 other major natural disasters -- caused more than $300 billion in damage last year. That's a new record for the U.S.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --you're using for planning.
California has the same system architecture as here in the Caribbean, right? Fossil fuel, long transmission distribution lines, Locke said. And you see that PG&E had to proactively shut off power to millions of people in order to prevent fire.
The numbers of honeybees are down from the dangerously low levels of less than 30,000 monarchs for the past two years, the zoo said. The incredible migration of western monarchs is a unique yet fragile piece of North America's natural history, and it is on the brink of collapse, said Paige Howorth, director of invertebrate care and conservation at San Diego Zoo Global.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts, and a number of states around the country.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: Well, there's been a larger problem in terms of the way in which we have tried to overcome twenty-first century threats, and that is that we are fighting sequential one-year engagements without any type of long-term strategy. So the key here in Afghanistan, because we saw in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq was absolutely foolish. But then we did a speedy withdrawal, which I believe was motivated by politics, and then we had to go right back in. We cannot afford to do the same thing in Afghanistan, but we also have to come to the realization that the only way in which we will stabilize that country is with some type of political reconciliation with the Taliban and it's our responsibility, as the part of an international coalition--
A recent study by Potsdam Institute climate scientist Marlene Kretschmer found the polar vortex has weakened and meandered more often since 1990, but that study focused more on Europe. Ongoing research shows that there seems to be a similar connection for more frequent Arctic cold snaps like what the U.S. is now experiencing, Kretschmer said.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think the decision the administration made to block the travel, which was controversial at the time, clearly, bought us time. It-- it slowed the introduction of the virus into the country. Virus was probably here at that time, but it slowed additional cases. The question is what do we do with that time? I think there's some things we did that were very smart. We got the country prepared. One of the mistakes, one of the challenges was getting the diagnostic testing in place. I think what-- what we should have done and I don't want to, you know, armchair quarterback this, we relied on the CDC. We always rely on a CDC in a public health emergency. But simultaneous to that, we should have also been reaching out and trying to get the laboratory-developed tests into the game and the manufacturers, who have diagnostic capability. We've done that. You know, a couple of weeks went by and they did that. And that is now in place. And those labs are going to be coming online. So we course corrected. I think what it teaches us, if you're looking back, what is the teachable moment? It's don't take a linear approach to these crises, take an all of the above approach. And we need to do that now in a therapeutic. We-- we can't put all our eggs in the vaccine basket. We need to be looking at antibody-based prophylaxis, treatments, vaccines, and all of the above approach.
Two billionaires who donated heavily to charity last year — MacKenzie Scott, Bezos' former wife, and Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter — did not make the Chronicle's list because no single donation of theirs was large enough to qualify. Rather than give billions to just one charity, both billionaires opted to make large donations to numerous causes.
This is high ground, which makes it less vulnerable to storm surge or other types of disaster events, Locke said.
From there, the scientists analyzed the ship logs to identify Spanish ships that wrecked during hurricanes between 1495 and 1825.
MARGARET BRENNAN: The President yesterday when he was speaking referred to this fatality as a woman. It is a man.
This is a very rare phenomena, but once it does occur, it becomes extremely threatening to food securities, livelihoods, pastures — and of course with pastures, if herders have to move animals into new areas, this can be sources of conflict, said Keith Cressman, the FAO's Senior Agriculture Officer.
You're the best damn workers in the world, Biden said. I promise you if I become your president you will never have a better friend in the White House. I'm union from, as my — I won't say what my grandfather used to say — but from belt buckle to shoe sole, man.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: I think-- I think there is a hunger out there for people who are willing to speak honestly, who aren't, you know, just so poll tested and-- and holding back on what they're really thinking. I think there's also a hunger out there for people who are trying to solve problems instead of just carrying a partisan banner. I think the country needs to heal, the divisions are growing and I think that we need a uniter to be our nominee.
Last January, a massive cavity the size of two-thirds of Manhattan was found under the glacier, a sign of rapid decay. Scientists continue to warn that the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet could collapse within the next 100 years, leading to a sea-level rise of nearly 10 feet and flooding coastlines around the world.
Mr. Biden will be relying on Congress to approve many of the initiatives he aims to accomplish for his first 100 days, which could potentially be difficult, even with the slight majority that will be held by Democrats. Here are some of those promises:
MARGARET BRENNAN: You've been sparring with the pro-Israel lobby known as AIPAC. You said it gives a platform for bigotry, which was seen as a swipe at Prime Minister Netanyahu. Today, Israel's ambassador to the U.N. says of you that you're not welcome in that country and anyone who calls our prime minister a racist is either a liar, an ignorant fool, or both. Do you see a political cost in taking on the pro-Israel lobby in this way?
This is the new abnormal, former Gov. Jerry Brown said.
Ed O'Keefe, Jenna Gibson and Sarah Ewall-Wice contributed reporting.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And all of that requires working with a Republican Senate--
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --accomplished for us to successfully leave Syria. And the President's slowing down and he's re-evaluating his policies in light of those three objectives. Don't let Iran get the oil fields, don't let the Turks-- Turks slaughter the Kurds, and don't let ISIS come back. I think I share the goal of the President to withdraw our forces. Let's just do it smartly.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Well, I think that it only has ever been radicals that have changed this country. Abraham Lincoln made the radical decision to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. Franklin Delano Roosevelt made the radical decision to embark on establishing programs like Social Security.
The price of renewables have come down to the point where they're now very, very competitive with diesel, Burgess said. And in most cases, way cheaper than diesel.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Because it's not winner take all.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --not the illegal immigrant. Until that changes we'll never get anywhere. There is a deal to be had here--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean there is some calculation here that this could go on for weeks, if not months, because it's not really being felt. Are you seeing that in your district?
Mr. Trump has long claimed that the wildfires which have plagued California were a result of forest mismanagement, instead of the scientifically accepted theory that climate change is impacting the acceleration of forest fires in the state. He has also said that the Finnish president told him that Finland did not have forest fires because its citizens spent time raking the forest floor, although the Finnish president denied ever talking to Mr. Trump about raking.
Schumer will take over as majority leader as the Congress grapples with the effects of the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, during which a pro-Trump mob violently pushed its way into the Capitol building. The deadly attack led to the evacuation of both the House and Senate and has given way to questions about the preparedness of U.S. Capitol Police.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. I really believe that.
A study published Monday in the journal Current Biology about green sea turtles that nest along island beaches near Australia's Great Barrier Reef found that turtles born in areas most heated by climate change are 99.8 percent female. Turtles born farther south, along a cooler beach, are only about 65 percent female.
Majorities see the leading five candidates as being consistent in what they stand for. Sanders does best on this (88%), followed by Buttigieg (80%), Klobuchar (75%), Warren (70%) and Biden (66%). The Sanders campaign's questions about Biden's past votes seem to have resonance with Sanders' own backers; Democratic voters who say they have given a lot of consideration to a candidate's past votes in Congress pick Sanders as their first choice. But relatively few Democrats (30%) make past votes a top criterion in deciding who to support.
Plywood sheets are easy for one person to carry comfortably, so they're often used to protect the windows of businesses and homes during hurricanes.
BlackRock had supported just 3% of the shareholder proposals Morningstar reviewed over the past five years. These included social and corporate governance proposals as well as environmental calls for action. On just environment-focused issues, BlackRock supported 8% of the shareholder resolutions it voted on last year, compared to a 42% support rate for all large fund families.

SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, actually, we have. I mean that's a very fair question. And my campaign has spoken to public health officials on that issue. And right now, we are planning to do rallies not only in California, but in Utah, Minnesota, and other states around the country.
ED O'KEEFE: It is not. You have to hit fifteen percent in each congressional district and in the states. And so the numbers to look for are fifteen. So if you look at our California and Texas numbers right now, Mike Bloomberg is in trouble because he is not hitting fifteen percent. This could have been a very expensive overuse of his money if he can't hit fifteen percent in those two states. But this is why, despite not winning anything so far, Elizabeth Warren is still in this race. Because she sees that she is doing well enough in California and in Texas and in a few of these other states, likely, that she can get above fifteen percent and keep a pool of delegates that keeps her in the race going into later March and April.
While we have to be careful about knee-jerk cause-effect discussions, the National Academy of Science and recent peer-reviewed literature continue to show that some of today's extremes have climate change fingerprints on them, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society.
And while the theory behind the connection makes meteorological sense and some studies do support the connection, Dr. Zack Labe, an Arctic climate scientist at Colorado State University, says you can find an equal number of scientific papers finding a connection versus no connection. Due to all of the chaos and noise in our atmosphere, it still remains challenging to understand connections between Arctic climate change and the polar vortex, explains Labe. This topic remains an active area of scientific research and debate.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And you trust that?
And that's just the tip of the iceberg, literally. Warm water hastens the rate of glaciers melting, and expands the water column, and together the two phenomena raise sea levels. By 2100 the IPCC estimates sea levels may rise 2 to 3 feet, and some studies say more. The destabilizing effects of this on society are incalculable.
Anderson Cooper: This would require, though, raising taxes.
The mechanism behind why climate change is causing more extreme floods is very straightforward: a warmer ocean and atmosphere provides more energy to fuel more extreme weather systems.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Joe Biden is blanketing the airwaves this morning. We know from your campaign that you raised forty-six million dollars in February. That's a significant number. What do you think that does for you going into Super Tuesday? What edge?
Some climate scientists say the drought never fully ended in parts of Southern California. The Los Angeles area has received just a fourth of normal rainfall so far this rainy season.
As you know from our work at the end of the last Congress, the job of COVID emergency relief is far from complete, Schumer told senators. Democrats wanted to do much more in the last bill and promised to do more, if given the opportunity, to increase direct payments to a total of $2,000 — we will get that done.
Since the election, some conservative media outlets have focused on Ocasio-Cortez with an intensity unusual for a rookie member of Congress.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED (D-Texas/@RepColinAllred): Well, let's be very clear. He doesn't want border security. We have border security in this bill that we passed and we are willing to negotiate on border security. There is a difference though, between border security and then building a wall that we don't need and that will be a waste of money. A five-billion-dollar price tag is a lot of money. There's a lot of things we can do instead of that.
It is terrible economics. The austerians were wrong about the Great Recession and Great Depression. At some point, politicians need to learn from mistakes and read economic history, Khanna tweeted, referring to austerity measures, which are focused on reducing a deficit due to risks of budget default.
His reaction to Hillary Clinton saying nobody likes him
The answer is still somewhere out there.
I think the real secret is to keep busy up here, Bliss said, pointing to his head. I have a work program right now that could keep me busy for two years.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Okay. Here's what he's open to. He's open to getting his wall money. We need five billion dollars for the wall in light of the increased threats. He has always put on the table--he put 1.8 million illegal immigrants having a pathway to citizenship in his own plan. So how can you say he's not open minded to it. Here's what I think the deal would look like: given the money we need to secure our border in five billion-- five, six could be well spent. And I think we can put on the table TPS reform. There's four hundred thousand people going to lose their legal status soon who've been here for decades. I'd like to deal with that problem and I would--
In the two decades since then, Franzen has traveled to see as many of the world's nearly 10,000 bird species as possible.
A campaign that started more than two years ago and featured more than 2,200 candidate events is down to its final weekend in Iowa. On Monday night, Iowa will officially kick off the presidential nominating process with its first-in-the-nation caucuses.
Based on a CBS News analysis, only three candidates are currently qualified to participate: Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. All candidates have until February 18 to qualify.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We described in your introduction your attempts in the past to broker agreements, you-- you've tried to be a deal maker. You were in the room with the President on Friday. Did you hear any points of agreement?
Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, delivered the fifth-largest donation on the Chronicle's list: A $250 million gift to the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which worked on voting security issues in the 2020 election.
Cohen warns that the chance for extreme winter weather may last for quite a while. Following an SSW the period of increased risk of cold air outbreaks and snowstorms usually lasts from four to eight weeks. It is not cold and snowing continuously but rather it is episodic, he explained.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: --that realizes the fact that politics is what matters here, it's the United States military's job to provide that room for diplomacy to take its action.
SEN. SANDERS:-- is that he has the right to do anything he wants. Right now, we are confident, MARGARET, based on the fundraising that we are doing, is that we can beat Trump.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Four freshman Democrats joined us earlier this week to talk about their new jobs in Congress. We spoke with Representative Jahana Hayes, a former National Teacher of the Year from my home state of Connecticut and that state's first African-American woman to serve in Congress. Congressman Max Rose, an Army captain from New York who earned a Bronze Star and a Purple Heart in Afghanistan, he then went on to work in the Brooklyn district attorney's office. Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill represents New Jersey. She flew helicopter missions in the Navy then went to law school and became a federal prosecutor. And Representative Colin Allred, who's from Texas. He's a former NFL player who later worked for President Obama's Department of Housing and Urban Development. We started the conversation talking about the vote they took to reopen the government.
Bleaching can eventually lead to death of the reef community, turning them into Ghost Reefs. Since 25 percent of all life in the ocean depends on coral reefs, this loss has a ripple effect on the ecosystem.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How long would it take to get U.S. troops out? Because you're saying this is based on conditions. That means the Taliban has to follow through on a few things.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What will decide that? Are you looking at that?
In what is not likely a coincidence, this pattern yielded two astonishing records last week. On December 28, the unofficial highest pressure ever recorded on Earth happened in Mongolia.
Since the mid 1800s levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have jumped from 280 parts per million to 415 parts per million. They are now higher than any time in the last 3 million years, if not longer. In the Carbon Skyscraper chart below by Dr. Scott Kulp from Climate Central, you can see just how abrupt the change in carbon dioxide has been in the past century compared to the previous 800,000 years.
Even before the locust outbreak, over 20 million people in East Africa faced high levels of food insecurity due in part to harsh climate conditions, such as drought and flooding.
Von Oldenborgh stresses that the model results are likely an underestimate. Models always underestimate the increase in chances for extreme fire risks such as Australia saw in the last few months. This means we know the effect is larger than 30% increase lower bound, which is already a significant influence of global warming.
Gabbard, a native of American Samoa, was elected to the Hawaii State Legislature in 2002 at the age of 21, the youngest woman to be elected to a state legislature in U.S. history at the time. She left office in 2004 and volunteered to be deployed to Iraq. She would return in 2006, work for Hawaii Senator Daniel Akaka, then return to Iraq in 2009.
We also understand on a global level that they are the guardians of the forest that keep our planet healthy, she said. We don't want climate change. If they disappear from their land, we know the level of deforestation has gotten worse.
SEN. SANDERS: Yeah, I do. I mean, they have a lot of money. They have a lot of power. Look, I'm Jewish and I'm very proud of my Jewish heritage. As a kid, I spent time in Israel. I am not in- anti-Israel. I will do everything I can to protect the independence and the security and the freedom of the Israeli people. But what we need in this country is a foreign policy that not only protects Israel, but deals with the suffering of the Palestinian people as well. You've got 70 percent youth unemployment in Gaza. People can't even leave that district, that area, major, major crises. It is not sustainable that we continued conflict in the Middle East until the United States develops an even handed policy.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG: This is up to the scientists and the doctors as to whether there is a problem. They all around the world say that it is in some places and has enormous potential to become one elsewhere. And it is just ignorant and irresponsible to not stand up and be the leader and say, we don't know, but we have to prepare for the fact that if it is, we have the medicines and the structure, and the knowledge to deal with it.
MIKE POMPEO: Look, we can't get into hypotheticals about what it would take exactly but there is a detailed set of commitments that the Taliban have made about the levels of violence that can occur, the nature of what's got to take place. We are hopeful that in the coming days, there will be inter-Afghan negotiations that commence as well. That has not happened before. It's going to be rocky and bumpy. No one-- no one is under any false illusion that this won't be a difficult conversation. But that conversation for the first time in almost two decades will be among the Afghan people. And that's the appropriate place for that conversation to take place. We're-- we're prepared to do what it takes to ensure that we keep America safe. We've asked everyone there to reduce the levels of violence, both the Afghan national--
The main selling point for these items is resilience, not eco-friendliness.
We have this term, 'off grid,' GoSun CEO Patrick Sherwin told reporters at a virtual press conference ahead of CES. We define that as something that begins as soon as you leave your house. Your backyard is off grid. Your barbecue. The event that you go to, the soccer field, the tailgate. And of course, it extends to the boat, the beach, the barbecue.
According to the International Thwaites Glacier Collaboration, the amount of ice flowing out of the Thwaites and nearby glaciers has nearly doubled over the last 30 years. Melting ice from the Thwaites into the Amundsen Sea already accounts for approximately 4% of current global sea-level rise — a number that would significantly increase when the glacier crumbles.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So this is significant. And according to the deal that was released, the U.S. will bring down troops to eight thousand six hundred in the next hundred and thirty-five days. And then if conditions are met, a total withdrawal within fourteen months. But the President said yesterday, if bad things happen, we'll go back in. What's the benchmark there?
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: No. It-- it absolutely isn't. But we have been at war in Afghanistan now for seventeen years. To put things into perspective, people are now enlisting in the United States military who were born after 9/11. And we cannot just have perpetual war. But we also have to maintain our leadership on the global stage, which means that when we make a commitment, we stand by it, and we don't just try to exercise politics on the global stage. We need to have a long-term strategy not governed by tweets--
MILLERSVILLE, Pa. -- Administrators at a Pennsylvania university hosted an open forum to address concerns about a photo circulating of two students in blackface.
As a result of human-caused climate change, the team showed the intensity of this season's Fire Weather Index in Australia was at minimum 30% more likely than in 1900, with such an event becoming, on average, 80% more likely in the models
Biden replied: You're full of sh**.
Even though the group says its carbon fee plan would return money to Americans' pockets, it may still be seen as a tax. In reply, Costello says, I learned in Congress that no major policy solution comes without simplified rebuttals, which often aren't accurate. If families are receiving a check every three months and carbon emitters are transitioning to the cleaner energy, everyone comes out ahead.
Sanders: I'm sorry. I really-- I know the media likes that issue, but I'm not gonna get into that issue. We had it out. Senator Warren is somebody I've known for 25 years, have a lot of respect for. We're gonna go forward together. And I have the feeling we'll be working together.
60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft reported on the case last year. He spoke with Oregon lawyer Julia Olson, who recruited the climate kids from environmental groups around the country. Their suit alleged that the use of fossil fuels is causing climate change, and the government's continued support of the fossil fuel industry endangers the plaintiffs' future and violates their constitutional rights to life, liberty, and property.
Wheeler, in his Wall Street Journal piece, said the new limits wouldn't compel the release of any personal data or categorically exclude any scientific work.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So you would accept it?
After the worker told him that he had made the remark in a viral video, the former vice president replied that it's a viral video like the other ones they're putting out that are simply a lie.
Headlines like this have become commonplace every January when the major climate monitoring agencies tally the numbers for the year before. Because of human-caused climate change, the last six years have been the warmest six years in the record books, which date back into the 1800s.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: --those fences and barriers. Well, he's changed-- he's changed his demand from time to time and he's changed the amount of money he is asking for dramatically from two billion to five billion to eleven billion to twenty-five billion, even to seventy billion dollars. And when we ask for specifics, how are you going to spend this money, what are you going to do with it? He basically says, well, shut down the government until you agree on it. That is not an approach that comes up with the safe border which Democrats certainly want.
Costs are adjusted for inflation and NOAA keeps track of billion-dollar weather disasters going back to 1980. Three of the five most expensive hurricanes in U.S. history hit last year.
There's so many smart products out there; you could end up with a dozen or more apps for each of the smart components, Korthauer said. With Wiser… you've got one app that literally will connect your entire electrical system with everything that you plugged into it.
CBS News: The largest concentration of cases appears to be in the colder mid-latitude areas of China and Europe — and in the United States, [like] Seattle and New York City — but not as large a number in the South. Is it possible that the virus is following colder and not warmer climates?
WASHINGTON -- Anchorage, Alaska, was warmer Tuesday than Jacksonville, Florida. The weather in the U.S. is that upside down.
MARK LANDLER: --tested more is just how resonant an issue getting out of foreign wars is for President Trump's base. We know where his base is on the border wall, we know that's why he's sticking to the wall so hard.
It hasn't been cold enough to hold the Elfstedentocht in the Netherlands since 1997. A group of enthusiasts in 1989 began holding an alternative event 750 miles away in the tiny Austrian mountain lake town of Weissensee. It's now attracting several thousand skaters, nearly all Dutch, and making for one heck of a party in a town that swells to about 6,000 for the event.
Another disease that made WHO's list of global health threats is Ebola, which caused two separate outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 2018.
To start with, a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture and dump more precipitation. A simple equation called the Clausius-Clapeyron rate calculates that for every 2 degree Fahrenheit increase in air temperature, the atmosphere can hold 8% more moisture, and thus produce more rain or snow.

For people of my generation, especially in Europe, life's just always carried on, he said. And the pandemic has really shaken that. The lovely stable world that we've known, for all its problems that we go on about, is fragile and precious, Berners-Lee said.
The problem, sometimes called the insect apocalypse, is like a jigsaw puzzle. And scientists say they still don't have all the pieces, so they have trouble grasping its enormity and complexity and getting the world to notice and do something.
A new study finds the world's oceans are warming significantly faster than previously thought. The analysis, published Thursday in the journal Science, raises the stakes for curbing climate change.
Candidates receiving 1% or less support in the poll are not pictured.
When the mercury's rising in your thermometer, it may also be rising in the ocean.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Good morning, MARGARET.
ED O'KEEFE: This will not be clean. This is going to be a messy contest. It's different than what we've seen before because we have so many candidates. We are down to seven, the magnificent seven, perhaps, who are going into Tuesday. Will the field shrink after Tuesday? Probably. But, again, if you're somebody who can hit viability, fifteen percent in a few of these states, you have no reason to get out yet.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, it's a historic agreement.
Running those models into the future — to the point when global temperatures rise to an average of 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial times (a mark we may hit by 2050-60) — the chance of fire weather like this season's would be 4 times more likely than it is today.
Gritzo is research manager for insurance firm FM Global. His team believes the only way to truly know how something will stand up to disaster is to put it through one.
Due to climate change, Raine Island — the site of the key breeding ground in this study — has warmed significantly since the 1990s, the researchers wrote, likely accounting for the hard female skew.
The desert locust is considered the most destructive migratory pest in the world, according to the FAO. A small swarm of locusts can consume enough food for 35,000 people. Farmers are complaining that about 90% of their crops have already been destroyed. The locusts are now moving towards Uganda and South Sudan, a country that is already under significant strain from food insecurity.
Alexei Stolyarov and Vladimir Krasnov, who make up the well-known Russian prank duo Vovan and Lexus, reportedly made two phone calls to Prince Harry pretending to be Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg and her father, Svante, The Sun reported.
ALEX AZAR: Well, I understand that. It's a very fast-moving situation. Our Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were up late at night, very earl-- early in the morning, working with the Washington state public health office and inaccurately recorded that the individual was a female. That's what the President was briefed on. They've apologized for incorrectly briefing on that. But it's a very fast-moving situation. Obviously, we regret the error.
Up until now the 2015-2016 winter was the clear winner for warmth, but now it must split that distinction with this season. When you factor in the ocean surface in addition to land temperatures, 2015-2016 still holds the record. That's because that winter, the Earth experienced a super El Niño, overheating the surface waters of the equatorial Pacific and radiating heat into the atmosphere. It's years like that where record warmth is expected. But there was no El Niño to be found this winter, and yet, at least over land, it impressively still managed to exceed a super El Niño year.
We're not in an emergency right now, but shame on us if we just bury our heads in the sand ... allow people to go out and waste water by washing down the driveway with a hose when a broom would do, she said.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We're back now with more from our reporters' panel. We saw this week campaign 2020 kick off even though we just started 2019. Dan. And Elizabeth Warren, senator, throwing her hat in the ring. How do you see Democrats defining themselves?
KEVIN MCCARTHY: Nancy Pelosi, I extend to you this gavel.
EDWARD WONG: Well, I think that everyone agrees that full transparency or a large amount of transparency on this virus is necessary both, you know, to push forward with expertise on addressing the virus, plus, calming public fears over it. I think when an administration or government appears to be nontransparent on it then that creates problems. I think that the Trump administration really grappled with that this past week when you saw President Trump come out and say it was a new hoax by the Democrats or when--
While the swarms appear almost biblical, there is a clear suspect for the cause of the outbreak: the changing climate. Unusually wet and rainy seasons has contributed to the number of locusts, which thrive after rainy weather, Patta reports.
There's a lot of incredible things happening in this world with speaking up and positivity, Lovato told CBS News in an interview Thursday. And as hard as this world can be to live in sometimes, there's a lot of people that are doing activism work. And I think that it's important that change happens. And change can only happen when you learn to love yourself, then you realize your worth and your value. I hope people learn that as they listen to my music.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us.
The worst flood in Venice's history happened in 1966. It was only a few inches higher than this past November's. Back in '66, experts said the flood was a once-in-800 year event. Nonetheless, thousands of Venetians left for good.

Erratic individuals can occupy great positions of power in government, and you had better believe they will occupy your chair someday, said Jackson Minasian, an attorney for Stanford Vina Ranch Irrigation Co. Their view of what is 'waste and unreasonable use' will be radically different than yours.
Michael Bloomberg is advertising and campaigning in the Super Tuesday states, and while still trailing the top tier, Bloomberg is now marginally ahead of Buttigieg across these states. Bloomberg is helped, in part, by doing better than Buttigieg among black Democrats. No one is close to Biden among this group, but Bloomberg is the first choice of 10% of black voters and the second choice of 12%. Black voters are more likely than white voters to feel that he could handle attacks from Mr. Trump well. Both black and Hispanic Democrats are more likely than whites to see Bloomberg as fighting a lot for people like them.
Globally, nine out of 10 people breathe polluted air every day. Pollutants in the air can penetrate respiratory and circulatory systems, damaging the lungs, heart and brain and causing an estimated 7 million premature deaths every year from diseases such as cancer, stroke, heart and lung disease.
But the Bahamas has found a ray of hope - specifically, a solar array - that can help its islands survive future hurricanes. And in the process, it may have important lessons the rest of the world should learn, as Mother Nature continues to brew devastating storms like Dorian.
Together, these analyses revealed that climate change has contributed substantially to the growing cost of flooding in the U.S. Overall, the study found 36% of the cost of flooding over that time period can be attributed directly to increasing extreme precipitation events, or almost $75 billion of the estimated $199 billion total.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus. This is their new hoax.
Photojournalist Davide Monteleone recently produced an essay for the New Yorker in which he met with locals where the routes are being developed. It's very complicated to understand how does this actually affect people's lives in the region -- in China, in Khazakstan, Monteleone said in an interview with CBSN. Regular people don't really understand what it is. They aren't very interested in what's going to happen on a global, geopolitical level. They are more concerned about how it's going to affect their everyday life.
MARGARET BRENNAN: But you are a Democratic socialist. You have never officially entered the Democratic Party. In fact, you constantly criticize Democratic establishment. So, how can you convince the country that you are the best candidate to unify Democrats and challenge President Trump?
MARGARET BRENNAN: But it's a process--
MIKE POMPEO: Yes. She-- she-- I'm happy to talk with her. There-- there are--
Bremmer added: In other words, this is the first time we've ever seen as U.S. leadership erodes, no one else has been standing up. Now the leader of China is saying we're prepared to stand up whether it's on climate or the global economy, you know, regional security, you name it -- that's a big change for the world.
This is a nice way image to illustrate what is happening in the Stratosphere right now.

Sanders: Politically in the last week or so of the campaign, yeah, I think it does. I mean, he and others, not just Biden, are able to go out, talk to people. That's really important.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Well, thank you very much, Senator.
It comes after U.S. officials declared that nearly half the state, all of it in the south, is back in drought just months after emerging from it.
Anderson Cooper: One of the criticisms of you is that— that your math is fuzzy. The Washington Post recently awarded you four Pinocchios—
But in a recent paper, Labe was indeed able to find a robust connection between Arctic amplification and a stronger, colder area of high pressure over eastern Siberia, something that is a key to Cohen's theory. Labe's analysis finds that this effect will intensify if global warming gets worse.
By any measure, the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season was catastrophic — burning 46 million acres, killing more than 1 billion animals and racking up an estimated price tag in the tens of billions of dollars.
All of the four top candidates are seen as being able to handle political attacks from Mr. Trump at least somewhat well, but Sanders leads on handling them potentially very well. However, Elizabeth Warren has dropped on this measure since October.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And all of you are willing to do that?
ALEX AZAR: That's not one of the highest priority areas that we're looking at right now, because Mexico only has a couple of cases. Canada's epidemiology is similar to the United States right now. What the President's making clear, though, is we'll always be looking at travel restrictions, border protections. We will take whatever measures are appropriate and necessary to protect the American people. But we don't forecast doing that anytime soon.
For the first time, there is no unique donor threshold to help candidates qualify for the debate. This could benefit billionaire Mike Bloomberg who has said he would not seek donations for his presidential bid. The requirement has kept him off the debate stage in the past. He has not yet reached the polling threshold but has ticked up in support in polls released in recent weeks.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: Of course (LAUGH) not. What we have in mind— and what of my— and my policies most closely re— resemble what we see in the U.K., in Norway, in Finland, in Sweden.
DR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thanks a lot.
The plan also includes legislation that would create customized water-use limits for urban water districts, which would risk state enforcement if they fell short. Lawmakers also are considering whether to allow districts to enforce drought regulations, a power now reserved for the state.
$100 million: Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan gift to the Center for Tech and Civic Life to ensure safe and reliable voting practices in the 2020 election
As a consequence of President Obama's nuclear agreement with Iran, this state sponsor of terrorism will now be able to increase its oil exports at a moment when our moderate Sunni allies, and their partners, feel increasingly threatened by Iranian belligerents, Sen. John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, said in a video released Saturday. As a result, Saudi Arabia has opened the spigot to maintain its own level of exports.
If you want electric service, you're going to have to find a different way to structure the system because no utility will survive. That's the lesson here, he said.
The U.S. Climate Extremes Index (USCEI) for 2020 was 80% above average and ranked as seventh highest in the 111-year record due to extreme heat, drought and hurricane activity.
All of you just came to Washington at a time when a quarter of this government is shutdown. All of you took a vote to reopen the government but Leader McConnell in the Senate has said that is just a waste of time and political posturing. Where do we go from here, Congresswoman?
It's not a perfect solution on Ragged Island; notably, the power from these panels will still feed into the vulnerable overhead power lines; the money's not there yet to bury them.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Senator Sanders, thank you for joining us.
Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has not yet appeared on a ballot, but that will change Tuesday. He sat down with our Scott Pelley yesterday in an interview for tonight's 60 MINUTES. Here's a preview.
Shaul Bassi is a product of that flood. A professor of English literature at Venice's Ca'Foscari University, his parents met when his mother went to Venice to help the flood victims. They stayed, but how many will now that the seasonal high tides, known as acqua altas, are getting worse.
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about Syria. I know you watch the region and you had criticized the President's decision to pull out. The National Security Adviser John Bolton is in the region right now and is saying now there's no timeline for a U.S. drawdown and it'll be dependent on Turkey agreeing not to slaughter our Kurdish allies. It sounds like he's describing--
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mark, I mean, one of the things that-- to-- to pick up on what Shannon was saying, promises made, promises kept, that is something the President prides himself on doing, it has been a challenge for some of his aides, though, who say sometimes, you need to change with the information flow, when circumstances change. You can't just keep to the promise because it was part of the original brand. Afghanistan, when the President had that cabinet meeting in front of the cameras earlier this week, he made some unusual comments, Wall Street Journal came down pretty hard on him.
Some progressive Democrats have announced that they will vote against House Democrats' rules package, which was rolled out Tuesday evening. Although the package includes bills which would create a committee on climate change and implement ethics reforms, some representatives are basing their opposition on the inclusion of the pay as you go rule.
To examine climate change's real-world impact, this forensic analysis involved investigating the change in probability of Australia's heat, drought and the Fire Weather Index since 1900 by looking for trends in both observations and climate computer simulations. Both methods must be blended together to draw robust conclusions about the impact of climate change.
Fortunato Ortombina: It was completely under the water.
SEN. SANDERS: Well, all I can say is we have won the popular vote in Iowa. We won the New Hampshire primary. We won the Nevada caucus. We lost last night. We're looking forward to Super Tuesday. I think we've got a great chance to win in California, in Texas, in Massachusetts and a number of states around the country.
MARGARET BRENNAN: A very little sleep for (INDISTINCT).
The fires that raged through California in the past two years have been the some of the most devastating to ever hit the state, according to Cal Fire. In 2017, they did as much damage as all the wildfires in the prior 16 years, according to some estimates. That record stood for less than a year before it last November's disasters eclipsed it. The Camp Fire, which destroyed nearly 19,000 homes and took at least 86 lives, was the most destructive in California's history.
MARGARET BRENNAN: An inspector general announced this week that they are looking into this complaint by a whistleblower that your agency did not provide adequate training or equipment to those workers who went to receive and welcome back Americans who had been evacuated from Wuhan, China. And those workers were not tested for the virus after they had that contact. Have you personally looked into these allegations?
The physics are clear, Gritzo said.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: It's a first step.
Senator Bernie Sanders: Well, let me be frank. I mean, obviously, when we had planned out our schedule, trust me, we were not planning to be in Washington this week. We had set up a number of town meetings all over the state. We usually bring out good crowds. So it is disappointing to me not to be in Iowa, talking to the people there.
In both states, Sanders is seen as best able to address the issues and concerns of young voters, Hispanics and working class voters. Biden is seen as best able to address the concerns of black voters, while Warren is seen as best able to address the concerns of women. Voters in California and Texas trust Sanders best to handle a number of issues, particularly health care and climate change. When it comes to Sanders' plans, majorities of his supporters in California and Texas think he has the right approach, even if he won't get all of his initiatives done if elected.
But critics say the new rule could force disclosure of the identities and details of individuals in public-health studies, jeopardizing medical confidentiality and future studies. Academics, scientists, universities, public health and medical officials, environmental groups and others have spoken out at public hearings and written to oppose the change.
Last month, Trump administration officials announced Tuesday that the Monarch butterfly was a candidate for federal designation as a threatened species — but will not receive the designation for several years, as there are other priorities.
Just about an hour and twenty minutes before the Senate voted not to call witnesses, including Bolton, Biden told the crowd that he was in the race in May, and according to the transcript, the president instructed Bolton to go to the Ukrainians and try to dig up dirt on Joe Biden. (h/t CBS News Political Unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro). The former vice president was likely referring to the fact that it's Giuliani who has been alleging and investigating, on Mr. Trump's behalf, corruption allegations of Joe and Hunter Biden related to Ukraine. No evidence of criminal wrongdoing on the part of either Biden has surfaced.
At 78, Pelosi is the first person to reclaim to the speakership in more than 60 years, winning support from all but a dozen Democrats after two months of horse trading and policy promises.
ALEX AZAR: So, we're very concerned about the intermingling of our supply chain with China, in particular. We-- the FDA has gone out and worked proactively with drug manufacturers and there are twenty drugs for which the entire molecule or a critical element of the molecule is made exclusively in China. And so we're working aggressively with the-- with the manufacturers to determine if there are any shortages. We are aware of one drug which has many, many replacements in terms of that therapeutic class available that may be in shortage for a short period of time. But--
Another reason for the scrutiny: Fink's sobering prognosis was a surprise for a firm that in the past seemed reluctant to put its weight behind climate issues. Mutual fund researcher Morningstar recently ranked BlackRock 46th out of 50 money management firms when it came to its record of supporting environment issues.
Dorsey, whose current net worth totals $11.4 billion according to Forbes, announced in an April 2020 tweet that he would be donating $1 billion in equity to his Startsmall LLC to fund global COVID-19 relief. After we disarm this pandemic, the focus will shift to girl's health and education, and UBI, said Dorsey in his tweet.
For FACE THE NATION, I'm Margaret Brennan.
The good news, he said, is that the technology to dramatically decarbonize the global economy doesn't need to be invented — it already exists. Equally important is for consumers to understand that less-polluting ways of living can make a major difference, coupled with finding the will to maintain some of those lifestyle changes, such as flying and driving less, after the pandemic ends.
REPRESENTATIVE JAHANA HAYES: I think we have to look at the bigger problem of immigration reforming our immigration system, not just a wall.
How can it be so cold with global warming?
Electric cars covered with solar panels. Solar-powered laptop and smartphone chargers. An AI-driven system to cut the energy use of a home or a factory. This year's annual Consumer Electronics Show puts environmental sustainability and self-reliance front and center.
With many U.S. cities in varying stages of shutdown for parts of 2020, travel was reduced — and so were greenhouse gas emissions. According to a report by the Rhodium Group, an economics and policy research provider, the drop in annual emissions was the nation's largest since the World War II era.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Mm-Hm. But let's dig into that--
In speeches, interviews, and in at least 49 published plans throughout his presidential campaign, Mr. Biden talked about the actions he'd take in the earliest days of his administration — what he would do if he triumphed in what he saw as a battle for the soul of the nation against President Trump.
Andrew Yang is approaching the end of a of a 17-day swing across Iowa. Yang has been campaigning on a message that a changing economy requires a different perspective in Washington to ensure Americans aren't left behind. He's promised that a win in Iowa will also mean a victory in New Hampshire.
Water officials expect neighbors to be responsible for detecting and reporting most of the wasteful water use, and they have no plans to add more enforcement officers if the permanent restrictions are adopted.
Fortunato Ortombina: No, no, no, no, no. If the water arrives, on the cable, on the line, where you have electricity, it explode. It explode.
Although we have come to expect each new year to be one of the warmest on record, 2020 should not have been able to reach such heights. That's because this fall a La Niña event developed, which cooled the overall global surface temperature by two-tenths of a degree, according to Berkeley Earth.
This is a graph of atmospheric temperatures high above the North Pole. The thick black line is the average. The blue line is last winter. The purple line is this winter. Over the past week the purple line spikes upward indicating rapid warming in the Arctic. This is called a Sudden Stratospheric Warming event. The scale on the left is in degrees Kelvin. The purple text shows that corresponds to a jump of temperatures from -110 Fahrenheit to -10 Fahrenheit over one week's time. NASA
You're working for me, man! the worker said.
And because I had fallen in love with them, I wanted to help them, he said.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: I think this is the reality setting in that you got to plan this out. President Obama ended the operations in Iraq against sound military advice. The President's getting sound military advice about the status of the Kurds--what will happen with Iran if we leave too soon. And the-- bottom line here is we want to make sure we get this right, that ISIS doesn't come back. And I applaud the President for re-evaluating what he's doing. He hasn't changed his mind but he's listening to a lot of good advice. And President Obama never would do that. And you saw what happened when a President shuts people out. This President's not shutting people out. He has a goal in mind of reducing our presence. I share that goal. Let's just do it smartly.
Ocasio-Cortez and her allies managed to get more than 40 members of Congress to support the climate committee.
John Dickerson: And what cities are we talking about?
Pelosi, who is the daughter and the sister of two former mayors of Baltimore, began her speech by addressing the government shutdown.
It is worth noting that the team did not find a significant trend in dry extremes or mean precipitation in either the observational or the model analysis. Instead, most of the increase in likelihood of extreme fire weather is driven by heating. That's because more heat causes more evaporation which dries out soil and vegetation.
Cars with solar panels on them might seem like science fiction, but this year's CES has all manner of solar-powered gadgets. Solar Breeze, a company that sells a solar-powered pool cleaner, said it can barely keep up with demand since the pandemic began.
With recent temperatures reaching in the low 70s — 25 degrees above normal — flowers are starting to appear in New York's Central Park weeks early.
The crop devastation has prompted the United Nations to appeal for $76 million in aid to combat the swarms and prevent a humanitarian crisis. The UN has raised about $15 million so far.
The team's findings provide a method to separate the costs of the different variables — vital pieces of the puzzle for policy makers who must weigh the costs of action versus inaction. Armed with this understanding, they can use cost-benefit calculations to determine how, and how much, to invest in climate mitigation and adaptation.
According to a CBS News poll released Wednesday, 7 in 10 Americans don't think the issue of a border wall is worth a government shutdown, which they say is now having a negative impact on the country. But partisans don't want their own side to budge: 65 percent of Republicans say President Trump should refuse a budget unless it includes wall funding, and 69 percent of Democrats think congressional Democrats should keep refusing to fund it.
This all came after a tumultuous few months in South Korea's political climate. In December, then-president Park Gun-Hey was impeached amid a corruption scandal. Hundreds of thousands flooded the streets of Seoul, calling for her removal.
Along with a gradual building of cold air over the coming weeks in the East, the jet stream setup will provide many opportunities for snow storms. While many will not materialize, with a prolonged pattern favorable for extreme winter weather, odds are that pieces of the puzzle will come together for a couple of memorable winter storms.
Sadly, it is not a surprise to most climate scientists. We've seen this coming for literally decades and now it's upon us, said Gleick, I expect there will be new, hotter temperature records broken over and over again in the future along with increasingly severe droughts and floods, rising sea levels, and worsening fire risks. There's no 'normal' anymore. And still our politicians dither. It's sad and disturbing to me.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: --who accuse them--
Anderson Cooper: What do you mean?
Joe Biden has spent months making the case to Iowans, in person and in advertisements, that he's best suited to take on President Trump in a general election and restore the soul of the nation. In the days leading up to the caucuses, advertisements have emphasized Biden's poll numbers against Trump and stressed that this is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate.
The climate model portion of the study was also revealing. Using 11 large state-of-the-art climate models, the team calculated the current and future global heating impact.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No one asks how we're gonna pay for this Space Force. No one asked how we paid for a $2 trillion tax cut. We only ask how we pay for it on issues of housing, healthcare and education. How do we pay for it? With the same exact mechanisms that we pay for military increases for this Space Force. For all of these— ambitious policies.
End so-called Muslim ban on travel, which in 2017 restricted travel and immigration to the U.S. from Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen, before adding Eritrea, Nigeria, Myanmar, Kyrgyzstan, and Tanzania in 2020.
It has been widely understood by the climate science community that the hotter, drier conditions linked to climate change were a driver behind the extreme fire season. Now a new study released Wednesday by a group of leading scientists confirms those suspicions: Human-caused climate change did indeed make the fires in southeast Australia worse.
Biden has also highlighted his ability to withstand a barrage of attacks from Republicans, especially after some have questioned whether it was appropriate for his son Hunter to sit on the board of a Ukrainian energy company. They have thrown everything but the kitchen sink so far, Biden said in Iowa City on Monday. And I'm just gonna say it...I'm still standing and just getting stronger. Biden also ramped up his visits to Iowa in December and January while focusing more time on smaller and mid-sized communities.
Toto Bergamo Rossi: Now I think is like, how you call that kind of department (laugh) that they put you the mask and you are in (laugh)
We're continuing to build in areas in the urban-wildfire interface, and it's going to lead to damages to the larger economy, Nik Steinberg, head of analytics for Four Twenty Seven, a climate-change research group, recently told CBS MoneyWatch.
President Donald Trump's plan to focus on domestic issues and downplay foreign affairs has given Beijing an opening to try to play a bigger leadership role in trade, climate and other global issues.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN: I can just tell you, I don't know what he's basing this on, but he's faced so many lawsuits when he ignores the law and ignores tradition and precedent and just goes forward without any concern, he'll face challenge, I'm sure, if he's oversteps what the law requires when it comes to his responsibilities as commander-in-chief.
Earlier this week, the Times reported that Bolton had written in his book draft that the president had told him in August that he wanted to continue the pause in military aid to Ukraine until officials helped with investigations into Democrats including Biden.
Combined, the hurricane data from historical accounts, as well as tree ring data from actual Caribbean shipwrecks, revealed the same trend: a 75 percent drop in the number of hurricanes between 1707 and 1825. This was a period when few sunspots occurred, known as the Maunder Minimum. Without these sunspots, Earth received fewer rays of sunlight, leading to a cooler Northern Hemisphere, the researchers reported March 7 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

In his January essay for National Geographic magazine Why Birds Matter, and Are Worth Protecting, Franzen compares birds to humans, writing: They build intricate homes and raise families in them. They take long winter vacations in warm places. Cockatoos are shrewd thinkers, solving puzzles that would challenge a chimpanzee, and crows like to play.
I support the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment — just like right now, if you yelled 'fire,' that's not free speech, Biden continued. And from the very beginning — I have a shotgun, I have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge. My sons hunt. Guess what? You're not allowed to own any weapon. I'm not taking your gun away at all.
At a time when political polarization divides Americans on so many issues, these points of agreement may seem surprising. But agreement is not enough. For an energy transition to happen, policy and incentives are needed.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro (Translation): The frequency, it's like an earthquake. When there are too many, then it means something is happening. I see it as an opportunity to wake up the world.
The Departments of Homeland Security and Defense, as well as the U.S. Secret Service, are holding an all-senators briefing Tuesday on security for the inauguration, and thousands of National Guard members have been authorized ahead of the inauguration.
During this week's presidential election in South Korea, one of the nation's leading television networks came up with eye-popping visuals that used pop cultural references and images to connect with election night viewers, reports CBS News correspondent Don Dahler.
The report also notes that the decline in emissions came with an enormous toll of significant economic damage and human suffering.
MARGARET BRENNAN: How long will it take--
The insects grow in size extremely fast, but only live three to five months. Within that short lifespan, however, a locust population can explode if left unchecked. The swarms have grown so big that one spotted in Kenya contained about 200 billion individual locusts, occupying a space in the sky three times the size of New York City.

Diplomats have expressed concern that Beijing is promoting a vision of trading networks centered on great powers such as China, which would erode the rules-based system under the World Trade Organization in which all competitors are treated equally.
MARK LANDLER: And that's a very interesting question, because a number of the obvious candidates for the defense secretary job are actually people who went on record fairly strongly against President Trump's troop pullout. Lindsey Graham being an obvious example. Tom Cotton expressed reservations about it as well. So some of those top tier candidates don't appear to be on the same page. There are some other names that are being bandied about, but I am beginning to sense that maybe filling the defense secretary job will be a little bit like filling the chief of staff job was, which, if you recall, a lot of people turned it down, and Mick Mulvaney only agreed to do it on an acting basis. I wouldn't be surprised if Pat Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, is someone we see in that job for quite a few more months.
There would be no environmental problem if everything remained frozen, but we know the Earth is getting warmer, study author Paul Schuster, a hydrologist at the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado, said in a statement. This discovery is a game-changer.
While a record number of coal-fired power plants were retired last year, their energy production was mostly replaced by natural gas instead of renewable energy like wind or solar, according to a report by independent research provider Rhodium Group. The report estimates that in 2018 the U.S. posted the largest increase in heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions since 2010, up 3.4 percent.
It's possible to prevent power lines from sparking fires or power outages by putting them underground. But that option was found to be so expensive that a utility watchdog group said it was really not feasible, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.
Winslow told Whitaker why all those generators are still running.
And the relationship between Arctic warmth and severe winter weather was strongest in in the northeastern U.S. -- in fact, a temperature spike in the Arctic meant that the U.S. Northeast was two to four times more likely than usual to experience a bout of extreme winter weather, the scientists reported in a new study. [The 10 Worst Blizzards in U.S. History]
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: She absolutely is. And—
The president certainly didn't invent racism. But he's certainly given a voice to it and expanded it and created a platform for those things.
Minnis said it's his goal to make Ragged Island a green island.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --is indeed open to a DACA for wall trade here because he stood in the Rose Garden the other day and said no you've got to wait till the court rules and we're some time out from that.

As Dokoupil witnessed, a 2x4 aimed at a one-inch thick piece of plywood just bounced off.
MARGARET BRENNAN: What does that mean? I mean Americans hear this and they are concerned. There's about a two-percent fatality rate.
The contrast that is interesting to me is between a kind of fire and brimstone Christianity. 'You are damned unless you change your ways' which is kind of the climate conversation. And then, on the other hand, you have this older Catholic, particularly Franciscan, from St. Francis who was all about, hey, birds. I love the birds. I'm gonna write to the emperor and ask him to put grain out in the fields on Christmas Day to feed my friends the larks, Franzen said. His approach to the world was love, love, love, love, love. And I think for meaningful action of any kind, love is a much better motivator than fear of damnation.
The lockdown-related fall in emissions is just a tiny blip on the long-term graph, WMO president Petteri Taalas said. We need a sustained flattening of the curve.
In the sixth spot was a $200 million donation made by Arthur Blank, co-founder of Home Depot, through the Arthur M. Blank Family Foundation, to Children's health care of Atlanta to build a new hospital in his name.
Sea level rise is caused by warming of the ocean and melting from glaciers and ice sheets. The research, based on 25 years of satellite data, shows that pace has quickened, mainly from the melting of massive ice sheets. It confirms scientists' computer simulations and is in line with predictions from the United Nations, which releases regular climate change reports.
The first thing I would do is restore what's been lost — the integrity and the compassion of this country, Gillibrand said. If you want to get things done, you have to get people together.
It is, Minnis said. Because even though our contribution to climate change is minimal, it's miniscule to compare with First World nation, but we still have a responsibility.
ED O'KEEFE: And very little sleep.
This really seems to be an attempt by Wheeler to permanently let major polluters trample on public health, said Benjamin Levitan, a senior attorney with the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group. It ties the hands of future administrations in how they can protect the public health.
The senseless and prolonged shutdown is inflicting chaos across the country, she said, adding that mayors could feel the impact of the shutdown in their cities. I know as the daughter and sister of a mayor that there is no buffer between a mayor and constituents...you know the shutdown must end, and must end now.
Forecasters warned of frost bite and hypothermia in Chicago, where wind chills of minus 35 degrees were predicted. According to CBS Chicago, many homeowners are already facing the consequences of frozen or broken pipes due to bone-chilling temperatures.
The new measure of actual ocean heat matches almost perfectly the average projection from the best coupled ocean-atmosphere models (CMIP5). By this metric, the climate models are performing very well. It gives climate scientists and the public greater reason for confidence in future projections.
MARGARET BRENNAN: We'll talk with Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders about the race.
Rhodium Group reported that three of the leading sectors for greenhouse gas emissions — transportation, electric power, and industry — were also among the sectors hardest-hit by pandemic-related shutdowns. For example, with travel far less in demand during the pandemic, emissions from the transportation sector declined 14.7% between 2019 and 2020.
Officials have warned that the insects could increase 500-fold by June if not contained quickly, Patta said. If action isn't taken, the swarms could also migrate to other parts of Africa — and even beyond the continent.
The main power plant for this island is literally 25 miles south of here, Chris Burgess said. That's 25 miles of line that has to be rebuilt.
The Bahamian government spends nearly $400 million a year on imported fuel to keep its power plants running and passes that cost along to its citizens. They pay three to four times what people in the mainland U.S. pay for electricity.
Ocasio-Cortez is sworn in as a U.S. Congresswoman
DAN BALZ: Well, there-- there is certainly a lot of politics in this because we know that for-- for President Trump the wall has been central to his political message. And I know there are Democrats who believe that he will never make a deal because he wants the issue more than he wants the wall, if you will. And so that's part of the hump that you have to get over in these negotiations. But with the government shutdown, there's going to have to be solution at some point. I mean, this can't go on indefinitely. President talked about this could go on for months or even years. It's not going to go on for years, we're-- we're confident of that. But the question is, how long each side is prepared to hold out? And I think what we'll-- what we'll get to, at some point, I don't-- don't know when is, there will be enough, you know, if you will, pain and suffering and complaints and issues that pop up as a result of the hardships caused by government being shut down that will eventually force a solution.
Mayor Luigi Brugnaro (Translation): Yes, of course. Yes, these are the effects of climate change.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: No. Because I think he's a symptom of a problem.
Seeing really is believing, Gritzo responded.
Take the LP's soulful fourth track, You Don't Do It For Me Anymore, for example.
If the American people are to be regulated by interpretation of these scientific studies, they deserve to scrutinize the data as part of the scientific process and American self-government, Wheeler wrote.
In February, the Chronicle will publish its list of the 50 biggest donors, which counts cumulative donations, not individual gifts.
The lesson here is, tested, installed and maintained protection works effectively, Gritzo replied. One sprinkler, he said, would reduce a fire to a distraction, rather than a disaster.
The initiatives include around a dozen of executive actions he can enact alone as president on the first day in office, January 20. Here are a few of the highlights:
FACE THE NATION will be back in one minute. Stay with us.
The former vice president was touring an assembly plant under construction for Fiat Chrysler, shaking hands with and praising the electrical workers union members who are building the plant. As Biden was working the room, one man confronted him about his stance on gun ownership.
With sustained winds of 185 miles per hour, gusts above 200, and a storm surge well over 20 feet in some spots,Dorian wreaked unimaginable havoc on the Bahamian islands known as the Abacos.
Read O'Donnell's interview with Sanders below.
Sanders: How am I doin'? I think the last CNN poll had me seven points ahead of Trump. I think we are the strongest-- campaign to defeat Trump, and I will tell you why. To defeat Donald Trump, you're gonna need an incredibly large voter turnout. I think our campaign is the campaign of energy, of excitement that can reach out to young people, reach out to working-class people who today are sick and tired of a government and an economy that works for the people on top and ignores them.
The research done at FM Global Research's 1,600-acre campus in northwestern Rhode Island is passed along to businesses so they and the communities they serve can bounce back faster after a disaster strikes.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb will both be here.
Michael Oppenheimer is a professor of geosciences at Princeton University. He was a lead author of a landmark report for the United Nations on climate change that found coastal cities are increasingly at risk from sea level rise.
Sanders: Democratic, put in there, please.
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Well, I had lunch with the President last week and I came away a bit encourage. There are three things that we want to accomplish as part of a withdrawal. We want to make sure that when we leave the Kurds do not get slaughtered. And I don't trust Turkey to take care of the Kurds. It'd be like Putin trying to police Assad. That didn't work well. We need a plan to protect the Kurds from Turkey and others. We need to make sure ISIS doesn't come back once they're defeated and Iran is not the biggest winner. If you can accomplish those three objectives by reducing our forces, which I think we can, then count me in. But those three things have to be--
The idea is to spray the locusts aerially while they're still young, and before the population booms.
For almost two years, Joe Biden has been telling Americans what he plans to do on his first day in office — and the next 99 — if elected to be the nation's 46th president.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Mister Secretary, thank you for your time.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: There's an element where— yeah. There— people are going to have to start paying their fair share in taxes.
Schumer detailed the issues the Senate will take up in a letter to his Democratic colleagues, which include legislation to address climate change, improve the health care and child care systems, and fix income inequality. The New York Democrat also said the Senate will also pursue immigration, democracy and criminal justice reforms.
So far, Khanna and Ocasio-Cortez are the only Democrats to announce opposition to the package. Other notable provisions include reviving the Gephardt rule, which automatically raises the debt ceiling when the House passes a budget. Members would be required to have additional ethics training, and would be prohibited from serving on corporate boards. One provision would also amend the rule against wearing hats on the House floor to have religious exceptions, so that incoming Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, may wear her headscarf.
Most of California's reservoirs are at or slightly above their historical average for this time of year, but experts expect that to fall when water is released in the spring and summer and not enough melting snow can replenish it.
For Nicklen and Mittermeier, that perspective makes life richer and makes the job worth every moment.
The most dramatic effect of warmer water is the impact we already feel most directly: extreme weather. A warmer ocean means stronger hurricanes and heavier flooding events.
Scientifically, [six] would be a better description of the strength of 200 mph (320km/h) storms, and it would also better communicate the well-established finding now that climate change is making the strongest storms even stronger, he said.
SENATOR DICK DURBIN (Minority Whip/@SenatorDurbin/D-Illinois): Well, I can tell you, first, there's no requirement that this government be shut down while we deliberate-- deliberate the future of any barrier whether it's a fence or a wall. This is the first President in history who shut down his own government. Unfortunately, there are going to be people who suffer. Look at those at the airport who were carefully-- going through-- the passengers to make sure that they're safe on airplanes. As of next Friday, they'll miss a payday that may mean some problems for mortgage payments, problems and balancing the budget of their own families and households. This is totally unnecessary. And that's a point we've made over and over to this President, let's have this debate on the future of any barrier wall or border security but not at the expense of critical services for America.
It's not just the caucus arrangement that keeps Iowa a fluid race, it's the voters, too: just over a third of those expressing a candidate choice say they've definitely made up their minds. Sanders has the most solidly committed supporters, and this has been true in recent weeks: 48% say they've definitely made up their minds. That's higher than Biden's 27% definite supporters, which is a potential vulnerability for Biden in the final stretch. Another is that his supporters are relatively less enthusiastic than those of other top candidates; fewer than half are.
The SSW that is happening right now is in fact characterized as a major event. Since late December temperatures have increased from around minus-110 degrees Fahrenheit to minus-10 degrees — a jump of 100 degrees — at a height of 100,000 feet above the North Pole.
Demi Lovato may only be 25, but she's already overcome a lifetime of obstacles. She's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. She's beaten addiction. She's in recovery from an eating disorder. And now, she's hitting the road with a powerful new album about growing up and learning to love yourself.
These support levels would translate into a substantial delegate lead for Sanders. We estimate that his current support in California would yield nearly half of the state's massive delegate prize, with Biden and Elizabeth Warren splitting the rest. In Texas, voters' current intentions translate into a narrower delegate lead for Sanders over Biden, with Warren trailing them. And Mike Bloomberg, who is just under the 15% delegate threshold statewide, is in position to pick up delegates in specific districts, as many as a few dozen in his better simulations.
Environmental groups have reason to be wary. According to Morningstar, BlackRock was one of the least likely among mutual fund firms to support shareholder resolutions at the companies it had invested in.
The effects of what WHO called vaccine hesitancy are already significant. For example, cases of measles have surged 30 percent worldwide in recent years, despite an effective vaccine that can prevent it. WHO noted that some countries that were close to eliminating the disease have seen a resurgence.
SHANNON PETTYPIECE: He-- he did what he said. And they feel like that's a strong hand to run on.
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: I don't think it's inevitable. It probably will. It possibly will.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Your campaign said that if you are the nominee, you won't accept the financial help that Michael Bloomberg has offered. He said he'd extend it to any party nominee. Do you really want to turn down his bankroll?
California faced its deadliest wildfire season this past year, with the Camp Fire and the Woolsey Fire destroying thousands of homes and burning through hundreds of thousands of acres. Mr. Trump visited California in November to tour the devastation with then-Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom, during which he promised that the federal government would continue to support the state in the face of these deadly wildfires.
There's no guarantee that PG&E's bankruptcy -- which would be one of the biggest by a U.S. company --will lead to the desired result. What's almost certain, however, is that the nearly $30 billion in damages PG&E potentially faces would be dramatically reduced in bankruptcy.
Winter of 2019-20 (DJF) was not much of a winter as far as snowfall across the majority of the CONUS. There were some exceptions, but the rule was well below normal snowfall in many areas. pic.twitter.com/fKUqdJ1pGM — Greg Carbin (@GCarbin) March 12, 2020
MIKE POMPEO: The public document was released yesterday. There are two implementing elements that will be provided. They are secret. They are military implementation documents that are important to protect our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. Every member of Congress will get a chance to see them. They are classified, secret. There aren't any side deals. Remember, the side deals I was complaining about were deals that the American side--
California Rep. Ro Khanna was the first Democrat to announce his opposition to the rules package based on the PAYGO provision Wednesday.
So, for at least the next few weeks, if you live in the eastern half of the nation, prepare for real winter weather and the possibility of snow.
ED O'KEEFE: This is Biden. And Biden said in response to her, what's her name? Give me her number. He had an aide get her phone number. The next day he called this woman's mother and they talked for about ten minutes and he asked, so you think I should run? Yes, absolutely, you should, and if you do I will volunteer for you. And he asked her all these reasons why. That happens. And they're all doing this. It's got to be tremendous for their ego. But whether or not it actually results in them running and taking the plunge, you know, is another matter because they have to factor in, can I stand up against somebody like Elizabeth Warren--

The researchers are currently working on a follow-up study modeling the release of permafrost due to climate change, according to the statement.
We must remember that as long we do not treat this crisis as a crisis, and as long as facts and science are being left completely ignored, then we will not be able to solve this crisis, she said. Before we came here, we had a few demands for this WEF and of course, those demands have been completely ignored. We expected nothing less.
People think it's a breakup song, explains Lovato, but it's actually kind of a breakup song with myself and my bad habits.
The Environmental Protection Agency has completed one of its last major rollbacks under the Trump administration, changing how it considers evidence of harm from pollutants in a way that opponents say could cripple future public-health regulation.
MARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Well, we'll-- we'll gear up for that with both of you. Thank you.
There is serious and justified concern that the president will shut down the government any time he doesn't get his way, Pelosi said, explaining why it was important to hold firm. To the Republican mayors in the room, Pelosi said that she urged them to take back their party from Mr. Trump.
Scientists from NASA and NOAA held a briefing Thursday afternoon to discuss the latest findings about Earth's escalating fever.
REPRESENTATIVE MAX ROSE: But if I could just have one important thing. It's obvious that election season's starting again. But what we can't do is campaign in the halls of Congress. When it comes to things like infrastructure and reducing health care costs, we can't say Oh, I don't want to give this President a win because it might improve his chances in 2020.
CBS News: Is coronavirus less likely to spread at warmer temperatures, and will spring or summer slow the spread of the disease?
So if a storm like Dorian hits again, the power to these two critical facilities stays on? Whitaker asked.
MARGARET BRENNAN: It makes for some exciting political watching on Tuesday.
MARK LANDLER: --with his own President. President Trump just a few minutes ago on his way to Camp David repeated what he has said over and over again, the troops are going to come out of Syria soon. That's a very different message than what John Bolton had in Israel a few hours earlier. Some of the caveats that he put in place, namely the one that we would not pull out our troops if there was any threat that the Turks would go after our Kurdish allies, that is by all accounts a standard that cannot be met at all in the short term, I think a lot of people in the Pentagon are skeptical the Turks can ever be relied on not to go after the Kurds. So I think that we're-- we're really in a very-- a-- a moment of-- of deep confusion about where this policy goes. But I have to say, it is in keeping with what we've seen from President Trump on troop deployment and withdrawal issues almost from the beginning of his presidency. He will say something dramatic, indicate a desire to termination to pull out and then as the machinery of the national security--
Dr. Noah Diffenbaugh, co-author of the research and professor of Earth System Science at Stanford University, says obtaining this quantification was the motivation for this study. There has been a lot of research about the impacts of climate change on different natural and human systems, but relatively little of that has focused on generating hard numbers quantifying the financial costs of those impacts, Diffenbaugh said. This study provides those numbers for flooding, which is one of the most costly natural disasters.
Streets ran like rivers, squares became swimming pools, it was Venice's second-highest tide ever recorded, more than six feet above sea level, wind from a storm barreling up the Adriatic Sea accelerated from 6 miles an hour to 70 in less than 15 minutes. When the surge was over, the destruction totaled a billion dollars.
In the United States, approximately 100,000 young children have not been vaccinated against any of the 14 potentially serious diseases for which vaccines are recommended, according to a report released last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most American children are routinely vaccinated, the number who have received no vaccines by the age of 2 is slowly creeping up.
The study also lays to rest a long-standing discrepancy in the climate science community, namely the question of why climate models over-project ocean heating. According to this new study, it turns out they don't.
Folks are spending more time around their swimming pool due to isolation, and so our rate of customer inquiries have doubled, the company writes on on its site.
ANDERSON COOPER (60 MINUTES): You're willing to compromise?
O'Donnell: Don't you think it's important business?
This lull in hurricanes, which occurred during the 18th and 19th centuries, may have been partly caused by a drop in sunspot activity, which reduced the solar radiation reaching the Earth, the researchers found.
Anderson Cooper: There are people that say that you don't understand how the game is played.
The warmth has been even more astonishing in Europe. According to the Copernicus Climate Change Service, Europe just experienced its warmest winter on record by far — 6 degrees Fahrenheit above normal — shattering the old record by 2.5 degrees Fahrenheit.
In most cases the SSW propagates down through the clouds to the Earth's surface over the course of a few weeks. When this happens it throws the Arctic upper-level wind patterns off-kilter and the domino effect leads to convoluted jet stream patterns around the world in the mid-latitudes like Canada, the U.S., Europe and Asia. That means it will almost certainly result in some extreme winter weather, and given the expected pattern in the U.S., that will most likely happen along the East Coast.
He ended up spending a stunning $570 million on total advertising over the course of his candidacy, amounting to $18 million per delegate he ultimately won.
MARGARET BRENNAN: If-- if-- you just finished your own campaigns, I know you're sort of, wow.
But by September 2020, the WMO was already reporting a rise back to nearly pre-pandemic levels.
That ties 2011 for the number of billion-dollar disasters, but the total cost blew past the previous record of $215 billion in 2005.
Ahead of President Obama's last State of the Union address, Republicans are once again blasting what the White House considers a key accomplishment of the president's foreign policy legacy: the Iran nuclear deal. And this time, they're warning that the international agreement could take down the U.S. oil industry.
Party rules make 15% the typical cutoff for awarding delegates, and supporters can shift to other candidates if they don't reach this threshold. So, it's critical to look at voters' second choices and who else they're considering, too.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: Well, let me say, I'm from Texas. We have fencing in place, there is a significant amount of fencing, in fact, in place and there is a big difference between wasting money on something that maybe will be just a campaign promise versus something that will actually get the job done. Fencing in certain places is absolutely appropriate and we do have that.
Vovan and Lexus have made high-level prank calls before, releasing audio of purported conversations with U.S. presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, as well as singer Elton John.
For the U.S. the trends are clear: Cohen's research shows a direct connection between intense warming events in the Arctic and more episodes of extreme winter weather in the eastern U.S.
The reasons why some people choose not to vaccinate are complex, WHO said, citing complacency, inconvenience in accessing vaccines, and lack of confidence as the main factors. Even though decades of medical research has proven vaccines are both safe and effective, skeptics continue to spread misinformation online.
MARGARET BRENNAN: And that would mean we wouldn't get to hear congressional hearings and on the record an explanation to the American people. More to talk about on the other side of this commercial break.
Dr. Shaman: Without a doubt. You see evidence of this when you put people in isolation or quarantine you can slow the spread of virus because the virus thrives on contact. And if people are running into each other because they are on subways, buses, in stores and banks — in the urban environment you have hundreds of contacts per day — then the virus will spread faster. In the winter people tend to be in closer quarters.
It's failing 98 percent of the time, being miserable most of the time, and being patient. Believing in yourself, believing in the process and chasing that story, Nicklen said. And that makes it rewarding.
Anderson Cooper: And you're occupying her office.

Michael Oppenheimer: The rest of the world should take the message that this is what the situation's gonna look like in many places that they live in. Venice is just, you know, as everybody says, the canary in the coal mine. It's happening there now.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: What makes it unrealistic?
CBS News: Do you know of any ongoing or proposed research on this that would be helpful in determining the impact of climate on the coronavirus?
Anderson Cooper: There are Democrats, obviously, who are worried about your affect on the party. Democratic Senator Chris Coons, said about left-leaning Democrats, If the next two years is just a race to offer increasingly unrealistic proposals, it'll be difficult for us to make a credible case we should be allowed to govern again.
Anderson Cooper: Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful.
NEW YORK — A group of over two dozen curators at the American Museum of Natural History have objected to a museum trustee who is a donor to groups that challenge climate change.
MIKE POMPEO: There are no annexes that the members of Congress won't have a chance to see--
SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM: Yeah. They're being held hostage. They're being held hostage by people who say you need one dollar to secure the border. They're being held hostage by people--
ALEX AZAR: They might make projections of numbers themselves, but we are not. We'll take aggressive public health measures. It's what we call community mitigation steps. So depending on the nature of the disease and depending on what we learn from these in the field investigations--
You just know that they have been watching the same place, the same tide, the same sea ice form for hundreds of years and so they know things that even the best scientists don't know, she said.
Three months ago, I entered the race for President to defeat Donald Trump. Today, I am leaving the race for the same reason: to defeat Donald Trump — because it is clear to me that staying in would make achieving that goal more difficult, he said. I'm a believer in using data to inform decisions. After yesterday's results, the delegate math has become virtually impossible — and a viable path to the nomination no longer exists.
SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS: Well, two points. I am a member of the Democratic leadership. I have been in the Democratic caucus from my, you know, virtually my first day back in Congress thirty years ago and from-- in the state of Vermont, where I live, I am supported by Democrats that have won the Democratic primary. But we will win because we have an agenda that speaks to independents, to Democrats, and to more than a few Republicans. Look, we are living at a time when the American people are sick and tired of the kind of income and wealth inequality that exists in America. All over this country, Margaret, and I have been all over this country, you got millions of people who work eleven, twelve bucks an hour. They can't afford childcare.
JOE BIDEN: We are very much alive.
Hope Town is a Bahamian landmark. Its candy-striped lighthouse dates to 1863 and is pictured on the country's ten-dollar bill. The lighthouse stood up to Dorian, but as we saw coming into the harbor, not much else did.
📢February #temperature highlights from #Copernicus #C3S: 🌡️Last month was the second warmest February in our record, globally and for Europe
The broader point I was trying to make is that unlike in the case of surface temperature, ocean heat content has increased fairly smoothly, with no decadal-scale slowdowns or hiatuses. You can see this clearly in the Cheng et al data, for example: pic.twitter.com/lFfULK4qcU — Zeke Hausfather (@hausfath) January 10, 2019
It would be so very sad for our Country if the State of the Union were not delivered on time, on schedule, and very importantly, on location! Mr. Trump said.
A federal appeals court last Friday dismissed a landmark climate change lawsuit brought by 21 young Americans against the federal government. Two of the three judges on the Ninth Circuit panel argued that the courts are not the place to resolve the climate crisis.
Does this make the change to renewable energy that much more important, imperative, urgent for you here in the Bahamas? Whitaker asked.
MARGARET BRENNAN: --she suggested wouldn't accept a deal like this, that you raised concerns about secret side deals that the Obama administration had cut with Iran--
Watch how the stratospheric polar vortex evolves from a strong symmetrical system in December to a disturbed version now as significant warming invades the Arctic in a Sudden Stratospheric Warming event. This disruption will likely have implications in the mid lats for weeks. https://t.co/8yOL4GH4IJ — Jeff Berardelli (@WeatherProf) January 5, 2021
Alternatively, candidates can qualify based on pledged delegates. Those delegates will be awarded based on the results of the Iowa caucuses on February 3 as calculated and reported by the Iowa Democratic Party or the New Hampshire primary on February 11 as calculated and reported by the Associated Press.
Unlike the tour she's kicking off at the end of the month with DJ Khaled, Lovato says these special cardholder shows are not huge productions, but rather showcases in smaller venues where she can be closer to her fans.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Anthony, does he have the enthusiasm that you say Sanders' supporters have?
MARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you on foreign policy. The President just authorized a deal with the Taliban. What do you think of that? Because if you're commander in chief, you'd either follow through with it or halt the withdrawal of U.S. troops.
While the emissions decline was welcomed, the trend is not expected to last. Unfortunately, 2020 tells us little about what we can expect to see in 2021 and beyond, the report says.
MARGARET BRENNAN: Congressman, this week, not only a new week in Congress but also the beginning it seems of the 2020 presidential campaign season-- I know, get ready.
REPRESENTATIVE COLIN ALLRED: It's absolutely premature. This is way too early to be talking about this. We need to let the investigation run its course. And I just think that it's-- it's also something that can be used as a partisan lightning rod that we need to try to avoid.
MARGARET BRENNAN: So we just had the first American death on U.S. soil out in Washington State. What do we know about how the virus was contracted and how much it has spread?
