in response, commenters were out for the count on who exactly was in the wrong for the formatting fiasco.
trump: well, i think it's ridiculous. she should have sent them a long time ago. it just - it belittles the process. what they've done to impeachment. it's like i was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter somebody that you know very well. i can say bob woodward. he said, he's doing something and this time, i said maybe i'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. i mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. our military was totally depleted. our military was old and depleted. and he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered nixon and he covered clinton. but bob woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. i said, i am happy. so maybe i'm wired a little bit different.

well, in the democrats' case, if you built it with these goofballs, the people will run. but it wasn't so much the candidates' talent or skill set that excited the resistance media that was covering all of this. it was what the field collectively represented.
bernanke's victory was bad enough, but the other finalists were even worse. he was up against — i'm not kidding: usain bolt (he runs faster than most people); gen. stanley mccrystal (who was ignored by barack obama); nancy pelosi; steve jobs and — my favorite finalist — the chinese worker. which one? the one that dipped our toys in lead paint or the one that poisoned our dog food?
the answer used to be obvious. the overriding goal for america is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. but is that still true? does anyone still believe that cheaper iphones, or more amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from china are going to make us happy? they haven't so far. a lot of americans are drowning in stuff. and yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in gdp is an idiot.

at least 3 million people have already cast early votes in the georgia runoff elections, in what has been a 2-month sprint that will likely determine which party gets the majority in the u.s. senate.
jim antle: right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. and so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in afghanistan and syria, and the vast majority of republican senators voted to rebuke him. and in the case of syria, we're talking about a war that congress never voted to authorize in the first place. well, here we are in iraq, and we have most republican senators saying that they don't want congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. i think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of cold war 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped trump win in 2016.
wallace: so what to expect? do you -- i mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?
of course, that is not the only tactic democrats might use to expand their grip on the country. other ambitions include stacking the supreme court, welcoming reliably blue puerto rico and washington, d.c., as states, and abolishing the electoral college. these attempts to profoundly change our nation could only succeed if the democrats win control of the senate.

chris van hollen: my point, chris, is we're now headed very close to the precipice of war. you just heard the president this morning talk about targeting iranian sites, including cultural sites, which is, in fact, a war crime if the president was to carry that out. the point we're making is that the president is not entitled under the constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action. that's what the constitution requires. look, i heard secretary pompeo talk about this. you asked him about the maximum pressure strategy. they've not accomplished any of their goals. they had very unrealistic goals. all they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with iran, something president trump said he wanted to avoid, but a lot of people around him, like secretary pompeo, have been urging a confrontation with iran for a very long time, including when he was a member of congress.

it was just a few months ago that nancy pelosi said impeachment must be bipartisan. no republicans supported it. and then she rammed through articles of impeachment in the house with the support of only democrats.
sen. cornyn: well, i think it's irresponsible and i think it defies reality. i mean, the truth is it's the democrats who are trying to change the subject and trying to create a further circus like atmosphere here in the senate because of their lack of success in dealing with this impeachment matter in the house. this is obviously a totally separate matter. i respect people what democrats like joe lieberman and jay johnson, who both said in recent days that this is well within the president's authority and a necessary act. and i also respect great leaders like ryan crocker, who today i think is in the new york times, wrote a piece about why this was within the president's authority, why it was necessary. and it was a former cia director and centcom commander, david petraeus, who made the point that this is more significant in terms of our fight against radical islam than was the death of osama bin laden. so this was a a very big deal. and i think the president is to be commended for his decisive action in the face of a real threat.

social conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. the real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the american family is collapsing. nothing can be fixed before we fix that. yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. the idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. they refuse to consider it. questioning markets feels like apostasy.

j.d. vance: well, tucker, i'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. i mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly i actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed china to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of china's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so i do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the american national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and i think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.

donna edwards: well, what i'm saying to you is that i think among the options, the range of options, that the president has, the question is, do you take one and i believe they did in taking the action in killing soleimani that actually, you know, the downstream puts us in a much more difficult position and i don't -- and i think right now, it's not really clear to me that just like pulling out of the iran deal, that this administration has said -- has mapped out what the end game is, what's the next part of this strategy.

michael anton: i don't know that i necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. you could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you've talked about earlier in the program that iran has been doing without much of a response. so the main point i would want to make here is the iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation, and when they finally do get pushback, they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again. we've seen that happen in the past. they haven't faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the iran deal all around the middle east, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they, i think, got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that soleimani went right into iran and the airport -- sorry, into iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him. so, i think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.

sen. bernie sanders (d-vt), presidential candidate: just as we were led into vietnam and iraq by lies, the trump administration is misleading us on iran. they just did the assassination of qasem soleimani by claiming that he was planning imminent attacks and yet they produce no evidence that would justify this claim, not even in a classified setting.

clearly, coverage of the capitol-storming had to be characterized as it was, an unacceptable and dangerous event. it is difficult to fully compare the social unrest of last summer to the washington chaos of yesterday. last summer's events were sparked by different circumstances and were more socially, culturally based. yesterday's chaos was sparked by more specific political motivations, mccall told fox news.

in 2010, for example, mitt romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. he paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. for normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. no wonder mitt romney supports the status quo. but for everyone else, it's infuriating.

we should follow that precedent, the group said in a statement. to wit, congress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.

there was a very interesting moment on friday because president trump came out to the rose garden after his meeting with nancy pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on democrats who want to impeach.

jarrett: the prosecutors in the house had a chance to subpoena people like bolton or mick mulvaney or rudy giuliani. they didn't do it. the one subpoena they issued, they withdrew and now all of a sudden, nancy pelosi is trying to engage in a quid pro quo to extort the senate to do the job that the house was supposed to do. at the same time accusing the president of an impeachable quid pro quo. the hypocrisy and irony is, lost on no one.

i think your history comment for [friday] is a bit off or at least does not tell the whole story. the 44 colt model of 1847 was a collaboration of sam walker and colt in 1846-47. walker was with the texas rangers at the time and wanted a more powerful weapon for the mexican-american war. the 1000 us military orders were for the state of texas military is my understanding. the 44 walker was the most powerful handgun until the 357 magnum came along in 1935. they were called 'horse pistols' as they commonly were carried on the pommel of the saddle. these were powerful, accurate repeating weapons. sam walker carried two at the time of his death. military walkers are stamped with the us and 1847 on the left side of the revolver. original walkers are exceptionally expensive. beat up ones might set you back 40 to 60 thousand dollars while the few really nice ones that are properly authenticated go for nearly a million. i attached a few pictures of me shooting my replica. they are fun guns to shoot and it teaches you a lot about patience as it takes a while to load up the black powder (pyrodex replica in my case) and it is quite powerful. my targets are not the best in the world but certainly show that the revolver could be quite accurate at 25 yards.

warren brings more experience in the senate to the table that some of the other top-tier candidates who are flirting with the idea of getting into the race. but she has also faced criticism from the right and the left for the handling of her claims of native american ancestry -- particularly her release in october of dna test results that showed only a trace amount of native american heritage.
republicans in the house of representatives have begun putting pressure on republicans in the upper chamber of congress to object to election results in at least three states in an effort to impact the outcome of the presidential race – which was called, in november, in favor of president-elect joe biden.
wallace: and then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on super tuesday you face another centrist candidate in mayor mike bloomberg. and over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as i discussed with kellyanne conway, a big story in the washington post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.
ukrainian foreign minister: it's all over ukrainian media as well today and yesterday, and strangely enough, my name was not mentioned although i'm minister of foreign affairs. and, frankly, i never spoke with this individual. again, i don't -- i don't trust any word he is now saying.

in other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 american households. and if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. since 1978 ceo salaries in america's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. in 1965, ceos in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. as recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. no wonder people are sending money to bernie sanders. that's what happens when you abuse the system. you discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. in europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. airbus ceo tom enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. that's a lot, but it was half as much as boeing's dennis muilenburg made, and airbus planes didn't even crash. this is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. it's dangerous for our country. why? well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like dennis muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. attitudes are changing fast.
and i wrap my fingers around that nativity in my hand.
the president framed his new pitch for a steel wall as a concession to democrats to move negotiations along, as the shutdown entered its 16th day. meanwhile, democrats published the full text of several spending bills to reopen the government on sunday that the white house and senate republicans have long said have no chance of becoming law because they do not include any funding for a wall of any kind.
ingraham: so you live by the racial litmus test, you die by the racial litmus test. instead of focusing on who the best candidate is, whatever color or gender, background, democrats obsess on immutable characteristics. and they should never be the basis for promotions or jobs or political losses, not immutable characteristics, no. ever heard of merit or experience or political talent?

'it's not going to be just apple,' cea chairman kevin hassett said in an interview on cnn. 'there are a heck of a lot of u.s. companies that have sales in china that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with china.' hassett argued that a softer economy in china is cutting into u.s. companies' sales there and that the economic pain gives trump leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. 'that puts a lot of pressure on china to make a deal,' he said.

unlike what was called for by a failed lawsuit from rep. louie gohmert, r-texas, the suggestion here is not to simply overturn the election results outright and award a second term to president trump, but rather to have an independent investigation of those states' elections. while out of the ordinary, it would not be the first time for such a process, as it is what happened following the 1876 election, allowing rutherford b. hayes to become president.

actually, we do know what could happen, because it's happening right now. it's happened in countless other countries over countless centuries. and the cycle is always the same because human nature never changes.

this is why they keep throwing up smoke. and i want to tell these five republicans of the senate, the weak links in the chain -- romney, collins, murkowski, gardner, and the other one skips my mind, luckily, alexander.
conventional wisdom holds that republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. yes, george w. bush and ronald reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. of the 15 democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, franklin roosevelt and woodrow wilson, were former governors.
the federal minimum wage rate has remained at $7.25 per hour for the past decade, though 29 states and washington have set it higher.

kraushaar: warren, booker already making rookie mistakes - national journal: as the first leading contender to announce her intent to run for president, elizabeth warren has drawn ample scrutiny over her decisions. from publicizing the results of a much-mocked dna test showing a trace of native american ancestry to announcing her candidacy before the new year when few were paying attention, there's plenty to second-guess. but more consequential than these tactical decisions is the big-picture strategy that a candidate adopts. and warren, in the run-up to her announcement, has concluded that she can't deviate from an agenda embraced by the party's progressive activists. when moderates (and conservative democrats) make up over half of the democratic electorate, and in a prospective field filled with progressive candidates, such down-the-line liberal orthodoxy threatens to be a major political blunder.
house democratic caucus chairman rep. hakeem jeffries, d-n.y., defended his party's proposed new house rules for the 117th congress, specifically addressing new language that would replace gendered terms with more general ones.

which republicans might run against trump in 2020? too soon to say - washex: renegade republicans intent on upending president trump in 2020 are keeping their powder dry, waiting to see if legal and political controversies drive him from office first. …republicans who oppose trump's re-election are eyeing june as the approximate moment for deciding on a primary challenge or independent bid. it's a strategic delay. some republicans think the weight of multiple investigations could motivate the president to exit the white house after one term — especially if special counsel robert mueller issues a politically damaging report. … the republicans most often listed as possible trump challengers are outgoing ohio gov. john kasich, who ran in 2016; sen. ben sasse of nebraska, who is up for re-election next year; sen. mitt romney of utah … maryland gov. larry hogan; and former sens. bob corker of tennessee and jeff flake of arizona, who sources say are unlikely to run.

first, comey's tweets and comments reveal that he despised trump, and so the self-serving memos he was making and then leaking about his every contact with the president were likely part of an effort to build a case against trump. we learned that the fbi was wiretapping a number of trump campaign officials largely on the basis of the steele dossier. we learned that the dossier was authored by an operative who hated trump and paid for by the democratic national committee and the hillary clinton campaign via hidden payments to their law firm. and we learned that comey sent fbi agents to question general michael flynn about perfectly legal conversations they already had transcripts of, without following white house protocol, in a deliberate effort to entrap him.

it just really sucks because no one ever held him accountable, and he kept pushing and pushing and seeing how much he could get away with, the woman said. this can't happen in 2020. you can't run for president of the united states unless you acknowledge that every campaign demands a safe work environment for every employee and volunteer.

i just constantly tell myself that i should be the only one to define my worth and what i'm capable of, and how i perceive myself. and that i should never source that worth from other people, especially strangers on social media. they don't know who i am, the length of my journey, who i am as a person. so why should i let their words define me? or allow me to change how i view myself, or to think negatively about myself. i just tell myself that i know my worth, i know my capability, and that's what really drives me.
at one point, goldberg compared trump to former president bill clinton. one president followed the law and did what he was supposed to do. we have a president now who's blocking people from doing stuff, she said, apparently referring to the administration opposing new witnesses.

thanks for your comments on the current 'emergency,' but i think that your analysis is a bit off. while it may seem true that '[d]emocracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason,' in fact, as the end of the roman republic shows, such a tendency occurs when the legislative body (e.g., the senate) abdicates its power—which it need not do. today, we see our legislative branch interested in everything except legislating—which activity the executive and judicial branches are happy to take up. puzzling and heartbreaking. – jim voelz, fort wayne, ind.

the democratic investigations and impeachment mantras are starting up. depending upon what is in his tax returns, trump will release them and laugh or fight it all the way to the supreme court. most of the congressional subpoenas will be ignored and slow-walked. no doubt an impeachment would be a crowd pleaser for the democratic base and trump could face some manic days with the release of the mueller report, just as bill clinton faced tough days after ken starr released his report. but absent something dramatic and new, trump acquitted is the likely headline out a senate trial, so democrats will think twice about going down this road. censure might be a logical way out, but i'm not sure logic will prevail.

the president said a wall would be virtually a hundred percent effective and [house speaker] nancy [pelosi] and [senate democratic leader] chuck [schumer] know that, but it's politics. it's about the 2020 campaign, it's about running for president. that's what they're doing. they're already doing it. it's a shame. they've got to put the country first.

the cars have base prices of $76,000 and $82,000, respectively, while the next-up 100 kwh versions cost $94,000 and $97,000, respectively. the added cost primarily brings a longer range between charges and a small performance bump. the move creates more space between the model s and smaller model 3, the most expensive version of which starts at $62,000.

now, let's review some of the actions of the fbi director. many of these actions were clear at the time; others we know only now. what we have learned since underscores that the president's firing of comey was more than justified, and the actions of comey's staff and the department of justice (doj) to trigger the most extensive investigation in history of a campaign, an administration and a president appear to be wholly without justification – and were based instead on politically inspired emotion and hysteria.

georgia's senate runoff contests were viewed by left and right as critical to the future direction of the country. republicans see democrat control of the senate possibly leading to fundamental and damaging changes in our nation. given the chance, democrats may push to change the electoral college, pack the supreme court, allow puerto rico and washington d.c. to become states and other measures that would guarantee one-party rule and pave a progressive pathway to the future.

by contrast, president obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. he is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. this is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. his expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. and it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.
in the meantime, everyone needs to remember our national motto of e pluribus unum, which means out of many, one. it's a fancy way of saying there's room for all of us so chill out.

this brings us to the electoral count act of 1887. congress approved the electoral count act after an epic battle from the disputed election of 1876 between president rutherford b. hayes (the ultimate winner) and his vanquished opponent samuel tilden. more on that later. but the electoral count act -- alongside the 12th amendment -- sets the ground rules for how congress operates during the joint session of congress to certify the winner of the electoral college.

obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. but we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. and it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.

instead, they warmed to warnock's alarms about police brutality and promises of criminal justice reform. warnock hewed closely to the platform of president-elect joe biden, with vague promises about investing in infrastructure, investing in climate and in education; if voters wonder where the money will come from to fund these initiatives, a visit to his campaign website will not satisfy their curiosity. there is, understandably, no mention of taxes.
the president, in sober tones, said nothing about declaring a national emergency, focusing instead on how migrant children are used as human pawns and how drugs and criminals are pouring across the border. he also made the economic case, saying illegal immigrants drive down wages, especially for blacks and hispanics. and he declared that the federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only — that the democrats refuse to provide $5.7 billion for border security.

these senators argue that in 1877, there were disputed electors from florida, louisiana, south carolina and oregon. congress then created an electoral commission to determine how to parse out the electoral votes from these states. congress would ultimately vote on those results. in those days, the electoral college was smaller. the electoral commission awarded all contested electoral votes to hayes, making him president, 185 electoral votes to 184 electoral votes for tilden.

you don't have to know what you want, you just have to make sure that the incumbent president gets the blame for whatever goes wrong. but you also have to have some kind of an economic agenda. markets may look like the inside of a rental car after a myrtle beach bachelor party, but the president still enjoys a substantial advantage when it comes to his handling of the economy.

elleithee: and i do think it is premature. i think most members of house democratic leadership agree with that. most members of house democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way tom steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. there may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and bob mueller will let everyone know when that time is.

iran is not iraq, it's twice as big. it'd be twice as bad. we're weaker than we were 16 years ago. if president george w. bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if trump does, he is cooked.
i think our offense affected our defense, brown said. there's going to be nights where you can't make shots.
around 2009, venezuela is also said to have started offering iran contracts to build low-income housing, even though the tenders coming from within venezuela's own private sector were half the cost. iran in 2010 established the banco internactional de desarrollo in caracas as the first non-governmental bi-national bank in iran, with its financing deemed to be of mutual benefit to both countries.
harman: ok. no. and i think that what you said, chris, is right. this is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. and if they have had real evidence that the president was a manchurian candidate, i think they would have intervene right then. i mean we can't have that go on -- an unprecedented whatever i -- collusion, cooperation, arrangement with one of our most important, strategic competitors, russia.
gray: there was the whole aspect of me wanting to rediscover my roots. i had just graduated from high school, and i didn't really know what i wanted to pursue for university. so i wanted to take a gap year to take the time to kind of discover myself. being a sheltered only child, i wanted to discover who was i on my own.
iran and venezuela at one point even had an agreement to build bicycles. the iranian government wanted to use venezuela to make bicycles. a little crazy, venezuelan opposition leader julio borges, who has been living in exile in the colombian capital of bogota for the past 10 months, told fox news in an interview. hezbollah enjoys a kind of impunity in venezuela too. they get venezuelan documents and passports. and they can live and operate freely on the east side of the country.
the key swing voters in georgia are those mostly-affluent suburbanites who split their votes between biden for president and the republican senate candidates. if the purpose of having a republican senate is to support trump, even to the point of this absurdity, then those folks won't really want a republican senate. in fact, they might want to send a message to the gop about the way their senators have been behaving.
in the end, we don't take it too seriously. we're not going to be fanatics, kardashian agreed.
they just kicked the crisis can down the road, he warned.
earlier sunday, speaking to reporters before he headed out to camp david to discuss border security with top advisers, trump had predicted that the pence-run meeting would not lead to any major developments.
somehow every clear security breach in the clinton camp – like an aide's classified mail on the laptop of a sex offender or huge payments and contributions from russian-connected sources – was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to russia was evidence that donald trump was secretly serving as a russian agent.
you will face enormous pressure from your base to take large, symbolic action on firearms and climate change. this seems like a bad idea. both would make for difficult votes for swing state members while accomplishing no change. your 2020 nominee will not want to have to defend pie in the sky you passed to prove a point.

he's got command of the offense, he understands where we want to distribute the ball, said coombs, who was an assistant with the nfl's tennessee titans last season after a five-year stint on urban meyer's staff at ohio state. he's one of the best quarterbacks i've ever seen and been around, and we've been around some really good ones here. he's truly gifted.

now, the left's latest desperate attempt to smear president trump, keep his impeachment charade alive, forever -- it's insane. earlier in the week, there you go, we got the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar himself, adam schiff, he attached an addendum to the articles of impeachment. he's got new evidence, filled with random documents from a ukrainian-american named lev parnas.
the debate carried on as thousands of trump supporters rallied outside the capitol demanding the election results be tossed out. they were invigorated by a speech from trump himself who again refused to concede his election loss and raised unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud that have been rejected by dozens of courts, state election officials and his own attorney general william barr.

carolla: yes, i did. feed it to my cat.
democrats appealed to the 32% of the electorate that is black in georgia, running on righting the purported racism that has in their view held back progress for that segment of the nation. exit polls show 92% of blacks voted for warnock, pastor of the storied atlanta church once co-pastored alongside his father by martin luther king, jr.

ned ryun: this is unreal, tucker. i mean, again, you pointed out that trump gave him a strong backstop back in september and said you can opt out of this with his executive order and now you have these 18 republican governors saying no, we want more. and they're saying well, we're following our hearts. this is, you know, christian charity in action. i got to say this, tucker, as a active devout evangelical christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the american taxpayer. michelle malkin has written about some of this but the u.s. state department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this. first of all, --

prager: by the way, this was the danger working with him.
these aren't democratic positions, they are american positions. but only one party will ensure they come to life: the democrats. these are all positions and policies biden will be able to tackle if democrats also control the senate.
need evidence? look no further than the drama over the covid-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the gop still blocked it. they can't even work together with democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.
some republicans have told me privately that they have explored possible avenues of compromise with democratic colleagues and made little progress. it may well be that pelosi and company, confident that the president has helped them brand this as the trump shutdown, would rather let the thing drag on and inflict more pain. but republicans too, boxed in by trump's hard-line stance, are resisting certain avenues of compromise.

i personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. what i think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. the humanitarian crisis i think may have been what she was referring to.

the last time this happened (and only the second time in u.s. history) was in january 2005, following president' george w. bush's narrow re-election victory over democratic challenger john kerry of massachusetts. one senate democrat – barbara boxer of california – and one house democrat – rep. stephanie tubbs jones of ohio – objected. in 2017, a handful of house democrats objected to trump's victory over hillary clinton, but no senate democrats joined them.
don't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, because
we fought isis in syria and then for some reason stuck around. we're still there. we joined humanitarian missions in lebanon and somalia. our special forces have been quietly fighting in yemen, pakistan, niger, who knows where all else. many other places. in every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. the benefits? often, they've been non-existent. a lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. certainly, they did. hope that makes you feel better. what do the american people think about all of this? not that anyone cares. well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. the killing of soleimani happened just last night. but just five months ago after months of supposed iranian provocation. american's didn't seem to view iran as a major concern, not even close. in a gallop poll taken last august, just 18 percent of americans said that they backed military force to shut down iran's nuclear program. seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. so, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual americans don't enter the equation at all. they're immaterial. in 2016, donald trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. he vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing.

add in those poor souls who really believe trump's claims of massive, uncorrected, systemic electoral fraud who decide not to vote and you have created the only conditions under which republicans really could lose the senate.
my hope is, is that our withdraw from syria, i assume that the president's going to fulfill it, is done in an orderly fashion. but let's recognize our withdrawal empowers russia, it empowers iran, it empowers the syrians. and the ultimate result of it may be iranian-supported militias on the northern border of israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.

and the danger posed by this type of situation isn't just to the occupants of the vehicle. investigators determined that the massive and deadly carr fire that devastated northern california was ignited by a car trailer with a flat tire that threw sparks into some roadside brush.
in the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. they held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. even lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the civil war were grounded in the constitution and the rule of law.
you may have nothing in common with the people on the other side of the country (increasingly, you probably don't), but you're stuck with them. the idea that groups of americans will somehow break off into separate peaceful nations of like-minded citizens is a fantasy. the two hemispheres of this country are inseparably intertwined, like conjoined twins. neither can leave without killing the other. as horrifying as this moment is, we have no option but to make it better, to gut it out.

i mean, with all due respect to the former vice president and the gaffes and all the rest of it, when you look at that field, that field -- there's no way on earth that they can stand toe-to-toe with the president. i think that's fueling the impeachment. but when i'm disappointed with, sean, is that you failed to mention when you introduced me the fact that, you know, i have a robust life in terms of liking a drink now and then. i've been sober for a week, because i promised not to have a glass of alcohol until the president is acquitted, because i'm confident he will be. and the sooner, the better, so he can get the party back on.

douglas macgregor: well, i'm told that tomorrow the iraqi parliament is going to vote overwhelmingly to demand the removal of our forces from iraq. if that's the case i sincerely hope that president trump will take advantage of it and get us out. we should've been out of iraq and syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. we gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. if these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. but if we are going to fight the iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. as for the active killing soleimani, i think we can say with some certainty that iran will respond. probably not in the way that we would. the iranians are not like us. they do not emote. you've been listening to people emote about how much they hate soleimani and blame the failure in iraq on soleimani. that's nonsense. we failed in iraq. the generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of american life and the squandering of our opportunities in iraq. soleimani simply took advantage of it and iran now controls iraq.

sen. cornyn: well, the world is a better place for for this. and certainly while we don't know what iran's response is going to be, i think president trump acted within his authority to defend the united states, our troops and our interests in the middle east against somebody who has american blood on his hands and who's been known to be part of a designated terrorist organization, the islamic revolutionary guard and particularly the kurds force that has is well-known throughout the middle east, providing things like explosively formed penetrators, which would cut through the armor of american soldiers in afghanistan and iraq like a knife through a hot knife, through butter. so nobody should mourn the demise of general soleimani and the president did operate within his constitutional authority. i think what we've just been discussing and the disarray of the house over this impeachment matter shows the wisdom of the founding fathers giving these sort of decisions under the constitution to the commander in chief and not 535 members of congress. i think the contrast between the way that the death of osama bin laden was greeted on a bipartisan basis in the way now that soleimani death is being greeted on a partisan basis, is tells tells the story.

[ed. note: i will not nitpick your condemnatory descriptions of lincoln's extra-constitutional activities as president. i take your basic point that he did exceed the boundaries of presidential authority, even in the creation of my home state of west virginia. but suggesting that somehow lincoln did not work through congress in prosecuting the civil war or that he lacked congressional authorization goes too far. i would also point out that the constitution explicitly grants the president special powers in a time of domestic insurrection. there are many who seek to diminish lincoln's legacy by casting him as some sort of despot, but that tends to either be sour grapes among still-unreconstructed southerners or hot take aficionados. lincoln's love for the constitution and the declaration of independence is evident. when he was visited by a delegation of powerful american leaders who had participated in a peace conference in washington prior to his inauguration, lincoln was urged to accommodate the demands of the secessionists. as described by one who was there, lincoln calmly, clearly told the men lecturing him: i will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the constitution of the united states. … it is not the constitution as i would like to have it, but as it is, that is to be defended. the constitution will not be preserved and defended until it is enforced and obeyed in every part of every one of the united states.

ingraham: iran was also boasting that it was gradually eroding any thought of really abiding by this ridiculous iran nuclear deal. over the summer, they continued to talk, we're not going to be doing this. so we couldn't trust them, never could, despite obama's idealistic, naive approach.
why can't someone else pick them?
we can re-open the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy, schumer said. we can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. and, we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security. the symbol of america should be the statue of liberty, not a thirty-foot wall.
the effort that's going to take place in the senate, again, it's about
but investigations to come fast and furious - politico: democrats want to investigate the trump hotel deal and president donald trump's taxes. they want to haul up conflicted cabinet officials and dig into controversial changes to the census and food stamps. they want to put education secretary betsy devos under oath and investigate child detentions at the border. the threat of subpoenas, investigations and oversight hearings will dominate the new house democratic majority agenda, targeting the white house's most controversial policies and personnel, spanning immigration, the environment, trade and of course, the biggest question of them all: russian collusion. … but for house democrats in control for the first time in nearly a decade, it's also a role full of pitfalls. trump has already tried to brand the prospect of congressional oversight as nothing more than 'harassment,' and democrats will also have to show they can legislate, govern and investigate all at the same time in the house.
in addressing the house chamber yesterday, pelosi said that we should serve with our heart full of love and that americans want a congress that delivers results for the people. she got a cheer for saying her party would be offering legislation to reopen government today — which she pushed through last night.

woods has also come under fire for several tweets and was even temporarily locked out of twitter for a satirical meme encouraging men not to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.
there's a case to be made that this is an artificial crisis, with trump using the border situation to pound away at his signature promise to build a wall and the democrats determined to deny him that funding. but there's also a very real crisis, in which both parties play a role, as 800,000 federal workers continue to go without paychecks and the ripple effects of the partial shutdown are increasingly hitting the economy.

but then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. and nancy pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides republicans, that peels off republicans. and the one thing that will keep republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. if it just becomes -- if the democratic party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the republican party, which i think is a real concern, of just the anti-trump party, than that will unify the republicans.
he continued: as we all know, this is a results-driven business and, simply put, the results of the past two years have fallen short of expectations. moving forward, we will redouble our efforts to both build and maintain a championship-caliber program. we have been innovative in many facets of our organization in recent years, and we need to carry that over to our entire operation. our fans need to know that the los angeles chargers are committed to consistent, winning football. the search for a new head coach will begin immediately.

wallace: you're talking about the issues, i guess i'm talking more about attitude. because it's -- you know, there are problems there and people have known about possible deals, possible solutions for a long time, but it never gets done. why not?

trump campaign moving fast to rig nomination - politico: president donald trump is tightening his iron grip on the republican party, launching an elaborate effort to stamp out any vestiges of gop opposition that might embarrass him at the 2020 republican convention. the president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when never trump republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national tv audience. the effort comes as party elites like utah sen. mitt romney are openly questioning trump's fitness for the job, and it's meant to ensure that delegates to next year's convention in charlotte, n.c., are presidential loyalists… trump political aides bill stepien and justin clark, the organizers of the project, held a national conference call with republican state party chairs, who traditionally play an outsize role in picking delegates. last week, the two advisers began having one-on-one calls with the state chairs to describe the campaign's mission and discuss various circumstances in each state.
loeffler has now said she will object to the certification of electoral votes for biden on wednesday and has called for the resignation of georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger -- a kemp ally -- all while trump has promised to campaign against kemp in 2022.

my democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge we should confirm judges by a majority vote, graham told fox news' chris wallace. they changed the rules to accommodate president obama. they tried to stack the court. they never thought [hillary] clinton would lose. so what you're gonna have is harry reid's and chuck schumer's desire to stack the court on their democratic watch has come back to haunt them.

democracy is a pressure relief valve. as long as people sincerely believe they can change things by voting, they stay calm. they don't burst into the house chamber. they talk and they organize and they vote. but the opposite is also true if people begin to believe that their democracy is fraudulent, that voting is a charade, that the system is rigged and it's run in secret by a small group of powerful, dishonest people who are acting in their own interests. then, god knows what could happen.

tucker carlson: they're thinking, let's get some. that's what they're trained to do. that's their job. their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. that's their job. but when they go, and they experience war like i've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. they get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. they pay attention a little bit more to politics. and they say, why was out there? what was i accomplishing, and what was i told? and how much of it was true? i think president trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. and he's thrown the ball in the court of iran today with a tweet to say, listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because i think that is his end goal. and he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all iran will respond to. that's our hope. that's our hope today. is that iran responds to military force. we really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. and it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.

cuban government officials typically deny the existence of political prisoners, saying instead that counter-revolutionary activities, or trying to incite others against the regime, is a crime.
look, the strongest candidate against trump is going to be somebody who has to assure the country that they can keep the country safe, that they can protect a strong economy even while protecting the welfare state, a kind of pragmatic centrist, like you say. but they have driven those people out of the field, and they did it right at the beginning.

the co-hosts also tried confronting dershowitz on his previous statements about impeachment, with goldberg suggesting he changed his mind because trump was president. dershowitz countered by claiming that he actually changed his mind on impeachment about four years ago when he looked into the possibility of former secretary of state hillary clinton getting impeached.
michael anton: -- it was an extraordinary confluence of circumstances that don't look to be repeated, and president bush, who was defeated in 1992, also faced a very bad economy, which is -- remember, it's the economy, stupid -- the number-one issue bill clinton ran against him on and was able to seize on. the democrats don't have that right now. i think, you know, anything is possible. the economy could turn sour sometime during this year, but at this point in the 1992 campaign the economy had already been in recession for a while, and people were very discontented. that's not the case right now. so, president trump looks very strong to me.

medicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. a new york times analysis found that one-third of senate democrats and more than half of house democrats have endorsed medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the u.s. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the british national health service. their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite obamacare's goals. and while medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of americans.

the latest assault comes in the form of a workplace election rule change that would shrink election windows, giving people only ten days to learn everything they need to know about unionizing before voting. the proposed rule change is profoundly disrespectful to the people that it would affect: workers around the country. it shows no respect for their intelligence or their judgment. it is unfair to make it virtually impossible for an employer to present the other side of the organizer's pitch. how can anyone in good conscience take away the opportunity to discover the truth and weigh their options from someone? how many doctors have to take their mcats as freshmen in college? it seems reasonable because it would deprive the participant of important information. why would you deny the same level of respect to workers during an organizing drive?

graham added that trump would be willing to offer work permits to recipients of the obama-era deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program for those brought to the u.s. illegally as children -- a compromise the white house had backed last summer. however, graham noted, trump's planned rescission of the daca program is working its way through the appellate court process, as several federal judges have ruled that the white house violated federal administrative law by ending daca without offering legally sufficient notice or justification.

in the november elections, republicans won enough senate races to control 50 seats in the chamber. that means if they win just one of the races on tuesday, republicans will hold a majority in the body for the next two years. if the gop caucus remains united, they'll have an effective veto over much of biden's agenda. that agenda, republicans have said, would be a transformational far-left plan to change the country.
president trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the senate, maybe to the chief justice initially. but i have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of congress, which is another way of saying, the president exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.

tucker carlson: well, if you can remember that far back during president barack obama's second term, republican leaders in the congress made a big show of opposing the obama administration's refugee policy. obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled syria's civil war in the united states and at the time 25 republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. for example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. often, it's impossible. some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be syrian. that was true for sure in europe with the refugees. some of them might be islamic extremists. but terrorism was not the only worry they had. america's middle class is in decline. we already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. the last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. that's just true. and anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. as with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. so, before she became the most anti-american member of congress, ilhan omar was a refugee. so, at the time the republican governors got their wish and president trump won the 2016 election.

if you had a nickel for every time a democrat used arguments about science in discussions about climate change, you'd be rich. scientific studies about the existence of climate change – be it man-made or naturally occurring – are often used as cudgels against opponents of the left's radical environmental agenda or international regulatory regimes like the paris climate accord.

but mexico and china are also linked to the deaths of americans. each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. so, does that mean we get to bomb oaxaca? can we start assassinating generals in the people's liberation army? maybe. maybe ben sasse will call for that, too. he's a former consultant and a very tough character. but before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the united states richer and more secure. there are an awful lot of bad people in this world. we can't kill them all. it's not our job. instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of american citizens. period. that's why we have a government. so, has the killing of soleimani done that? maybe. no one in washington has explained how. instead, like ben sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. he clearly was. so? that's irrelevant. meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. we're praying they don't, but they could. how do we know that? because we've seen it before. we fought quite a number of wars around the middle east in recent decades. we attacked saddam hussein twice, as you know. in the end we killed him. we invaded an occupied afghanistan. we toppled moammar gaddafi in libya.

president obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. it is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. useful because it can be easily abused. mr. obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. as chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

mccrory may challenge tillis - [raleigh] news&observer: former north carolina gov. pat mccrory on wednesday ruled out running in the 9th congressional district — but not for governor in 2020 or the u.s. senate in 2022. speaking on his morning talk show on wbt radio, the charlotte republican said he'll make that decision later this year. 'i'm going to do a thorough assessment about running for governor (in 2020) or senate in 2022, but i'm not ready to make either decision,' mccrory said. charlotte's longest-serving mayor did say he's ruled out running if there's a special election in the 9th congressional district. the election in november of republican mark harris has been clouded by allegations of election fraud involving absentee ballots in bladen and robeson counties. the state board of elections and ethics enforcement has twice declined to certify the race.

thanks to stories like this one, americans are warming shockingly to socialism. six months from now, a socialist could be the democratic nominee for president. in a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. what would that look like? well, of course it would be a disaster. socialism doesn't work. it never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like alexandria ocasio-cortez would become vastly more powerful. that's socialism. you think america is stratified and unequal now? wait till we get a socialist system. it will be so much worse. that's coming, by the way and at high speed. why? because mindless chamber of commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. as of tonight, america is sending thousands of additional troops to the middle east, but the iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. so, what will happen next? we'll tell you as our coverage of the iran crisis continues.

but, until then, democrats have a policy agenda to push. they've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. and they have an election to win. if they want to beat donald trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. they've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. that should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.
in 1996, congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. the statutory language is mandatory. thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. yet, the president is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. he cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. to do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.

following the signing ceremony, schwarzman who served as an intermediary between the u.s. and china during negotiations told fox business, he's confident the deal will work. i think the chinese had a lot of time to think this one through. their country is complex, they have the reformers, they have the hardliners, they've come together. i've been talking to the people who have the responsibility of implementing this deal and they're all over it.

chris van hollen: so, look, there's no doubt that the maximum pressure campaign is putting pressure on iran, but to what end? secretary pompeo had a list of, like, 11 things the iranian regime had to do, and it was never realistic, and that's why they've got no endgame. and that's why we're here right now, after this latest escalation, at much greater risk of going to war with iran, which would be very damaging to the united states. obviously, it would be damaging to iran, but it would be very damaging to the united states.

mike pompeo: it's interesting. i haven't heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence make the comments that you just described. i think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior american leaders had in their possession would've come to the same conclusion that president trump and our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to america, more risk through inaction than there was through the action that we took. i think it's very clear. i think it's very plain. we'll do everything we can to share this information with the american people, but i think the american people understand too, there's certain things you just can't -- you can't put out in public. you got to protect americans who are out collecting the intelligence. the intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and protect them.

also, in the run-up to the election, the release of a phone call in which trump exhorted georgia secretary of state to find 11,780 votes to give him the state likely turned off a number of republican voters fed up with our mercurial president. exit polls indicate that 63% of self-described moderates voted for warnock, whose agenda does not promise moderation.

there have been numerous decisions by this board that highlight hazards for unsuspecting workers. this board allows organizers to exaggerate and make promises which have no weight during negotiations. for example, in wolfrich corporation, dba thrifty rent-a-car, 234 n.l.r.b. 525, this board permits organizers to tell workers they can make more money, even if that is not necessarily true, because employees generally understand that a union cannot automatically obtain benefits by winning an election, but must attempt to achieve them through the collective-bargaining process. furthermore, in coach & equipment sales corp; 228 nlrb 441 the board asserted that: [c]ollective bargaining is potentially hazardous for employees and that as a result of such negotiations employees might possibly wind up with less benefits after unionization than before. is it remotely reasonable to expect every person to know such things?

members of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the democratic party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. in other words, functionally libertarian. they don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. as far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.

sen. cornyn: well, i i i wonder whether senator schumer thinks that bernie sanders or elizabeth warren or joe biden i guess he is no longer in the senate. amy klobuchar and other senators running for president are, strictly speaking, impartial writers. it's not a good it's not a good analogy. i know all of us, including myself, have used that as an analogy, but it's not the same thing as an impartial jury in a criminal or civil case that would be tried in a court of law. we know that the that this is primarily a political matter and one where the people who cast their vote, either in the house from the senate will be held accountable by the people they represent. that's what this is. so i think it's it's hypocritical, particularly if looking back on the way that senator schumer and others conducted themselves in the clinton impeachment, he actually ran for the senate against senator al d'amato, saying if elected, he would vote to acquit president clinton. that's not exactly impartial.

and what really happened was that infusion of cash and the cessation of those sanctions created a terrorist whirlwind from iran into lebanon, into syria, into yemen. and they're embarrassed about it, because this plan was bankrupt, it was crazy. and i think secretary pompeo and trump realize that and yet they know that our real interests are in china with - in dealing with china and there's existential threat. so, they're sort of like sheriff's backing out of this middle east saloon and saying, this place is a mess, but we're going to have a revolved result and restore deterrence. and that's hard to do.

they seem to have hit dead ends with roger stone, paul manafort and general michael flynn. they can write a report condemning the president but the russian collusion goods don't seem to exist. they may just keep on going, picking up new investigations from the democratic house committees, and act as a permanent presidential investigation unit. but eventually i think the supreme court, which will start to get cases that could limit their power and authority, and the appointment of an unrecused attorney general, will catch up to them if they don't end it soon. expect their report by march 15, 2019.

mollie hemingway, senior editor, the federalist: it does seem that they're having trouble sticking with a particular narrative when it comes to soleimani, iran. first, they're telling us it's no big deal. then they're highlighting the people who are mourning his death. they said that trump doing this might have been a wag the dog effort to distract from impeachment. last week supposedly he couldn't wait for impeachment, which is why nancy pelosi had such leverage. they can't stick with a particular storyline and it's making them looking like the only thing that they are consistent, and it is what they're consistent about, is opposition to trump.

what trump is doing with the help of many members of his party is certainly the most historically significant part of his presidency – more than an impeachment, more than judicial appointments or any piece of policy. it is unprecedented and deals with matters central to the survival of the republic
men like madison, jefferson and adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. they knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. they knew that absolute power corrupts.

tucker carlson: thank you. for more than 100 years the boeing company has led international aviation. to this day it's measured by dollar amounts. boeing remains america's single largest foreign exporter. but now like so many american institutions, boeing is in trouble. last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. there's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. production is being suspended. in business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. how did it happen? well, at least part of the responsibility lies with ceo dennis muilenburg who has been in charge at boeing since 2015. fittingly, muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. someone in corporate america is finally being held accountable for screwing up. but before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. according to recent sec filings, muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. that's his punishment. and by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. here's some context for how much money that is. a rank and file employee at boeing might make $60,000 a year. that's a decent salary in many places. it would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced dennis muilenburg is getting in his severance package.

it's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the house. but their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. a stunning gallup poll last summer showed democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. the term democratic socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of bernie sanders, who identifies as one. the enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.

romney's main complaint in the piece is that donald trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. that's true, of course. but beneath the personal slights, romney has a policy critique of trump. he seems genuinely angry that trump might pull american troops out of the syrian civil war. romney doesn't explain how staying in syria would benefit america. he doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. more policing in the middle east is always better. we know that. virtually everyone in washington agrees.

i will also say this, chris -- i was very concerned by president trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that vladimir putin's russia had interfered in our 2016 election. there's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of president trump to complement president putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for president putin.

chris wallace: as soon as the drone strike took out soleimani, you and other democrats started criticizing the action. president trump and his top officials say that there was an imminent attack, and that that taking out soleimani prevented it. you just heard secretary pompeo say that again on this program. don't you believe them?

the film, which takes its name from the negro motorist green book, a guide by postal worker victor hugo green to advise fellow african-americans on how to travel safely in the segregated south, has received mixed reviews from american critics, some of whom feel it oversimplifies or glosses over racial issues. but clearly the international press, which comprises the hollywood foreign press association and chooses who wins the golden globes, sees the film as something special.

quick question for you: how did nancy pelosi manage to get herself elected speaker of the house once again? my understanding is/was that you need to receive a majority to win … 218 votes of the 435 total; but i caught part of a report on the radio wherein a pundit was stating (i think) that she received less than 218 and even had to have some reps abstain from voting in order to have enough votes to win. is this true? can you win with less than 218? and if so, exactly how close was her 'by the skin of her teeth' victory anyway? – bob nelson, norwell, mass.

huckabee: it's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. some people eat their soup louder than others. it doesn't mean their soup tastes better. some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. but the point is, if donald trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. but if it happens with biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion. that's a hard one to reconcile.
legislative agenda? what do you say to those voters?
today, the democrats' only message is they won't spend one ten thousandth of the budget on a border wall. it is an appeal to the base, but is a weakening hand with a policeman killed in california and democrats' statements that they won't compromise even $1. they have the chance to split the difference, make a deal for daca and turn this into a win-win or let it drag on as a lose-lose. i think there will be a compromise sooner than later.

j.d. vance: well, i think for a couple of reasons. one, we have an entire generation of american intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the middle east was just the most important region of the world. and so, one way of thinking about american policy really for the past 20 years, the george w. bush administration, of course the barack obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. we basically had one new war per term, iraq, and then -- excuse me, afghanistan, then iraq, lebanon and syria during the obama terms and that's obviously terrible and i think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for america's national interest but viewed from the chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for america's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that china was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. i think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the american foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.

if jon ossoff and raphael warnock win their races against incumbent republican senators david perdue and kelly loeffler, democrats and republicans would each hold 50 seats in the senate, with democrats holding the tie-breaker vote with vice president-elect kamala harris. this, plus a house majority and a democratic white house would give the party the potential to check a number of items off their agenda.

michael anton: well, as you said earlier, the president really would like to get as much out of the middle east as possible. but he didn't run as an isolationist. it's important to remember: he ran as kind of a jacksonian. his philosophy of foreign policy is very simple. live and let live. we will live and let live as much as possible. but if you hit us, if you mess with us, if you strike us, if you kill our people, we will hit back very, very hard. that's why, what he -- what he's doing is essentially retaliatory. it's not long-term nation building. he has no interest in staying in the middle east, or rebuilding it, or transforming it for the long term.

'it's a creative way to solve a problem without really working the problem,' chody told ktcb-tv. chody said the cutouts, which depict the deputy pointing a speed-measuring radar device at the road, look like a real deputy at first glance. … he said the department tested out the cardboard deputies by placing them near school zones, with real deputies waiting nearby to observe the results.

especially over the past decade, counterterrorism has not only encouraged inertia, but also has served as a smokescreen to put the u.s. in a de facto alliance with iran, including the obama administration providing iranian-led militias with cover and support for ground operations, he added. the trump administration has been slowly moving away from that, first through quiet acquiescence to ti israeli strikes and now by retaliating directly against attacks by these militias. this change in posture is as necessary as it is overdue.

roll call: a proposed house rules package wouldn't just reinstate the old rule that let the chamber avoid separate votes on the statutory debt ceiling 20 times in three decades starting in 1980. the new rules offered by house democratic leaders, set for floor debate thursday, would turbocharge the old 'gephardt rule' into something completely new. it would allow the chamber to spin off a resolution 'suspending' the debt ceiling to the senate, without a house vote, once the house adopts its own version of a budget resolution. that's a stark departure from the previous gephardt rule, named for former house majority leader richard a. gephardt, d-mo., which required the house and senate to jointly agree on the same budget resolution in order for the house to avoid what is typically a difficult vote on the debt ceiling. …congress will have to address the debt limit later this year after a temporary suspension of borrowing authority expires march 1.

josh holmes: yeah. i mean, that's, like, the if and -- ifs and buts, and candy and nuts, [unintelligible] christmas in every day. there's no chance of that happening. let me tell you why -- specifically because what mcconnell was advocating for is an imminently reasonable process, one that was adopted 100 to nothing in the clinton impeachment trial in the 1990s. and what that does is provide the impeachment managers from the house and the president's defense team the opportunity to lay out their cases. and what is agreed to at the front end is that framework. after you get through that framework, then senators are -- after they go through a series of questioning, are able to look at what's missing. and at that point, you can have a discussion about whether you bring in different pieces of evidence, whether you bring --

new congress less christian, but still more christian than the nation - pew: while the number of self-identified christians in congress has ticked down … the religious makeup of the new, 116th congress is very different from that of the united states population. within protestantism, certain groups are particularly numerous in the new congress, including methodists, anglicans/episcopalians, presbyterians and lutherans. additionally, protestants in the 'unspecified/other' category make up just 5% of the u.s. public, but 15% of congress. by contrast, some other protestant groups are underrepresented, including pentecostals (5% of the u.s. public vs. 0.4% of congress). but by far the largest difference between the u.s. public and congress is in the share who are unaffiliated with a religious group. in the general public, 23% say they are atheist, agnostic or 'nothing in particular.' in congress, just one person – sen. kyrsten sinema, d-ariz., who was recently elected to the senate after three terms in the house – says she is religiously unaffiliated, making the share of 'nones' in congress 0.2%.

the self-righteous preening by some journalists and commentators was something to behold. there was no need to carry trump, they said, because he'd just give a political speech. as if every speech by every president isn't on some level political. when bush addressed the nation on iraq, he was speaking of war and peace — and saying some things that turned out to be untrue — but he was also making the political case for an invasion.

donna edwards: well, no. i mean, i think we should examine that where we are right now is precisely because mitch mcconnell openly said that he wasn't going to have a fair process. and i think it's legitimate for speaker pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to. i mean, she's going to turn over the articles of impeachment, but she does want assurances, given that mcconnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn't going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president. and so, you know, and i think that she actually has created leverage, because, in fact, she opened up the space for murkowski and collins. and i'm waiting for this phase -- for mitt romney, who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration, with the president -- to make sure that there is, indeed, a fair process.

mann says you may not even have to be suspected of terrorism to get on a no-fly list. in some cases, people have either open warrants or some other characteristic indicating criminal activity and then they find themselves on this list, he says, even when the alleged activity has nothing to do with aviation security. mann believes that's a sign the no-fly list has morphed beyond an air security tool into an all-out law enforcement tactic. this has mission-creeped into something that is much wider in scope than was originally intended, he says.

but for all of biden's goodwill and effort in this arena, it is obvious that republicans have no interest in working with him. biden can make all the overtures he wants, mcconnell has been clear. he sees democrats as the enemy.
chris wallace: all right, but there's no question, and you certainly would agree, that soleimani was our enemy. he had been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of hundreds of american soldiers during the iraq war. there's no question that he was -- he wasn't taking a vacation as he was traveling around the middle east this last week. he was making more plans for terror attacks, spreading iran's malign influence. why not kill him?
jonah goldberg, fox news contributor: absolutely. look, as you know, i'm a
but there's no guarantee that that's going to be the case. and the big risk is that unwittingly, just as barack obama thought the iraq war was a mistake. donald trump thought the iraq war was a mistake, but the people end up doing some of the same mistakes, repeating some of the same mistakes that they campaigned against. what we really want to do is avoid an iraq-like war with iran.

josh holmes: well, i don't think that's inconsistent at all. i mean, i think his overarching policy as secretary pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove america from these endless wars and these conflicts in syria, the conflicts in iraq and beyond, but that also cannot override immediate security threats. you need to be responsive to that and i will just say, i'm totally stunned at the notion that somehow america is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level. the president's critics may not have been paying attention to what's happened over the last couple of years, but just because they're more focused on trying to impeach the president of the united states than the health and well-being of american soldiers in iraq, doesn't mean that things aren't happening. this guy has tried -- has killed over 600 american soldiers, all right? just last week, we watched him storm the embassy in baghdad. now, how america is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time, and i'll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing, but first time in a long time tell iran not anymore. you're not going to be attacking american assets or american personnel without severe repercussions and i think that's a great thing for this country.

the data compiled by peace now showed a drop in construction starts during trump's first year in office, to 1,643 units in 2017 from 3,066 units the previous year. this drop appears to reflect the lingering effect of reduced planning during the final two years of the obama administration.
and it includes a host of other liberal wish-list items like: a job-guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one; a just transition for workers affected by climate change; basic income programs; universal health care and more.

chris van hollen: i'm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence. they did not notify the gang of 8. the one opportunity they had, just two days ago, to brief senior staff at the top secret level, they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat. look, everybody knows that soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. there's no debate there. but the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported. and what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting americans at greater risk. in fact, secretary pompeo's own state department, right after these attacks, urged americans to leave iraq. so, obviously, they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before, and as you've just reported, we sent 4,000 additional troops to iraq, this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the middle east.

thus, handed these cards and with the escalation on the ground that put our troops and personnel at risk, donald trump had to weigh the options and he had to make a decision. so, was it better for the u.s. to allow soleimani to parade openly around iraq with no forceful response after he fomented the attack on our embassy and was plotting more?

yet venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of cuba, iran, china, russia and turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. turkish president tayyip erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against venezuela, and this year turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from venezuela. and russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.

j. v. last: 'the trump primary has already begun' - the bulwark: the smartest thing barack obama ever did was running for president when everyone thought hillary clinton was invincible. the second smartest thing he did was invite clinton into his cabinet and keep her there through his first term. obama understood that avoiding a primary challenge is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for re-election. … president trump, on the other hand, seems to be daring someone to run against him in 2020. he frequently insults his fellow republicans and has made almost no effort to mend fences… he did not bring the people most likely to run against him—john kasich and mitt romney—into his administration. and he has not kept the people who would be most dangerous to him—nikki haley and jim mattis—on his team. if you only looked at this top-line data, you'd almost think trump wants a primary challenger. maybe he does.

so here's the question: i understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of democrats, including pelosi, including schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. so why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that lindsey graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on dreamers and on tps immigrants?

many democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. it is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.
de blasio's announcement came after california's new democratic gov. gavin newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting obamacare. medi-cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, up from 19, according to newsom's new agenda.
graham: well, number one, that story came from somebody who leaked it with an agenda. so i'd like to know who leaked it because they have an agenda not very friendly to president trump and i for one don't trust what i read in the new york times.

president trump: iran is a much different country than two-and-a-half years ago. when i took over, iran was all over. they had 14 to 18 different sights of confliction. they were all over. and now, they just want to -- oh, they want to negotiate a deal so badly.

to many activists, black friday is the epitome of this shift, a purely commercial event designed to boost u.s. retailers ahead of the christmas holidays, the symbol of capitalism run amok.

pelosi announced the visionary rules package with rules committee chairman jim mcgovern, d-mass., on friday and said it reflects the values of her diverse democratic majority.
for pelosi, it has mostly kept the insurrectionists in her conference in check, mother truckers notwithstanding. democrats may disagree on may things, but sticking it to trump is not one of them. war with trump makes life simpler and power more easily wielded.
she's gamed this. why did she take so long? remember, they impeached him
however, president obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. it has become his political gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with congress. he contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. he treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.

in a december surprise, general james mattis quit over the syrian troop withdrawal. not since president harry truman fired the revered general douglas macarthur has a president had to contend with a general opposing civilian rule in such a bold manner. but the decision to draw down 2,000 troops was hardly a momentous military decision in the leagues of sending hundreds of thousands of troops to korea, the decision to start the iraq war or to use the atomic bomb against japan. it was more likely a pretext to leave the administration and surely there will be a multimillion-dollar book contract next. military command moves on, and this is just another failed power play.

that's the answer to everything, but it would be nice if someone disagreed with that claim, because that claim is totally false. it's poisonous and it's wrecking what has been, for a couple of hundred years now, a pretty great country. but increasingly, no one pushes back. in fact, a lot of republicans have been saying the same thing recently.
it's going to happen, it's a question of limiting it and putting as many safeguards in place to make sure it does not happen, sterling said.
the federalist has a smart take: if president trump wants to end the government shutdown and get congress to approve funding for his border wall, there's a way to do it — if he's willing to compromise with democrats. likewise, if democrats want to end the shutdown and address the humanitarian crisis at the border, they could do that — if they were willing to compromise with trump.

tucker carlson: as well as in the campaign against isis. though he was little known to the american public, soleimani was among the most famous living figures in iran and also among the most powerful. according to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. the iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the u.s. in response to his death. now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. but it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with iran. from iran's perspective we're already there. if iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? you would. so, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in syria, it was a pivot point. neo-cons in washington understood that immediately. congratulations to all involved in eliminating qasem soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor john bolton. hope this is the first step to regime change in tehran. that of course has been the neo-con objective all along. the president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.

wapo: house republican leaders on thursday stepped forward to criticize rep. steve king for defending white nationalism... king, who won a ninth term in congress in november, lamented in an interview with the new york times that the term had become a pejorative one. 'white nationalist, white supremacist, western civilization — how did that language become offensive?' king said in the interview, which was published thursday. king later issued a statement in which he sought to walk back his remarks. he said he rejects 'those labels and the evil ideology that they define' and proclaimed himself 'simply a nationalist.' … and iowa gov. kim reynolds (r), who backed king during the last campaign and appeared with him on the campaign trail, has said she will not endorse him this time, telling an nbc affiliate in des moines that 'the last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close.'
but, knowing that he would not have the power in a divided government to do much more to protect black americans in the south anyway, hayes capitulated and agreed to pull the troops out and let the terrorists drive black lawmakers from power. so began a decades-long reign of terror and its lasting shame.
wapo: house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) sought to quell a rising furor sunday over whether democratic lawmakers will seek to impeach president trump, saying in an interview on cbs news's 'sunday morning' that the public has yet to hear the conclusions of special counsel robert s. mueller iii's investigation. democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without republican backing, pelosi hinted. that could hinge significantly on whether mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. … pelosi's remarks were echoed sunday by house majority leader steny h. hoyer (d-md.), who said calls for trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from democrats' 'substantive agenda.' … pelosi's remarks come amid days of democratic infighting after newly elected rep. rashida tlaib (d-mich.) vowed … to 'impeach the motherf-----,' referring to trump. many of tlaib's colleagues have cautioned against moving too quickly toward impeachment. rep. adam smith (d-wash.) on sunday told abc news that impeaching trump would be 'an unbelievably serious undertaking.'

in 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. that's the last time we checked in on this story. here's the amazing part. for some reason no republican governors are taking advantage of that. instead, you probably didn't read this in the new york times but 18 republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. have their voters demanded this? no. so what's going on here? ned ryun is the founder of american majority and author of restoring our republic. he joins us tonight. so, ned, i don't think there's any evidence that republican voters in the states have been begging their republican governors to move more refugees in. so, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?

wapo: president trump on friday threw cold water on the idea of immediately declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the u.s.-mexico border, reversing days of signals that he might soon declare the emergency amid a protracted standoff with democrats over a partial shutdown of the federal government. 'what we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,' he said friday afternoon, surrounded by law enforcement officials at a white house roundtable. 'i'm not going to do it so fast.' the president has defiantly said for days he might declare a national emergency to expedite construction of the wall — and his administration has asked agencies to begin preparations. but he has gotten sharp pushback, even from republicans, at the notion of declaring such an emergency. his lawyers have privately warned that he could be on shaky footing with such a move, according to people familiar with the discussions.

graham suggested that the white house would likely approve a compromise that extended protections afforded to temporary protected status (tps) recipients who fled natural disasters, in exchange for funding for trump's proposed border wall.
the wall was fiercely opposed by democrats as well as immigration and environmental activists. morgan praised president trump for continuing to back the effort even as the administration fought against numerous lawsuits, as well as opposition to funding on capitol hill.

fortunately, there are no national elections this year so the press of partisanship could take a back seat to progress. just maybe 2019 will be the year that america returns to its political senses, reduces gridlock, cuts good trade deals and enjoys a strong economy. on january 4, 2019, those predictions seem somewhat crazy as we are in a partial government shutdown, headed for an impeachment and many believe a recession is around the corner. call me an optimist.

[ed. note: it is said that pain is the touchstone of all spiritual growth, and i think that applies to political reform as well. perhaps we have not yet hurt badly, deeply or long enough to be ready to embrace substantive changes to our system. issue-based arguments are becoming increasingly fruitless because the larger mechanisms that make up our constitutional process are breaking down. there is a time coming, i believe, when people across the political spectrum will embrace the concept of systemic reform rather than narrow ideological combat.]

trump: i can reveal that i believe it would have been for embassies. and i think that probably baghdad already started. they were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force. we came in with very powerful force and drove them out. you know that ended almost immediately. but baghdad certainly would have been the lead. but i think it would have been for embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. but it was imminent and then all of a sudden, he was gone.

it's clear the same kind of retribution is going on in the southern district of new york (sdny) following trump's firing of u.s. attorney preet bharara. the recent indictment of a russian lawyer, over statements in a civil case that she did not disclose her part in securing a document from a russian prosecutor, shows the length that these prosecutors will go to using selective prosecution as a tool for making a case against trump.
jonah goldberg, contributor: yes, so that' -- that's part of the irony here, right, is the fight over this is almost purely symbolic now. it is a, if they win, we lose, zero sum understanding that if trump gets anything he can claim victory for, democrats will feel like it's a loss, and vice versa.

charlotte observer: the republican in the nation's last undecided congressional race asked a north carolina court thursday to require that he be declared the winner because the now-defunct state elections board didn't act. a lawsuit by gop candidate mark harris claims the disbanded elections board had been declared unconstitutional, so its investigation into alleged ballot fraud by an operative hired by the republican's campaign was invalid. the elections board was dissolved friday by state judges who in october declared its makeup unconstitutional but had allowed investigations to continue. a revamped board doesn't officially come into existence until jan. 31. … the investigation is continuing, however, with harris being interviewed thursday as all other u.s. house winners were sworn into office in washington. democratic leaders in the u.s. house have said they won't allow harris to take office because of the ongoing investigation. the u.s. constitution makes the house the judge and final arbiter of its members' election contests.
