There's an old saying in horse racing that you've gotta be a mudder who can run on a sloppy track in order to win the big races. We were all mudders in 2020. The track got sloppier by the second but if you're reading this it's because you found a way to keep going. You may not have won the race but give yourself credit just for finishing because as years go, 2020 was one of the longest decades ever.

Time: Google honored banjo-picking bluegrass legend Earl Scruggs with its Google Doodle on Friday. Scruggs, who pioneered a musical style known as the 'Scruggs style' which became integral to bluegrass, died in 2012 at age 88. The animated Doodle shows off Scruggs' fingerpicking playing style. Google's Doodle was timed to celebrate the anniversary of the 2014 opening of the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby, N.C. The Scruggs Center is dedicated to celebrating Scuggs' life and helping to educate people about the North Carolina musical traditions that gave rise to Scruggs' talent. Scruggs' son, Gary, told Google: 'Even though my father, Earl Scruggs, passed away before the Earl Scruggs Center opened, he was involved in its planning stages. It was important for him that the Earl Scruggs Center would serve as more than a museum displaying interesting artifacts and memorabilia, but as an educational facility as well.'

We sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.

There is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.

New Congress less Christian, but still more Christian than the nation - Pew: While the number of self-identified Christians in Congress has ticked down â€¦ the religious makeup of the new, 116th Congress is very different from that of the United States population. Within Protestantism, certain groups are particularly numerous in the new Congress, including Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Lutherans. Additionally, Protestants in the 'unspecified/other' category make up just 5% of the U.S. public, but 15% of Congress. By contrast, some other Protestant groups are underrepresented, including Pentecostals (5% of the U.S. public vs. 0.4% of Congress). But by far the largest difference between the U.S. public and Congress is in the share who are unaffiliated with a religious group. In the general public, 23% say they are atheist, agnostic or 'nothing in particular.' In Congress, just one person â€“ Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who was recently elected to the Senate after three terms in the House â€“ says she is religiously unaffiliated, making the share of 'nones' in Congress 0.2%.

Amy Klobuchar said Wednesday that she is 'getting close to a decision' about running for president in 2020, as other prominent Democrats begin to jump in the race to challenge President Donald Trump next year. 'I'm continuing to talk to people about it,' the Minnesota Democrat said in an interview in her U.S. Senate office, a day before the start of a new congressional term. She said those discussions have been with a handful of longtime political advisers in Minnesota, some fellow U.S. senators and others. â€¦ Her likeliest strategy would be to win or finish strongly in neighboring Iowa, with its presidential caucus on Feb. 3, 2020. Klobuchar declined to put an exact timeline on when she'd reveal her plans. But she acknowledged that the likelihood of a large Democratic field vying to challenge Trump means she can't wait too long.

Awkward! Or it would be, if it was anyone else but Schiavo, a gregarious, emotional, wisecracking guy who is all South Phillyâ€¦ He's won awards, had money donated in his name, and gets stopped all the time by former patients who want to buy him drinks or dinner. 'I'm holding someone's groin for 20 minutes, they tend to remember me and nobody else,' Schiavo said.

It is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.

For example, after an ad from Kelly Loeffler highlighted Warnock's domestic abuse issues, a fact-check from a CBS affiliate ran with a story titled Warnock's character questioned in dredged up bodycam of dispute with ex-wife.

Fox News: Former presidential candidate Martin O'Malley is urging Beto O'Rourke to launch a 2020 White House bid, while making clear he's taking himself out of the running. The former governor of Maryland who abandoned his 2016 Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., after a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses penned an op-ed in the Des Moines Register Thursday encouraging outgoing Texas Rep. O'Rourke to run. 'I will not be running for president in 2020, but I hope Beto O'Rourke does. And this is why,' O'Malley wrote. 'People are looking for a new leader who can bring us together. They are looking for a unifier and a healer. They are looking for a leader of principle, and they are now looking for a fearless vision.' â€¦ O'Malley added: 'Like so many other Americans, I believe we need new leadership to make that future a reality.'

WALLACE: Now, you are telling the president, urging the president to use his executive powers to fund the wall and the president on Friday said not so fast.
WALLACE: The McCabe case is small potatoes?
PRAGER: No, you said you did feed it.
The president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.
Thus, handed these cards and with the escalation on the ground that put our troops and personnel at risk, Donald Trump had to weigh the options and he had to make a decision. So, was it better for the U.S. to allow Soleimani to parade openly around Iraq with no forceful response after he fomented the attack on our embassy and was plotting more?
WALLACE: It went from the 60-vote margin to 51, and then the Republicans did it for the Supreme Court.

The president, though, claimed there would be very little difference in emissions between the federal and California's standard, but said cars will be far safer and much less expensive. He also predicted that a new national standard for fuel economy will result in more cars being produced by the U.S. and more jobs.

How does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.

Inslee faces grumbling at home about his possible run - The Spokesman Review: Despite adding trips to New Hampshire and Nevada to his January schedule, Gov. Jay Inslee pushed back Thursday against suggestions he won't have his full attention on Washington when the Legislature starts next Monday. 'I have a fantastic story to tell, and that's the story of Washington state,' Inslee said of his plans to speak at events around the country. He hasn't officially announced a run, but is exploring adding his name to a growing pool seeking the Democratic nomination. This weekend he will be the keynote speaker to a conference of progressive activists in Nevada. On Jan. 22, he will talk about fighting climate change to two colleges in New Hampshire. He has registered a political action committee, the Vision PAC, with the Federal Election Committee and started accepting contributions.

On Thursday, the House voted 244-180 to pass a Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development spending bill and 243-183 to pass an Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal 2019. The votes come after the House passed a Financial Services spending bill on Wednesday. A vote on an Interior-Environment appropriations bill is planned for Friday. The Senate has no plans to hold a vote on any of the bills.

Those on the left calling for higher taxes have frequently pointed to tax rates in place before President Ronald Reagan took office, to argue they are not unprecedented. But free-market conservatives have argued there were more loopholes in the '60s and '70s, meaning most high earners didn't actually pay those ultra-high rates.

GRAHAM: Well, what President Obama did, he didn't declare a national emergency about the DACA recipients. He took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1.8 million people. Ever president -- not every, a lot of presidents have declared emergencies. After 9/11, we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency.
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you suggesting that if the president did not abide by a resolution if it were to be passed by the House, by Congress, that you would potentially add that to articles of impeachment against him?
Those seeming oddities occur because FEMA's index scores how often disasters strike, how many people and how much property are in harm's way, how vulnerable the population is socially and how well the area is able to bounce back. And that results in a high risk assessment for big cities with lots of poor people and expensive property that are ill-prepared to be hit by once-in-a-generation disasters.

HUCKABEE: It's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. Some people eat their soup louder than others. It doesn't mean their soup tastes better. Some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. But the point is, if Donald Trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. But if it happens with Biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a Catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion.

There will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the American people soon after Biden's inauguration.

Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now.
UPI: A Texas sheriff is taking on speeders in his county by placing cardboard cutouts of deputies next to roads rife with lead-footed drivers. Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody tweeted a video showing one of the cutouts, which he said depicts one of the department's real-life deputies, giving the appearance of a police presence next to a road in the Fern Bluff neighborhood of Brushy Creek. 'It's a creative way to solve a problem without really working the problem,' Chody told KTCB-TV. Chody said the cutouts, which depict the deputy pointing a speed-measuring radar device at the road, look like a real deputy at first glance. â€¦ He said the department tested out the cardboard deputies by placing them near school zones, with real deputies waiting nearby to observe the results. 'We didn't get one speederâ€¦' Chody said.
It's official. By executive fiat, President Obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the United States.
According to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.
COONS: Well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. I'm grateful for the partnership of Senator Graham, now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with Senators Tillis and Booker to protect the Mueller investigation, and I think that report by The New York Times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.

They (the top five) are a low frequency, potentially high-consequence event because there's a lot of property exposure in that area, said University of South Carolina Hazards & Vulnerability Research Institute Director Susan Cutter, whose work much of the FEMA calculations are based on.

Iran is not Iraq, it's twice as big. It'd be twice as bad. We're weaker than we were 16 years ago. If President George W. Bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if Trump does, he is cooked.
However, for his mother, Kim Wedel, her life in Oklahoma halted as she pleaded for assistance and answers from Fort Hood's Army Criminal Investigation Department (CID).
What should the response be if that happens?
Some liberal commentators have warmed to the proposals. The New York Times' Paul Krugman said it wasn't clear what the Green New Deal meant, which is what makes it a good slogan.

Here's just one of his tweets. Wow, just learned in a failing New York Times that the corrupt leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me for no reason and with no proof after I fired lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze.
WALLACE: So, why was that an overreach for President Obama then but not for President Trump now?
Now, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war. And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades.
That conundrum will confront Democratic kingmakers again and again as they try to whittle down this massive field. If Trump, who had no experience in public service, can win why not someone with a lengthy background even if it's not on a national level?
Everyone needs to get out and vote, she continued. Not just you go out and vote, you need to get like 10 other people to go to the polls with you tomorrow. Vote like your life depends on it because it does.

The new year was welcomed in the capital, Tarawa, with church services and mostly quiet private celebrations.
I think there is a crisis at the border. I think it fits the definition of a national emergency. It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option.
WALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.

In this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south. The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.
So, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look at
The Sunrise Movement, a group that's helped promote the Green New Deal, swarmed the large Water Tower Place shopping mall in Chicago.
Negotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.
HOLMES: But -- but you're right --
Trump added: In California, an Air Force Veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.
The tradition stems from a Chinese-influenced belief that noise drives away evil and misfortune.
Those voters shrugged off allegations of domestic abuse made by Warnock's wife and a history of lauding the controversial Black minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose infamous God Damn America sermon rattled the first campaign of President Obama, who attended Wright's church.
WALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the president's thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from Greg Engle. By declaring a national emergency, will this open the door for future -- future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change, health care, or even gun control laws because of mass shootings? Is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge?

For you're someone like Andy McCabe, who wasn't just a garden-variety FBI agent just starting out, he was the number two and for a while the acting director of the whole FBI after Comey was fired. No one, including Andy McCabe, his FBI counsel, Lisa Page, familiar name, has denied that he lied, and he didn't lie once, he lied multiple times.
ROVE: WE can stay stuck in this and we can argue about Nancy Pelosi saying it's an immoral wall, which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when -- when Barack Obama wrote -- built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral.
By contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.

Gray: I initially didn't have an interest in pageants just because I saw it as a show. I didn't see past that final coronation night. But of course, being from the Philippines, pageantry is a world in its own. We don't have Superbowl, we have pageants. And seeing the kind of platform that it had the potential to be, that's what really drew me to pageantry. Because I was already working as a volunteer in some of my charities, and I realized what a bigger reach I could have if I went into pageantry with it. So actually, that was the main reason I pursued pageantry.
My guess is we've heard enough. It's such a weak case.

These past 12 months were the most toxic times many of us have ever witnessed. It's natural to want to relitigate the pandemic, the protests or the politics but as the old saying goes, hindsight is 2020.
In other words, people died as a result of these policies, more than a hundred and it's not just in Philadelphia. Baltimore had 348 murders last year. That's the most since 1993 and at a per capita level, it's the deadliest year on record in Baltimore.
So, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.
During the town hall, the 2020 hopeful claimed climate change was a national security issue and that the Syrian war was the first war partly caused by climate change. He also invoked God and religion in the climate change debate, saying environmentally irresponsible behavior was kind of a sin.

I'm not sure how we lost our ability to coexist, but if I had to guess, social media and the carefully curated world of the smartphone have given us a staggering sense of self-importance that tells us our opinions are the only ones worth hearing.

So far, only Ocasio-Cortez and Khanna have publicly come out against the rules package that includes the pay-go provision. A total of 218 representatives must vote 'yes' to pass the new rules, meaning that ordinarily, 18 Democrats would need to vote against the rules package in order for it to fail.

Many Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. It is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.

Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to socialism isn't limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of Medicare for All, legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industryâ€”at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.

The public outrage at GuillÃ©n's murder forced an independent review of the base, led by a five-member civilian team.

As the Congress gavels in for the 116th session the early votes will be the usual ones â€” establishing the House rules and electing the House speaker, presumably California Democrat Nancy Pelosi.

And that I should never source that worth from other people, especially strangers on social media. They don't know who I am, the length of my journey, who I am as a person. So why should I let their words define me? Or allow me to change how I view myself, or to think negatively about myself.

That sort of denial is especially true with frequent and costly flooding, he said, and is the reason only 4% of the population has federal flood insurance when about one-third may need it.
Now, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.

On Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.
Attorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not see
I also asked him about seeking an ethics opinion from the Department of Justice about whether he should recuse himself given some of the opinions he's expressed both in a memo that he sent unsolicited, challenging the obstruction of justice basis for some of Robert Mueller's investigation. He didn't make that commitment. He said it would depend on the facts at the time.

You do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. And this is unprecedented. The FBI, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a Manchurian candidate, for the Russians. But what we can say, and I -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have Mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. Michael Cohen is not going to testify before Congress. I think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. And right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. There something going on.

HOLMES: Well, I think if you cut away from the sort of conspiracy and all the invective that this New York Times article actually injects into our public discourse, what we've learned here is the mind-set of the FBI at the time. We learned nothing about the fact pattern that the president of the United States engaged in. In fact, we've known all of this for months.
SPALDING: I actually think the Iranian leadership is going to have to take a reassessment based on the strike. So, whatever language the President uses, it kind of reinforces this sense of unpredictability on - so they don't know where the line is. And if they don't know where the line is, they have to reassess. And I think you're going to see a level of stability as a result, not just in Iran. I think it sends a message to Beijing, to Moscow and Pyongyang that they need to pay attention to what the President is saying.
Members of Congress are allowed to have firearms on Capitol grounds, although there are certain places where they can't carry, such as the House chamber, Speaker's Lobby, cloakroom and the Rayburn Room.

Shutdown woes pile up as stoppage approaches longest in history - Fox News: The impact of the partial government shutdown intensified on Friday, as hundreds of thousands of federal workers missed their first paychecks since the funding lapse last month -- a situation putting rising pressure on Congress and the White House to reach an agreement to re-open shuttered agencies. â€¦ Most workers were issued their last paycheck two weeks ago, and it is unclear if and when they will receive the next. Some federal workers have had to apply for unemployment benefits and take out loans to stay afloat; while others have had to cancel trips and scale back spending in other ways. Statistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
Other rule changes proposed by Pelosi and unveiled Sunday would eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and make it easier to suspend the debt ceiling.

With that in mind, here is a realistic to-do list for House Democrats in the 116th Congress:

She is a -- I knew her first when she was a litigator in the '70s and she's always been a petite woman whose voice sometimes wobbles, but her mind is strong and it's her call. And she wears that diva t-shirt in the gym at the -- at the Supreme Court and she's a trailblazer for women. I mean -- and she'll know when it's time. She's not going to hang on if she can't function fully in the job.
Together, Ocasio-Cortez's proposals would effectively eliminate fossil fuels from most of society, destroy millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth, require 'upgrading' every home and business in America, create a national federal jobs-guarantee program, impose single-payer health care (costing trillions more), establish a new system of publicly owned banks, run up the national debt by countless trillions of dollars, and move the United States closer than ever to socialism, Justin Haskins, a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. If we don't stop it, it will destroy our economy for a whole generation of Americans.

Thanks for your comments on the current 'emergency,' but I think that your analysis is a bit off. While it may seem true that '[d]emocracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason,' in fact, as the end of the Roman Republic shows, such a tendency occurs when the legislative body (e.g., the Senate) abdicates its powerâ€”which it need not do. Today, we see our legislative branch interested in everything except legislatingâ€”which activity the executive and judicial branches are happy to take up.

And I might add here, remember that on the southern border eight congressional districts, including one Republican, none of them, including the Republican, voted for this wall, Chris. So the politics of this are very clear, its Trump, not the Republicans.
Obviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.

The president, during his address Tuesday, vowed that the wall would very quickly pay for itself in part because the cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion dollars a year â€“ vastly more than the $5.7 billion dollars we have requested from Congress. Trump added that the wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico and suggested that his offer to make the wall out of steel, instead of concrete, was a concession to Democrats.

WaPo: President Trump on Friday threw cold water on the idea of immediately declaring a national emergency to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, reversing days of signals that he might soon declare the emergency amid a protracted standoff with Democrats over a partial shutdown of the federal government. 'What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,' he said Friday afternoon, surrounded by law enforcement officials at a White House roundtable. 'I'm not going to do it so fast.' The president has defiantly said for days he might declare a national emergency to expedite construction of the wall â€” and his administration has asked agencies to begin preparations. But he has gotten sharp pushback, even from Republicans, at the notion of declaring such an emergency. His lawyers have privately warned that he could be on shaky footing with such a move, according to people familiar with the discussions.

Yes, there would be 'outrage,' Levine writes. Hollywood's Jacobins of propriety would express their horror. Screenshots of trollish old tweets (and there have been many) would make the rounds. Words like 'racist' and 'sexist' would fly a mile a minute.

I will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place.

The president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told Mitch McConnell he would sign.

PRAGER: Well, I won't -- I don't know what Adam's position is on this. But I think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. I don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.
ALDA: I plan to keep figuring out what's -- what's worth doing and having

WALTZ: No, I don't think we are. I think this was a response to stop the series of escalations. The President's made it clear that if they escalate again, our response will be overwhelming. The last thing the Iranian regime wants is a war with the United States because the thing they value the most is their own survival and they know they would be destroyed in such a conflict. They have in a whole history of escalating right up to the edge and when faced with strength, they backed down.
And Joe Biden doesn't do any of that. He bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which I think will come back to haunt him.

But I have been paying careful attention to people who are. David French (ph) in The National Review had, I thought, a particularly penetrating article on this. He pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely, say the president can declare an emergency that, quote, requires the use of armed force, he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force. That seems to me to not apply in this situation.

On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

But I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.

Inscrutable as ever, McConnell holds cards close - McClatchy: Mitch McConnell, uncharacteristically absent from deliberations as the shutdown approached the three-week mark, suddenly emerged as a player Thursday. But only for a few hoursâ€¦ McConnell had hosted a group of GOP senators in his office Thursday morning to discuss a compromise to break the impasse, but the White House quickly rejected the proposal. â€¦ McConnell â€¦ [spoke] on the phone with Trump, who agreed to legislation guaranteeing furloughed government employees would be compensated 'to ease their anxiety' as the shutdown continues. The partial shutdown is due to reach its 21st day Friday, tying the record set in 1996. What's not known is whether McConnell will gather members into his office again to discuss strategies or do as he's done the past three weeks, which is eviscerate Democrats on the Senate floor for refusing to give Trump $5.7 billion for his border wall and otherwise wait for Democrats and Trump to broker a deal.
MCCABE: We are seeing things happen every day in this country that many of us never, ever thought we'd see here -- the pursuit of political enemies and the use of the criminal justice system.
He outlined climate change and universal healthcare as some of his main priorities.
Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have argued that the cost of inaction on climate change is unsustainable. According to Sanders, the proposed solutions -- infrastructure and investment -- would boost the U.S. economy as well during a time of widespread joblessness.
If that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. Its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.
MICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He sees our poll numbers and I think it's fair to say he is scared because he knows I have the record and the resources to defeat him.
He added, You don't have to be religious to see the moral dimensions of this because frankly, every religious and non-religious tradition tell us that we have some responsibility of stewardship, some responsibility of taking care of what's around us- not to mention taking care of our neighbor... At least one way of talking about this is that it's a kind of sin.
He is accusing the president of obstructing justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey, the newspaper reported.
In addition to the new language, the proposed rules would also continue proxy voting during the coronavirus pandemic, ban lawmakers convicted of certain crimes from visiting the House floor again, and change payment rules on legislation related to the virus and climate change that previously required lawmakers to identify new revenue sources or spending cuts to fund their priorities.
The fireworks replaced last year's somewhat anticlimactic LED lightshow that ran down the facade of the 828-meter-tall (2,716-foot-tall) tower.
But even more ambitious than Medicare-for-all is what's known as the Green New Deal. While echoing the language of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Green New Deal could be an even more sprawling government and economic overhaul. Championed by groups such as the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats, the plan would aim to combat both climate change and income inequality â€“ and has been picked up by lawmakers such as Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.
Buttigieg made his remarks a day after he and other Democrats running for president discussed plans to combat climate change during a CNN town hall telecast Wednesday.

In her remarks, Pelosi said the president's statements during the partial shutdown have been full of misinformation and even malice, and accused the administration of practicing cruel and counterproductive policies at the southern border.

And in this particular situation with Iran they have neither. None of those three and all their decisions are bad in their case.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reignited the call for a Green New Deal during her surge to Congress in the midterm elections. Her plan is a lofty one, calling for the federal government to invest trillions of dollars. In turn, she says, millions of high-wage jobs will be created. She compared her plan to the Marshall Plan, or the European Recovery Plan, where the U.S. gave around $15 billion to help Western Europe recover in the aftermath of World War II.

Castro, who made stops in Iowa and Las Vegas days before his announcement, now joins what could be a crowded Democratic field.

On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.

In 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.

INGRAHAM: Yes, and even Merkel was saying, it was justified. But I want to go back to this point because I am not a neoconservative. I do believe we have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure and the American people clearly don't want that; we're never going back to those days Those days are over. The Republican Party and they don't want that anymore. Maybe people at defense contractors want it and make a lot of money, I understand that, but that's what not the people want.
Ocasio-Cortez's commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a Green New Deal. According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.

President Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision.

He's not out there. He's not doing it. It endangers the public. It's irresponsible. It's dangerous to the police officers to put their lives on the line on a daily basis to go out and arrest people. It's a shame.
Now two years later, Obama was elected in part on his promise to pull us out of Iraq. Of course, Obama took a completely different approach. He made things worse. He thought that as long as we ended combat operations in Iraq, we could bribe Iran to get better behavior from Iran. So, the $1.7 billion was the settlement of a decades old arbitration claim between the U.S. and Iran. An initial 400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets, January 17th. Now that's the same day, Tehran agreed to release four American prisoners.

Quick question for you: How did Nancy Pelosi manage to get herself elected Speaker of the House once again? My understanding is/was that you need to receive a majority to win â€¦ 218 votes of the 435 total; but I caught part of a report on the radio wherein a pundit was stating (I think) that she received less than 218 and even had to have some Reps abstain from voting in order to have enough votes to win. Is this true? Can you win with less than 218? And if so, exactly how close was her 'by the skin of her teeth' victory anyway? â€“ Bob Nelson, Norwell, Mass.

The race in Georgia should have been a referendum on the Democrats' agenda. Voters should have chosen between GOP policies that have built our country up, creating jobs and opportunities, versus Democrat policies that aim to punish successful Americans. Policies that protect traditional rights and freedoms versus those that allow a censorious mob to decide what Americans can or cannot say. Policies that aim to make all neighborhoods safe, including those populated largely by minorities, versus attempts to defund the police and let criminals out of jail.

So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.

The larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.

'I'm going to do a thorough assessment about running for governor (in 2020) or Senate in 2022, but I'm not ready to make either decision,' McCrory said.

It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.

At the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.

Manchin considering returning to W.Va. for gubernatorial run - W. Va. Metro News: U.S. Senator Joe Manchin is once again considering running for Governor of West Virginia, according to several people who are familiar with the Senator's thinking. When asked Friday about his interest in the governor's race, Manchin fired a shot across [Jim] Justice's bow. 'The state of West Virginia deserves and needs a full-time governor,' he said. Manchin is already getting calls about 2020, some from Democrats who themselves are thinking about running for Governor and want to know his plans and some from West Virginians encouraging him to run. Also, he could run for Governor while continuing to serve in the Senate. â€¦ [T]he idea keeps surfacing and the dynamism of the legislative session that just started in Charleston is far more appealing to him than the protracted partial shutdown that's now gripping Washington.
Over time, there have been differing opinions on just what a Green New Deal should tackle â€“ and how it would meet its goals. However, some critics of the plan, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have thrown some shade at the proposal.

Now, two more Democratic Socialists will join Sanders in Congress on Thursday -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the mantle, while Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). And while Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib represent only a sliver of the Democratic Party's new majority in the House, they have attracted outsized media attention and are pushing policies with dozens of supporters.
The new Congress will be sworn in on Sunday. The House will vote on whether Pelosi will remain speaker. Her majority is much slimmer, in part due to a record number of GOP women being elected in November.
As for President Trump, his reputation and his extraordinary support among Republicans, as well as his chances of running in 2024, have been dealt a serious blow.

I promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks. I worked in Naco, Ariz., for ten years. We didn't have physical barriers in Naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.
Progressives fought for the exceptions of the budgeting rules to open the door for their high-priced legislation, like Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Omar also praised the new rule that curbs the ability for the minority party, in this case the GOP, to bring a Motion to Recommit to the House floor with language changes to legislation that is about to be passed by the majority.
Can they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got Bloomberg's record? And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down. He's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that Democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?

Habitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught. With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.
McConnell continued: The past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president. For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution.
WALLACE: And -- and in 30 seconds, is Bernie Sanders a suicide pact?
But the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.

CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is dangerous now to allow the president of the United States to grow in war powers, undermining those checks and balances, because you may have a sober, deliberative president like President Obama, but the next one could be an impulsive, capricious, un-strategic thinker like President Trump.

However, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.

The Trump administration's expectation is that you will devote yourselves to preparing articles of impeachment against the president, hoping that you will replicate the deadly overreach of the Gingrich-era House GOP.

Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.

MICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the new members in the House and a rising Democratic star, has pushed universal health care as well as a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive Green New Deal that she said would be a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.
In past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.

At the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collectiveâ€”which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of votersâ€”in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.

The Heritage Foundation attempted to use the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the Green New Deal. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model.
A draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.

In 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. In 2018, last year, you and most Senate Democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.

A higher minimum wage reduces the family income of business owners to the extent that firms' profits are reduced, the CBO report said. Real income is also reduced for nearly all people because increases in the prices of goods and services weaken families' purchasing power.

One of the challenges of negotiating with President Trump, as Lindsey Graham knows better than anyone else, is I feel like I've signed up for the Trump of the day club. I don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. It was Senator Graham who famously talked about Tuesday Trump and Thursday Trump when he and Senator Durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to President Trump last year, he embraced on Tuesday and then walked away and announced it on Thursday.
Having said all that, I'm going to ask the FBI director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the Russians? I find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the FBI, McCabe and that crowd. I don't trust them as far as I throw them.
With today's changes, the majority is seeking to silence views they are afraid of with no regard for this institution or the American people's trust in our constitutional responsibility to govern, and govern well, he said, according to Roll Call.
From my standpoint, the gender-neutral language is just consistent with an effort for the House, in the best tradition of the House, to reflect the gorgeous mosaic of the American people in the most sensitive fashion possible, Jeffries told reporters when asked about the language. And the House, of course, is designed to be the institution closest to the American people to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the aspirations, the fears, concerns, anxieties, in the words of the framers the passions of the American people.
It's not easy to make a new coalition, but that's exactly what your party needs you to do right now. With a mix of suburban moderates and urban left wingers your new majority has new clear mandate other than to be a check on Trump, and even there, as we discussed above, it's a matter of degree.

WALLACE: And briefly, sir, I want to pick up on the conversation I was having with Senator Graham, given Justice Ginsburg's recent illness, the fact that she is going to be turning 86 in March, it's only understandable that there would be some discussion about the possibility of replacing her at some point.
And then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA. So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California.

In anticipation of the move, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Tuesday that the administration's action will hurt both U.S. automakers and American families. He said California would fight the administration in federal court.
The liberal media will be quick to blame President Trump, and indeed he bears some responsibility. Though he made two trips to the Peach State to stump for the GOP candidates, and just the night before the vote held an energizing rally for thousands of supporters, he also muddied the waters with ongoing charges of election fraud and by picking fights with Georgia officials.
WALLACE: President Trump in May of 2017 mentioning the Russia investigation as a reason he fired FBI Director James Comey. The New York Times now reports that was one of the reasons the FBI launched a counterintelligence probe into the president.

Other news outfits explained Warnock's endorsement of Jeremiah Wright and other disturbing messages, which the Democrat senator-elect calls truth-telling. An admiring piece in the New York Times, for instance, notes that Loeffler's campaign used his sermons to try and paint him as a 'radical' â€” and their claims have often been labeled by fact checkers as misleading. That, even as the Times acknowledges that Warnock has written that white churches had been active and complicit participants in slavery, segregation and other manifestations of white supremacy.
So, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.
But it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.

INGRAHAM: They're not even making any sense. Yes, he is a bad guy, but. If Ronald Reagan was the great communicator, Trump could be the great revealer. At every turn he is forcing Democrats to stumble all over their words, completely contradict what they said five minutes ago, and also the media, they are showing their true colors as well. In this case, they seem to be standing with Iran's sovereign right to exist to foment terror around the world.
Other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.

HOLMES: Well, it's -- I think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn't see eye to eye with his conference.

And instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, Nancy Pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall. That's ridiculous.

Those disaffected Republicans were somehow convinced that not voting in the senate races would punish those who had stolen the presidential race from Donald Trump in November.

In what has become an annual tradition, Trump will pre-tape an interview to be aired with Fox News' Sean Hannity. Last year, Trump spoke with CBS's Margaret Brennan, but skipped the interview with NBC in 2018, after the White House and NBC, which had the telecast, could not come to an agreement.

Bloomberg: President Donald Trump's trade war with China will force many U.S. companies to join Apple Inc. in announcing lower than expected earnings, the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers said. 'It's not going to be just Apple,' CEA chairman Kevin Hassett said in an interview on CNN. 'There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have sales in China that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.' Hassett argued that a softer economy in China is cutting into U.S. companies' sales there and that the economic pain gives Trump leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. 'That puts a lot of pressure on China to make a deal,' he said.

There is a lot of room in between. There is a lot of options. That is not on the table and nor does the President need authorization to defend our embassies, to defend our troops to strike back and to stop this escalation. He's absolutely right.

Roll Call: A proposed House rules package wouldn't just reinstate the old rule that let the chamber avoid separate votes on the statutory debt ceiling 20 times in three decades starting in 1980. The new rules offered by House Democratic leaders, set for floor debate Thursday, would turbocharge the old 'Gephardt rule' into something completely new. It would allow the chamber to spin off a resolution 'suspending' the debt ceiling to the Senate, without a House vote, once the House adopts its own version of a budget resolution. That's a stark departure from the previous Gephardt rule, named for former House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., which required the House and Senate to jointly agree on the same budget resolution in order for the House to avoid what is typically a difficult vote on the debt ceiling. â€¦Congress will have to address the debt limit later this year after a temporary suspension of borrowing authority expires March 1.
However, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, Democrats sing a much different tune. Many of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.
So here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?

Charlotte Observer: The Republican in the nation's last undecided congressional race asked a North Carolina court Thursday to require that he be declared the winner because the now-defunct state elections board didn't act. A lawsuit by GOP candidate Mark Harris claims the disbanded elections board had been declared unconstitutional, so its investigation into alleged ballot fraud by an operative hired by the Republican's campaign was invalid. The elections board was dissolved Friday by state judges who in October declared its makeup unconstitutional but had allowed investigations to continue. A revamped board doesn't officially come into existence until Jan. 31. â€¦ The investigation is continuing, however, with Harris being interviewed Thursday as all other U.S. House winners were sworn into office in Washington. Democratic leaders in the U.S. House have said they won't allow Harris to take office because of the ongoing investigation. The U.S. Constitution makes the House the judge and final arbiter of its members' election contests.

President Trump decided that the status quo was unacceptable. He was and is correct. Now, I want to say it's very important. You know my views on these endless wars.

[Ed. note: It is said that pain is the touchstone of all spiritual growth, and I think that applies to political reform as well. Perhaps we have not yet hurt badly, deeply or long enough to be ready to embrace substantive changes to our system. Issue-based arguments are becoming increasingly fruitless because the larger mechanisms that make up our constitutional process are breaking down. There is a time coming, I believe, when people across the political spectrum will embrace the concept of systemic reform rather than narrow ideological combat.]
You don't have to know what you want, you just have to make sure that the incumbent president gets the blame for whatever goes wrong. But you also have to have some kind of an economic agenda. Markets may look like the inside of a rental car after a Myrtle Beach bachelor party, but the president still enjoys a substantial advantage when it comes to his handling of the economy.
The first signal Trump has given that he may be willing to talk about the wall impasse came Tuesday, when he tweeted, Let's make a deal? He's invited Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to a White House meeting Wednesday on border security.

Kraushaar: Warren, Booker already making rookie mistakes - National Journal: As the first leading contender to announce her intent to run for president, Elizabeth Warren has drawn ample scrutiny over her decisions. From publicizing the results of a much-mocked DNA test showing a trace of Native American ancestry to announcing her candidacy before the New Year when few were paying attention, there's plenty to second-guess. But more consequential than these tactical decisions is the big-picture strategy that a candidate adopts. And Warren, in the run-up to her announcement, has concluded that she can't deviate from an agenda embraced by the party's progressive activists. When moderates (and conservative Democrats) make up over half of the Democratic electorate, and in a prospective field filled with progressive candidates, such down-the-line liberal orthodoxy threatens to be a major political blunder.

The 85-year-old's absence this week from oral arguments -- her first since joining the bench -- after her surgery in December sparked speculation about a possible departure, and even led to low-key planning by the White House for that scenario.

Georgia's Senate runoff contests were viewed by left and right as critical to the future direction of the country.

Instead, they warmed to Warnock's alarms about police brutality and promises of criminal justice reform. Warnock hewed closely to the platform of President-elect Joe Biden, with vague promises about investing in infrastructure, investing in climate and in education; if voters wonder where the money will come from to fund these initiatives, a visit to his campaign website will not satisfy their curiosity. There is, understandably, no mention of taxes.

It's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. A stunning Gallup poll last summer showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. The term Democratic Socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of Bernie Sanders, who identifies as one. The enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.

These aren't Democratic positions, they are American positions. But only one party will ensure they come to life: the Democrats. These are all positions and policies Biden will be able to tackle if Democrats also control the senate.
As a consumer of political content, I'm sure you've already been inundated by articles and TV segments analyzing the importance of the Georgia Senate run-off elections on Tuesday. Control of the Senate means, in no uncertain terms, that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to bring their agenda to lifeâ€¦ or not.
Barr looks to assuage Senate Dems' Mueller worries - WaPo: Attorney general nominee William P. Barr tried Thursday to assuage Senate Democrats' concerns he might be too biased to oversee the special counsel's Russia probe, but lawmakers said they would need to hear his answers under oath before they could consider backing his nomination. â€¦ Barr has been facing questions from Democrats and Republicans about his previous statements regarding Mueller's probe, particularly a 2018 memo blasting Mueller for examining whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice in his decision to fire James B. Comey from his post as FBI director. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), another committee member, said that during his meeting with Barr, he asked the nominee to prepare before Tuesday 'a complete, thorough and accurate description of what led to his Mueller memo.'

This is as The New York Times reported that the FBI allegedly looked into whether or not the president was secretly working on behalf of Russia during and following the 2016 campaign, a suggestion that drew a scathing rebuke from the president's attorney John Dowd who wrote The New York Times story is an unwitting disclosure and verification of the utter corruption of their oaths by Comey and his colleagues to undermine the free election of the president of the United States.

So, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. I am going to support him. Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.

You know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.
We're not only learning about different cultures which, you know, teaches us understanding, but we also broaden our view of the world. And I think that's an amazing thing. Because with that, we're given the platform to share our experiences. And if we can share a message of inclusivity, of understanding and respect, I think that in itself is a really great thing, too.

If President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?

President Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.

But, you know, let me pick up with you, Michael, on the point I was making with Mayor Buttigieg. You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. And, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Biden and Bloomberg about to get into it.

WaPo: House Republican leaders on Thursday stepped forward to criticize Rep. Steve King for defending white nationalism... King, who won a ninth term in Congress in November, lamented in an interview with the New York Times that the term had become a pejorative one. 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization â€” how did that language become offensive?' King said in the interview, which was published Thursday. King later issued a statement in which he sought to walk back his remarks. He said he rejects 'those labels and the evil ideology that they define' and proclaimed himself 'simply a Nationalist.' â€¦ And Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), who backed King during the last campaign and appeared with him on the campaign trail, has said she will not endorse him this time, telling an NBC affiliate in Des Moines that 'the last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close.'

Dear Sir, As an ever-increasingly frustrated member of the sane middle, your commentary regarding the president's ability to declare an emergency and Congress's sudden abhorrence of the power they gave him hit all my sweet spots. But what do you think the chances are that: A) Republicans will denounce it if it happens? B) Democrats who denounce it if it happens will, in turn, denounce it if their future president attempts it? I suspect the answer to both is nil. â€“ Jeffrey L. Greek, Jacksonville, Fla.

Fox News reached out to nearly two-dozen Democrats seen as potential 2020 candidates to ask about their position on the Green New Deal. Some voiced support for the plan or pointed Fox News to prior statements of support, though most did not respond to the requests for comment or declined to comment -- leaving open the possibility that more potential candidates could lend their support in the coming weeks.

Earlier this week, House Democrats formalized proposals for a new committee on climate change, but without the features that proponents of a Green New Deal have sought -- such as the power to subpoena and the authority to vote on legislation and send it directly to the House floor.

In one instance in 2019, the House was on its way to passing a bipartisan gun background check bill. Rep.

But for all of Biden's goodwill and effort in this arena, it is obvious that Republicans have no interest in working with him. Biden can make all the overtures he wants, McConnell has been clear. He sees Democrats as the enemy.
We need to act on climate change and a Green New Deal, which is broadly defined as combining policies that reduce emissions and help people economically, is a smart approach. I am less interested in slogans and branding than I am in real policies, which is what I'm running on. The details really matter., Delaney said in a statement to Fox News. The best start is the bipartisan one I introduced in Congress with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICD) - a carbon tax with revenues going back to the American people through a dividend. This plan can result in a 90% reduction in GHG by 2050 by changing behavior, encouraging innovation in new technologies and using market forces to reduce emissions.

But preparations go beyond public statements as Brown's longtime aide and current chief of staff, Sarah Benzing works backstage to set up a campaign â€” with a particular focus on Iowa, where she grew up and worked on a series of congressional, Senate and presidential efforts earlier in her career. â€¦ And she has spent the weeks since Brown's reelection to the Senate â€¦ calling her Iowa network, seeking advice and operatives to staff a Brown presidential bid.

Liberal democracy of our kind is messy, complicated and asks a great deal of citizens. Dictators ask much less of the governed, at least until they start the long, inevitable march toward oppression. Congress has not devolved its powers irrationally. It's hard to get re-elected if you address difficult questions. It's hard to raise money from powerful interests if you are independent and honest. Ceding issues that are likely to upset primary voters and donors to the other two branches takes the pressure off. The rise of authoritarianism logically follows.

Medicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. Such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the U.S. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the British National Health Service. Their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite ObamaCare's goals. And while Medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of Americans.
COONS: Well, frankly, I think the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end.

I'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.
But make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez's radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America's economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't simply want to tweak our existing system, she wants to complete Barack Obama's goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.
CARLSON: So my sense of it is, the President doesn't seek war and he is wary of it, particularly in an election year, but I think he was elected on the promise that he would avoid wars except when absolutely necessary.
I will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.

We have also had periods of much deeper chaos, including a period between the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the American defeat in Vietnam in 1975. It has been worse before and in the not too distant past. We can do this and I believe the current trials and tribulations will result, as they did before, in a renewal of our commitment to republicanism and democracy.]

Pretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean? It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.
At the time, the distraught Block family â€“ at their home in Vidor, Texas â€“ were informed that Block died from a friendly fire gunshot through the heart. Yet after viewing the body at a local funeral home, Shonta questioned the official cause of death.
Hammill argued that federal law already provides for a kind of pay-go mechanism that requires OMB to offset the cost of deficit-increasing legislation by forcing indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts in federal mandatory spending. Without enacting the separate pay-go rule provided by the Pelosi-backed rules package, Hammill suggested, the Trump administration could simply overrule congressional Democrats. (Mulvaney has also been named acting White House chief of staff, in addition to his OMB duties.)

But with Trump dug in over the $5 billion he wants to build the wall, the shutdown could drag on. Senate Republicans are reluctant to consider the House bills unless they know the president is on board.
Indeed, the question that has long dogged such proposals is how to pay for it all. But the answer has typically avoided specifics, instead arguing that America has found ways to pay for other gargantuan costs in the past. In a follow-up FAQ, one explainer says the plan would be funded by the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.
JOHNSON: And yes, there are still people leaking inside the administration, trying to undermine his policies.
But, the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would re-open government â€“ over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall â€“ a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for, Pelosi continued.

Still, corralling a large House majority has never been easy, and Democrats are ushering in the largest class since the Watergate era.

Also, in the run-up to the election, the release of a phone call in which Trump exhorted Georgia Secretary of State to find 11,780 votes to give him the state likely turned off a number of Republican voters fed up with our mercurial president. Exit polls indicate that 63% of self-described moderates voted for Warnock, whose agenda does not promise moderation.

Of course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There is no evidence that Iran started behaving any better after the deal and in no serious Republican or Democrat is even attempting at this point to argue that.

First, they're telling us it's no big deal. Then they're highlighting the people who are mourning his death. They said that Trump doing this might have been a wag the dog effort to distract from impeachment. Last week supposedly he couldn't wait for impeachment, which is why Nancy Pelosi had such leverage. They can't stick with a particular storyline and it's making them looking like the only thing that they are consistent, and it is what they're consistent about, is opposition to Trump.
What we do today is even more consequential, because of what's happening in our country, he added during his address.

Which Republicans might run against Trump in 2020? Too soon to say - WashEx: Renegade Republicans intent on upending President Trump in 2020 are keeping their powder dry, waiting to see if legal and political controversies drive him from office first. â€¦Republicans who oppose Trump's re-election are eyeing June as the approximate moment for deciding on a primary challenge or independent bid. It's a strategic delay. Some Republicans think the weight of multiple investigations could motivate the president to exit the White House after one term â€” especially if special counsel Robert Mueller issues a politically damaging report. â€¦ The Republicans most often listed as possible Trump challengers are outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran in 2016; Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who is up for re-election next year; Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah â€¦ Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan; and former Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who sources say are unlikely to run.

Do not forget Abe Lincoln. He confiscated funds designated for another expenditure to use for war preparations without Congress' consent. He suspended habeas corpus without the consent of Congress. He signed an arrest warrant for Chief Justice Roger Taney because Justice Taney told him he could not suspend habeas corpus without the consent of Congress. The U. S. Marshall refused to serve it. Lincoln ordered the arrest of members of the Maryland legislature suspected of being southern sympathizers. He sent troops to arrest Missouri's legislators. He summoned the state militias without consent of Congress that resulted in the secession of Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina. He arrested 13,000 without ever charging them. He sent federal troops fresh off the battlefield at Gettysburg to quell the riots of the Irish in New York City shooting them down in the streets. Before we talk of Wilson, Roosevelt, Nixon or Trump, discuss the originator of the empirical presidency. Of course, you can say that was a real emergency. It was, but he could have called a special session of Congress like Roosevelt did after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, but he did not. â€“ Bill Billips, Palm Harbor, Fla.
On Thursday, Trump plans a personal visit to the Mexican border, where his administration said an illegal immigration crisis has been worsening by the day.
You can cut the hypocrisy with a knife. Of course, the left is confident you won't notice it's really all about money and votes.
Administration figures have shown that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials also have said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.
WILLIAMS: He said Mexico will pay for this this.
WALLACE: But Bill Barr -- wait a minute -- Bill Barr says that that kind of conversation, even if it's to the whole world, not getting on the phone with Bill Barr undercuts his authority and makes it impossible for him, Bill Barr, to do his job.
CBS News: A member of the Republican National Committee, fearing primary challengers to President Trump in the wake of incoming GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's scathing op-ed, is urging fellow committee members to change the rules to thwart intra-party threats to Mr. Trump in 2020. In an email obtained by CBS News, Jevon O.A. Williams, the national committeeman for the Virgin Islands, urged fellow elected RNC members â€¦ to close 'loopholes' in the nomination in a way that would make it tougher for even token challengers to Mr. Trump to enter the fray. â€¦ Williams also called for a resolution to declare Mr. Trump the presumptive nominee in 2020, calling for both of those moves to take place at an RNC winter meeting later this month.
They actually posed this question to Congress.
Look, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. And, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.
But I do think what we can all agree on is that the Mueller investigation should reach its conclusion --
SANDERS, BUTTIGIEG ARE WINNING THE 2020 CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING RACE
We don't careâ€¦ yet. For now, you just need to be a person who can credibly campaign and at least be considering a run.
Should he gain traction in the other two polls, Steyer will debate alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Enough Democrats agreed to the GOP provision to have it inserted in the final bill. Collins still voted no on the legislation, which was never signed into law.
Conventional wisdom holds that Republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are Democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. Yes, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 Republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. Of the 15 Democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were former governors.
Who benefits from this? It's hard to see who benefits from it, except the people getting out of jail.

President Trump has stated tonight, and, over and over again in recent weeks, that this country faces a national emergency, said Sanders, who is said to be considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Well, he's right. But it's an emergency and a crisis that he himself has created.

It also can't help that Twitter has taught us to hate dissenting views as a form of currency. The Smart Phone Fight Club rewards the snarkiest posts with the highest dosages of digital dopamine, aka likes.

Are any of you not running for president? You are not as bad as the Senate where 11 Democrats are running or may run for president, but you've got five current or former members dipping toes in the presidential waters.
But there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of Washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, Bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the President wants.

JOHNSON: I'm not sure what else John would really add to this. I haven't spoken to him since - we really talking about Ukraine. We share the same position, but from my standpoint, President Trump has been unbelievably consistent in why he had reservations about Ukraine. And it starts as a candidate when he didn't think Europe was doing enough in their own defense. And then, throw that into that mix, the corruption of Ukraine.
Even so, there will be at least four serious contenders in the Senate that will make life much harder for Sen. Chuck Schumer as he tries to overcome his members' personal ambition for the good of the party overall.

WALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? Or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where Barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the Justice Department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the White House and Justice?

We have heard over and over again from Democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to President Trump? Why won't any of his people stand up to President Trump? Then Bill Barr does that with a brush back pitch that I think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.

CARLSON: So there was that and he won a vote or two with that unusual argument. His other argument was that voters should vote for him based on his identity.

Warren's visit to the Granite State came days after a bill in the New Hampshire legislature to change the name of Columbus Day to indigenous people's day received its first committee hearing.
If you really want to tie Trump down, keep him at the negotiating table and make him do the part of the job he obviously dislikes. The current shutdown provides a pretty good blueprint for how Democrats can keep the president hunkered down.
ROVE: Yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of Comey. This was leaked to The New York Times, which says something about the culture inside the FBI. The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.

CARLSON: So I don't think there is any topic on which there is a greater divide between what the majority of citizens of all parties, all colors say they want and what they get from the people in charge. Why is this complicated for our leaders?
WILLIAMS: No, that was fencing. It was fencing and barriers, not wall.
And the same thing with North Korea, these sanctions are sharvy North Korea and all of the cards, everybody is hysterical Laura, but the cards - if you just look at it dispassionately or on our side with Iran, with North Korea, with China, it will just calm down and let these things play out. We're the ones with the sanctions. We're the ones with a strong economy. We're the ones with the largest military.

Trump asked.
WALLACE: Which indicates that the shutdown's going to go on a long time.
GRAHAM: I just talked to them about 30 minutes ago. He says let's make a deal. They did not turn down wall for the bridge, that's not that story line. I tried to see if we could open up the government for limited period of time to negotiate a deal and the president says, let's make a deal, then open up the government.
It follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.

Pelosi, 78, faced early opposition from some in her own party who called for a fresh generation of guidance.

There was more cleavage on that stage than the San Andreas fault, Laura. I could not believe some of these outfits.
And what do Golden Globes, that ridiculous awards ceremony, tell us about the next election, if anything? Stay tuned.
The expansive Green New Deal proposal has floated in Democratic circles for years but was given new life by the Sunrise Movement and liberal lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez. The package would focus on income inequality and climate change, combining ideas incorporated in former President Franklin D.

But once you get to the tippie tops, on your ten millionth, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.

Gillibrand looks for upstate cred with campaign headquarters - [Albany] Times Union: Campaign representatives for Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand signed a lease for a 5,000 square foot space in downtown Troy, according to a local Democratic operative â€” a sign the recently re-elected Albany native could be basing a presidential campaign in the Capital Region. It was unclear which building the space is located in, and Gillibrand, who lives in the Troy suburb of Brunswick, has not officially announced she would run in the 2020 presidential race. But a Troy-based headquarters would be a nod to Gillibrand's familial roots in the area, which she represented in Congress before winning a Senate seat in 2010.

COLLINS: Laura, you just told me something amazing, that they actually attempted to keep this up. They never attempted to keep this up. The moment after it was signed, they were still traveling. Soleimani was traveling. They were still testing their weapons. They were still running the centrifuges. This was simply an appeasement by the Obama administration. The president had to clean it up. In this essence, he did. And what we've got also to think about now is Iraq is being run by Iran. This is what we have to understand.

Near Paris, climate demonstrators blocked a shopping mall and gathered in from of Amazon's headquarters to protest over-production they say is killing the planet.
INGRAHAM: I don't like this idea of this hanging out over him during an election. That would be kind of a strategy on the part of the Democrats albeit a weak one. So, how do you avoid that?
For Democrats, supporting marijuana legalization is a way to mobilize young and minority voters. For all their charges that Republicans are in the pocket of Big Pharma, marijuana will become a booming industry that will endear many cannabis workers, investors and users of the drug to the Democratic Party and its candidates.
We shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added.
Both Block and Norris were members of the 401st Military Police Company and believed to have been in a secret relationship; it was prohibited under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But it turned tragic in a war zone more than 7,000 miles away.

I would like to see a complete investigation that isn't only focused on sexual trauma because there are a lot more issues at that base. It needs drastic oversight.

WALLACE: Attorney General Barr and former FBI official Andrew McCabe finding one thing they can agree on as both complain about President Trump weighing in on Justice Department investigations.
If you had a nickel for every time a Democrat used arguments about science in discussions about climate change, you'd be rich. Scientific studies about the existence of climate change â€“ be it man-made or naturally occurring â€“ are often used as cudgels against opponents of the left's radical environmental agenda or international regulatory regimes like the Paris Climate Accord.
My opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questions
CARLSON: Most of what you're saying is intuitive. It's obvious. Normal people, I think, know it instinctively. So why the change? Was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? I mean, how did we get here?
And what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.
WILLIAMS: No, not surrender. See, I don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. I think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. You had two years of Republican majorities, didn't get done. You had the Senate majority leader say let's negotiate. You refused. So it's bad behavior.
WALLACE: The president tweeted right after that came out: Wow, Bloomberg is a total racist, and he expanded on that in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera.
Newsom, who is California's 40th governor, takes over the post after serving as lieutenant governor under the Golden State's former leader Jerry Brown. Under Brown, California led the nation in the battle against the Trump administration's policies on everything from immigration to climate change.

Ahead of midnight, a light show with the theme of brotherhood took place on the Arc de Triomphe monument at the top of the Champs-Elysees.
New House rules unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are completely gender-neutral, strip away GOP opportunities to force awkward votes and preserve lawmakers' ability to carry firearms at the Capitol.
A draft proposal, which calls for a select committee to be formed to create an official plan, calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture while dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources as well. It also demands a job guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one.
WALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the new tension between President Trump and his attorney general.
And I think what Trump - everybody understands, and this is what frustrates the Democrats is, he's got a very unique view of the Middle East. He's saying you know what we don't need its oil anymore, we're self-sufficient.
Pelosi is expected to regain the gavel Thursday, securing the votes to become speaker even after some new and returning lawmakers signaled they wanted new leadership. She would be the first woman to hold, then return, to the office.

They've been our enemy for like over 40 years.

Yet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.

Yet, Castro's supporters believe the three-term mayor has what it takes to clinch the country's highest public office.
Congress initially passed the PAYGO or pay-as-you-go rule in 1990 but it expired in 2002. Democrats later reinstated the rule in 2007 but former President Obama carved out room for the 2009 stimulus designed to absord the impact of the financial crisis.
[Ed. note: I will not nitpick your condemnatory descriptions of Lincoln's extra-constitutional activities as president. I take your basic point that he did exceed the boundaries of presidential authority, even in the creation of my home state of West Virginia. But suggesting that somehow Lincoln did not work through Congress in prosecuting the Civil War or that he lacked congressional authorization goes too far. I would also point out that the Constitution explicitly grants the president special powers in a time of domestic insurrection. There are many who seek to diminish Lincoln's legacy by casting him as some sort of despot, but that tends to either be sour grapes among still-unreconstructed Southerners or hot take aficionados. Lincoln's love for the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is evident. When he was visited by a delegation of powerful American leaders who had participated in a peace conference in Washington prior to his inauguration, Lincoln was urged to accommodate the demands of the secessionists. As described by one who was there, Lincoln calmly, clearly told the men lecturing him: I will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. â€¦ It is not the Constitution as I would like to have it, but as it is, that is to be defended. The Constitution will not be preserved and defended until it is enforced and obeyed in every part of every one of the United States.
PELOSI: It was a petulant president of the United States, a person who would say, I'll keep the government shutdown for week -- a month or years unless I get my way.
I think the thing about Joe Biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, Joe means well. Okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. He cares about us -- like, he has that.
WALLACE: Donna, haven't Democrats learned their lesson? Move on from impeachment and investigations?
WALLACE: OK, and I'm not going to spend anymore of this interview on that.
The mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassed
This is the movement that has, so far, stopped the government health care debacle from passing; there's no one else standing in the way. Democrats have the 60 votes they need. What else is holding things up? There is no reason for a Democrat to vote against it unless they fear for their re-election chances. And because of you, they do.
And this is what happens when you change the rules. This has come back to bite them. I predicted it would, and we'll see.
Gov. Jerry Brown declared a formal end to a three-year drought emergency in 2017, but said water conservation efforts must continue.
On Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city -- including illegal immigrants.
On the first question, all of the impeachment talk hinges on what prosecutors find or don't find. So just cool your jets. On the second question, don't get your hopes up. As your Republican predecessors discovered, contempt of Congress isn't nearly as scary for administration officials as it sounds. They're going to blow you off and voters won't care any more about your howls than they did when Eric Holder stiff-armed the House GOP.

Mayor, let's start with the numbers from the two states which are going to be holding contests over the next few weeks, put them up on the screen.

BENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less.

Apparently responding to Pelosi's widely reported comment that a wall would be immoral, Trump remarked: Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.
INSIDE NANCY PELOSI'S BATTLE FOR HOUSE SPEAKER
California Rep. Nancy Pelosi is expected to get her old job as House speaker back as the new Congress convenes Thursday. Pelosi made history as the first woman elected speaker of the House in 2007 â€“ and she will be the first lawmaker to regain the gavel in more than a half-century.
WALLACE: We'll ask Pete Buttigieg how he plans to stand out in the crowded center.
I've never heard a Republican candidate or any Republican officeholders say, you know, that's just a flat out lie actually. We have the numbers, you're wrong. Why do they never stand up for simple law and order?

So while I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world. We have to vote in 2020 and we have beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.
WALLACE: I understand, but if the White House -- if the FBI found evidence that the president was an ongoing Manchurian candidate, an agent for the Russians, you don't think that that -- they -- they'd just sit on that and --
WALLACE: All right. Kellyanne Conway, thank you. Always good to talk with you.
MILLS: It's a joke. It's a joke. I mean, I think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? So you see the Baghdad embassy protests. And to be clear, this is not just an embassy. This is a fortress. It's been a fortress since we took out Saddam in 2003 and American troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.
Emphasizing that he was not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!
That's what he stated in the White House on March 23rd.

WALLACE: These days, Donald Trump is facing the toughest set of challenges of his presidency -- the government shutdown, the new Democratic majority in the House and the special counsel's Russia probe that appears to be close to wrapping up.
Such a sweeping policy would almost certainly be dead on arrival as long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress or the White House. Krugman noted the political realities for the left, arguing that Democrats can't enact such a plan this year but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.
I did notice the clip was all Dennis Prager, by the way, so I'm going to get my publicist on this.
Your job, like the new Republican majority eight years ago, is to make the incumbent a one-term president. This approach may not be good for the country (it's not) but it's pretty much all that's left in this burned-over country that we call politics.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom said the White House has abdicated its responsibility to the rest of the world on cutting emissions and fighting global warming.
Plus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about Michael Bloomberg's rise in the polls, and accusations of sexism in the workplace.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said it's time for progressives to push for retroactive coronavirus relief, student loan cancellation, climate justice, voting rights and ending the death penalty.
It's the Democrats position of appeasement toward Iran that's endangered American interests and allies for years and years. If our position, a friend of mine gave me this idea, I wish I could claim it as my own. But if our position right now, we listen to the Democrats is that we cannot eliminate a known and unrepentant terrorist for fear of reprisals from his homeland. Then that means the situation in the region is truly hopeless.

Changing history means not just telling the same old tall tales of the free market system and the Founders. No, it's the history according to progressives.

In the past, I have assailed you with modest proposals to which you have responded that you are far more optimistic than I about America's public institutions and future. However, in your latest missive, I sense a growing cynicism or perhaps a new assessment regarding where America is heading: 'Like many great civilizations before us, America is slouching toward authoritarianism. Democracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason.' I think you are correct as far as you have gone. What you seem unaware of or unwilling to recognize is that, even though the sample of democracies is perhaps too small to draw a conclusion, 'voters' appear to get what they collectively want, have worked hard to get, and/or deserve in some inexplicable way from their leaders. â€“ Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.

The proposal would also authorize funding for the House Administration Committee to investigate election disputes underway in Iowa's 2nd District, where Democrat Rita Hart is contesting a six-vote win by Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks.

WALLACE (voice over): Ben Folds is all about breaking down barriers. Musical barriers between pop and classical.
Here's what she said in 2017 about how long she will continue as a justice.
Well, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.
Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer reached the donor threshold to qualify for the next Democratic debate in Iowa, his campaign announced Friday.
The market is pricing in recession no matter what -- the market has priced it in. Now to what extent and when? That history hasn't been written yet. â€“ Jeff Carbone, managing partner at Cornerstone Wealth, talking to Bloomberg about some scary economic indicators.
They didn't get in -- they didn't try to tip the scales of justice. They were trying to calm the community after, you know, two very horrific things occurred. So, we shouldn't put the two together.
All of that changes if we learn to show each other even the slightest modicum of respect in the New Year. I'm not asking you to abandon your core beliefs. I'm asking you to abandon the need to destroy anything in your path that doesn't agree with you and give cool a chance.

Disaster experts say people have to think about the big disaster that happens only a few times a lifetime at most, but is devastating when it hits â€” Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, the 2011 super outbreak of tornadoes, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake or a pandemic.
BAIER: We are joined by Senator Kelly Loeffler. It's a FOX News Sunday
The group posted photos and videos purportedly showing activists protesting the holiday.
California typically gets about two-thirds of its annual rainfall between December and March.
I know old habits die hard, and Goonies never say die. If you need help taking the edge off I also know a world-class radio show you can check out. (And once you get done with Brian Kilmeade's show be sure to give mine a try, too.)
Have you given any thought given how -- and I know you were concerned about how ugly the Kavanaugh hearing is, how you avoid a repeat, particularly if it comes to the situation of Donald Trump replacing a woman who has become a liberal icon?
But asked in an interview with Fox News if New Hampshire was a must-win state, Warren wouldn't directly answer.
WALLACE: But Barr said the tweets are making it impossible to do his job.
I personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. What I think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the Trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. The humanitarian crisis I think may have been what she was referring to.
Plus, President Trump has a way of revealing folks, doesn't he? For who they really are. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee, they're going to tell us how the Left and the media are now defending the world's largest state- sponsor of terrorism. I thought I'd seen it all until the last few days.
As a resolution, the Green New Deal doesn't enact any particular policies but directs Congress to pursue many goals such as universal health care, which Ocasio-Cortez seeks to achieve through Medicare for All. Conservative groups have estimated the deal would cost trillions of dollars, create an unsustainable financial burden for the economy, and burden the average household with tens of thousands in annual costs.
CHAFFETZ: Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will go
Panel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.
Fox News spoke with the beauty queen about becoming Miss Universe, why she temporarily disappeared and how she managed to feel confident while rocking a swimsuit.
MEREDITH: Barr will be forced to explain some of his decisions. He's expected to head up to the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing at the end of March -- Chris.
that? Why can't we have that debate in this country?
she'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether or
In at least a partial nod to the presumably mammoth cost that overhauling the nation's economy and energy sector would entail, it says that the financing of the Plan would be accomplished by the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the Plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.
Congressman, Democrats didn't seem to care when Obama was droning individual citizens abroad, including Americans, didn't ask for permission, didn't ask for consultation. It just happened. What is different?
This is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a century
WALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?
Look, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.
Schumer added afterward: There is an obvious solution: separate the shutdown from the arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation â€“ supported by Democrats and Republicans â€“ to re-open government while allowing debate over border security to continue.
You begin your time in the majority as you will likely end this Congress: Caught in some penny-ante fight with the administration. The current shutdown is over an absurdly small amount of money but an absurdly large portion of posturing.
These future-focused proposals reflect our priorities as a caucus and as a country -- including crushing the coronavirus, addressing economic disparity, combating the climate crisis, advancing inclusion, and promoting integrity in government.
The National Republican Congressional Committee on Wednesday criticized the comments from Democratic lawmakers, saying they are pushing for a socialist agenda.
They're set to approve a rules package on Thursday that sets a new tone for governing. For example, it requires that legislation first be considered in committees before bills are brought to the floor for votes. It bans lawmakers from serving on corporate boards. And it recognizes the diversity of the new freshmen class by easing a century-old rule against wearing hats on the chamber floor to allow Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, a Muslim-American from Minnesota, to wear a head scarf.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. â€“ all considered 2020 Democratic presidential contenders â€“ have openly endorsed marijuana legalization or encouraged states to legalize. Yet, they've all also used scientific arguments to justify their positions on climate change.
Republican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh
JOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I come from a family -- we're in an area where there is coal mining in Scranton. Anybody who could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mine sure in hell can learn how to program as well.
A pair of wins for Democrats in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff elections would ensure an all-out assault on our freedoms, our economy and our Constitution, Laura Ingraham told viewers Monday night.
Time's year in pictures review doesn't include any pictures of either the 9/12 rally or the tax day tea party protests all over the country. But these are some of the most memorable pictures of 2009.

LAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: And yes, as Hannity said, I am back. And I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from of course, we're back. So, it's a really busy Washington. Now, and moments, I am going to explain why the killing of an Iranian General Qasem Soleimani reveals Trump as a true pragmatist.
New Year's Eve without Big Ben would be positively un-British. The comforting chimes are used by TV and radio stations throughout Britain to herald the moment of transition from the old to the new year.
The disruptions will likely continue as the United Nations meets to discuss the issue in Madrid on Monday.
Another rule change hinders the minority party's ability to alter legislation through a motion to recommit. That measure prompted condemnation from Rules Ranking Member Tom Cole, R-Okla.
We need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because the
Although the billionaire and climate activist hit 225,000 unique donors on Friday, he still needs to reach the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold to secure his spot at the Jan. 14 event.
CORKE: On Twitter, Mr. Trump insisted that Democrats come back from their vacations and get back to work: I'm in the White House ready to sign. A sharp elbowed reference to the thousands of Democratic lawmakers who trotted to Puerto Rico for a retreat, where they hope to strategize ways to help the dead mired U.S. territory and even planned to see a special performance of the hit Broadway show Hamilton.

It's sort of the same subject is racism. As racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.

Joining us now from Delaware, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Later, tens of thousands of students rallied in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
And it's time now for our Sunday group.
COONS: I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.
over and over again on the trail?
Most recently, McConnell blocked a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans even though President Trump urged lawmakers to make them a reality. McConnell and other Republicans had already agreed to $600 payments and believed that a more targeted approach to assisting Americans during the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing shutdowns was preferable to sending money to everyone, including those who did not suffer losses.
HARMAN: No, and I don't think there's one person in the Trump administration who agrees with the policy. Understand that Bret McGurk, who was the special advisor dealing with the ISIS coalition --
