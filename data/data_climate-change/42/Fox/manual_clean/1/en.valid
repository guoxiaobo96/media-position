in his op-ed in the washington post, romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align u.s. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on china's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.
no, we saw during his 2012 campaign that romney did not have the steel to go the distance. after he trounced obama in the first debate between the two, romney failed to press his advantage and the second debate was a disaster for him.
while some analysts feared his wealth and lack of political experience would alienate progressives, steyer had an extensive array of advisers and strategists at the ready, owing in part to his longstanding involvement in national politics.
and yes, despite president trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that biden carried georgia. trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.
fox news' pat ward and brooke singman contributed to this report.
the remarks came after steyer -- among the prominent liberals who received a threatening suspicious package earlier in the month -- said he absolutely was blaming trump for creating an atmosphere in which anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up.
in 2013 he founded nextgen america, a political action committee and nonprofit working to combat climate change.
ossoff is a georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small-business owner. he also previously worked as a national security aide for rep. hank johnson, d-ga., handling defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and economic policy issues.
loeffler and perdue were both against additional $2,000 covid-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after trump's belated tweet storm). they have both questioned the integrity of the november election and even demanded the resignation of a fellow republican, georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger.
i implore georgians to turn history on its head and to get out the vote for democratic candidates raphael warnock and jon ossoff on tuesday. record numbers of early votes are a good sign for the two democrats, but the election will be close and now they need as many supporters as possible to vote tuesday.
negotiations to end the shutdown stalled on thursday, as trump, during his visit to the u.s.-mexico border in texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and other violent crimes.
statistics provided by the department of labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of december, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.
there is not gonna be any bend right here, trump added.

today we say to this president, 'grow up, do your job, end this shutdown,' sanders said.
i don't like that language, nadler told cnn. more to the point, i disagree with what she said. it is too early to talk about that intelligently. we have to follow the facts and get the facts.
protesters initially gathered near the afl-cio building in washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on republicans.
shutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in washington, d.c., on thursday. some near the white house chanted, do your jobs, so we can do ours.
other rallies were taking place in atlanta, denver and ogden, utah, where some 5,000 irs workers are affected by the shutdown, according to kuer npr utah. a local food bank reported that 50 percent more families have showed up this week than the last.
democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the white house and across the country on thursday, just one day before the partial government shutdown over border wall funding threatens to deny all of them their first full paycheck.
gabrielle roesch, who identified herself a government scientist, wrote on twitter: applied for unemployment....even though i have a job... surreal.
nothing could be further from the truth.
roughly 420,000 employees were deemed essential and are working unpaid. an additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. on thursday afternon, after assurances from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., that president trump will sign the bill, the senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the ongoing government shut down.
however, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.
warnock, the only black candidate in the tuesday runoff, is the senior pastor of ebenezer baptist church in atlanta, the former pulpit of the rev. dr. martin luther king jr.
that is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from romney's presidential campaign. running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.
the shutdown, which enters its 21st day friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.
although trump has said that most of the people not getting paid are democrats, he has also sounded notes of empathy during the shutdown.
he was told to stay home during the last government shutdown in 2013. but this time, he had little time to prepare for a missed paycheck or tie up loose ends with the cases he is working on, he said.
after his defeat in 2012 and in the run-up to the next election, romney made the rounds of important republican funders, looking to test their support for a re-run. i spoke to some of those folks as the 2016 contest got underway. the near-universal consensus: he had had his shot.
taking a page from trump's angry and divisive playbook filled with a mountain of lies, republican sens. kelly loeffler (running against warnock) and david perdue (running against ossoff) have gone on the attack and have falsely and ridiculously labeled their respective democratic challengers as radical socialists.
mitt romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that american voters elected donald trump.
let's call this shutdown what it is: it's a lockout, afl-cio president richard trumka shouted. shame on the senate. shame on the white house. this lockout has to end, and it has to end now.

some workers are relying on donations, including launching gofundme campaigns. a food pantry has opened up at a coast guard base in boston.
vermont independent sen. bernie sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to trump's tuesday night address from the oval office, also rallied attendees on thursday. sanders has consistently accused the white house of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration.
with two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. but if the shutdown stretches into february, he may need to take out another.
that summit, steyer promised, would be followed by an advocacy day that will include impeachment summit participants fanning out across capitol hill to hand deliver articles of impeachment drafted by legal scholars to members of congress with the simple message: 'we did half the work, now it's up to you to finish the job.'
steyer vowed in a statement to spend 100% of his time and energy focused on removing donald trump from power through the group need to impeach, which he founded in october 2017. he committed to spending $40 million on the effort to have trump removed from office in 2019.
mitt romney helped create or rebuild great companies like staples, sealy (the mattress firm) and the sports authority, creating wealth not only for his firm bain capital but also for investors. those businesses also created thousands of jobs. romney's firm also had some clunkers, but for the most part he and his partners supplied capital to entrepreneurs who took that funding and created solid and enduring companies.
in early december, steyer laid the groundwork for a political platform, speaking alongside a panel in charleston, s.c., at one of five scheduled town halls. each event focused on the five rights of his potential campaign platform, which he called the social contract for the 21st century.

all eyes are on you, georgia. the health, safety and security of the american people are at stake.
billionaire tom steyer, the outspoken liberal megadonor and former hedge fund manager who has led a campaign for president trump's immediate impeachment, will not run for president in 2020, he announced wednesday.
the two u.s. senate runoff elections that will be held in georgia tuesday will determine whether the senate will work in partnership with president-elect joe biden to build a better future for americans, or whether republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.
instead, steyer, who spoke at an event in des moines, iowa, declared that he will undertake and oversee a laundry list of activities in 2019 aimed at removing trump from office.
recall that mcconnell famously stated in 2010: the single most important thing we want to achieve is for president obama to be a one-term president.
trump again asserts power to declare national emergency during border visit
loeffler and perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge president-elect biden's victory. they agree with anything trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. they act as if they are running to be selected by trump to be his employees on the apprentice, rather than to represent the people of georgia in the senate.
mitt romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that american voters elected donald trump. he is not alone. there are reasons why many republicans are wary of too close an association with the president, and romney's op-ed detailed many of those.
i can relate, trump told reporters this weekend. and i'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. they always do. and they'll make adjustments. people understand exactly what's going on. many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what i'm doing.
the incoming administration of president-elect biden and vice president-elect kamala harris needs a senate willing to work with them to fully and effectively respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement, the existential threat of climate change, and other important challenges our nation faces.
trump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in georgia or across the united states in the november election, and i don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in georgia.
if he couldn't stand up to obama, how would romney have fared with chinese president xi jinping?
shame on mitt romney. publishing an ad hominem attack on president trump in the washington post on the cusp of occupying a senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the oval office was dishonorable. in addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about romney: that he is not to be trusted.
back in washington, democrats on thursday were blocked in the senate after trying to proceed with house-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. sen. mitch mcconnell, the republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to pointless show votes.
he thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, house speaker nancy pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the white house on wednesday. but they can't. (trump walked out of the meeting after pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.)
among steyer's goals: a multi-million dollar digital initiative aimed at informing the public and members of congress about the 10 impeachable offenses that trump has already committed, town halls across the country, and even an impeachment summit in late january that will bring more than 250 supporters from across the country to d.c. together to learn about historical precedent for impeachment.

it's in the national interest for georgia voters to follow up on their support for president-elect biden by voting tuesday to elect democrats jon ossoff and the rev. raphael warnock to the senate. both men are highly qualified. their election will give biden the democratic majority he needs in the senate to repair the enormous damage trump has caused to our nation in the past four years.
democrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid transportation security administration (tsa) officials are calling out sick at airports.
but there is a more profound reason that romney lost to obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. while president trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. maybe he thought american voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.
like warnock, ossoff supports strengthening the aca, increased covid-19 relief, criminal justice reform, and lower taxes for working families and small businesses in georgia.
although steyer seemingly won't be on the ballot in 2020, members of his team emphasized that they felt the democrats had momentum.
romney refused to go after obama on the shameful lies about the deaths of americans in benghazi, wouldn't challenge the president on his handling of the auto industry meltdown and allowed democrats to paint him as anti-female.
warnock rose in georgia politics through his vocal leadership of the campaign to expand medicaid for low-income residents of the state. he supports increased covid-19 relief funding, expanding the affordable care act (the aca, also known as obamacare), and passing the john lewis voting rights act.
but, romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. millions of americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the u.s. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected donald trump.
meanwhile, house majority leader steny hoyer said he didn't think comments like these particularly help. and rep. emanuel cleaver, d-mo., said members were aghast at tlaib, d-mich., lamenting a fever among some colleagues to impeach trump.
liz peek: let's look past the liberal media gloom factory and celebrate the good news this christmas
i am disappointed that romney chose to do otherwise.
maryland democratic sens. benjamin cardin and chris van hollen also spoke to the crowd, as did connecticut democratic sen. richard blumenthal.
warnock has been endorsed by former presidents jimmy carter (a fellow georgian) and obama, and by former u.n. ambassador and atlanta mayor andrew young. warnock is also backed by former democratic candidate for governor of georgia and georgia house of representatives minority leader stacey abrams of fair fight, a national voting rights organization rooted in georgia.
georgia is a formerly red state that turned semi-blue in november, when a majority of voters wisely cast their ballots for former vice president biden.
richard fowler: in georgia senate races, key voting bloc gives democrats excellent chance of winning
also, romney had foreign policy chops. his comments about russia being the nation's biggest threat proved prescient, even as he was mocked by president obama, who thought he knew better.
trump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in mcallen. the president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine.
it is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a gop-turncoat talking head, as ex-sen. jeff flake, r-ariz., may hope to become. last year, anti-trumper flake met with msnbc president phil griffin and cnn's chief jeff zucker, sparking speculation that post-senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.
that isn't to say that many republican voters don't regret romney's defeat. the former massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than barack obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.
unfortunately and disgracefully, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the biden administration.
but a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the american voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.
house judiciary committee chairman jerry nadler, d-n.y. -- who would oversee any impeachment proceedings -- also condemned tlaib's comments.
fox news' alex pappas and the associated press contributed to this report.
that's not romney's situation. could it be that romney wants to be at the ready in case the impeachment abyss opens up and consumes the president … and vice president mike pence at the same time? does he think he'll be the chosen favorite in case gop leaders have to go to their bench? it isn't going to happen.
so mcconnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the american people. not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. no, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt president obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the american people. you can bet every penny you have that mcconell feels the same way about our incoming president.
it's all uncertain and i don't know how it ends or resolves itself, he said. this isn't a matter of me not going to the movies or out to eat as much. i can't cut off my power or my cellphone or move out of my house.
but would mitt have done those things? would he have stood behind supreme court nominee (and now justice) brett kavanaugh while the liberal media slimed his reputation and judged him guilty of sins allegedly committed decades earlier on the flimsiest of evidence?
dems react after new congresswoman vowed to 'impeach the motherf---er'
with a new congress now seated, and a majority of democrats in the house, the power is in their hands to start the process of removing this corrupt and comprised president, need to impeach lead strategist kevin mack said in a statement. we're not backing down, and we're not letting up on our work to hold members of congress accountable until donald trump is out of the white house.

last october, trump took a personal shot at steyer, deriding him as a wacky and crazed & stumbling lunatic and asserting that if he is running for president, the dems will eat him alive!
watch: airports report longer security lines as tsa agents call out sick
steyer seemed to tie the president's rhetoric not only to pipe bombs mailed across the country by an outspoken trump supporter in florida, but also to a massacre by a lone gunman at a pittsburgh synagogue in late october.
steyer had been considered by many analysts to be a potential contender for the white house, and had taken apparent steps in that direction. in recent months he ran television advertisements in which he appeared personally to call for trump's removal, appeared at numerous political events, and even named a potential campaign manager.
as president trump visited the southern border in mcallen, texas, and declared that he will almost definitely use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks remain stalled, the demonstrations emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began dec. 22.
you have to ask, what was the senator-elect from utah thinking? that by proclaiming that president trump had not risen to the mantle of the office romney would protect himself from a trumpian taint? to what end? it's hard to imagine.
and especially after writing the anti-trump op-ed. republicans could change their minds, but at the moment a startling 89 percent support the president, according to a gallup poll.

theodore atkinson, a furloughed trial attorney in the justice department's civil division, told the associated press he is spending extraordinarily stressful days anxiously watching the news at his home in baltimore.
the best way to stop mcconnell is to elect ossoff and warnock to give democrats 50 senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 republican senators. vice president harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give democrats majority control of the senate.
truth be told, loeffler and perdue — not warnock and ossoff — are the radical candidates running in georgia. the republican candidates are out-of-touch with georgia voters and values and reject their senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic. their only loyalty is to donald trump and to their own self-interest.
most people come to iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president, steyer said in his prepared remarks. but i am proud to be here to announce that i will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.
the truth is that warnock and ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo president-elect biden's hopeful unifying message. they are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering georgians in these perilous times.
this is the biggest issue in american politics today, steyer said in his speech wednesday. we have a lawless president in the white house who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. donald trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in america — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. it is past time for members of congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. the question remaining is, what will congress do?
like massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who has announced that she's formed an exploratory committee ahead of a possible presidential run, steyer often has tangled publicly and personally with trump.
essential government workers, like tsa agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. while furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.
two large unions representing federal workers -- the american federation of government employees and the national treasury employees union -- have argued it is illegal to force workers to show up to their jobs without pay.
ladies and gentlemen, we need to keep yelling and screaming and hollering until this president opens up that government -- of the people, for the people and by the people, hoyer continued.
but, top democrats seemed less than enthusiastic about introducing impeachment articles. last week, house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., downplayed freshman rep. rashida tlaib's profanity-laced vow to impeach trump, as republicans strongly condemned the language.
the demonization of this pastor who now preaches in dr. king's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in georgia of hostility to its black residents. in fact, georgia has never elected a single black u.s. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. and yet the census bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is black.

romney would not have pulled us out of the paris climate agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. he would have been too polite to throw over the iran nuke deal, or to confront the chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our nato allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put america first.
if we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold, trump said of human trafficking. the president then took part in a briefing by border agents.
also speaking at the rally, democratic virginia sen. mark warner accused trump of using federal workers as pawns.
