As much as Pittsburgh Steelers and Cleveland Browns coaches want to downplay it, the Mason Rudolph-Myles Garrett fallout from their fight last year still lingers as the 2020 NFL season heads into Week 17.\n\nRudolph will start for the Steelers in place of Ben Roethlisberger while the Browns named Garrett a captain for the game.\n\nCleveland needs a win to secure a playoff berth for the first time in 18 years. With the 2019 incident still in the back of everyone's mind, Rudolph said he hasn't spoken to Garrett since.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nHe has not reached out to me in any capacity, Rudolph told reporters Friday, via the Cleveland Plain-Dealer. I'm happy to hear Myles out. If he wants to approach me, if he wants to talk, like I said, he's a great player. They're playing well as a defense.\n\nGarrett was suspended for the final six games of the 2019 season and may have cost himself a Defensive Player of the Year award in the process. He accused Rudolph of hurling a racial slur at him, which allegedly caused him to explode. The NFL said an investigation couldn't substantiate the claim.\n\nFLASHBACK: BROWNS' MYLES GARRETT ADMITS HE NEARLY QUIT AFTER HELMET INCIDENT, WANTS TO CLEAR AIR WITH STEELERS QB\n\nGarrett told reporters he doesn't anticipate giving Rudolph any kind of special treatment.\n\nHe'll get hit just like everybody else. I'm not going to put a pillow underneath his head before I take him to the ground. But I'm not going to do anything extra. It's just a game. It's a Steelers game. It's a divisional game. It's an important game. But going against him, it changes nothing for me, he said.\n\nAnd, just like with any other player or any other quarterback, if he reaches out his hand for me to help him up, I'm going to do it. And if I see him and he's on the ground, it doesn't change my mindset at all with him back there.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGarrett said in September he hoped to clear the air with Rudolph as the incident nearly made him quit football altogether.
Road trip? For many vacationers across the country, travel plans are jammed in neutral, as the government shutdown drags on with no end in sight. It's frustrating. It seems like we do this more and more, year after year, said Eric Kelso, a frequent parks visitor who's cutting his trip to Joshua Tree National Park short this year.\n\nMARTHA STEWART SHARES BIZARRE HACK FOR MAKING SCRAMBLED EGGS: 'THE WHITEST THING I'VE EVER SEEN'\n\nMost national parks, museums, and other government institutions remain shuttered for the time being, forcing many travelers to change their vacation plans or scrap them altogether. Sarah Ellis Sparks made a lengthy journey to Washington to explore America's history at the Smithsonian and other institutions, only to be met with disappointment instead of national treasures. They need to open everything up because people are coming from like...I'm coming from Alabama, I flew down here -- to see nothing, she said.\n\nVacationers aren't the only ones feeling the squeeze. The U.S. Travel Association reports the shutdown is costing the industry more than $100 million a day. That means tour operations need to change plans too. Some 82 percent say they've adjusted itineraries – with almost half reporting major cancellations. They're more slowed in terms of those parts of the industry. You know, the parks are open but certain portions or parts of the parks are closed down, said Zach Burau, founder of the subscription travel service Wanderlift.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nIt's a big gamble for vacationers who roll the dice and go forward with their plans. Many park visitors, like Sven Schumacher, say they need to seek out non-government services and lodging – sometimes at higher prices. They are independent of the government shutdown which was good for us and we also had to choose them because on the homepages and also on the phones the people were not available so there was a huge impact.\n\nTravel experts expect losses to keep piling up as long as the government remains shut down. If this thing goes on past a month and a half or two months, I think you will see some effects and then the severity of those effects could continue as the shutdown goes on, Burau said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA prolonged shutdown could impact travel further down the road when it comes to booking trips now. About 800,000 federal workers are expected to miss paychecks this week.\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: A previous version of this report used outdated data from the U.S. Travel Association on the impacts of government shutdowns on the travel and hotel industries.\n\nSteve Rappoport is a Newscast Producer and Anchor for Fox News Radio.

Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House and across the country on Thursday, just one day before the partial government shutdown over border wall funding threatens to deny all of them their first full paycheck.\n\nAs President Trump visited the southern border in McAllen, Texas, and declared that he will almost definitely use his emergency powers to build the wall if talks remain stalled, the demonstrations emphasized the financial strain imposed on government employees since the shutdown began Dec. 22.\n\nRoughly 420,000 employees were deemed essential and are working unpaid. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. On Thursday afternon, after assurances from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., that President Trump will sign the bill, the Senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the ongoing government shut down.\n\nStatistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.\n\nShutting down the government is not a policy that should be followed, House majority leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told a boisterous crowd of protesters in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Some near the White House chanted, Do your jobs, so we can do ours.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we need to keep yelling and screaming and hollering until this president opens up that government -- of the people, for the people and by the people, Hoyer continued.\n\nAlso speaking at the rally, Democratic Virginia Sen. Mark Warner accused Trump of using federal workers as pawns.\n\nProtesters initially gathered near the AFL-CIO building in Washington, where union leaders placed the blame squarely on Republicans.\n\nLet's call this shutdown what it is: It's a lockout, AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka shouted. Shame on the Senate. Shame on the White House. This lockout has to end, and it has to end now.\n\nTwo large unions representing federal workers -- the American Federation of Government Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union -- have argued it is illegal to force workers to show up to their jobs without pay.\n\nVermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who delivered his own rebuttal to Trump's Tuesday night address from the Oval Office, also rallied attendees on Thursday. Sanders has consistently accused the White House of manufacturing a crisis, and has argued that climate change and health care are more urgent concerns than illegal immigration.\n\nToday we say to this president, 'Grow up, do your job, end this shutdown,' Sanders said.\n\nMaryland Democratic Sens. Benjamin Cardin and Chris Van Hollen also spoke to the crowd, as did Connecticut Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal.\n\nOther rallies were taking place in Atlanta, Denver and Ogden, Utah, where some 5,000 IRS workers are affected by the shutdown, according to KUER NPR Utah. A local food bank reported that 50 percent more families have showed up this week than the last.\n\nDemocrats have increasingly sought to make federal workers the face of the shutdown in recent days, amid reports that hundreds of unpaid Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officials are calling out sick at airports.\n\nWATCH: AIRPORTS REPORT LONGER SECURITY LINES AS TSA AGENTS CALL OUT SICK\n\nHe thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said after a contentious meeting at the White House on Wednesday. But they can't. (Trump walked out of the meeting after Pelosi flatly refused to consider any spending bill that included wall funding.)\n\nAlthough Trump has said that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats, he has also sounded notes of empathy during the shutdown.\n\nI can relate, Trump told reporters this weekend. And I'm sure that the people that are on the receiving end will make adjustments. They always do. And they'll make adjustments. People understand exactly what's going on. Many of those people that won't be receiving a paycheck, many of those people agree 100 percent with what I'm doing.\n\nThere is not gonna be any bend right here, Trump added.\n\nThe shutdown, which enters its 21st day Friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. Most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.\n\nTRUMP AGAIN ASSERTS POWER TO DECLARE NATIONAL EMERGENCY DURING BORDER VISIT\n\nSome workers are relying on donations, including launching GoFundMe campaigns. A food pantry has opened up at a Coast Guard base in Boston.\n\nGabrielle Roesch, who identified herself a government scientist, wrote on Twitter: Applied for unemployment....even though I have a job... surreal.\n\nEssential government workers, like TSA agents, have been required to show up to work without pay, and have little basis for an unemployment claim, analysts said. While furloughed workers and government contractors may have stronger unemployment claims, they would likely have to return the money if Congress approves back pay to furloughed workers once the shutdown ends, as it has done with previous shutdowns.\n\nHowever, many government offices that process unemployment claims are understaffed, creating another headache for furloughed workers and contractors running low on funds.\n\nCNN REPORTER JIM ACOSTA INADVERTENTLY MAKES CASE FOR BUILDING STEEL SLATS AT BORDER\n\nTheodore Atkinson, a furloughed trial attorney in the Justice Department's civil division, told The Associated Press he is spending extraordinarily stressful days anxiously watching the news at his home in Baltimore.\n\nHe was told to stay home during the last government shutdown in 2013. But this time, he had little time to prepare for a missed paycheck or tie up loose ends with the cases he is working on, he said.\n\nWith two children and a mortgage, child support and alimony payments, Atkinson said he has taken out a personal loan to cover two paychecks, just to be safe. But if the shutdown stretches into February, he may need to take out another.\n\nIt's all uncertain and I don't know how it ends or resolves itself, he said. This isn't a matter of me not going to the movies or out to eat as much. I can't cut off my power or my cellphone or move out of my house.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNegotiations to end the shutdown stalled on Thursday, as Trump, during his visit to the U.S.-Mexico border in Texas, argued a barrier made of steel would deter human trafficking and other violent crimes.\n\nTrump, accompanied by elected officials and border agents, highlighted gun, trafficking and drug crimes along the border during remarks at a patrol station in McAllen. The president spoke in front of a table of items border agents have seized, including a rifle, handguns, a plastic bag full of cash and bricks of heroin and methamphetamine.\n\nIf we had a barrier of any kind, a powerful barrier, whether it's steel or concrete ... we would stop it cold, Trump said of human trafficking. The president then took part in a briefing by border agents.\n\nBack in Washington, Democrats on Thursday were blocked in the Senate after trying to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border wall money. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, blocked that effort, saying it amounts to pointless show votes.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Japan declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and three nearby areas on Thursday as coronavirus cases continue to surge, hitting a daily record of 2,447 in the capital.\n\nPrime Minister Yoshihide Suga issued the declaration at the government task force for the coronavirus. It lasts from Friday until Feb. 7, and centers around asking restaurants and bars to close at 8 p.m. and people to stay home and not mingle in crowds.\n\nThe declaration carries no penalties. But it works as a strong request while Japan juggles to keep its economy going.\n\nJAPANESE GOVERNORS DEMAND STATE OF EMERGENCY OVER COVID\n\nShopping malls and schools will remain open. Movie theaters, museums and other events will be asked to reduce attendance. Places that defy the request will be publicized on a list, while those that comply will be eligible for aid, according to officials.\n\nI am confident we can overcome this, but I must ask all of you to endure a restricted life for a while longer, Suga told reporters after the declaration.\n\nHe promised more aid for hospitals treating COVID-19 patients. The Japanese military is ready to help, and efforts are underway to get a vaccine approved and delivered, he added.\n\nPlease take this matter seriously as your own, to protect all precious life, your parents, your grandparents, family and friends, over generations, Suga said.\n\nCoronavirus cases have been surging in Japan following year-end and New Year's holidays.\n\nShigeru Omi, a doctor who heads the government panel on coronavirus measures, described the latest wave as explosive, requiring the emergency declaration.\n\nTokyo has logged record numbers of daily cases for two straight days, after 1,591 on Wednesday. Nationwide, cases have been growing steadily by more than 5,000 a day.\n\nSome experts say Japan should have acted sooner, and a government campaign to promote domestic travel through discounts was a mistake.\n\nOpinion on having eateries close early is mixed, since places could simply get more crowded in earlier hours.\n\nDr. Hiroshi Nishiura, an expert on infectious diseases, said the rate of increase in number of cases will decline but infections will continue to rise. He believes more drastic action is needed.\n\nVaccinations are expected to start next month in Japan, with health and essential workers first. The rollout is likely to take months.\n\nDr. Atsuo Hamada, an expert on infections and professor at Tokyo Medical University Hospital, said curtailing nighttime drinking and dining will help.\n\nWhen people go out to eat at night, they tend to get drunk, talk in loud voices and sing so airborne infections spread more quickly, he said in a recent telephone interview.\n\nKeeping COVID-19 infections under control is imperative for Japan with the Tokyo Olympics set for July. Politicians have repeatedly stressed it must go on despite an increasingly doubtful public.\n\nSPREADING VIRUS PULLS OLYMPIC TORCHES OFF DISPLAY IN JAPAN\n\nA similar state of emergency was issued last April through late May, and was eventually widened to apply nationwide.\n\nThe effort was largely effective. Japanese tend to follow orders from authorities, even without the threat of penalties. Almost everyone has been wearing masks.\n\nA legal change is needed to allow for penalties in emergency declarations, and such a move is set to be considered in parliament. A strict lockdown, like ones in Europe, is not being considered.\n\nYoshimasa Maruyama, chief economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said the economic damage from the declaration will be limited, with real gross domestic product growth likely to be pushed down by 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of 2021.\n\nThe emergency last year affected a wider part of the economy, and it coincided with the time when the economy was already struggling amid plunging global trade, he said.\n\nOther economists are projecting a slightly greater negative impact on GDP.\n\nDuring the second quarter last year, Japan's economy shrank nearly 8%, but has gradually rebounded, growing 5% in the July-September 2020 period.\n\nTrade has stagnated, although hopes are high for a gradual recovery. Some parts of Asia have not been as affected by the coronavirus as the U.S. and Europe.\n\nStill, the restaurant and hotel sectors will be slammed, and government assistance is needed, Maruyama said.\n\nShingo Sakai, who runs La Rochelle French cuisine restaurants in Tokyo, said fine dining takes more than two hours, and his customers usually don't get out of the office until after 6 p.m.\n\nWe have to keep our dining quality, and at the same time we need to keep our reputation by following the government order, he said.\n\nI have to think about cutting costs to keep the company alive. There's no place to cut costs because I did that for the last six months. There's no room for that.\n\nJapan's unemployment rate has risen, but has not shot up, hovering at about 3%. Bankruptcies related to the coronavirus total about 800 so far, high for Japan, according to Tokyo Shoko Research.\n\nBut shopping districts have been packed, a situation that has contributed to the most recent virus wave.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome 250,000 cases have been confirmed nationwide with more than 3,700 deaths, according to the Health Ministry. Hospitals are getting stretched thin.\n\nTokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike and the heads of neighboring Saitama, Chiba and Kanagawa prefectures asked the government for the emergency declaration over the weekend.\n\nWe need to now recognize that virus infections have entered a totally new stage, she said. Tokyo is making the protection of human life a top priority.
Shame on Mitt Romney. Publishing an ad hominem attack on President Trump in The Washington Post on the cusp of occupying a Senate seat that he won with the help of an endorsement from the Oval Office was dishonorable. In addition, it underscored what many voters suspected all along about Romney: that he is not to be trusted.\n\nYou have to ask, what was the senator-elect from Utah thinking? That by proclaiming that President Trump had not risen to the mantle of the office Romney would protect himself from a Trumpian taint? To what end? It's hard to imagine.\n\nIt is not as though the wealthy former private equity mogul needs to secure a future career as a GOP-turncoat talking head, as ex-Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., may hope to become. Last year, anti-Trumper Flake met with MSNBC President Phil Griffin and CNN's chief Jeff Zucker, sparking speculation that post-Senate he would become a contributor to one of those outlets.\n\nLIZ PEEK: LET'S LOOK PAST THE LIBERAL MEDIA GLOOM FACTORY AND CELEBRATE THE GOOD NEWS THIS CHRISTMAS\n\nThat's not Romney's situation. Could it be that Romney wants to be at the ready in case the impeachment abyss opens up and consumes the president … and Vice President Mike Pence at the same time? Does he think he'll be the chosen favorite in case GOP leaders have to go to their bench? It isn't going to happen.\n\nAnd especially after writing the anti-Trump op-ed. Republicans could change their minds, but at the moment a startling 89 percent support the president, according to a Gallup Poll.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAfter his defeat in 2012 and in the run-up to the next election, Romney made the rounds of important Republican funders, looking to test their support for a re-run. I spoke to some of those folks as the 2016 contest got underway. The near-universal consensus: he had had his shot.\n\nThat isn't to say that many Republican voters don't regret Romney's defeat. The former Massachusetts governor would have been a much better president than Barack Obama, given his considerable management expertise and profound understanding of the economy.\n\nAlso, Romney had foreign policy chops. His comments about Russia being the nation's biggest threat proved prescient, even as he was mocked by President Obama, who thought he knew better.\n\nBut, Romney would not have disrupted the status quo, and that's what voters wanted. Millions of Americans were fed up with a globalist agenda, tired of being told the U.S. had run out of gas, furious over the absurdities of political correctness – they wanted a change, and they elected Donald Trump.\n\nRomney would not have pulled us out of the Paris Climate Agreement, because he would have feared the backlash. He would have been too polite to throw over the Iran nuke deal, or to confront the Chinese on their ongoing theft of intellectual property or demand that our NATO allies up their defense spending; he would not have resolutely, without fail, put America first.\n\nIn his op-ed in The Washington Post, Romney tempers his criticisms of the president by lauding some of Trump's accomplishments, saying the president was right to align U.S. corporate taxes with those of global competitors, to strip out excessive regulations, to crack down on China's unfair trade practices, to reform criminal justice and to appoint conservative judges.\n\nBut would Mitt have done those things? Would he have stood behind Supreme Court nominee (and now justice) Brett Kavanaugh while the liberal media slimed his reputation and judged him guilty of sins allegedly committed decades earlier on the flimsiest of evidence?\n\nNo, we saw during his 2012 campaign that Romney did not have the steel to go the distance. After he trounced Obama in the first debate between the two, Romney failed to press his advantage and the second debate was a disaster for him.\n\nRomney refused to go after Obama on the shameful lies about the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, wouldn't challenge the president on his handling of the auto industry meltdown and allowed Democrats to paint him as anti-female.\n\nMitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump.\n\nIf he couldn't stand up to Obama, how would Romney have fared with Chinese President Xi Jinping?\n\nBut there is a more profound reason that Romney lost to Obama in 2012; he was ashamed of his success. While President Trump has touted his fortune and his accomplishments as a developer (possibly to excess), Romney never talked up his enormous wins as a private equity investor. Maybe he thought American voters would not understand his business dealings, or maybe he thinks that amassing a fortune is somehow shameful.\n\nMitt Romney helped create or rebuild great companies like Staples, Sealy (the mattress firm) and the Sports Authority, creating wealth not only for his firm Bain Capital but also for investors. Those businesses also created thousands of jobs. Romney's firm also had some clunkers, but for the most part he and his partners supplied capital to entrepreneurs who took that funding and created solid and enduring companies.\n\nThat is a record to be proud of, but you would never have known that from Romney's presidential campaign. Running from your past is smart if your history is dishonorable; otherwise, it is dishonest.\n\nMitt Romney, who ran for the presidency twice, is horrified that American voters elected Donald Trump. He is not alone. There are reasons why many Republicans are wary of too close an association with the president, and Romney's op-ed detailed many of those.\n\nBut a more honorable approach for the newly elected senator would have been to become a leader in his caucus, to attempt to work with and advise the president by becoming a trusted voice, and to serve the American voter by making this presidency as successful as possible.\n\nI am disappointed that Romney chose to do otherwise.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LIZ PEEK
The topic is discussed so often it might seem like old news, yet ongoing questions about the future of aircraft carriers are as, if not more, relevant today than at any other time. Are carriers obsolete? Are they too large and vulnerable to long-range precision carrier-killer missiles to operate close enough to shore to project power? Will the Navy architect a new generation of differently configured carriers? Perhaps smaller, faster and more agile?\n\nTo the extent that the Navy's recently released 30-year shipbuilding plan offers a glimpse into current thinking about future Naval warfare, it is clear that the question will continue to receive very significant attention. The text of the plan states that, moving through the next five years and beyond, the Navy plans to analyze carrier evolution, by writing that the service continues to meet full funding requirements for CVN 80/81 and advanced procurement for a CVN in 2026. The department also recognizes the need for continued exploration of carrier evolution and expects to conduct an analysis of alternatives within the FYDP (Five Year Defense Spending Plan) to inform potential requirements.\n\nCVN 80 and 81, the third and fourth Ford-class carriers, are already well underway following the successful construction of the first-in-class USS Ford which is now nearing deployment.\n\nNAVY ACCELERATES NEW SHIP RADAR TO SUPPORT EMERGING 'SEA-ATTACK' STRATEGY\n\nThe question regarding the future has been studied extensively in recent years through a number of formal Navy studies, and many weapons developers continue to ponder a range of potential contingencies. Some of these include greater use of F-35B armed amphibious assault ships for carrier-like power projection missions. Certainly, having 5th Gen attack capability extends the tactical and operational envelope for amphibs, and newer amphibs are being engineered with new abilities to command and control large fleets of surface, air and even undersea drones. Would amphibs be less vulnerable targets sufficiently capable of sustaining a high-op tempo sortie rate for maritime attack?\n\nOther major factors include the large-scale incorporation of surface, air and undersea drones, meaning carriers could operate at safer standoff distances when enabled by new platforms such as the MQ-25 Stingray, a first-of-its-kind drone able to nearly double the strike range of carrier-launched fighter jets such as F-35s and F/A-18s. Then there is the question of evolving ship defenses, meaning newer kinds of layered defense weapons to include EW (electronic warfare), lasers, aerial sensor nodes, advanced radar and faster computer processing for fire control all continue to massively improve carriers' ability to operate safely in high-threat environments such as waters within striking range of China's heavily touted carrier-killer DF-26 and DF-21D anti-ship missiles. Fast-evolving ship defense technologies are likely one reason why senior Navy leaders continue to emphasize that U.S. carriers are going nowhere soon and can operate wherever they need to, whenever they need to when called upon. While the mission to project massive attack power from the sea is by any estimation here to stay, its particular size, shape and technological configuration certainly may evolve.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDrone evolution may be the hidden key to all of this in several respects. Certainly the Navy's MQ-25 will not be the only carrier-launched drone to emerge, as others will likely follow, and how about the idea of large unmanned carrier-like platforms launching unmanned strike assets? All while command and control operations are performed by human sailors at safer standoff ranges? That would certainly change the equation when it comes to operating in high-risk areas more vulnerable to enemy fire. As part of this equation, it would seem important to point out that the Navy is already well on the way to engineering new large unmanned ships such as the Medium and Large Unmanned Surface Vessel programs. Large drone boats could perform anti-submarine warfare, conduct reconnaissance operations and even coordinate strikes for aircraft from strategically vital vantage points enabling maritime forces to project power from wherever needed.\n\n-- Kris Osborn is the Managing Editor of Warrior Maven and The Defense Editor of The National Interest --\n\nKris Osborn is the defense editor for the National Interest*.* Osborn previously served at the Pentagon as a Highly Qualified Expert with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army—Acquisition, Logistics & Technology.

James Corden shared a message of hope with his audience after violence broke out at the Capitol building on Wednesday.\n\nThe late-night host was among the first to comment on the events that took place at the Capitol in his opening monologue, which was shared ahead of his Wednesday night broadcast on CBS. In it, the host, who is operating out of his garage due to increased coronavirus cases in Los Angeles, looked visibly rattled as he went over the events that happened earlier in the day.\n\nWhat a crazy… sad day, he began. A day that will go down as a dark one in the long history of America. We've all sat today, glued to the pictures of Trump supporters breaching the Capitol, fighting with police, shouting in the chambers of Congress or flagrantly popping a selfie as they sit with their feet up in the government's offices.\n\nThe host, like many celebrities, then turned his attention to Donald Trump's role in the situation.\n\nFANS SHOCKED THAT JAMES CORDEN DOESN'T ALWAYS DRIVE ON 'CARPOOL KARAOKE'\n\nThen under the pretense of trying to calm the situation, their hero, the president, released a message this afternoon to tell his supporters that they're special and we love you. I wouldn't want to even imagine his treatment or response to those people if they had been wearing Black Lives Matter hats instead of red MAGA ones, he said.\n\nThe British comedian noted that, despite how upset or hopeless people may feel in the wake of what happened, he says growing up idolizing America from afar is helping him maintain hope for the nation.\n\nBecause I think if there is one thing that we can have after the last month in this country, it's hope, he continued. You know, as an outsider growing up in England, I used to look to America as this beacon of light and possibility. A place where anything can happen, a place where you'd be lucky to work. A place where many people that I knew used to fantasize about living here. A place that gives an individual more opportunity than they would get elsewhere but cares for their fellow man.\n\nJAMES CORDEN TEASES HE MAY LEAVE 'LATE LATE SHOW' AND MOVE BACK TO UK\n\nHe continued: Today people across the world would have looked at these pictures from Washington and wondered, 'what on earth has happened to this great country?' But I truly believe, and make no mistake, that they know that the America that they admire still exists. They know that the America that so many aspire to will be back. It's just been hijacked by a lunatic and his crazy army for the last four years.\n\nCorden went on to note that people have reason to be hopeful because, in two weeks, on those same steps, where that mob fought and pushed passed police, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the president of the United States.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHe went on to note how inspired he feels at seeing the victory of Democratic Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Georgia, whose victory on Wednesday solidified the party's control of the Senate going into Biden's presidency.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nToday was the last dance at the worst party we've ever been to, Corden concluded. So if you can, have hope. You've seen in these past two weeks that voting counts, change is coming, science is real, vaccines are on the way. I really do believe that there are better times ahead.
After a year plagued by privacy scandals, hate speech controversies, the viral spread of disinformation and the public airing of his company's internal communication, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg used his year-end note to focus on the positive ー drawing the scorn of critics who blasted the billionaire as tone deaf and out of touch.\n\nAs he looked back on a year that saw his company's stock price drop and scores of lawmakers on both sides of the aisle calling for new, strict privacy regulations in the wake of Cambridge Analytica, Zuckerberg spent a chunk of his note boasting that 2 billion people now use one of Facebook's services and the tech giant has empowered countless small businesses.\n\nI'm proud of the progress we've made, he wrote in the letter, which notes that Facebook now employs 30,000 people who focus on safety, but does not dwell on the specifics of any particular challenge or scandal.\n\nZuckerberg wrote that Facebook is a very different company than it was two years ago and has fundamentally altered [its] DNA to prioritize the prevention of harm. He also wrote that he learned a lot in the last year, but a range of critics took issue with the tone of his note.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen read as a whole, the post simply confirms one thing about Facebook. No change has affected (or is designed to affect) the leading cause of Facebook's problems ー the business model, wrote Paul Armstrong, a tech adviser, in Forbes. Without this, Facebook is doomed to become irrelevant to other platforms or become extremely dangerous and be broken up.\n\nArmstrong's advice to Facebook for 2019 includes banning all political advertising, atomic bombing Facebook's algorithm-driven Newsfeed and verifying all news sources on the network.\n\nMark Zuckerberg is a bit out of touch with people's perception, Mark Douglas, CEO of digital advertising platform SteelHouse, told Cheddar. It's going to be a rocky year, that's clear.\n\nThey are the least trusted company in tech. They are going to have to rebuild the trust with the users or they are going to lose those users, Douglas explained.\n\nCHINESE SCHOOLS ENFORCE 'SMART UNIFORMS' WITH GPS TRACKING TO SURVEIL STUDENTS\n\nAlthough Facebook has continued to see its monthly active users increase globally, the company is confronting flat growth in parts of North America and decreased growth in Europe. Besides that fact that it was harnessed by Russia to meddle in the 2016 presidential election, Facebook confronted a series of false rumors on WhatsApp, which it also owns, that led to more than 20 people being lynched in India.\n\nCesar Sayoc, who stands accused of sending 13 pipe bombs through the mail to a range of prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump, trafficked in conspiracy theories, white supremacy and anti-Semitism on his Facebook profile. And the Menlo Park, Calif. company stands accused of furthering ethnic cleansing in Myanmar, where the military has targeted the country's mostly Muslim Rohingya minority group with severe violence.\n\nA number of critics called on Zuckerberg to step down or take a break from leading the company.\n\nLeslie Miley, former CTO of the Obama Foundation, said the 34-year-old Silicon Valley executive should resign and find a pursuit that will teach him humility and help him find his moral compass.\n\nThe executive director of Color of Change, a racial advocacy group that has tangled with Facebook over its treatment of minorities, told the Guardian that Zuckerberg desperately needs to begin implementing systemic solutions, in a way that is transparent, rebuilds the public trust and provides a safer platform for all people.\n\nNEW YEAR'S EVE TIMES SQUARE DRONE GROUNDED DUE TO WEATHER, NYPD SAYS\n\nThe head of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights organization, told the Guardian that Zuckerberg should find a new job in 2019, while TechCrunch called the CEO's letter tone deaf.\n\nSome other critics were not as harsh.\n\nIt means personally committing to a Facebook that doesn't accidentally make decisions that aid violent regimes, white supremacists and other bad actors, Dia Kayyali, program manager at Witness, told the Guardian. Above all, it means simply being honest about Facebook's largely detrimental role in global society. That would be the biggest challenge of all\n\nFacebook has managed to make enemies on both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill, with Democrats calling for more regulation and some Republicans claiming the network is biased against them, and it faces FTC and FBI probes.\n\n2019 is not starting out better, that's for sure, Douglas said.
CNN's legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin, who is currently away from the network amid a masturbation scandal, on Wednesday morning sent a cryptic tweet declaring he'll be back before quickly deleting it.\n\nMany thanks. I'l be back, Toobin wrote in the now-deleted tweet.\n\nIt is unclear if Toobin intended to send someone a private message or if he simply had a change of heart and deleted the public message. It is also unclear if he meant he'll be back on CNN, the network that granted him a leave of absence following reports of his lewd behavior.\n\nCNN'S JEFFREY TOOBIN FIRED BY NEW YORKER MAGAZINE FOLLOWING ZOOM CALL MASTURBATION INCIDENT\n\nCNN's star analyst fell from grace when he was fired from his job as a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine following an investigation into an incident in which he was caught masturbating during a Zoom call with colleagues.\n\nCNN has not taken action against the tech-challenged Toobin and has remained silent about his status at the network despite recently hiring contributor Evan Osnos, who is also a staff writer at The New Yorker and was reportedly an eyewitness to Toobin's alleged misconduct on the infamous Zoom call.\n\nCNN did not immediately respond to a request for comment regarding Toobin's tweet and has stayed mum on Toobin's status.\n\nThe New York Times on Tuesday published a lengthy article on the situation headlined, The Undoing of Jeffrey Toobin, that featured a CNN staffer hinting the network will give him an opportunity to return and noted that he was still employed by the liberal network.\n\nCNN SAYS JEFFREY TOOBIN STILL EMPLOYED AS REPORT SUGGESTS HE MAY GET SECOND CHANCE AFTER MASTURBATION SCANDAL\n\nThree CNN employees say that network president, Jeff Zucker, is a big fan of Mr. Toobin's and a believer in second chances, the Times reported.\n\nThe Times also reported new details of the incident.\n\n[Toobin] was seen lowering and raising his computer camera, exposing and touching his penis, and motioning an air kiss to someone other than his colleagues, witness Masha Gessen told the Times. I was really, truly shocked.\n\nLast year, TheWrap founder and CEO Sharon Waxman – a women's rights advocate – wrote that Toobin's situation reeks of male privilege and asked where CNN has been.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen your job is to weigh facts and render conclusions that shape public opinion, one's own judgment should matter, Waxman wrote, noting that CNN has persistently avoided all questions about his future at the network.\n\nWaxman wrote that she spoke to several prominent women in media who all agreed that a woman would never be able to get away with similar actions.
Bacteria on the International Space Station are evolving and changing in their strange orbital environment -- but according to a new study, they don't seem to be any more dangerous to humans.\n\nThat's good news for astronauts, as some previous research suggested that space travel might make certain microbes mutate into strains that are more harmful to people.\n\nThere has been a lot of speculation about radiation, microgravity and the lack of ventilation and how that might affect living organisms, including bacteria, lead study author Erica Hartmann, a biological design professor at Northwestern University, said in a statement. These are stressful, harsh conditions, leading researchers to wonder if space travel would increase the odds that bacteria would evolve into so-called superbugs to survive.\n\nBased on the new study, published today (Jan. 8) in the journal Msystems, the answer appears to be 'no,' Hartmann said.\n\nIn the study, researchers analyzed DNA from two kinds of bacteria that had taken a trip to the ISS: Staphylococcus aureus (which is found on skin and causes staph infections) and Bacillus cereus (which is present in digestive systems and soil and usually harmless). Both microbes were collected from the ambient environment of the space station and probably hitched a ride to space on the skin of astronauts or inside their bodies. The results revealed that while the returned bacteria had mutated differently than their Earthbound counterparts, they hadn't developed any of the obvious genetic traits of superbugs. (Superbugs are bacteria that have become resistant to antibiotics.) [Over Earth: Day & Night from ISS]\n\nOn Earth, the researchers said, bacteria routinely fall away from the human bodies they prefer to inhabit and undergo changes to adapt to nonliving surfaces. But researchers were especially concerned that the close quarters of spacecraft, where humans and bacteria share the same air and small spaces for months on end, might produce dangerous changes.\n\nIt seems, however, that while the bacteria did change themselves to adapt to space, those changes didn't produce any abnormalities that would make them produce diseases that would be more infectious or difficult to treat.\n\nThis is good news for long-term spaceflight. While NASA's rigorous quarantine procedures before launches have made infectious diseases in space exceedingly rare, the prospect of an outbreak in a sealed spacecraft speeding toward Mars remains alarming. So far, though, it seems that nothing about the space environment itself is working to make that bacterial risk any more dire — even if there are other health issues to worry about.\n\nOriginally published on Live Science.
The two U.S. Senate runoff elections that will be held in Georgia Tuesday will determine whether the Senate will work in partnership with President-elect Joe Biden to build a better future for Americans, or whether Republican obstructionists who put politics ahead of patriotism will be empowered to do everything possible to oppose our new president.\n\nGeorgia is a formerly red state that turned semi-blue in November, when a majority of voters wisely cast their ballots for former Vice President Biden.\n\nAnd yes, despite President Trump's baseless claims that he actually won in the state, recounts have proven beyond any doubt that Biden carried Georgia. Trump now makes the ridiculous and delusional claim that the state's Republican governor and secretary of state are part an imaginary plot that deprived him of a victory.\n\nRICHARD FOWLER: IN GEORGIA SENATE RACES, KEY VOTING BLOC GIVES DEMOCRATS EXCELLENT CHANCE OF WINNING\n\nIt's in the national interest for Georgia voters to follow up on their support for President-elect Biden by voting Tuesday to elect Democrats Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock to the Senate. Both men are highly qualified. Their election will give Biden the Democratic majority he needs in the Senate to repair the enormous damage Trump has caused to our nation in the past four years.\n\nThe incoming administration of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris needs a Senate willing to work with them to fully and effectively respond to the deadly coronavirus pandemic, an economic crisis, systemic racism in our nation's law enforcement, the existential threat of climate change, and other important challenges our nation faces.\n\nUnfortunately and disgracefully, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has made it clear that he will block, stonewall and try to derail every action by the Biden administration.\n\nRecall that McConnell famously stated in 2010: The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president.\n\nSo McConnell's goal 10 years ago — in his own words — was not to serve the American people. Not to create jobs, improve health care, strengthen education, protect national security, or fight for equal rights. No, he admitted that his top priority was to do everything humanly possible to hurt President Obama's reelection prospects, regardless of the harm inflicted on the American people. You can bet every penny you have that McConell feels the same way about our incoming president.\n\nThe best way to stop McConnell is to elect Ossoff and Warnock to give Democrats 50 Senate seats — creating a tie with the 50 Republican senators. Vice President Harris will cast the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats majority control of the Senate.\n\nTaking a page from Trump's angry and divisive playbook filled with a mountain of lies, Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler (running against Warnock) and David Perdue (running against Ossoff) have gone on the attack and have falsely and ridiculously labeled their respective Democratic challengers as radical socialists.\n\nNothing could be further from the truth.\n\nTrump's hysterical radical socialist rants clearly did not resonate with the majority of the voting public in Georgia or across the United States in the November election, and I don't think this nonsense will work for the runoffs in Georgia.\n\nThe truth is that Warnock and Ossoff are mainstream candidates dedicated to public service, and they echo President-elect Biden's hopeful unifying message. They are laser-focused on the facts, the issues, and the values that matter to suffering Georgians in these perilous times.\n\nWarnock, the only Black candidate in the Tuesday runoff, is the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, the former pulpit of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe demonization of this pastor who now preaches in Dr. King's church is part of a long and disgraceful history in Georgia of hostility to its Black residents. In fact, Georgia has never elected a single Black U.S. senator, governor, lieutenant governor, or secretary of state. And yet the Census Bureau estimates that 32% of the state's population is Black.\n\nWarnock rose in Georgia politics through his vocal leadership of the campaign to expand Medicaid for low-income residents of the state. He supports increased COVID-19 relief funding, expanding the Affordable Care Act (the ACA, also known as ObamaCare), and passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act.\n\nWarnock has been endorsed by former Presidents Jimmy Carter (a fellow Georgian) and Obama, and by former U.N. Ambassador and Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young. Warnock is also backed by former Democratic candidate for governor of Georgia and Georgia House of Representatives Minority Leader Stacey Abrams of Fair Fight, a national voting rights organization rooted in Georgia.\n\nOssoff is a Georgia native, media executive, investigative journalist, and small-business owner. He also previously worked as a national security aide for Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., handling defense, foreign affairs, intelligence, and economic policy issues.\n\nLike Warnock, Ossoff supports strengthening the ACA, increased COVID-19 relief, criminal justice reform, and lower taxes for working families and small businesses in Georgia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLoeffler and Perdue, on the other hand, have hitched their wagons to a lame-duck president and have repeatedly refused to even acknowledge President-elect Biden's victory. They agree with anything Trump says, even if that requires them to flip-flop on their positions on issues. They act as if they are running to be selected by Trump to be his employees on The Apprentice, rather than to represent the people of Georgia in the Senate.\n\nLoeffler and Perdue were both against additional $2,000 COVID-19 economic stimulus checks before they were for the checks (but only after Trump's belated tweet storm). They have both questioned the integrity of the November election and even demanded the resignation of a fellow Republican, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\n\nTruth be told, Loeffler and Perdue — not Warnock and Ossoff — are the radical candidates running in Georgia. The Republican candidates are out-of-touch with Georgia voters and values and reject their Senate oath of office, which pledges them to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. Their only loyalty is to Donald Trump and to their own self-interest.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI implore Georgians to turn history on its head and to get out the vote for Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff on Tuesday. Record numbers of early votes are a good sign for the two Democrats, but the election will be close and now they need as many supporters as possible to vote Tuesday.\n\nAll eyes are on you, Georgia. The health, safety and security of the American people are at stake.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM DONNA BRAZILE
Billionaire Tom Steyer, the outspoken liberal megadonor and former hedge fund manager who has led a campaign for President Trump's immediate impeachment, will not run for president in 2020, he announced Wednesday.\n\nInstead, Steyer, who spoke at an event in Des Moines, Iowa, declared that he will undertake and oversee a laundry list of activities in 2019 aimed at removing Trump from office.\n\nMost people come to Iowa around this time to announce a campaign for president, Steyer said in his prepared remarks. But I am proud to be here to announce that I will do whatever it takes, for as long as it takes, to remove a president.\n\nAmong Steyer's goals: a multi-million dollar digital initiative aimed at informing the public and members of Congress about the 10 impeachable offenses that Trump has already committed, town halls across the country, and even an impeachment summit in late January that will bring more than 250 supporters from across the country to D.C. together to learn about historical precedent for impeachment.\n\nThat summit, Steyer promised, would be followed by an advocacy day that will include impeachment summit participants fanning out across Capitol Hill to hand deliver articles of impeachment drafted by legal scholars to members of Congress with the simple message: 'We did half the work, now it's up to you to finish the job.'\n\nSteyer vowed in a statement to spend 100% of his time and energy focused on removing Donald Trump from power through the group Need to Impeach, which he founded in October 2017. He committed to spending $40 million on the effort to have Trump removed from office in 2019.\n\nDEMS REACT AFTER NEW CONGRESSWOMAN VOWED TO 'IMPEACH THE MOTHERF---ER'\n\nThis is the biggest issue in American politics today, Steyer said in his speech Wednesday. We have a lawless president in the White House who is eroding our democracy and it is only going to get worse. Donald Trump's removal from power ultimately decides whether or not we can tackle every other challenge we face in America — and whether or not we continue to live in a democracy of, for, and by the people. It is past time for members of Congress to fulfill their constitutional duty. The question remaining is, what will Congress do?\n\nSteyer had been considered by many analysts to be a potential contender for the White House, and had taken apparent steps in that direction. In recent months he ran television advertisements in which he appeared personally to call for Trump's removal, appeared at numerous political events, and even named a potential campaign manager.\n\nIn early December, Steyer laid the groundwork for a political platform, speaking alongside a panel in Charleston, S.C., at one of five scheduled town halls. Each event focused on the Five Rights of his potential campaign platform, which he called the social contract for the 21st century.\n\nWhile some analysts feared his wealth and lack of political experience would alienate progressives, Steyer had an extensive array of advisers and strategists at the ready, owing in part to his longstanding involvement in national politics.\n\nIn 2013 he founded NextGen America, a political action committee and nonprofit working to combat climate change.\n\nLike Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has announced that she's formed an exploratory committee ahead of a possible presidential run, Steyer often has tangled publicly and personally with Trump.\n\nLast October, Trump took a personal shot at Steyer, deriding him as a wacky and crazed & stumbling lunatic and asserting that if he is running for President, the Dems will eat him alive!\n\nThe remarks came after Steyer -- among the prominent liberals who received a threatening suspicious package earlier in the month -- said he absolutely was blaming Trump for creating an atmosphere in which anything can bubble up, and anything is bubbling up.\n\nSteyer seemed to tie the president's rhetoric not only to pipe bombs mailed across the country by an outspoken Trump supporter in Florida, but also to a massacre by a lone gunman at a Pittsburgh synagogue in late October.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlthough Steyer seemingly won't be on the ballot in 2020, members of his team emphasized that they felt the Democrats had momentum.\n\nWith a new Congress now seated, and a majority of Democrats in the House, the power is in their hands to start the process of removing this corrupt and comprised president, Need to Impeach Lead Strategist Kevin Mack said in a statement. We're not backing down, and we're not letting up on our work to hold members of Congress accountable until Donald Trump is out of the White House.\n\nBut, top Democrats seemed less than enthusiastic about introducing impeachment articles. Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., downplayed freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib's profanity-laced vow to impeach Trump, as Republicans strongly condemned the language.\n\nMeanwhile, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer said he didn't think comments like these particularly help. And Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., said members were aghast at Tlaib, D-Mich., lamenting a fever among some colleagues to impeach Trump.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y. -- who would oversee any impeachment proceedings -- also condemned Tlaib's comments.\n\nI don't like that language, Nadler told CNN. More to the point, I disagree with what she said. It is too early to talk about that intelligently. We have to follow the facts and get the facts.\n\nFox News' Pat Ward and Brooke Singman contributed to this report.
The Russian hypersonic weapons test is shining light upon an aggressive U.S. plan to prototype, test and deploy hypersonic weapons on an expedited schedule -- to defend against enemy attacks by fast-tracking an ability to launch high-impact, high-speed attacks at Mach. 5 - five times the speed of sound.\n\nWe would like all the resources we can build into the kill chain to hit any target or hold it at risk with hypersonic weapons, Gen. Timothy Ray, Air Force Global Strike Command, said at the Air Force Association Air, Space & Cyber Conference in September.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is, according to numerous news reports and Russia's own state news operation, calling the test a tremendous success, adding that the weapon is invincible and ready to enter service next year.\n\nThe actual technological capacity of the new Russian weapon has not, as of yet, been verified by public U.S. reports.\n\nLegitimate or not, a Russian weapon traveling at hypersonic speeds, naturally, would better enable offensive missile strikes to destroy targets such and enemy ships, buildings, air defenses and even drones and fixed-wing or rotary aircraft -- depending upon the guidance technology available.\n\nA key component of this is the fact that weapons traveling at hypersonic speeds would present serious complications for targets hoping to defend against them – they would have only seconds with which to respond or defend against an approaching or incoming attack.\n\nIn fact, while emphasizing the current Air Force push for hypersonic weapons, Ray raised this precise concern.\n\nThe challenges becomes your ability to defend against hypersonic weapons - they are not easily defendable, Ray told an audience at the AFA Conference.\n\nAlong these lines, the advent of hypersonic weapons is a key reason why some are questioning the future survivability of large platforms such as aircraft carriers. How are ship-based sensors, radar and layered defenses expected to succeed in detecting tracking and intercepting or destroying an approaching hypersonic weapon traveling at five times the speed of sound?\n\nHypersonic weapons will quite likely be engineered as kinetic energy strike weapons, meaning they will not use explosives but rather rely upon sheer speed and the force of impact to destroy targets, developers explain.\n\nA super high-speed drone or ISR platform would better enable air vehicles to rapidly enter and exit enemy territory and send back relevant imagery without being detected by enemy radar or shot down.\n\nA drone or unmanned ISR platform traveling at hypersonic speeds would better enable air vehicles to rapidly enter and exit enemy territory and send back relevant imagery without being detected by enemy radar. (Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies report on Hypersonic Weapons HERE)\n\nAlthough potential defensive uses for hypersonic weapons, interceptors or vehicles are by no means beyond the realm of consideration, the principal effort at the moment is to engineer offensive weapons able to quickly destroy enemy targets at great distances.\n\nScientists explain that speed of sound can vary, depending upon the altitude; at the ground level it is roughly 1,100 feet per second. Accordingly, if a weapon is engineered with 2,000 seconds worth of fuel – it can travel up to 2,000 miles to a target, former Air Force chief scientist Gregory Zacharias told Warrior in a previous interview.\n\nThe service recently awarded a second deal to Lockheed to expedite prototyping of a hypersonic weapon, called the Air Launched Rapid Response Weapon, Air Force news reported.\n\nThe effort involves two separate trajectories, including the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon and a Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon. The Air Force has now awarded developmental deals for both systems to Lockheed.\n\nThe most recent award was cited recently in the service's Around the Air Force new report, which said that Air Force Secretary Heather Wilson is moving as fast as possible when it comes to hypersonic weapons.\n\nRecent thinking from senior Air Force weapons developers had held that U.S. hypersonic weapons might first be deployable by the early 2020s. Hypersonic drones for attack or ISR missions, by extension, were thought to be on track to emerge in the 2030s and 2040s, senior service officials have told Warrior Maven.\n\nNow, this aggressive new Air Force hypersonic weapons prototyping and demonstration effort is expected to change this time frame in a substantial way.\n\nA boost-glide hypersonic weapon is one that flies on an upward trajectory up into the earth's atmosphere before using the speed of its descent to hit and destroy targets, senior officials said.\n\nThe Hypersonic Conventional Strike Weapon effort involves using technologies which have not yet been integrated for air-launched delivery, an Air Force spokeswoman told Warrior Maven earlier this year.\n\nThese kinds of propulsion and weapons technologies are currently informing the exploration of hypersonic drone platforms able to surveil, strike and defend.\n\nLockheed's Skunk Works division is currently working with the Pentagon on the SR-72 hypersonic drone, designed to travel at Mach 6. Visions for this platform, according to reports from Popular Mechanics and Aviation Week, incorporate engineering the drone for strike missions as well. Current plans call for a Flight Research Vehicle to be constructed in the early 2020s, with a full-scale version to be in service sometime in the 2030s, the Av week report states.\n\nSenior Air Force weapons developers have explained the rationale in terms of not waiting many more years for a 100-percent solution if a highly impactful 90-percent solution can be available much sooner.\n\nOften referred to as agile acquisition by Air Force senior leaders, to include service Secretary Heather Wilson, fast-tracked procurement efforts seek quicker turnaround of new software enhancements, innovations and promising combat technologies likely to have a substantial near-term impact. While multi-year developmental programs are by no means disappearing, the idea is to circumvent some of the more bureaucratic and cumbersome elements of the acquisition process.\n\nThis hypersonic weapons acceleration is taking place within a high-threat global environment. Alongside Russia, China has also been visibly conducting hypersonic weapons tests, leading some to raise the question as to whether the U.S. could be behind key rivals in this area.\n\nA report in Popular Mechanics sites Chinese State Media as having announced a successful test of a new wave-rider hypersonic vehicle.\n\nThe hypersonic vehicle that detached from the booster rocket flew for 400 seconds, achieving a maximum speed of Mach 5.5 to 6 (4,200 to 4,600 miles an hour) and reaching an altitude of 100,000 feet, the report says.\n\nAlso, a report in The Diplomat earlier this year outlines Chinese DF-17 hypersonic missile tests in November of last year.\n\nIn an essay from earlier this year titled Hypersonic Missiles: A New Proliferation Challenge, Rand scholar Richard Speier further specifies the seriousness of hypersonic missile threats.\n\nThey are able to evade and conceal their precise targets from defenses until just seconds before impact. This leaves targeted states with almost no time to respond…..Hypersonic missiles require a reconsideration of traditional second-strike calculations, as they have the potential to decapitate a nation's leadership before it has the opportunity to launch a counter attack, Speier writes.\n\nMore Weapons and Technology -WARRIOR MAVEN (CLICK HERE)—
Owning the libs doesn't mean giving them two free Senate seats, Trump 2020 national press secretary Hogan Gidley told Fox & Friends Weekend on Sunday, two days ahead of Georgia's crucial runoff elections, which will decide which party controls the Senate.\n\nWe have to make sure that Republicans maintain control of the Senate so that any radical agenda of the left can't come through and destroy this country and remake it into the image of some socialist nation, which is exactly what the Democrats are pledging to do, Gidley said.\n\nBoth Georgia Senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on Tuesday as Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., faces challenger Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., takes on Jon Ossoff.\n\nBoth Ossoff and Warnock are making pledges of not just embracing and adopting the Green New Deal, which would destroy our economy, but also make us less secure on the global stage by relying on other nations for our energy, Gidley said on Sunday.\n\nThey want to open our borders. They want to make Puerto Rico a state, D.C. a state, pack the court, all the agenda items that have been radical from the beginning that have been exposed, they are embracing and promising to do.\n\nHe went on to say that President Trump is therefore going to go and campaign in Georgia on Monday for the Republican senators and rally his supporters and say, 'Guys, we are still looking at what happened in this reelection campaign for me. Don't worry about that. What you need to make sure you do and focus on is getting out the vote for Kelly Loeffler and Perdue to make sure we control the Senate.'\n\nI think it's a pretty good message and I think it's one that's going to work in the state of Georgia, Gidley continued.\n\nWhen Trump weighed in on the 2017 race, calling Ossoff a super liberal Democrat who wanted to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes, Ossoff responded that the president was misinformed.\n\nWISCONSIN SUPREME COURT TOSSES TRUMP CAMPAIGN LAWSUIT\n\nI'm focused on bringing fresh leadership, accountability and bipartisan problem solving to Washington to cut wasteful spending and grow metro Atlanta's economy into the Silicon Valley of the South, Ossoff said.\n\nOssoff distanced himself from the national Democratic Party's lurch to the left at the time. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said Ossoff often tried to avoid nationalizing that campaign over fears of losing moderate voters.\n\nHe said he would not support any tax increases, even on the wealthy. I don't support any increase in income tax rates, he said.\n\nLast month, Loeffler painted her Jan. 5 runoff election against Warnock as a battle against socialism during an interview on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures.\n\nLoeffler tied her opponent to ideas touted by the more progressive wing of the Democratic Party, including cutting funding to police departments and the so-called Green New Deal. She also linked Warnock to former Cuban strongman Fidel Castro.\n\nIn 1995, Warnock was a youth pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, where Castro gave a speech during a trip to the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Warnock's campaign claims he had no role in the decision to host Castro.\n\nOn Sunday, Loeffler also warned that Democratic victories in her state's runoff elections will mean a radical agenda that will drastically change life in the U.S.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nRepublicans currently hold 50 seats versus 48 for the Democrats.

The early days of 2019 have not treated President Trump well.\n\nThe federal government is nearing the second week of the partial shutdown, Republicans are about to lose their unified government, and Americans are increasingly turning against the president.\n\nIn a poll released last week by Reuters/Ipsos, 47 percent of Americans blame President Trump, over the Democrats, for the shutdown. With frustrations increasing, and Democratic energy at an all-time high after the historic midterm election results, the president has been backed into a corner.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DOUG SCHOEN: TRUMP IS TO BLAME FOR GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN, BUT BORDER SECURITY IS IMPORTANT\n\nThe Democrats, who will regain the majority in the House of Representatives on January 3, have already begun planning how they will come out of this issue on top.\n\nRecognizing the importance of reopening the government, they have now proposed a plan that would deal with six out of the seven appropriations bills, leaving only the Department of Homeland Security with a continuing resolution.\n\nAs of now, this looks like the best option. However, it looks like this still will not be enough for President Trump.\n\nPresident Trump is still demanding that the Democrats provide the full $5 billion he has requested to build a wall, something that Democrat leaders are refusing to provide. The presumptive Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, have agreed to provide $1.3 billion for additional border security.\n\nIf I could speak directly to the president I would say to him, Mr. President: take their deal.\n\nAs Americans have become increasingly frustrated with the government over the shutdown, and eyes are turning toward President Trump as the main person to blame, it is more important now than ever before that he take this deal and declare victory for additional border security.\n\nThe president should also take this deal because it is becoming increasingly obvious that the issue of the wall is no longer a selling point for voters. Yes, there is the need for additional border security, but the issue of building the wall only motivates the president's base. And that base is growing increasingly narrow as the president's approval rating, according to the RealClearPolitics, is now below 43 percent. Playing to the base is an increasingly bad strategy for him going into 2020.\n\nElection results from the 2018 midterm elections should be a warning for Republicans: if they want to win in 2020 they will need to back away from the hardline issues like building a wall that are clearly not working.\n\nDespite the inability to find common ground to end this shutdown, there is still a great deal of work to be done in Washington.\n\nThe Democratic wins across the country in the 2018 midterm elections made one thing abundantly clear: Americans want action on the most pressing issues. We must shift the focus of the debate not just to keeping the government open, but fixing issues with infrastructure, health care, and, dare I say, comprehensive immigration reform.\n\nWhile it might appear outlandish that in this current government there could be something like bipartisan reform, the recent criminal justice reform bill shows that common ground can still be found.\n\nThe Democrats are in the best position to bring about change because of decisive victories in traditionally red states and districts that make it increasingly clear that the Republican agenda is not resonating with voters.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdditionally, with Democrats now about to take control of the House of Representatives, cooperation with them is going to be more important than ever for Republican leaders.\n\nFor President Trump, the solution is simple. Take the $1.3 billion and call it a victory for border security. Bipartisanship is going to be increasingly important in 2019, and if President Trump fails to deliver, it leaves the door wide open for the Democrats in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DOUG SCHOEN
Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said Thursday the rapidly spreading coronavirus that originated in China will bring jobs back to North America.\n\nIt gives businesses another thing to consider when they review their supply chain, and it could accelerate the return of some factories to the U.S. and Mexico, Ross told FOX Business' Maria Bartiromo.\n\nCORONAVIRUS TREATMENT WEEKS AWAY, DRUGMAKER SAYS\n\nU.S. companies that operate in China, including Google and Starbucks, have begun closing some locations due to the outbreak.

Bryan Cranston defended playing a quadriplegic in his upcoming movie The Upside, saying taking on the role was a business decision amid the growing debate about expanding casting in Hollywood.\n\nCranston told the Press Association that he's aware of the need to expand opportunities to others when it comes to casting specific roles, but as an actor, he has the right to take on characters with different attributes and abilities. In The Upside, Cranston plays a wealthy quadriplegic who hires a caretaker, played by Kevin Hart, to help him on his daily routine.\n\nWe live in the world of criticism, if we're willing to get up and try something, we have to also be willing to take criticism, Cranston said, according to Sky News. We're very aware of the need to expand the opportunities for people with disabilities.\n\nBRYAN CRANSTON URGES PEOPLE TO 'GET MAD' IF THEY WANT SOCIAL CHANGE\n\nAs actors, we're asked to be other people, to play other people, he added. If I, as a straight, older person, and I'm wealthy, I'm very fortunate, does that mean I can't play a person who is not wealthy, does that mean I can't play a homosexual?\n\nI don't know, where does the restriction apply, where is the line for that? I think it is worthy for debate to discuss those issues, he continued.\n\nSome social media users previously questioned Cranston being cast for the role.\n\nAre disabled actors....not a thing? Like, you couldn't find one? No disrespect to Bryan Cranston, only the chuckleheads who cast it, someone tweeted, while another person said, Disabled actors whose names will get people in seats pretty much aren't a thing, unfortunately. I'm not taking a side on if it's right, but the studios want money.\n\nSeveral actors, including Tilda Swinton and Jack Whitehall, have received backlash in recent years for taking on movie roles that some argued could have gone to LGBTQ or minority actors.\n\nScarlett Johansson was criticized in 2017 when she was cast as the lead in Ghost In The Shell, a remake of a Japanese anime classic. Many people argued the role should have been given to an Asian actor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJohansson also pulled out of playing a transgender character in the film Rub and Tug after the LGBTQ community slammed the project for not giving the opportunity to a trans actor.\n\nGlee star Darren Criss said last month he will no longer play a gay character because he wanted to make sure I won't be another straight boy taking a gay man's role. On Sunday, Criss won a Golden Globe for playing Andrew Cunanan, a gay serial killer, in the show, American Crime Story: The Assassination Of Gianni Versace.
West Virginia coach Neal Brown knew he would use reserve quarterback Austin Kendall in the second half. The redshirt senior ended up leading the Moutaineers to a Liberty Bowl victory.\n\nKendall threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to T.J. Simmons with 5:10 left, and West Virginia held off Army 24-21 on Thursday.\n\nBrown said the decision to switch quarterbacks was made at halftime by the Mountaineers coaching staff after starter Jarret Doege struggled, particularly in the second quarter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nJarret has played very, very well all year, but for whatever reason, he didn't see it well, Brown said, adding: I thought (Kendall) came in in relief and did a nice job.\n\nArmy (9-3) had a chance to tie it with 1:50 left, but Quinn Maretzki's 39-yard field goal was wide left. Josh Chandler ended Army's final possession with an interception and led the Mountaineers (6-4) with 13 tackles.\n\nSimmons also scored on a 5-yard pass from Doege.\n\nArmy quarterback Tyhier Tyler had three rushing touchdowns — from 1, 6, and 2 yards — to tie a Liberty Bowl record.\n\nYou can't do anything without the offensive line, the slotbacks and the fullbacks, Tyler said. They pave the way, and I just follow.\n\nThe Black Knights initially were scheduled to play in the Independence Bowl but seemed left out of the bowl lineup after the Shreveport, Louisiana, bowl was canceled. They got the opportunity to play in the Liberty Bowl after Tennessee (3-7) opted out because of COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe game was played in overcast conditions with occasional showers and sub-40-degree temperatures. The weather and local COVID-19 restrictions limited the crowd in the 60,000-seat Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, leaving clusters of the announced 8,187 fans scattered throughout the stadium.\n\nBoth team controlled the other's offense through much of the first half. Army coach Jeff Monken noted that his team, one of the best rushing teams in the country, was limited to 83 total yards by halftime.\n\nWest Virginia just whipped blocks, they beat blocks, Monken said. (They) got themselves where they needed to be to make the play. And they did that a lot.\n\nWhat began as a defensive battle, changed after halftime. Army's rushing offense got untracked, while a change in quarterbacks to Kendall for West Virginia gave it more firepower through the air.\n\nI thought this game kind of mirrored 2020 in a lot of ways, Brown said. A fitting way to close out the year. It wasn't a thing of beauty, but it was gritty.\n\nTHE TAKEAWAY\n\nArmy: The Black Knights' vaunted rushing offense couldn't move early, not picking up their initial first down until the final play of the opening quarter. Eventually, they had some success attacking the perimeter of the West Virginia defense.\n\nWest Virginia: While the defense controlled things early, the Mountaineers couldn't capitalize enough to build a significant lead. Turnovers hurt West Virginia, especially Doege's fumble deep in his own territory late in the first half, giving Army a lead. Kendall taking over at quarterback made a difference as he threw for 121 yards and two touchdowns in the second half.\n\nDOWN PLAYERS\n\nArmy was down eight players who did not dress for the game, many of them key parts of the team, because of health and safety protocol.\n\nI don't know if it changed, Monken said. Obviously, when you have players that are a big part of your offense and defense, kicking game included, it changes you some.\n\nDISAPPOINTING END\n\nThe loss snapped the Black Knights three-game winning streak. The most painful aspect is just not being finish it, linebacker Arik Smith said. Being that close and not being able to finish it. But we will regroup and do this again, and we will win.\n\nUP NEXT:\n\nArmy: The Black Knights , who ended the regular season on a three-game winning streak, will try and continue its winning ways. There are 17 seniors listed on the Army roster, but four of the five offensive line starters are seniors.\n\nWest Virginia: While the Mountaineers lost four games during the regular season, three of those were to teams nationally ranked at the time. With key offensive players such as Doege and leading rusher Leddie Brown with another years of eligibility along with a young corps of receivers, the Mountaineers have a nice future on offense.
Former Georgia state Rep. Vernon Jones announced Wednesday that he will be joining the Republican Party.\n\nJones, a former Democrat representing the 91st District in Lithonia, Ga., said in a post on Twitter: Now more than ever, the Republican Party is in desperate need of leaders that know how to fight. I know how to fight.\n\nMITCH MCCONNELL TO REBUKE GOP CHALLENGE TO CERTIFY ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTE\n\nJones caused a stir last year when he decided to resign from his position in the state's House of Representatives and commit to campaigning on behalf of President Trump, even speaking at the Republican Nationals Convention in August. He later flip-flopped on his decision to step down, saying he would not kowtow to Democrats, but said he was not interested in changing parties.\n\nJones did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on what swayed him to change his mind.\n\n5 TAKEAWAYS FROM GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nHe has repeatedly accused Democrats and their supporters of being thugs, calling them a left-wing mob. Jones has also blamed criticism from his party for supporting Trump on the fact that he is African American.\n\nMeanwhile, Georgia Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock made history Tuesday night after becoming the first Black senator in his state.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJones' party swap comes on the same day Congress is slated to hold what is sure to be a contentious joint session to certify the results of the presidential election, which Trump and his supporters have maintained was rigged despite no evidence to support his claims. Several Republican members of Congress have pledged to vote against certifying the election for President-elect Joe Biden.
Rep.-elect Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., wrote a letter to House leadership Friday, urging them to keep a 1967 rule that exempts lawmakers from a ban on firearms inside the Capitol building.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by 82 other current and incoming GOP Congress members -- including Dan Crenshaw, Mo Brooks, Louie Gohmert and Matt Gaetz -- came three days after 21 Democratic lawmakers asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to change the 53-year-old rule to keep Boebert from carrying her gun into work.\n\nOn Saturday, it appeared Boebert scored a victory, as new rules unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not appear to include a Democrat-proposed ban on firearms in the Capitol.\n\nI refuse to give up my Second Amendment rights, Boebert said in a statement last week. I'm a 5-foot tall, 100-pound mom with four children and will be walking to work and serving in one of the most dangerous cities in the U.S. I choose to defend my family and my life with all of the force the Constitution provides. I will not let a bunch of gun-grabbing House Democrats take away my Constitutional right to protect myself.\n\nThe letter sent by Democrats said allowing lawmakers to carry guns in the Capitol creates needless risk for Members of Congress, their staff, members of the Capitol Police, and visitors to the Capitol grounds.\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT BLASTS DEMOCRATS FOR TRYING TO BAN HER FROM CARRYING GUN AT CAPITOL\n\nThe Democratic letter was led by Reps. Jared Huffman, Robin Kelly and Jackie Speier. (Speier, of California, survived five gunshot wounds suffered during the Jonestown massacre in Guyana in 1978.)\n\nFellow Colorado Rep. Jason Crow, a Democrat, accused Boebert of conducting a political stunt and disrespecting Capitol police.\n\nThe US [Capitol police] are professionals & I have rarely felt safer, he tweeted. I should know. I've carried a gun for work. If Boebert wants to talk safety, I have legislation to discuss.\n\nGOP CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT THINKS THIS WILL GET DEMS TO SUPPORT CONCEALED CARRY\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBoebert, who is an outspoken advocate for the Second Amendment, also said Thursday she plans to join the House Freedom Caucus once she's sworn into office. The conservative caucus is currently led by GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona and was previously led by White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows when he was a congressman from North Carolina.
Before he begins a three-year prison sentence for lying to the Internal Revue Services about the taxes he owed, lying to financial institutions and lying to Congress, Michael Cohen – President Trump's former personal attorney – is scheduled to testify about Trump at a congressional hearing Feb. 7.\n\nAnti-Trump Democrats and others who hate the president are sure to love Cohen's testimony. While Cohen said in 2017 that he would take a bullet to protect Trump, that turned out to be yet another lie.\n\nIt turns out Cohen secretly recorded phone calls with Trump – hardly ethical behavior for a lawyer dealing with a client. And he has spent over 70 hours talking with federal prosecutors in New York City and from the office of Special Counsel Robert Mueller about his own crimes and making allegations of wrongdoing by President Trump.\n\nHANS VON SPAKOVSKY: FORMER ELECTION COMMISSIONER: COHEN AND TRUMP DIDN'T VIOLATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE LAW\n\nTrump opponents can be sure that if Cohen goes ahead with plans to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee his words will be music to their ears.\n\nOnce demonized by the anti-Trump crowd, Cohen has since been embraced by many of his former critics for turning on his former boss, who provided him with a paycheck for 12 years until they parted ways last year.\n\nBut with his long record of lying again and again, why should anyone believe a word Cohen says regarding Trump or anything else?\n\nRep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., will preside over the hearing where Cohen testifies. Now that Democrats are the majority party in the House, they have promised to aggressively investigate the president's activities in the private sector, in his personal life and in government.\n\nCohen himself issued an unintentionally ironic statement about his upcoming testimony, blithely asserting that he looked forward to having a platform with which to give a full and credible account of the events which have transpired.\n\nThis from a man already convicted of lying to Congress – among other felonies.\n\nCan we really expect a full and credible account from Michael Cohen? Or will his testimony be just another piece in what acting U.S. Attorney Robert Khuzami of the Southern District of New York called Cohen's pattern of deception, designed to make himself look good and to shift blame for his misdeeds onto the president?\n\nKhuzami has described Cohen as someone who repeatedly used his power and influence for deceptive ends. Cohen's illegal conduct was marked by a pattern of deception that permeated his professional life and he engaged in extensive, deliberate, and serious criminal conduct, according to Khuzami\n\nBut with his long record of lying again and again, why should anyone believe a word Cohen says regarding Trump or anything else?\n\nCohen pleaded guilty in federal court to willful tax evasion, false statements to financial institutions, illegal campaign contributions, and making false statements to Congress. Khuzami noted that all of the crimes bore a common set of characteristics. Each involved deception that was motivated by personal greed and ambition.\n\nIn his testimony scheduled for Feb. 7, Cohen will swear an oath to tell the truth. But he previously swore – falsely and repeatedly – that the tax returns he submitted to the IRS were true and accurate.\n\nKhuzami faulted Cohen for his submissions to prosecutors in which Cohen repeatedly attempted to minimize the seriousness of his decision not to report millions of dollars of income over a period of years by blaming his accountant – assertions that prosecutors said are simply false.\n\nDo we have any reason to expect Cohen to change his stripes when he comes before Congress next month?\n\nCohen didn't lie to just the IRS and prosecutors. Khuzami's sentencing memorandum noted that Cohen told numerous financial institutions a long-series of self-serving lies about his assets and liabilities.\n\nWell, at least Cohen's behavior is consistent!\n\nCohen previously lied to Congress about a real estate deal in Russia that the Trump organization had been negotiating for 30 years. Nothing about the deal itself was unlawful, but Cohen's ham-handed lies seemed intended to minimize the fact that he was still discussing this deal during the first half of 2016.\n\nNow that the House Oversight Committee is run by Democrats, Cohen has every incentive to shift the blame for this potentially embarrassing deal to President Trump. He probably has little fear that Democrats would want to see him prosecuted for misrepresenting what happened – as long as it advances their narrative that Donald Trump is guilty of something.\n\nThis is because congressional Democrats aren't really interested in Michael Cohen. They're interested in using Michael Cohen to make accusations of wrongdoing against President Trump.\n\nThere's no doubt that Cohen will be asked about the hush-money payments he made to two women in exchange for not making public their unproven allegations – denied by Trump – of extramarital affairs that supposedly occurred many years before Trump ran for president.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws by making these payments. But as I have explained before, many campaign finance experts and former members of the Federal Election Commission do not believe that the payments actually broke any federal law. As a former member of the Federal Elections Commission and an attorney who has worked extensively on election law issues I share this view.\n\nYet even in arranging the payments to the two women, the sentencing memorandum notes, Cohen used sophisticated tactics to conceal his misconduct. And when news stories about the payments began to surface, the memorandum says Cohen responded by telling shifting and misleading stories.\n\nIf members of the House Oversight Committee want to know why Michael Cohen has embraced a pattern of deception they should be sure to read the last part of the sentencing memorandum. Khuzami says Cohen's behavior was driven by his own ambition and greed.\n\nOriginally, Cohen expected to be given a prominent role and title in the new (Trump) administration, according to the memorandum. When that didn't materialize, he successfully convinced numerous major corporations to retain him as a 'consultant' who could provide unique insights about and access to the new administration.\n\nThat turned out to be a lie as well. Khuzami notes that although Cohen made more than $4 million as a consultant, he provided little or no real services.\n\nThe sentencing memorandum adds this kicker: Cohen undertook similar acts of deception in his private life.\n\nKhuzami summed it up this way: Cohen's consciousness of wrongdoing is fleeting … his remorse is minimal, and … his instinct to blame others is strong.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd this is the witness Chairman Cummings can't wait to put on national television, so millions of Americans can hear him attack the president of the United States.\n\nCohen has zero credibility. Anything he says – under oath or in casual conversation – should be treated with extreme skepticism, at best.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSKY
The man who killed Officer Natalie Corona in an ambush-style attack left a note in the apartment where he killed himself, claiming that police had targeted him with ultra sonic waves meant to keep dogs from barking.\n\nThe note left by Kevin Douglas Limbaugh of Davis, Calif., was released after Davis police identified the 48-year-old as the man who fatally shot Corona during the officer's response to a car collision Thursday night.\n\nCOP DIED IN 'AMBUSH' BY BIKE-RIDING GUNMAN WHO CONTINUED TO FIRE SHOTS, POLICE CHIEF SAYS\n\nThe Davis Police department has been hitting me with ultra sonic waves meant to keep dogs from barking, reads the note, which was typed on a computer. I notified the press, internal affairs, and even the FBI about it. I am highly sensitive to its affect (sic) on my inner ear. I did my best to appease them, but they have continued for years and I can't live this way anymore.\n\nThere's no way to know when the note was typed, Davis police Lt. Paul Doroshov told SFGate.com, adding that the note was found during a search of Limbaugh's apartment.\n\nAUTHORITIES ID SUSPECT IN SHOOTING DEATH OF CALIFORNIA COP\n\nThere have been a lot of rumors as to why this happened, why he did what he did, and we're hoping this sheds some light, Doroshov said. As for the placement of the note, which was found face-up on Limbaugh's bed, I really can't speculate as to why it was there like that.\n\nIn addition to the note, officers found two semiautomatic handguns inside the house, a 9 mm and a .45-caliber, Doroshov told the Sacramento Bee.\n\nAccording to authorities, Limbaugh rode up on a bicycle and shot and killed Corona as the rookie cop was on the scene of a three-car collision. He then unleashed a barrage of bullets that struck a bus, firetruck and a young woman's backpack. The woman with the backpack was uninjured.\n\nHe then fled to a rental home he shared with a roommate. At one point, Limbaugh emerged from the home wearing a bulletproof vest and yelled at the officers before going back inside. He emerged a second time with a gun before retreating.\n\nOFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY IN 2018\n\nThe officers never fired at him.\n\nAfter hearing a single gunshot inside, the officers sent a robot where Limbaugh was found to have fatally shot himself in the head.\n\nThe shooting wasn't Limbaugh's first brush with the law. The Sacramento Bee reported he was charged and convicted on a battery case last fall in which he assaulted a co-worker in the face after a dispute. As part of that case, Limbaugh was ordered to surrender an AR-15 rifle, the report said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMore than 1,000 mourners attended a Saturday evening vigil for Corona. The event was filled with speeches by local politicians and musical performances, according to the Bee.\n\nWhat brings us together is a really, really sad incident and one gathering is not going to change that, Davis Mayor Brett Lee said. But just seeing you all here does make a difference.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
