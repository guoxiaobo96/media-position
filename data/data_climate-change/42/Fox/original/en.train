Teddi Mellencamp couldn't be more grateful her parents taught her the value of hard work.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star explained that her father, Grammy-winning singer John Mellencamp, and her mother, Victoria Granucci, gave her a good balance growing up.\n\n'RHOBH' STAR TEDDI MELLENCAMP REVEALS SHE SUFFERED MULTIPLE MISCARRIAGES\n\nThey told me to always work hard for what I want to do, Mellencamp, 37, told us. That's really all I knew. If I want something I had to work hard for it, and that's really what I attribute a lot of what my business has become because my parents never gave me an easy way out to anything.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey were like, 'Oh you want this? Then work harder. Oh, you want this? These are the steps you need to do get there. Nobody's going to hand it to you.'\n\nWithout that advice at a young age, Mellencamp admits that she doesn't think she would have the same drive and go-getter attitude she does now.\n\nI know that it's possible to do anything that I believe in and that I work hard for because I've seen it work time and time again for different things in my life.\n\nMEGHAN MCCAIN ADDS FUEL TO TEDDI MELLENCAMP FEUD\n\nMost recently, her parents' sentiments worked for the South Carolina native's accountability program — ALL IN by Teddi — she has in Los Angeles.\n\nEssentially what we do is we hold you accountable to your commitments and your goals that you want to make for yourself, lifestyle change, in regards to health and fitness, Mellencamp shared, noting she's not an accountability coach for all walks of your life.\n\nBut what happens is when you're feeling your best, you're doing your best and good things happen, she continues. If you're feeling confident, if you're feeling good, if you're feeling committed to making a healthy lifestyle change, everything else kind of falls into place.\n\nMEG RYAN AND JOHN MELLENCAMP ARE ENGAGED\n\nFans of the Housewives franchise have seen Mellencamp's accountability program in action, as it was featured on the Bravo reality series when the mom-of-two joined the show last season.\n\nA lot of [the Housewives] friends have [joined ALL IN by Teddi]. If I've met somebody or if they hear about it or if it's a friend of a friend or assistants, it's all been interconnected because that's a huge part of my program. Once you see somebody you know change their life, you want to do the same for yourself.\n\nJOHN MELLENCAMP SAYS MEG RYAN IS THE 'FUNNIEST WOMAN' HE'S EVER MET\n\nAnd with season nine of the RHOBH set to premiere next month, Mellencamp is on the edge of her seat, alongside dedicated viewers, waiting for the episodes — described as a season of lies — to air.\n\nI can say it was a nail-biter for me living it, so I can only imagine what it's going to be like watching it back.\n\nIt's so dramatic you can't even believe it. Extreme highs. Extreme lows. I'm waiting! adds Mellencamp, who is no longer the newbie this season with Denise Richards signed on.\n\nAs for what she thinks of the franchise's newest castmember? Denise has been a fun new addition, Mellencamp admits. I love adding different dynamics to the mix. The more women and the more different personality types, the more you learn, the more you grow, the more fun you have, the more drama that can ensue, so it's been great getting to know Denise.\n\nMEG RYAN, JOHN MELLENCAMP ENGAGED: A TIMELINE OF THEIR UPS AND DOWNS\n\nHowever, when asked if she's getting along with Richards and the rest of the ladies, Mellencamp remained tight-lipped, but seemed to hint viewers will see her be more outspoken.\n\nLast season, I didn't know anybody really. I'd only met Dorit [Kemsley] a couple of times before being thrown into the group in Vegas. So this year I'm going into it knowing everybody better, and that's where you're more comfortable and you're really able to build relationships as opposed when you first meet somebody where you're treading lightly, getting to know everybody, getting your bearings — at least that's how I am.\n\nAlong with a new co-star, Mellencamp also recently welcomed a soon-to-be family member, with her dad's recent engagement to actress Meg Ryan in November.\n\nRUMORS OF JOHN MELLENCAMP, MEG RYAN WEDDING SWIRL\n\nI am so happy, she gushed.\n\nThey are such an amazing couple, and they're smart, and they're funny, and they're both brilliant. I feel really grateful.
CNN was uncharacteristically tame in the network's immediate fact-checking and analysis of President Trump's Oval Office address on Tuesday, until the network's White House correspondent Jim Acosta got involved.\n\nAcosta, who was scolded by Kellyanne Conway earlier in the day, appeared after a subdued panel discussion led by Chris Cuomo and kicked things off with an out-of-place joke.\n\nThat address probably should have come with a surgeon general's warning, it was hazardous to the truth, Acosta said, prompting an uncomfortable smirk from Cuomo.\n\nThere were a number of claims that the president made in that speech that are just not going to the facts, he continued. One of them being, this thing that he said over and over again that the new trade deal with Mexico is going to somehow pay for the wall.\n\nAcosta then noted that he'd expected the address to be recycled rhetoric.\n\nThat's pretty much what we got, Acosta declared, noting that Trump has been describing immigrants as criminals and killers and so on since he first declared his political aspirations.\n\nNot much has changed in terms of the president's rhetoric on this, Acosta said, He did say… Democrats asked for the steel barrier. … I just talked to a senior Democratic aide up on the Capitol Hill who said, 'No, we as a party did not ask for a steel barrier.'\n\nCuomo, brother of the Democratic governor of New York, reminded Acosta that Democrats have financed steel barriers in the past.\n\nIt's amazing how everyone is trying to forget the history here, Cuomo said.\n\nCNN'S NINA TURNER MOCKS TRUMP: REPUBLICANS NEED TO 'CHANGE THE PRESIDENT'S DIAPERS'\n\nAcosta, who has emerged as a household name over occasions when Trump and members of his administration are made available to the press, asked Conway during a press gaggle prior to the briefing if Trump planned on telling the truth.\n\nYes, Jim, Conway shot back, Can you promise that you will? The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Am I allowed to mention 'God' to you?\n\nAcosta responded by telling Conway that he doesn't have an alternative facts problem like she does.\n\nMake sure that goes viral. This is why I'm one of the only people around here who gives you the time of day, Conway said. You're such a smarta-- most of the time and I know you want this to go viral.\n\nConway then told Acosta that a lot of these people don't like him, while pointing to his peers and asked the reporter not to call her ma'am.\n\nLast year Acosta was briefly banned from the White House after he engaged in a contentious back-and-forth with Trump during a Nov. 7 press conference. During the now-infamous moment, Acosta refused to pass the microphone to a female White House aide.\n\nAcosta's press pass was restored on Nov. 19 after CNN argued that keeping him out of the White House violated the network and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights.
EXCLUSIVE: The group of Senate Republicans led by Ted Cruz will object to the certification of presidential election results in at least one state on Jan. 6, with a source telling Fox News that it is not a question of if the senators will object, but one of which states, and how many.\n\nIt's not a question of if objections to disputed states' electors will be raised, it's a question of which and how many, the source told Fox News Monday.\n\nGOP SENATORS, LED BY CRUZ, TO OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION, DEMAND EMERGENCY AUDIT\n\nThe group is committed to pushing the electoral commission here to get the facts, the source said.\n\nAnother GOP aide told Fox News that the group led by Cruz continued to discuss their plans on a call this evening, but no decisions have yet been made.\n\nCruz on Saturday assembled a group of 11 Republican senators—Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin; James Lankford of Oklahoma; Steve Daines of Montana; John Kennedy of Louisiana; Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Mike Braun of Indiana; as well as Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming; Roger Marshall of Kansas; Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama— announcing that they would object to the certification of the Electoral College results unless there was an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission.\n\nA source familiar told Fox News Monday that Cruz came up with the idea last Thursday, New Year's Eve, in light of questions surrounding the 2020 presidential election, and that Cruz worked to find a way for Congress to address the claims that was consistent with the Constitution.\n\nFox News has learned that Cruz first raised his idea to establish a commission to Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., on Friday, and then spent the next 24 hours on the phone, personally texting and emailing with various Republican senators and senators-elect.\n\nThe sources also told Fox News that those conversations continued into early Saturday morning, when the announcement was made.\n\nFox News has also learned that Cruz has been leading conference calls with the coalition of Senate Republicans and is in ongoing communication with them, in between trips to Georgia ahead of the state's Senate runoff elections on Tuesday.\n\nBy Saturday, Cruz and the group of Republican senators released a statement, which Fox News has learned was written personally by Cruz, calling on Congress to appoint a commission to conduct a 10-day emergency audit of the election returns in states where the results are disputed. They cite as precedent the 1877 race between Samuel Tilden and Rutherford Hayes in which there were allegations of fraud in multiple states.\n\nIn 1877, Congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy, the lawmakers said in the statement. Instead, Congress appointed an Electoral Commission -- consisting of five Senators, five House Members, and five Supreme Court Justices -- to consider and resolve the disputed returns.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS PRESSURE SENATE GOP TO OBJECT TO AT LEAST 3 STATES IN JAN. 6 CERTIFICATION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS\n\nWe should follow that precedent. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, the senators intend to vote against certification.\n\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, they said in the statement.\n\nCruz, on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures, said that each member of Congress faces a dilemma.\n\nMORE THAN 100 GOP HOUSE MEMBERS TO OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION\n\nLook, we've got a vote on January 6 on certification, and every member of Congress faces a dilemma, frankly two pretty lousy choices, Cruz said. That's why when in assembling this group of 11 senators, I was looking for a third option. An option that was really moored in the law.\n\nWhat I'm arguing for is Congress ought to do the same thing, Cruz continued. We ought to have a fair inquiry, a fair audit into these results, and we and we ought to resolve these claims – not just dismiss them out of hand.\n\nAs for states Cruz and the group of senators could object to, a source familiar told Fox News that discussions are ongoing. Another source told Fox News that the senators have been engaged in numerous phone calls and conference calls, but said that no conclusions had been reached.\n\nMeanwhile, last month, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., became the first Republican senator to commit to objecting to the election results, and specifically said he would do so in at least one state – Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd two sources told Fox News on Sunday that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., separately may object to at least one state during the joint session, but it is unclear, at this point, which state, if any, that may be.\n\nLOEFFLER TO OBJECT TO CERTIFICATION OF PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION RESULTS\n\nPaul's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe issue of Electoral College certification, though, is not being whipped by Senate Republican leadership, meaning they are not driving the Republican conference in a certain direction. As previously reported, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has referred to this as a vote of conscience.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators on Sunday said efforts to object to the Electoral College results this week by Republicans only will undermine confidence in the 2020 election.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign has launched a number of legal challenges, while Trump himself has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Joe Biden's victories.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press last month that to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.
Listen up, Georgia Republicans!\n\nI get it – you're exhausted, angry and sick to death of ads warning that only you can fend off a Democrat Socialist Republic.\n\nHere's the bad news: those ads are true. You have the terrible responsibility, in these last remaining hours, to decide the future of our country. For the sake of the nation and of Georgia, you must get out and vote to elect Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler to the Senate.\n\nTIMOTHY HEAD: IN GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFF ELECTIONS CHOICE FOR CHRISTIAN VOTERS IS CLEAR\n\nLet's make this easy; do you want Democrats to massively raise your taxes? And … do you want your tax dollars bailing out New York and California, which have been demolished by crazy tough-on-business and soft-on-crime policies?\n\nThat, my friends, is what's on the line.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nJoe Biden has pledged to reverse President Trump's tax cuts; if Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., becomes majority leader in the Senate, he will restore the deductibility of state and local taxes, in effect using taxes paid by hard-working Georgians to plug deficits racked up by profligate blue states like New York.\n\nThere's more at stake than taxes. If Jon Ossoff and Rafael Warnock win, and Democrats take control of the Senate on Jan. 5, many of the rights and freedoms you cherish are at risk. Moreover, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schumer, two dishonest partisans who fought President Trump every moment of the past four years, will run the nation.\n\nJust as President Trump stemmed the downward slide of our great country into mediocrity, that responsibility now rests with you.\n\nConsider how these Senate elections could change your lives.\n\nFor instance, the House is set to adopt rules that would, its authors claim, honor all gender identities by forbidding the use of words like mother or sister; going forward, House members could only use terms like parent or sibling. That kind of idiocy can spread like a virus. Do Georgians want their speech censored by left-wing culture warriors?\n\nHow about the 49% of you Georgians who live in homes that contain guns? Do you know that Democrats are pushing a law through the House called the Gun Violence Prevention and Community Safety Act of 2020, which makes it very tough to buy or sell a gun and removes limitations on the civil liability of gun manufacturers?\n\nAnother push by Democrats could lead to so-called reparations payments to descendants of people brought to this country as slaves.\n\nIf that law were to pass, gun makers could be sued by victims of shootings; the law might well put U.S. gun manufacturers out of business and make our Second Amendment rights a thing of the past.\n\nDemocrats are also working to open our borders, with a House bill called the New Way Forward Act, which repeals criminal penalties for illegally entering the country. It also ends mandatory detention for asylum seekers.\n\nThat bill is part of Democrats' long-term push to enable mass in-migration of Hispanics whose U.S.-born children automatically become citizens and, almost as automatically, future Democrat voters.\n\nAnother push by Democrats could lead to so-called reparations payments to descendants of people brought to this country as slaves. Texas Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee introduced a bill in the House that would examine slavery and discrimination in the colonies and the United States from 1619 to the present and recommend appropriate remedies.\n\nVice president-elect Kamala Harris has expressed support for reparations, as a sort of mental health treatment to deal with the ongoing trauma of slavery. Trauma induced, it should be noted, more than a century ago.\n\nBiden has backed a preliminary study of the issue, as has Schumer. It is hard to imagine a more divisive proposal; race relations are at a low point. With Democrats pushing this kind of grievance agenda, they will only get worse.\n\nAnd let's consider voting rights, an issue that hits close to home for Georgians today. The House has passed the For the People Act which, among other things, reduces the ability to remove voters from voter rolls.\n\nJust recently, Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner, sister of unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate and election rights activist Stacey Abrams, ruled in favor of Democrats who challenged the removal of nearly 4,000 people on Georgia voter rolls. Republicans wanted those folks tossed because change-of-address notifications indicate they have moved out of state. Presented with that documentation, local boards of elections voted to scrub those names, but they were overruled.\n\nElated Democrats called Gardner's ruling a blow to GOP voter suppression'; Republicans, who demanded that the partisan judge recuse herself from the case, viewed it as more Democrat-led voter fraud.\n\nThe For the People bill, which passed the House more than a year ago and is just waiting for a Democrat-led Senate, would allow criminals to vote, permanently expand absentee voting and voting-by-mail, prohibit purging voter rolls of eligible voters (as in the case cited) and in many other ways attempt to advantage Democrat candidates. The bill was designated HR1 in the 2019 term, designating it as a top priority.\n\nOf course, that is not the only tactic Democrats might use to expand their grip on the country. Other ambitions include stacking the Supreme Court, welcoming reliably blue Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., as states, and abolishing the Electoral College. These attempts to profoundly change our nation could only succeed if the Democrats win control of the Senate.\n\nWhat will Democrats do if they gain unfettered power?\n\nAmong other policies, they will make access to full-term abortions the law of the land, push criminal justice reforms the likes of which have set once-safe New York City's murder rate soaring, and eliminate right-to-work laws that make Georgia more competitive and has led to state unemployment of 5.7%, much lower than the national average of 6.7%.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat's a hint of what's in store if Democrats take the Senate.\n\nGeorgia – you can still save yourselves, and this great nation. Please vote for Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue. We will thank you.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK
Tesla is shuffling its lineup again by eliminating the two least-expensive versions of its two top models.\n\nElon Musk has announced on Twitter that anyone interested in buying a Model S or Model X with a 75 kWh battery pack had better get their order in by Sunday night because they're going away after that.\n\nThe cars have base prices of $76,000 and $82,000, respectively, while the next-up 100 kWh versions cost $94,000 and $97,000, respectively. The added cost primarily brings a longer range between charges and a small performance bump. The move creates more space between the Model S and smaller Model 3, the most expensive version of which starts at $62,000.\n\nThe change comes less than two weeks after Tesla dropped the price of all of its models by $2,000 to make up for a reduction in the federal tax credit that they qualify for.\n\nTESLA SUED BY PARENTS OF TEEN KILLED IN FIERY CRASH\n\nMusk did not announce any plans for an upcoming price adjustment on the 100 kWh cars, or a replacement for the 75 kWh battery, although previous model eliminations have often preceded additional updates.\n\nMusk added that Tesla will be moving away from labeling its vehicles with numerical designations for their battery size in favor of the naming system used for the Model 3, which is currently available in Mid Range, Long Range and Performance versions.\n\nFOLLOW FOX NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE
Arthur Kaliyev scored with 1:16 remaining and the United States advanced to the championship game of the world juniors, beating Finland 4-3 Monday night.\n\nAlex Turcotte, John Farinacci and Matthew Boldy also scored for the U.S., which won gold four previous times including their last one in 2017.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nSpencer Knight, one of eight returning players for a U.S., team that finished sixth last year following a quarterfinal loss against Finland, stopped 33 shots.\n\nKasper Simontaival had two goals and Roni Hirvonen also scored for Finland. Kari Piiroinen made 21 saves.\n\nThe United States will face Canada, which beat Russia 5-0 earlier Monday, in the gold medal game on Tuesday. Finland faces Russia for the bronze.\n\nTurcotte held off a Finnish defender to swipe home a bouncing puck from the top of the crease to open the scoring at 12:39 of the first period.\n\nFinland responded quickly on a power play, with Simontaival finishing off a one-touch pass from Kasper Puutio on a set play at 14:06.\n\nKnight stopped 18-of-19 shots through 40 minutes, and was rewarded by his teammates when the U.S. struck twice in a 1:07 span of the second period to take a 3-1 lead into the third.\n\nJackson LaCombe caught Finland making a change and sprung Farinacci on a breakaway with a slick pass up the middle from his own zone, with the American forward snapping the puck past Piiroinen at 15:53 of the second.\n\nThen while on a man advantage, Boldy tipped in a perfect snap pass from Trevor Zegras at the side of the net with three minutes to go in the period.\n\nZegras' assist gives him 16 points in six games and ties him with Jeremy Roenick (1989) for the second-highest single tournament point total in American history.

It was his first goal of the tournament.\n\nRussia got on the board with less than three minutes to go in the second period, but it was disallowed after a challenge for an offside zone entry.\n\nRussia pushed hard in the third. Shakir Mukhamadullin came close to scoring midway through the frame, ringing a shot off the post.\n\nBoth teams went down to four men with just over four minutes left on the clock after Peyton Krebs and Zakhar Bardakov were called for roughing.\n\nThe Russians pulled Askarov with about three minutes to go, and Cozens buried the empty-net goal with 1:29 left on the clock.\n\nThe 19-year-old also had two assists in the game.

PAMPLONA, Colombia – A little girl plays with her mother's identification card – tossing, catching and guarding it fiercely. It's the only thing she has to call her own.\n\nBoys nearby play soccer with an empty soda bottle. Men, reduced to tears, hide away in makeshift tents, counting pennies to feed their families.\n\nIt first started as a trickle, but really in the last year, it became a wave of people fleeing both for reasons of persecution and simply because they could no longer sustain themselves, Todd Chapman, the U.S Ambassador to Ecuador, told Fox News. People don't leave their children behind because they want to. It is because of the dire circumstances on the ground in Venezuela are causing people to take this consequential and dangerous and desperate decision to seek a better life elsewhere.\n\nThe depth of the catastrophe threatens to unravel the stability and wreak financial havoc beyond just Latin America - with little end in sight. It's quite simply the worst crisis the region has seen in modern history, according to Moises Rendon, associate director and fellow for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).\n\nYou have a humanitarian and economic collapse, mass immigration and the government cracking down along with institutional collapse, he said. Combine all these aspects together, and Venezuela is fast becoming a threat for the civility of the whole region.\n\nResponse for Venezuelans, the coordination platform for refugees and migrants, documents at least 16 countries that now need assistance in tending to the ever-burgeoning mass migration flow.\n\nNeighboring countries have subsequently been forced to deal with spikes in crimes, sex, and drug trafficking, and criminals – both from Venezuela and from home nations – seeking to take advantage of those most desperate amid the calamity.\n\nIn most towns and cities across Latin America, bus terminals have become sleeping hubs for new arrivals from Venezuela – but often raising the ire of authorities who have been purporting to dismantle them – given they, too, have become hubs for drug dealing, crime, sexual assault, and other illicit activities.\n\nAnd for that reason, they are squalid, dirty and dangerous places for vulnerable Venezuelans. Officials refer to those leaving Venezuela as being a mixed migration flow rather than refugees.\n\nAlthough more than 3.3 million Venezuelans are estimated to have left the country since 2015, only a small portion – for example, just 11,000 in Ecuador – have applied for asylum.\n\nMany just can't feed their children so their focus is on just getting a job, anything until they can go home again, explained UNHCR's Representative in Ecuador, María Clara Martín. I have rarely seen a Venezuelan who says they don't want to return.\n\nOther professionals underscored the lack of information on how to apply for asylum and the needed qualifications, an issue various NGO and UN bodies are endeavoring to address.\n\nSantiago Chavez, Ecuador's Vice Minister of Mobility, said there are more than 300,000 Venezuelans currently living in Ecuador, with about three-quarters having entered in an irregular – otherwise illegal – way.\n\nThe effort that Ecuador is having to do here is proportional to Germany allowing a million Syrian refugees in, and yet there is a big difference as Germany is a big, industrial country with a lot of resources to tend to the crisis, Chavez said. Ecuador, in contrast, has very limited resources.\n\nJobs are hard to come by in the countries that have taken in the Venezuelans, even for those with university degrees or established professions. Antonio Ledezma, a former political prisoner, mayor of Caracas and opposition leader now exiled in Spain, told Fox News more than 64 percent of the migrants are below 30 years of age, and more than 52 percent have received higher education.\n\nWhile fleeing to another nation provides some hope, most resort to street selling.\n\nAt the Resting House in Quito, Ecuador a group of 20-something former students and professionals take turns selling cookies in different parts of the street.\n\nI've only been able to send money home to Venezuela on two occasions, lamented Yondel Alestre, 24, explaining that few in the shelter where he stays own a smartphone, making it difficult to contact family members. My wife is in Colombia, where she had to go to give birth as there was no medical care in Venezuela. My other children are with my mother in Venezuela and I have to stay in Ecuador to try to work.\n\nThe impasse has torn families apart – with some migrant describing how certain members had gone to Chile or Colombia, while others ventured to Peru or Argentina – all in a bid to send whatever they could home to their other loved ones, sick and starving in their homeland.\n\nIt's really rough what the migrants have gone through. Everyone is frustrated, depressed, said Marcelo Viteli, the General Manager of the Resting House where up to 80 migrants are permitted to seek shelter for a few months after arrival.\n\nINSIDE LATIN AMERICAN 'AMAZING RACE' STAR'S DRAMATIC ESCAPE FROM VENEZUELA\n\nTRUMP ADMINISTRATION WALKING BACK OBAMA-ERA FOREIGN POLICY MISTAKES IN BURMA\n\nIt wasn't so long ago that Colombians were fleeing en masse to Venezuela – then the richest nation in Latin America, which still holds the largest known oil reserves in the world – as a simmering 50-year civil war raged on. While the tables have abruptly turned, most Colombians are eager to return the generosity.\n\nAn array of Colombian locals have set up their own makeshift shelters, or opened the doors to their own homes to assist the walkers on their long and arduous trek from the bordering nation.\n\nAt one small hut near the border town of Cucuta, some 300 mostly women and children pass through to recharge their phones, get some sleep and soup, and pick up an item of clothing from the Samaritan's Purse donation mound.\n\nFurther along the winding road, Colombian local Marta Duque – who opened the home to help Venezuelans after feeling a deep sense of sadness for what they were enduring – say she, too, has been threatened with fines and being arrested, given the hazard of having scores of migrants pouring out into the streets.\n\nBut she refuses to give up and shut down. I have to help because I understand what they are going through, why they have to leave, Duque said.\n\nOne young mother, Marisela, cradles her young son on Duque's floor, and encourages him to take deep breaths.\n\nHe is asthmatic, and there was no help for him, no medication in Venezuela, and the attacks became worse, she said. Life there is chaotic in every sense. I hope to get him medicine in Colombia. But without government change, there is no going home.\n\nThe acute medicinal shortage and health dilemma not only pose great health risks to Venezuelans, but to the region at large. The country is enduring a dire shortage of vaccinations and treatments for illnesses and diseases, prompting a concern that once eradicated conditions such as measles and diptheria are not only spreading in the financially depleted nation, but now threatens millions across Latin America.\n\nThe migration in 2018 has been fast and fleeting. Ecuador, for one, went from seeing the entry of thirty to forty Venezuelans per month to a peak of around 90,000 in May this year. A second wave hit in October, and at least 70,000 a month have been entering since.\n\nPeople who crossed before had at least a few dollars in their pocket for basic needs. Now they have absolutely nothing, said Victor Bautista, director for development and border integration at the foreign ministry in Colombia. In just six months, we went from 170 thousand migrants here to one million. Sixteen months ago, we had just 32,000. Something must be done. The humanitarian issues are unbelievable, and they will hurt the entire region.\n\nBoth government and non-governmental professionals tending to the regional calamity concurred that this year there has been a profile shift in those fleeing.\n\nIn the first few years of the meltdown, which gained momentum in 2015, those with some finances and education were able to buy plane tickets out. But as the situation has slowly deteriorated, those from poorer backgrounds started to escape.\n\nOne U.S government official closely monitoring the case told Fox News that while official displacement camps have not yet been established, calling this a last resort it is an option on the table being considered.\n\nExperts surmise that at least one in 10 leaving Venezuela now are disabled, and have pointed to an uptick in unaccompanied minors crossing international borders – mostly boys between the ages of 15 and 17. But many don't have documentation.\n\nUltimately, the buck stops with local governments who are then in-charge of tending to the minors, with local aid agencies doing their best to offer guidance and support to the already overwhelmed government bodies.\n\nBut with mass migration, comes surges in what some deem xenophobia toward Venezuelans, what others claim to be integration problems, and what others characterize as one citizen's need to put their own families first, over that of legal and illegal arrivals.\n\nWe are trying to establish programs that can be of benefit to both Ecuadorians and Venezuelans, and address the welfare concerns of both, said the International Organization for Migration (IOM) Ecuador's Chief of Mission, Manuel Hoff.\n\nIn several soup kitchens and shelters, separate lines and dining areas have had to be set up separate the poor locals from the Venezuelans, as to avoid any contention.\n\nYet the end game is unclear. All signs point to the situation only worsening, especially after January 10, when Maduro begins another presidential term. Though his term is not recognized by most of the international community, which viewed the 2017 presidential election as a farce.\n\nSo Maduro will after Jan. 9 be deemed illegitimate in the eyes of most international players – including the United States – which has been mulling designating Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism alongside Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Sudan.\n\nYet Venezuela does have some support abroad from the likes of Cuba, Iran, China, Russia and Turkey - all authoritarian regimes who say they support the country's sovereignty. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan this month condemned the sanctions against Venezuela, and this year Turkey became the biggest importer of non-monetary gold from Venezuela. And Russia now owns prominent parcels of at least five oil fields in the country, and is helping prevent Maduro's government from falling into bankruptcy, despite the unfathomable levels of hyperinflation.\n\nThe Maduro regime has – for the most part – denied the existence of a major crisis in its country, instead blaming the US- and US-supported political foe for waging economic war.\n\nOver the past fiscal year, the United States has already given almost $100 million – distributed through the Department of State and other agencies – to assist in the humanitarian response to the regional Venezuela contingency. In September, the U.S. pledged a further $48 million. Moreover, the Department of Defense spending in the region over the past year totaled more than $110 million.\n\nThe number of Venezuelans fleeing is expected to reach 5.3 million by the end of 2019, according to the United Nations, in what has become the largest exodus in modern Latin American history.\n\nThe U.N High Commissioner for Refugees stated that humanitarian organizations will require $738 million to provide vital services such as food and shelters to help ease the burden on receiving nations.\n\nIt is forecasted that Colombia will continue to receive the most migrants, at least another 1.2 million over the coming year totaling 2.2 million, while its expected Peru will have 1.4 million Venezuelans by the end of 2019. Ecuador, Brazil, as well as other countries in the Southern Cone, Central America and the Caribbean too are predicted to see a swell in Venezuelan arrivals.\n\nThe UN is projecting that at least two million more Venezuelans will flee their crumbling country over the course of the year.\n\nNonetheless, Chapman, the American Ambassador in Ecuador, underscored the U.S is committed to the cause, and said the Trump administration has long been resolute in supporting the humanitarian response in the region.\n\nWhat has been shocking to me is I am seeing parallels to other places I have worked – Afghanistan and Mozambique when it was the poorest country in the world, he added. People have that gaunt look of people who are starving, of people who have no hope. It is very troubling this is happening so close to our shores, and that is what makes finding a solution to the Venezuela crisis all the more important.
Alabama star receiver Jaylen Waddle has returned to practice. Now the question is will he be able to play in the title game Monday night against Ohio State?\n\nCrimson Tide offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian says Waddle practiced on Tuesday, but he deferred questions on his status to coach Nick Saban, who did not address the media on Wednesday.\n\nWe'll see where it goes from here, Sarkisian said. Clearly we've got about a week or so until the game.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nWaddle hasn't played since breaking his right ankle while returning the opening kickoff against Tennessee on Oct. 4. One of the nation's most dangerous return men, he had surgery after the game.\n\nIn his absence, DeVonta Smith went on to put up big enough numbers to win the Heisman Trophy on Tuesday. That would put the onus on the Buckeyes to defend that formidable pair.\n\nI think you absolutely have to prepare as if he's going to play, Ohio State defensive coordinator Kerry Coombs said. He's an extraordinary athlete, extraordinary receiver.\n\nWaddle had 557 yards and four touchdowns in the Tide's first four games, while opponents mostly kicked away from him.\n\nWaddle has made three of the program's five longest scoring catches. His career average of 19.1 yards per catch ranks second among Tide players with at least 100 receptions. He also has returned two punts and a kick for touchdowns in his career.\n\nI think he's getting back into it, Smith said. Of course he's going to take some time just for him to get back comfortable with everything, but he looks good to me.\n\nQuarterback Mac Jones agreed. Neither player offered an opinion on whether Waddle would play.\n\nIt'd be really cool, Jones said. Jaylen has worked really hard to get back on the field and I know he wants nothing more than to play, but I think they're just going to make that decision downstairs.\n\nBut it's his choice, and I feel like in watching him, he looks really good out there. So we'll see what happens.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n'GOOD DAY' FOR BUCKEYES\n\nA day after a report raised the possibility of the College Football Playoff championship being delayed because of COVID-19 issues at Ohio State, Buckeyes athletic director Gene Smith told The Associated Press he anticipated the game will go on as scheduled.\n\nIn the COVID world it's day-by-day, Smith said Wednesday. Today was a good day.\n\nAL.com first reported Tuesday that Ohio State had reached out to CFP officials with concerns about player availability when the Buckeyes face No. 1 Alabama on Monday night in Miami Gardens, Florida. A person with knowledge of the situation confirmed those discussions to the AP, but Smith and CFP Executive Director Bill Hancock both released statements saying there was no change to the schedule.\n\nSmith declined to provide any details about what virus-related problems Ohio State might be facing, but he did say the team practiced Wednesday.\n\nWe're in good shape. Ready to roll, Smith said.\n\nOhio State President Kristina M. Johnson posted photos on Twitter showing her visiting with coach Ryan Day and the team in the school's indoor practice facility.\n\nI can't wait to join Buckeyes around the world on Jan. 11 in cheering on this very special team, Johnson wrote.\n\nWEST COAST EXPORTS\n\nThe West Coast will be well represented in the national championship game among the players, if not the football programs themselves.\n\nAlabama All-America tailback Najee Harris, Ohio State wide receiver Chris Olave and Buckeyes All-America guard Wyatt Davis are all from California.\n\nHarris, for one, misses the California sunshine, but he has no regrets about his trading the West Coast for the Southern humidity — and football.\n\nThey say a lot of West Coast guys can't play in I guess conferences like this, the SEC, said Harris, who was fifth in the Heisman Trophy voting. So I wanted to like kill that hype, I guess, in a way and show that we can play, that West Coast people can play.\n\nWe have a lot more guys from the West Coast playing in the SEC than before, so it's good to see a lot of guys travel across.\n\nMORE RESPECT FOR FIELDS\n\nCoombs, who has been coaching football for nearly three decades, says Ohio State's Justin Fields is among the best quarterbacks ever.\n\nFields, the second-year Buckeyes starter and likely first-round NFL draft pick, added to his resume on Wednesday when he was named the winner of the 2020 Chicago Tribune Silver Football award as the best player in the Big Ten.\n\nHe's got command of the offense, he understands where we want to distribute the ball, said Coombs, who was an assistant with the NFL's Tennessee Titans last season after a five-year stint on Urban Meyer's staff at Ohio State. He's one of the best quarterbacks I've ever seen and been around, and we've been around some really good ones here. He's truly gifted.\n\nBATTLE IN THE TRENCHES\n\nOhio State defensive tackle Haskell Garrett said he's looking forward to facing the Tide's offensive front, which just won the 2020 Joe Moore Award this week as the nation's best O-line.\n\nIt will be won in the trenches, no doubt, said Garrett, who recovered from a gunshot wound to the face in August to become one of the leaders of the Buckeyes' defense.\n\nGames like this will be won up front, he said. If you can't move offensive and defensive lines, then you have no chance at winning. Offensive and defensive linemen are unsung heroes. We might not get the glamour and the flash, but it's won up front and the better front is going to win this game.
It's official. By executive fiat, President Obama will grant amnesty to up to 5 million immigrants living illegally in the United States.\n\nHow did we get here? Didn't the president say, even last year, that he couldn't, and wouldn't take executive action on immigration?\n\nIf Obama ever finds himself in a court of law, he would surely be advised to invoke the Fifth Amendment. He is prone to contradiction and tends to be a good witness against himself.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nConsider his self-incriminating statements on immigration and executive powers. A year ago, when asked if he had the authority to end deportations of illegal aliens he said, Actually, I don't. Three years earlier, when pressed as to why he could not act on his own on immigration he said, The notion that somehow I can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true.\n\nWell, now the president says it is true -- he can alter the laws unilaterally. Why the metamorphosis? What changed? The law and the Constitution are still the same. Which leaves Obama. When it comes to the truth, inconvenient or otherwise, he is a chameleon like no other politician. He never hesitates to contradict himself, conjuring a new breadth of hypocrisy.\n\nPresident Obama's favorite justification for his executive action is that Congress failed to act. No, Mr. President, Congress did not fail to act, it chose not to act in granting amnesty.\n\nThere is a difference. A determination not to act is, by itself, a deliberate act. This is how the framers constructed our system of government. Congress considers and debates a great many bills. Not all of them pass. This is not failure in the conventional sense, but decision by declination. It constitutes a prudent and calculated process.\n\nBut the president uses this contrived failure as a pretext to arrogate the authority of another branch of government. He wields his pen to legislate by executive decree. He well knows he is exceeding his power. In 2011, he said, I know some people want me to bypass Congress and change the (immigration) on my own. But that's not how our system works. That's not how our democracy functions. That's not how our Constitution is written. He was right. It was a rare moment of clarity for a man who fancies himself a constitutional scholar.\n\nNow, however, by granting legal status to roughly half the nation's population of illegal immigrants, Obama is twisting the law, ignoring the Constitution, and forsaking his primary responsibility as chief executive. For years, he argued publicly it would be unconstitutional for him to take such action because he said, I'm president, I'm not king. Apparently, he now favors a crown on his noggin. In truth, he is king of self-confutation, negating himself with his own words.\n\nRecently, when asked why he disagreed with himself, the president insisted, Well, actually, my position hasn't changed. After the laughter died down, the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama an upside-down Pinocchio for his tortured denial of a blatant flip-flop.\n\nThe president's executive action to legalize illegals by nullifying existing law, constitutes a stunning abuse of office: usurping the power of Congress, while abdicating his duty to uphold and enforce the laws. Here are three ways this is happening:\n\n1. Distorting Prosecutorial Discretion\n\nPresident Obama claims he is entitled to overhaul immigration laws in the name of prosecutorial discretion. It is one of those wonderfully fungible phrases in the law. Elastic because it is vague and ambiguous. Useful because it can be easily abused. Mr. Obama has appropriated this doctrine to argue he has near boundless discretion to amend, revise, waive or suspend the execution of immigration laws. As chief executive, he is empowering himself to decide what laws may be enforced or ignored and what persons may come or go across our southern border irrespective of what the law actually states.\n\nIn past decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has cautioned the executive branch that its prosecutorial discretion, while broad, is not unfettered. It is subject to restrictions. The doctrine may not be used to adopt a sweeping policy of non-enforcement of the law. It applies only to decisions not to prosecute or expel specific individuals or small groups of people, typically for exigent reasons like war, civil unrest or political persecution.\n\nBy contrast, President Obama is bestowing a wholesale, blanket amnesty for an entire class of nearly 5 million people. He is doing so not for the reasons allowed by law, but for purposes that appear to be purely political. This is a flagrant abuse of prosecutorial discretion. His expansive action exceeds his authority in ways that none of his predecessors ever envisioned. And it is a radical departure from any of the executive actions issued by previous presidents.\n\nIt is true that President Ronald Reagan utilized executive action in 1987 to grant a limited deportation reprieve to certain spouses and young children of immigrants. But his action was a logical and direct extension of, not a departure from, an existing amnesty law Congress had already passed. His exemption and a subsequent extension by his successor, President George H. W. Bush, were later incorporated into a new law passed by Congress. The point is instructive. The actions by Reagan and Bush are not a supporting precedent for Mr. Obama, but an important limiting principle of presidential authority.\n\nHowever, President Obama has commandeered this elastic doctrine of prosecutorial discretion and stretched or manipulated it beyond all recognition and reason. It has become his political Gumby toy with which he exerts his will whenever he fails to get his way with Congress. He contorts the word discretion to adopt a capacious policy -- his own policy -- to ban full enforcement of a duly enacted immigration statute. He treats the doctrine as a magical incantation shielding his arbitrariness.\n\n2. Usurping Legislative Authority\n\nOur Constitution clearly delineates a separation of powers. Congress is vested with writing laws and the President is charged with executing those laws. This is especially true when it comes to immigration.\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the Supreme Court declared that Congress had plenary power (meaning full and complete) to regulate immigration. Derived from Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, the doctrine is based on the concept that immigration is a question of national sovereignty, relating to a nation's right to define its own borders and restrict entrance therein. As the high court observed, Over no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete.\n\nYet President Obama has decided to usurp this power by unilateral directive, unconstrained by established checks and balances. In so doing, he is granting himself extra-constitutional authority and upsetting the carefully balanced separation of powers. He is also subverting the nucleus of our constitutional design: the rule of law.\n\n3. Breaching His Sworn Duty\n\nPresident Obama's decision that existing laws shall not be enforced against some 5 million illegal immigrants violates his sworn constitutional duty. Article II, Section 3 requires that the President shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed. Nowhere is it written that the chief executive is granted the latitude to pick and choose which laws he wants to enforce. He cannot ignore or nullify laws he does not like because the constitution gives him no power not to execute laws. To infer such latitude would invite an authoritarian rule anathema to our founding fathers' vision. President Obama admitted as much when he said, The fact of the matter is, there are laws on the books that I have to enforce. He was specifically talking about immigration laws.\n\nIn 1996, Congress passed a law which requires federal immigration agents to deport illegal immigrants, with few exceptions. The statutory language is mandatory. Thus, whatever prosecutorial discretion which may have existed previously, was specifically eliminated by that legislative act. Yet, the President is now, in effect, ordering those agents to break the law. He cannot, on his own, engage in a de facto repeal of this law by executive action. To do so would be, quite simply, lawlessness and a dereliction of his duty.\n\nIf President Obama can refuse to enforce a valid federal law affecting millions of people, are there any limits to his powers? After all, he has frequently threatened, Where Congress won't act, I will. What is to stop him from rewriting other laws with which he disagrees? Or to act where Congress has declined or refused to act? Can he abolish certain tax laws because Congress chooses to keep them? Can he banish all sources of energy except renewables to advance his agenda on climate change? If so, why even have a legislative branch of government? What's the point of a Constitution which enumerates and circumscribes powers and duties?\n\nMen like Madison, Jefferson and Adams were keenly aware of the tyranny and corruption of authority concentrated in too few hands. They knew the thirst for power posed an existential danger to those who cherish freedom. Their genius was in crafting a sustaining document that would end the arrogance of one man rule and protect the inherent rights of all men. They knew that absolute power corrupts.\n\nAnd they feared future presidents like Mr. Obama.\n\nIn the history of our republic, no president has dared turn his high office into an instrument of unrestrained power. They held too much respect for their fellow citizens than to abuse or misuse the principles of our democracy. Even Lincoln's actions to preserve the nation during the Civil War were grounded in the Constitution and the rule of law.\n\nBut, like the title of his autobiography, Mr. Obama's measure of himself seems defined by the word audacity. It is no more evident than now.
Several Republican senators are vowing to challenge electoral votes in the 2020 presidential election from several battleground states when the votes are formally counted at a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, with the hopes of establishing a commission to determine who gets the votes.\n\nUnlike what was called for by a failed lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, the suggestion here is not to simply overturn the election results outright and award a second term to President Trump, but rather to have an independent investigation of those states' elections. While out of the ordinary, it would not be the first time for such a process, as it is what happened following the 1876 election, allowing Rutherford B. Hayes to become president.\n\nTRUMP, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HELD CALL TO DISCUSS ELECTORAL COLLEGE REJECTION: BROOKS\n\nWe should follow that precedent, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and 10 other current and incoming senators said in a joint statement, referring to the race between Hayes and Samuel Tilden. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nIn 1877, following the 1876 election, returns from Florida, Louisana, and South Carolina – and one elector from Oregon – were disputed. Congress then set up a commission to determine how the electoral votes should be allocated, reserving the right to accept or reject the commission's findings. In the end, Congress awarded all 19 of the contested electoral votes to Hayes, who was elected with 185 electoral votes to Tilden's 184.\n\nGOP LAWMAKERS REJECT GOP PUSH TO OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS\n\nSen. James Lankford, R-Okla., one of the senators calling for a repeat of what happened then, outlined how it would work in a Saturday appearance on Fox News' Justice with Judge Jeanine.\n\nWe've asked a very simple question: Can we put together an electoral commission, have five senators, five House members, five members of the Supreme Court? Lankford explained. This is exactly how it was set up in 1876 when there was three states that had all kinds of fraud issues. And so the election commission was set up at that time in 1876, just like this, to be able to study it, look at it, make recommendations. We think that's a good plan. Obviously, there are millions and millions of Americans that think there are major issues with the election.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLankford said that he wants a commission to get to the bottom of how the election played out in these states, regardless of who the true winner is.\n\nNo matter how this turns out, we want the facts to come out, Lankford said. We want to make sure every legal vote is counted and votes that aren't legal are not counted. But regardless of where it goes at the end of it, it goes wherever the American people chose.\n\nSenate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he would pay attention to any allegations that will be made on Wednesday, but was skeptical of the overall strategy.\n\nProposing a commission at this late date – which has zero chance of becoming reality – is not effectively fighting for President Trump, Graham said in a statement. It appears to be more of a political dodge than an effective remedy.\n\nGraham went on to say that he will listen closely to the objections of my colleagues in challenging the results of this election, but noted that they have a high bar to clear in providing evidence that multiple state and federal courts erred in their rulings, and that the failure to take corrective action in addressing election fraud actually impacted the results of the presidential election.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry fired back Friday at Republicans who have criticized a statement he made earlier this week in which he said it was time for regime change in the United States.\n\nThey're trying to shift this in a phony way that they often do and making some sort of false claim about patriotism, and I am not going to be questioned on my patriotism by the likes of Tom DeLay, the Massachusetts senator said, referring to the House majority leader.\n\nOn Thursday, DeLay called Kerry's remarks desperate and inappropriate, referring to Kerry's Wednesday statement in front of an audience of New Hampshire Democrats.\n\nAt the event at the Petersborough Town Library, Kerry told a crowd of about 100 voters: What we need now is not just a regime change in Saddam Hussein and Iraq, but we need a regime change in the United States.\n\nThe remarks were similar to those he first made in California early in March, before the war against Iraq and the effort to get rid of Saddam Hussein was under way.\n\nWhat we need is regime change right here in America, Kerry said.\n\nThough similar, the remark made after the war drew criticism from plenty in the Republican Party, including Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist.\n\nPetty partisan insults launched solely for personal political gain are highly inappropriate at a time when American men and women are in harm's way, said Frist, R-Tenn.\n\nNew Hampshire and Iowa polls indicate a majority of Democratic voters oppose the war.\n\nKerry voted for using force against Saddam last year. Since then, he has often criticized President Bush's Iraq policy, leading some Democrats, including rival presidential candidate former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, to accuse Kerry of trying to have it both ways.\n\nKerry, who leads in most polls, has largely ignored attacks from the trailing Dean, but with the Republicans coming after him, Kerry dug in.\n\nThe real test of patriotism is in how you make America stronger and we fought for the right to be able to talk in this country about real choices. And they come along with these phony claims. I am not going to be deterred by them. I am not going to be pushed around by them, he said.\n\nRepublicans see political value in attacking the perceived Democratic frontrunner and at the same time defending the commander-in-chief.\n\nKerry defends his remarks as a decorated Vietnam veteran, a fact he notes in every speech, including to a New York teachers union convention in Washington on Friday.\n\nKerry is the only veteran in the field of nine Democratic presidential candidates, and his aides note that none of the most vocal GOP critics, Delay and Frist included, have served in the military.\n\nFox News' Naheda Zayed contributed to this report.
The 2021 Grammy Awards announced on Tuesday its decision to move the ceremony to March because of coronavirus pandemic conditions.\n\nThe new date, March 14, now conflicts with the previously scheduled 2021 Screen Actors Guild Awards, which honors the best performances in film and television.\n\nSAG-AFTRA expressed its disappointment in the Recording Academy's decision in a statement posted to its website on Wednesday.\n\nWe are extremely disappointed to hear of the conflicting date, March 14, announced today for this year's Grammy Awards telecast, SAG-AFTRA said.

Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those in our music community and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly on producing the show.\n\nThe Grammys were originally scheduled to take place Jan. 31 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles.\n\nLos Angeles County, the epicenter of the crisis in California, has surpassed 10,000 COVID-19 deaths and has seen 40% of the deaths in the state. California recently was the third state to reach 25,000 coronavirus-related deaths.\n\nAn average of six people die every hour from COVID-19 in Los Angeles County, which has a quarter of the state's 40 million residents.

Democratic Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal and other progressive lawmakers on Wednesday called for transformative change across America as America awaited the results of one Georgia runoff Senate race.\n\nDemocrat Raphael Warnock is projected to defeat Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., according to the Fox News Decision Desk early Wednesday. The race between Democrat Jon Ossoff and former Republican Sen. David Perdue is still too close to call, though Ossoff claimed victory Wednesday morning.\n\nIf Ossoff defeats Perdue, Democrats will hold the presidency and control both the House and Senate, which could allow the party to carry out more progressive policies.\n\nHOUSE DEM POSTS LEGISLATIVE WISH LIST WHILE AWAITING GEORGIA SENATE RESULTS\n\nVICTORY in Georgia must lead to transformative change across America! Jayapal tweeted. Recurring survival checks, union jobs that pay a living wage, guaranteed health care, racial justice, voting rights, immigration reform, climate action, repro justice, education, and MUCH more. It can't wait!\n\nJayapal later tweeted a list of progressive agenda goals, including COVID-19 relief such as survival checks, $15 federal minimum wage, a green renewable energy infrastructure package, humane immigration policy, racial justice, universal health care, democracy reform, bold climate policies, universal child care and family leave, and free college.\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee on Wednesday criticized the comments from Democratic lawmakers, saying they are pushing for a socialist agenda.\n\nWARNOCK PROJECTED TO DEFEAT LOEFFLER IN GEORGIA RUNOFF\n\nThe socialist Democrats just can't help themselves. They are openly pushing for a socialist agenda that will raise taxes, destroy our economy and leave communities less safe, NRCC Spokesman Mike Berg said in a statement to Fox News.\n\nDemocratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of four progressive congresswomen who refer to themselves as The Squad, including Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar and Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, retweeted Jayapal's transformative change message and later shared her own list of policy priorities.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHello! It's a new day! Who's ready to PUSH? Ocasio-Cortez said in an emoji-filled tweet on Wednesday. Ready to PUSH for retroactive COVID relief? And to PUSH for student loan cancellation? For climate justice? Healthcare? Voting rights? Ending the death penalty? What policies do you most want to PUSH for?\n\nOmar tweeted that Democrats must go big or go home, as she also used the transformative change line in a tweet.\n\nPressley also touted universal health care, housing, jobs, food and economic justice in a Wednesday tweet.\n\nMedicare for all. Housing for all. Jobs for all. Food for all. Economic justice for all. New year, she wrote.
Former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who has said he is seriously considering challenging California Gov. Gavin Newsom in next year's election, told Fox & Friends on Monday that change was needed, pointing to a growing frustration throughout California.\n\nFaulconer has signed a petition for the governor's recall. It states that Newsom has failed Californians, citing unaffordable housing, record homelessness, rising crime, failing schools, exploding pension debt and a locked down population among other reasons as to why he must go.\n\nAccording to a news release, the campaign to recall Newsom has garnered more than 911,000 signatures as of Monday, Dec. 28, reaching the 60% milestone to remove the controversial leader.\n\nIt's a new year. We need a new governor, Faulconer tweeted on Saturday. Jobs are leaving, homelessness is skyrocketing, and the state can't even issue unemployment checks to people struggling right now to get by.\n\nHe then encouraged other Californians to join him in signing the recall petition, writing, California is better than this.\n\nFaulconer, a Republican, stressed the need for new leadership in the state on Monday.\n\nWhen we look at what hasn't been happening from the governor's office, the conflicting rules and regulations in terms of COVID, the hypocrisy, all of the other issues that have also been ignored here in California in terms of homelessness skyrocketing, our schools still aren't open, this is frustration across the board, Faulconer said.\n\nGAVIN NEWSOM RECALL EFFORT GAINS MOMENTUM: TAMMY BRUCE SAYS CALIFORNIANS IN 'DIRE STRAITS'\n\nHe noted that Democrats, Republicans and independents understand we need a change at the top in California.\n\nLast month, Newsom announced the most restrictive order since he imposed the country's first statewide stay-at-home rule in March. Since Dec. 6, much of Southern California, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Central Valley have been placed under a sweeping new lockdown in an urgent attempt to slow the rapid rise of coronavirus cases.\n\nThe new measures include the closures of all bars, hair salons, barbershops, casinos and indoor and outdoor playgrounds.\n\nYou have to protect lives. We also have to protect livelihoods and that is a message that has been lost, unfortunately on this governor, Faulconer said.\n\nWe want to keep those numbers down, but we got to keep our economy moving as well, he added.\n\nThe fact that we have so many businesses shut in California, the fact that our schools aren't open, I think that is why you're seeing a growing number of Californians saying, 'Enough. It's time for a change.'\n\nFaulconer also said on Monday that he would absolutely run for governor if Newsom was recalled. He said he has been very vocal about the need for a leadership change at the top and added that we're opening an exploratory committee today.\n\nWe need a change in California and we need a change now, Faulconer stressed.\n\nIn November, fed up with the California governor's coronavirus policies, Faulconer first said he was seriously considering running for governor against Newsom, Politico reported. He reiterated he was giving the idea serious consideration on America's Newsroom later that month.\n\nNewsom is up for reelection in 2022. Faulconer, a moderate Republican, did not run for reelection in 2020.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA spokesperson with Newsom's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.
I guess no one in the FBI ever watched The Apprentice. It was only the number-one rated show in the country. In it, Donald Trump, more than any other person in the world, made famous weekly the phrase you're fired.\n\nConsequently when Donald Trump abruptly fired FBI Director James Comey, exercising the authority he believed he had as president of the United States, he was taking the very action he made famous. It wasn't out of character for him but in character, as he has been throughout his administration. If anything, it's hard to find anyone who has not been fired or threatened with firing. It's what he does.\n\nNow, let's review some of the actions of the FBI director. Many of these actions were clear at the time; others we know only now. What we have learned since underscores that the president's firing of Comey was more than justified, and the actions of Comey's staff and the Department of Justice (DOJ) to trigger the most extensive investigation in history of a campaign, an administration and a president appear to be wholly without justification – and were based instead on politically inspired emotion and hysteria.\n\nREPUBLICAN UNCOVERED SECRET FBI DEBATE OVER TRUMP MOTIVATION FOR COMEY FIRING DURING HOUSE QUESTIONING\n\nJames Comey initiated his relations with Trump by holding a one-on-one meeting at which he detailed the allegations of the Steele dossier without disclosing its source. Almost immediately the contents of the dossier leaked out to press, also without the source or verification. Comey publicly confirmed there was an investigation of the administration and yet refused to confirm that the president was not a target of the investigation while he repeatedly told the president that was the case.\n\nWe then learned through Comey's congressional testimony that he decided to take it upon himself to clear Hillary Clinton on her email controversy, and that the memo clearing her was drafted months in advance of much of the actual investigating. Once he believed the attorney general was compromised, as he testified, he should have asked for an independent counsel. Instead he exceeded his role and authority, politicizing the FBI in the process.\n\nHis testimony was enough to get Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff Sessions to endorse Comey's firing in writing, citing his complete lack of professionalism.\n\nNow, in the year since, we have learned new information that buttresses the case for his firing.\n\nSomehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.\n\nFirst, Comey's tweets and comments reveal that he despised Trump, and so the self-serving memos he was making and then leaking about his every contact with the president were likely part of an effort to build a case against Trump. We learned that the FBI was wiretapping a number of Trump campaign officials largely on the basis of the Steele dossier. We learned that the dossier was authored by an operative who hated Trump and paid for by the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign via hidden payments to their law firm. And we learned that Comey sent FBI agents to question General Michael Flynn about perfectly legal conversations they already had transcripts of, without following White House protocol, in a deliberate effort to entrap him.\n\nOn top of all of this, the Carter Page warrants flat-out state that the FBI had long before concluded the Trump campaign was working with the Russians.\n\nSomehow every clear security breach in the Clinton camp – like an aide's classified mail on the laptop of a sex offender or huge payments and contributions from Russian-connected sources – was no big deal, while every fourth-hand contact with someone who could possibly be linked to Russia was evidence that Donald Trump was secretly serving as a Russian agent.\n\nHow utterly ridiculous. I didn't support Donald Trump, and there are lots of things he does I don't support. But the idea that he was the Manchurian candidate working for the Russians when he ran on an America First platform is patently ridiculous.\n\nWhat this chain of actions supports is that there is a deep state — a group of unelected officials who now wield power far beyond their constitutional authority – who believe, like Comey, that they know best. In this case it was aided by Obama administration holdovers who never accepted the outcome of the election and sought to prevent it and later reverse it.\n\nIt's clear the same kind of retribution is going on in the Southern District of New York (SDNY) following Trump's firing of U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The recent indictment of a Russian lawyer, over statements in a civil case that she did not disclose her part in securing a document from a Russian prosecutor, shows the length that these prosecutors will go to using selective prosecution as a tool for making a case against Trump.\n\nLike the guilty pleas to non-existent campaign violations in the Michael Cohen case, this indictment seeks to stretch the law. Never mind that this same Russian lawyer had dossier-pushing Fusion GPS as her client and dined with dossier maestro Glen Simpson the day before and after the now-infamous Trump Tower meeting. Simpson says he didn't really talk to her, so ... well, never mind.\n\nYes, there absolutely were some Russians trying to create confusion with the American electorate. In 1996, the Chinese poured many millions of dollars into the Bill Clinton campaign to curry favor. These governments and their would-be hangers on do try to ingratiate themselves with campaigns and take disruptive actions, just as we do.\n\nBut this is entirely different from believing that the president of the United States has sold out his country and that the FBI should be investigating — to the extent of even possibly wearing a wire — a White House because their boss was fired. A boss that, by the way, was then replaced by a distinguished career official, meaning no actual investigations of any kind were ever in jeopardy in any way.\n\nSen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said it best in an interview: Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you. So, even for a practical, supposedly hard-nosed businessman, he's being really dumb to do this.\n\nThat's right. Dumb is apparently believing you can heap scorn on the intelligence community that brought you the Iraq war and backed the idea that ISIS was not an existential threat.\n\nDumb appears to be believing that as president, you can change foreign policy to try to reset Russian relations that had deteriorated under your predecessor, President Obama. Or that you can fire hostile, self-serving members in the Justice Department or FBI.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe response by the FBI and DOJ to Trump's election was unprecedented, and while almost all of those behind these various actions have been exposed, fired, quit or retired, the Mueller independent counsel and SDNY investigations remain as the insurance policies set up to keep up the effort to remove the president for … something.\n\nAt least we are learning how this all really started, even as the answers continue to grow ever more unsettling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARK PENN

The law is very clear. I mean, we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, Trump said. This is a national emergency, if you look what's happening.\n\nTrump did not lay out a specific timetable for when he might take such a step, saying: I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days.\n\nThe president spoke to FOX News in Texas, on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he visited the border region to argue that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States. Back in Washington, Democrats in the Senate on Thursday failed to proceed with House-passed spending bills that would fund the government and end the partial shutdown without new border-wall money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSHUTDOWN REALITY SETS IN: Approximately 8,000 federal workers on Friday will face their first payday without a paycheck due to the ongoing government shutdown ... Roughly 420,000 employees have been deemed essential and are working unpaid. An additional 380,000 are staying home without pay. Democratic senators and union leaders led federal workers in rallies at the White House and across the country on Thursday to end the shutdown.\n\nOn Thursday afternoon, the Senate passed legislation to provide back pay for federal workers furloughed during the shutdown. According to statistics provided by the Department of Labor, 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.\n\nThe shutdown, which enters its 21st day Friday, will be the longest in history by this weekend. Most of the government workers received their last paycheck two weeks ago.\n\nPatrick Walsh: The Democratic Party is running on fumes (and Trump knows it)\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta tries to show that walls don't work - and it backfires on him\n\nMISSING WISCONSIN TEEN FOUND ALIVE: Jayme Closs, a teenager who hadn't been seen since her parents were found dead last October, has been discovered alive and a suspect has been taken into custody, officials said ... Many questions surround Closs, 13, who was found about 70 miles north of where she was last seen. She was discovered Thursday in the town of Gordon in Douglas County, Wis., after she approached a woman who was out walking her dog.\n\nAuthorities are planning a news briefing for approximately 10 a.m. local time Friday.\n\nTRUMP'S EX-'FIXER' TO TESTIFY: Michael Cohen, President Trump's former personal attorney, has agreed to testify before the House Oversight and Reform Committee on Feb. 7, almost exactly one month before he starts serving prison time for campaign finance violations, tax evasion and lying to Congress about Trump's past business dealings in Russia ... In a statement, Cohen said he accepted the invitation to appear from Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., the committee's chairman, [i]n furtherance of my commitment to cooperate and provide the American people with answers. Cummings said the committee was in the process of consulting with Special Counsel [Robert] Mueller's office to ensure that Cohen's scheduled testimony would not interfere with the ongoing investigation into interactions between the Trump campaign and Russian officials.\n\nWILL BEZOS' DIVORCE AFFECT AMAZON? - The divorce of the world's richest man, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, and his wife of 25 years, MacKenzie Bezos, could leave the fate of the pair's massive fortune - and Amazon itself - potentially in the hands of Washington state courts ... TMZ reported Thursday that the couple did not have a prenuptial agreement detailing terms of a possible split. That does not preclude the possibility there was some type of post-nuptial agreement put in place.\n\nWashington state – where the pair live and where Amazon is based – is a community property state, as opposed to an equitable distribution state, like New York. In a community property state, all assets acquired during the marriage are considered marital property and subject to a 50-50 split. That means MacKenzie Bezos could be entitled to half of the entrepreneur's $137 billion fortune.\n\nBezos' most prized asset is Amazon. He is Amazon's largest shareholder with a 16.3 percent stake. If his wife gets half of that ownership, it could change the company's dynamics.\n\n\n\nTHE SOUNDBITE\n\nBORDER SWING - The number one reason they will vote 'for' him is because of his stance on border security – Brad Parscale, President Trump's 2020 campaign manager, on The Story with Martha MacCallum, arguing that swing voters are inclined to vote for Trump in the next presidential election because of his crusade for strengthened border security and construction of a wall.

It was still dark outside when LaPorsha Washington drove her four daughters, including 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes, in the family's silver car at 6:30 a.m. Sunday to a grocery store on the eastern outskirts of Houston.\n\nEach daughter was in her assigned seat in the family car, with Jazmine sitting behind her mother in the back seat.\n\nFifteen-year-old Alxis Dilbert, Washington's oldest daughter, was sitting in the front passenger seat when she noticed a red truck pull up beside their vehicle. She described the driver as a blue-eyed white man wearing a black hoodie and looking sickly.\n\nThe family, who is black, didn't give the truck a second thought until it changed lanes, moving around from behind to the driver's side of Washington's vehicle and the driver opened fired. Washington was hit by gunfire in her arm. Jazmine was shot in the head and died at the scene.\n\nI didn't see anything but shattered glass and bullets coming toward my car, Washington said.\n\nAuthorities have yet to identify or find the man suspected of killing Jazmine, whose death her family and community activists believe was racially motivated. They say the attack is similar to an incident in the area in 2017 in which a suspect described as white shot into a vehicle carrying at least two black people. That shooting remains unsolved.\n\nHarris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, whose agency is leading the investigation into Jazmine's death, said he is not tone deaf to concerns Washington and her children were shot at because of their race. But investigators have not determined a motive and their focus remains on catching the killer, he said.\n\nA composite sketch of the driver and surveillance video of his truck was released on Thursday and a reward for information leading to his arrest has climbed to $100,000. Jazmine's death has prompted an outpouring of support for her family from across the country, including celebrities and sports stars. A community rally to show support for Jazmine's family was planned for Saturday. Her funeral is set for Tuesday.\n\nIt's just amazing how ... this beautiful angel, 7 years old, just touched so many lives and her light shined very, very bright, Gonzalez said. It's upon us as a community, as leaders, as just our humanity to find justice for Jazmine.\n\nThe sheriff's office tweeted on Friday that investigators have received many potential leads since releasing the sketch but declined to comment on any specific tips.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday with Alxis, a tearful and emotional Washington recalled how she and her family were going to Joe V's Smart Shop near their home when their car came to rest at a stoplight on a feeder road next to a tollway. Nearby was a Walmart and strip malls with restaurants, banks, a Starbucks and other businesses.\n\nWashington said her 13-year-old daughter, Ebonee Dilbert, who sat behind Alxis in the back seat, then noticed the truck go behind their car, change lanes and pull next to them on the driver's side.\n\nAuthorities have declined to say what type of weapon was used when the driver opened fire.\n\nWashington said she can't remember how many shots were fired but he emptied out his gun. I know that for a fact.\n\nWashington said no words were ever exchanged between her and the driver and she doesn't believe this was a case of mistaken identity.\n\nWe didn't do anything wrong to this man, Washington said. This is something that I believe was a hate crime.\n\nWashington described Jazmine, whose nickname was Jaz, as a lovable person who enjoyed music, dressing up and trying to sit on her mother's lap while driving.\n\nJazmine, who was in second grade, had said she wanted to be a teacher when she grew up and was already practicing as she kept her 6-year-old sister in line.\n\nShe was always bossing people around ... She liked to eat a lot, Alxis said of Jazmine.\n\nWashington and Jazmine's father, Chris Cevilla, said they remain hopeful that their daughter's killer will be found.\n\nI won't stop. I won't quit. I don't care how long it takes, Cevilla said.\n\n___\n\nThis version of the story corrects the spelling of Jazmine in the headline.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.

This is a rush transcript from Hannity, January 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nSEAN HANNITY, HOST: Welcome to Hannity.\n\nWe begin tonight, a FOX News alert -- get this -- James Comey, I hope you're sitting down for this big breaking news only moments ago. Federal prosecutors are now reportedly investigating high-level leaks, classified material from the FBI. And the super patriot himself, according to reports, is likely the target of a criminal probe.\n\nNow, remember, only a few months ago in an unrelated case, the DOJ inspector general referred Comey for a prosecution over leaks and lack of candor surrounding his communications with President Trump. Now, more trouble for Jim Comey. We'll have details analysis and more on this major story coming up.\n\nFirst, tonight, more manufactured hysteria from the D.C. swamp. Let me be clear there is absolutely nothing significant nothing meaningful about this charade, this miscarriage of justice on Capitol Hill. You have conspiracy theorists, con artists and liars, same people that have been doing it for the last three years, they are now dragging this country through the mud and it's all out of pure rage, denial, hatred psychosis and insanity.\n\nI want to begin with this monologue on this point, I want to ask everyone a simple question, you playing at home, answer in your mind's eye the question and I really want you to think about it. Since Donald Trump was elected in 2016, think, what have Democrats -- what are the media -- what are they ever done to improve the lives of Americans? Now, have they done anything to create jobs, prosperity, safety, security, peace?\n\nWell, today's cover of The New York Post, a perfect representation of what I am talking about. On the one side, there you have President Trump signing what many thought could never be done -- a really great, historic trade deal with China, $220 billion in the next two years alone -- this year and next year -- and that will impact the energy sector, the service sector, manufacturing sector, our farmers benefit greatly, $220 billion. That helps the American economy and helps American workers.\n\nOn the other side of the picture, there's Nancy Pelosi smiling, a dozen commemorative pens to sign off on two bogus articles of impeachment, and then taking pictures with, yes, smiles. And Nancy's blatant political stunts will improve the lives of zero Americans. It will add zero jobs to the economy. It does nothing to make us more safe or secure, and we all know the outcome. It's going to die in the Senate.\n\nIt was just a few months ago that Nancy Pelosi said impeachment must be bipartisan. No Republicans supported it. And then she rammed through articles of impeachment in the House with the support of only Democrats.\n\nPelosi also said impeachment was so dire and so urgent, we got to pass it in record time. She then refused to send the articles to the Senate for over a month, a weeks-long stall that almost no one can explain. And Democrats -- that was after they passed it so quickly before Christmas so they can go on vacation for three weeks.\n\nAnd don't forget, by the way, Nancy Pelosi, speaker in name only, constantly reminding we, the people, impeachment was her solemn duty. She didn't want to do it. She was so prayerful and somber. Of course, that also a lie.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: So this is a very serious matter and we take it to heart in a really solemn way.\n\nSo sad, so tragic for a country.\n\nDecember 18th, a great day for the Constitution of the United States, a sad one for America, that the president's reckless activities necessitated us -\n\n- our having to introduce articles of impeachment.\n\nThis is nothing that anybody takes any satisfaction in. It's sad for our country.\n\nThere's just no joy in this. It's sad. We must be somber. We must be prayerful.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Sad, somber, prayerful.\n\nYou want a pen? You'd like a pen? Got dozens of them. Smile for the camera, we did it!\n\nSo Pelosi who was so somber and prayerful, she gleefully handed the special commemorative pens to her smiling colleagues so they could all take pictures together after signing the articles, all smiles -- a political stunt borne out of rage from beginning to end.\n\nNow, the Democrats' charade continues in the U.S. Senate. Tonight, they want to introduce new B.S. evidence and charges and material and witnesses that were not part of the case. Remember, the sole power of the Constitution to impeach is in the House. They passed it already.\n\nNow, if a few weak Republican senators try and help their radical Democratic colleagues and allow them to call new witnesses to do the job, the constitutional duty of the House, and enter all these new evidence, guess what's going to happen? This actually is a great thing -- I want to hear from zero experience Hunter Biden who's paid millions of dollars, no experience. Wow, what a deal? What company would ever give you millions then you know nothing about the business?\n\nAnd then, of course, we've got quid pro quo Joe. Let's bring him in to testify. You're not getting the billion at least you fire the prosecutor that I know is investigating my zero experience son.\n\nAnd the fake hearsay whistleblowers should be called to testify.\n\nBut perhaps my favorite, will be calling the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar Adam Schiff, let's put him under oath. Senator Ted Cruz and now, Senator Rand Paul, vowing to trigger a reciprocal witness list if any Republican caves to the Democrats' demands.\n\nSenator Paul's predicting no Republican will vote to convict the president.\n\nI tend to agree with them, except Mitt Romney.\n\nI don't know why Mitt Romney's angry. Mitt Romney hates Donald Trump, every second of every day. Meanwhile, Donald Trump is doing everything Mitt Romney said he would do if he had got elected president. It makes no sense to me.\n\nHere with more, Kentucky Senator Rand Paul.\n\nSenator, good for you. You were wrong on the War Powers Act, but that's a longstanding debate we have.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut I think --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nSEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: I don't have time to straighten (ph) you out on that tonight.\n\nHANNITY: No, but this is important, because we really do have --\n\nPAUL: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: Can you think of any company anywhere in the world that whatever paid millions and millions of dollars to somebody that has zero experience?\n\nCan you -- would any business ever do that?\n\nPAUL: Well, it goes to the heart of the matter of the president's being accused of withholding foreign aid and his argument is, well, we were studying corruption and we wanted to know about corruption in Ukraine, and I think the Bidens are as corrupt as the day is long.\n\nNo young man who's the son of a politician gets 50 grand a month who has no experience --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Eighty-three. I think it was 83.\n\nPAUL: -- working for a Ukrainian oligarch, you know? I mean, for goodness sakes, it smells to high heaven. It smells like corruption.\n\nAnd every day on the mainstream media, they say, oh, there's no there there. This has been investigated. There's no corruption.\n\nI think the American people don't buy it.\n\nBut here's the thing, is fair is fair, and if they're going to put the president through this, they're going to have to have witnesses on both sides.\n\nBut I'll tell you what my fear is, is that some Republicans are going to vote for witnesses, we'll get those, the ones the Democrats want and then when we have the votes on bringing witnesses or letting the president choose his witnesses, I think those will fail, not only because of those Republicans but because a whole variety of Republicans may not allow the whistleblower, may not allow Biden for one reason or another because they served with them.\n\nBut if it turns out and the Republican base sees that this looks like only Democrat witnesses and no presidential witnesses, I guarantee that the Republican base will punish those people who set off that kind of scenario.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: A hundred -- that is --I can't support any Republican that does that. I can tell you right now. I can't, because --\n\nPAUL: If it looks like a kangaroo court, they're not -- the Republican base is going to be very, very unhappy.\n\nThis is not an ordinary vote. Everybody in the country is watching. There was not one Republican that supported impeachment in the House. I don't think there will be in the Senate.\n\nBut if people play games with the witnesses and, all of a sudden, we have one side and we have John Bolton who has an ax to grind about being fired coming in, but we don't let the president call witnesses he wishes to call, I think all hell's going to break loose, and I think the Republican electorate will boot out any of these people who allow this to be a one- sided episode.\n\nHANNITY: I got to applaud you. Good for you. Good for you. Good for Ted Cruz. This is important, because you have Joe Biden -- you are not getting the billion taxpayer dollars.\n\nIt is breathtaking hypocrisy where we are here. And you're calling it out and we'll watch very closely. And I hope your prediction is right in the end.\n\nSenator, thank you for being with us.\n\nNow, the left's latest desperate attempt to smear President Trump, keep his impeachment charade alive, forever -- it's insane. Earlier in the week, there you go, we got the compromised, corrupt, congenital liar himself, Adam Schiff, he attached an addendum to the articles of impeachment. He's got new evidence, filled with random documents from a Ukrainian-American named Lev Parnas.\n\nParnas is currently out on bail from a federal prison. What is he accused of? Orchestrating a massive campaign finance fraud scheme, oh, and hiding -\n\n- you can't make this up -- a million-dollar payment from where? Russia. Wow. Wouldn't even believe it in a spy novel.\n\nThis guy is apparently the media mob's, the Democrats' new Michael Avenatti. And naturally, they are making him their hero, a guy that's been accused of taking a million dollars and hiding it from Russia. These are the same people, especially on fake news CNN and over there at conspiracy TV, Area 51, Roswell Rachel Maddow's conspiracy channel, both are state-run TV.\n\nThey put Avenatti on the air 254 times in one year. He was begging to be on this show, the number one show in the country, but we didn't put him. And they now love Lev Parnas. Where is Avenatti?\n\nAnd last I heard, he is in jail facing a ton of charges. Good luck to him.\n\nNaturally, now, he is making the rounds in the media mob, including an appearance last night, of course, on conspiracy TV, state-run MSDNC. Now, Roswell Rachel Maddow's program, this is basically a hoax-filled dumpster fire of never ending fake news, never ending conspiracy theories directed by the Democratic Party, dressed up as an intellectual new show.\n\nWell, it's pathetic how wrong they have been over there the last three years. Ever get an apology for them being so wrong, Trump-Russia collusion?\n\nNo apologies. No accountability. Nothing.\n\nWhoops. Wrong again. Now, let's move onto the next lying anti-Trump a narrative and new shady guest like Avenatti and new conspiracy theories.\n\nDon't be fooled. It's garbage. They hype up the anti-Trump basis of the left-wing. But, we got him this time. Last night's interview with Parnas, no exception.\n\nNow, we are talking about a guy that got paid, apparently, according to prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, these are serious people there, millions of dollars from Russia, or a million dollars, and now, accusing President Trump and pretty much everyone in his administration of pretty much everything he can think of.\n\nNow, when you face a possible jail term and you think you say something that might either eliminate the jail term or might lower the jail term, most people would pretty much say anything. That's how much credibility I put in this guy.\n\nThe president was clear today that he doesn't know the guy. But there are pictures of him and the president. You know, how many photo lines I've done in the course of my 24 years here, 21 years in TV. I've done a lot. I've actually seen pictures online. I have no idea who these people are.\n\nThe president doesn't remember this guy. He said so repeatedly today. DOJ says his claims are 100 percent false. His claims are full of glaring holes and contradictions. Whoopsy-daisy.\n\nThe foreign minister of Ukraine felt compelled to speak out and say, don't trust this guy. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's now said that he's spoken to key officials within President Zelensky's circle. Since you were one of those and you were when this happened, did you get that message from Lev Parnas?\n\nUKRAINIAN FOREIGN MINISTER: It's all over Ukrainian media as well today and yesterday, and strangely enough, my name was not mentioned although I'm minister of foreign affairs. And, frankly, I never spoke with this individual. Again, I don't -- I don't trust any word he is now saying.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Oh, same with what Zelensky. No quid or pro or quo.\n\nRemember, there were five separate high-level meetings after the phone call that never mentioned aid. At all those five meetings, they never mentioned aid. That's going to be a big point that the defense of the president is going to make.\n\nSo, let's get this straight. The Ukrainian government is warning all of us about Lev Parnas, the new Michael Avenatti, facing serious felony charges, campaign finance and a charge of trying to hide a million dollars from Russia. Meaning, he is charged with getting paid by the country of Russia.\n\nBut according to the mob, we must all believe all of his breathtaking allegations. Wow. I thought they didn't like people that colluded with Russia. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE SCARBOROUGH, MSNBC HOST: I'm trying to remember the last time that an interview revealed as much as Rachel Maddow's interview last night revealed and actually moved a story of national and international significance, as much as that interview did. I -- it was breathtaking.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Joe, your change of heart to be on TV is also breathtaking, liberal Joe.\n\nNow, maybe you're just dumb, or maybe you're just lying to trying to be Fox & Friends, which is never going to happen. After all, the con artists and the media mob, they've been lying for years. They spread one hoax, one tin foil hoax, one conspiracy theory after another, after another, after another.\n\nLast night, they told us over at MSDNC, state-run TV, that the president was a Russian op. Fake news CNN claiming the phony Russian dossier was totally legit. Nearly, everyone in the mob and the media claiming the president colluded with Russian.\n\nAll that we're about to show you, it's false. They've never been held accountable. They've never apologized.\n\nWe were right on this program. Well, simultaneously, they missed the abuse of power, corruption scandal, premeditated fraud on a FISA court -- no, we did all that. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Multiple U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the briefing tells CNN that classified documents on Russian interference in the\n\n2016 election presented last week to President Obama and President-elect Trump included allegations that Russian operatives claim to have compromising personal and financial information about Mr. Trump.\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, MSNBC HOST: A sort of dossier of alleged dirt that the Russians allegedly say they allegedly have on Donald Trump, alleged dirt that they allegedly used to allegedly cultivate him as basically a Russian asset.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The guilty that Robert Mueller got on October 5 and was revealed today was a guilty about collusion.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then candidate, Donald Trump, knew in advance about the June 2016 meeting in Trump Tower.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Paul Manafort, the president's former campaign chairman, paid secret visits, multiple ones to Julian Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: President Trump directed his attorney to lie to Congress.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Bo-bop-bop-bop.\n\nAlmost everything you heard there is a total lie. Wrong. Dead wrong.\n\nWell, the mob busy pushing the psychotic anti-Trump conspiracy theories, they did miss the biggest abuse of power scandal in American history, and it was happening right before their eyes.\n\nWe are proud of our investigating team and our reporting here on Hannity, because we got it right. We've been vindicated by the inspector general and we expect further vindication. FISA abuse, premeditated fraud on a FISA court, we're right about that. We were right about the unlawful surveillance of the president. Yes, he was spied upon by our own government at the height of an election, and after.\n\nWe were right about Mueller's partisan witch hunt. We were right about Comey's abuse of power. Right about the bias, right about leaking in misconduct at the highest levels of the FBI, oh, being -- showing less than candor, lack of candor, lying McCabe, lying.\n\nMeanwhile, the mob too busy obsessing about a hoax. They got nothing right and everything wrong. They pushed the dirty Clinton bought and paid for Russian dossier -- we now know unverifiable.\n\nEven The New York Times finally came around and said, yes, that dirty dossier the Hillary paid for was likely Russian disinformation from the beginning. That would tell -- mean, oh, it sounds like Russia wanted dirt out there on Donald Trump to help Hillary. They did this whole thing while pretending to be so upset about Trump-Russia collusion that never occurred.\n\nWell, Lev Parnas, he takes a million dollars according to prosecutors in New York from Russians. They don't care. They've learned nothing.\n\nAll they know is hatred, rage, all things anti-Trump. It is so intense that they've lost all touch with basic reason, common sense, intellectual honesty, equal justice and application of our laws.\n\nThe media is a mob. Their fellow Democrats, they're also part of a mob and they're all suffering from a full-blown psychosis.\n\nAnd today, one fake news reporter at fake news CNN who clearly is promoting Schiff's new Parnas evidence was confronted, by who, Arizona Senator Martha McSally -- good for her. Watch this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMANU RAJU, CNN REPORTER: She made it very clear that she wasn't going to answer that question. The question again was, whether or not the president, whether or not the Senate should considered any new to have evidence that all this come out as part of the deliberations the Senate considers whether to remove the president from office and this is what she said.\n\nSenator McSally, should the Senate consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial?\n\nSEN. MARTHA MCSALLY, R-ARIZ.: Man, you're a liberal hack. I'm not talking to you.\n\nREPORTER: You're not going to comment?\n\nMCSALLY: You're a liberal hack.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: You are a liberal hack. They're all liberal hacks. What a great battle for our Republican senators to deal with fake news industry.\n\nLev Parnas, or Avenatti, let's call him, 2.0, he shouldn't be trusted.\n\nUkraine is telling us not to trust him. Anyone with any small grasp on reality can see this.\n\nDemocrats, they don't care. Radio legend, Rush Limbaugh predicted months ago, in November, got to give him credit here, this may have been in the works for months. Nothing they do surprises me.\n\nRemember Julie Swetnick? Remember Kavanaugh? Seemed like, one after another.\n\nAvenatti brought in Swetnick, they wanted to believe here. In every -- every almost every other weekend, they had to line up and they spiked the punch balls and the boys would line in the halls and they would rape these young women almost every other weekend.\n\nWell, I never saw Justice Kavanaugh, oh, yes, he had a red solo cap, and he was in a hall, but he wasn't lined up in a hall, and that did flame out, too.\n\nBut it takes a long time to get to the truth. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, RADIO TALK SHOW HOST: Who's next?\n\nWell, I want to throw out a name. And let's see if I'm right. Let's just see.\n\nThe name is Lev Parnas. Lev Parnas could well be the next surprise twist, the surprise witness for the Democrats. I think this is going to be Schiff's next guy. This is the next bombshell, meaning the whistle-blower is no longer necessary. His information has been trumped, so to speak by Lev Parnas.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: November 11th, good call, Rush.\n\nHere with reaction, White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, Florida Congressman, Matt Gaetz.\n\nYou know, you think about this, doesn't it fit a pattern?\n\nReince, you lived through it at the beginning. Doesn't fit the same pattern of what they do, how the act, how wrong they always are?\n\nREINCE PRIEBUS, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF OF STAFF: Yes, I remember the night of the fake dossier, and trying to put that to bed.\n\nBut, look, you hit on something. If you watch the Rachel Maddow interview last night, when she finished her show and then Lawrence O'Donnell took over, he was congratulating her about the interview and he said, you must have been working on this for a long time. And she said, I've been working on this interview for months.\n\nIf you go back, that's what she said. So, in other words, Schiff knew, Pelosi knew, slow walking the articles of impeachment. They all knew. They were all in on it.\n\nSo, my point has been, as you and I have been talking about a lot lately, is to stop treating this as if it's a real trial and not a political operation. This is a new political weapon in modern political -- in our modern political world, and Donald Trump is the first victim.\n\nA hundred years from now, if a president doesn't have the House in the same party, that president is going to be impeached. So, it's time to play hardball.\n\nI love the phrase reciprocal witness list. It's exactly right, and Biden is needed in order for us to test the reasonableness of the president bringing up corruption and Biden on the call. But Hunter Biden is needed to test what this case is all about.\n\nHANNITY: Well said, Reince Priebus.\n\nMatt Gaetz, I think this is important. The president said something. They never talked about aid in the call.\n\nYou are surrounding yourself with some of the same people as your predecessors. I don't think that's a good idea. That was revealing, because it showed the president thinking, wait a minute, I don't know if I can trust you.\n\nThen, we have the whole issue of, you know, all of the corruption. You know, the president does have a sworn duty to faithfully execute the laws of our land, and then the five meetings after. They never once talked about aid, Matt.\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: If anything, the Lev Parnas interview proves that the president was entirely correct to be skeptical about Ukraine and whether or not corruption would impact U.S. investment in that country.\n\nDemocrats are really scraping the bottom of the barrel if they think that Lev Parnas is their star witness. We've all successfully smoked out that the Steele dossier was a part of a foreign interference campaign against our democracy. It may very well be with these Russian payments to Lev Parnas that Lev himself is part of a disinformation campaign.\n\nAs this moves to the Senate and we look at witnesses, Sean, one witness I want to see is Adam Schiff. Even before the motion to dismiss, there should be a motion to disqualify Schiff as an impeachment manager, because he is a fact witness to the setup.\n\nHANNITY: I don't think the senators -- Republicans have the stomach for it.\n\nReince, that's sad. That bothers me.\n\nPRIEBUS: Yes, no doubt about it. And guess what, sometimes the best defense is the so what defense, which is if everything the Democrats said is true, it's still not impeachable, if everything Lev Parnas has said is true, it's still not impeachable. I mean, that's what this is about.\n\nHANNITY: Great point. It's great point.\n\nAll right. The only quid and pro and quo is Joe and zero experience Hunter.\n\nWhen we come back -- thank you both -- Senator Marsha Blackburn calling on key senators to recuse themselves from this Schiff sham show. She will be here to tell you and the great one, Mark Levin, coming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: All right. The Democrats' Schiff sham impeachment show is officially headed to the Senate and will take 2020 candidates, Senator Warren, Sanders, Klobuchar off the campaign trail.\n\nAlthough Republican Senator Marsha Blackburn has a good idea: just recuse yourselves. Tweeting that the senators are, quote, spending millions of dollars to defeat Donald Trump and we are supposed to believe they will be impartial during this trial? They should recuse themselves.\n\n\n\nHere with reaction, Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee.\n\nSenator, it makes total sense to me.\n\nSEN. MARSHA BLACKBURN, R-TENN.: Absolutely. I think that they should take themselves out of this trial and they took an oath that they're going to give impartial justice. And if you're spending those millions of dollars and hundreds of hours, Sean, how in the world can you do that?\n\nAnd if these guys are out there in Iowa campaign this weekend, they need to think long and hard about coming back and sitting and saying they are going to be an impartial juror in this trial.\n\nHANNITY: Well, did (ph) it take a sworn oath to be fair?\n\nBLACKBURN: They took an oath today. And, you know, the thing is, there is precedent for asking for recusal. When you look at the 1868 trial of Andrew Johnson, who was a Tennessean, there was a request there for someone who would have succeeded President Johnson to recuse themselves from that trial.\n\nSo, I think that those who are sitting as a juror, they have been sworn in and they are running for president and would benefit by President Trump facing this impeachment, I think that they should recuse themselves from this discussion.\n\nHANNITY: Why are some of your Senate colleagues talking about bringing in new witnesses? Because it's the House's sole constitutional authority to impeach. They've impeached him.\n\nBLACKBURN: Right.\n\nHANNITY: They'll now make their case.\n\nWhy do some Senate Republicans want to bolster their case? Either they make it or they don't make it.\n\nBLACKBURN: Well, you're right about that.\n\nAnd you said something very important. It is the sole responsibility of the House to impeach, the action item. It is our responsibility to review the impeachment once it is delivered to us, those two articles. And to go outside of that is to go outside of our constitutional duty.\n\nSo, we should review the articles. We should hear what the managers have to say from the House and the president's team, their position, and then we should ask our questions. And we should make a decision if we're going to proceed --\n\nHANNITY: Amen.\n\nBLACKBURN: -- toward a vote of acquittal or guilt.\n\nAnd, of course, I feel that the president will be acquitted.\n\nWhen you look at the partial record and the sloppy work that has been done over in the House, and now, they're bringing into us and they're saying, well, you need to expand this -- that is not our job.\n\nIf Jerry Nadler wants to hear from more witnesses, he should be doing his work himself.\n\nHANNITY: They'll start all over again.\n\nBLACKBURN: Yes.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Senator, thank you. A lot of clarification.\n\nBLACKBURN: Good to be with you. Thank you.\n\nHANNITY: All right. Also, tonight, the left is ecstatic over the GOA, included the White House Budget Office technically violated the little known Impoundment Control Act by delaying aid to Ukraine.\n\nNow, the acting director of OMB, he's firing back. He wrote this: The GAO opinion comes from the same people who said we couldn't keep national parks open during the shutdown.\n\nRecently, GAO flipped its position twice in just the last few months. We wouldn't be surprised if they reverse again. Regardless, the administration complied with the law at every step.\n\nAnd breaking tonight, The New York Times is reporting that the DOJ probe into leaks of classified material appears focused on Mr. Super Patriot himself. That's right, Jimbo Comey.\n\nHere with reaction, author of Guilt by Association, Professor Alan Dershowitz, along with Fox News contributor, Jason Chaffetz.\n\nLet's start with the legal side -- Professor.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ, AUTHOR, GUILT BY ACCUSATION: Well, first of all, the name of my book is Guilt By Accusation.\n\nHANNITY: All right, sorry.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: And you can now get by $1.99 on Kindle, the cost of a candy bar.\n\nLook, GAO got it exactly backward. Here's what they said: The law does not permit the president to substitute his own policy priorities to those Congress has enacted into law.\n\nIt's exactly the opposite. The Constitution does not allow Congress to substitute its own priorities for the foreign policy of the president.\n\nConsider for example the Iran deal. Congress didn't support the Iran deal.\n\nThey didn't want the Iran deal. President Obama imposed the Iran deal because the president has exclusive power over foreign policy.\n\nOr imagine Congress in the future saying, we are going to give aid to Cuba and you have to send the money to Cuba. And the president says, no, no, no, that's not my foreign policy. My foreign policy is opposed to Cuba.\n\nIt is unconstitutional for a statute to take away the president's sole authority over foreign policy. The only limitation on the president's authority is he can't declare war. Other than that, he can decide the Jerusalem embassy for Israel without congressional authorization. He can decide who not to give money to.\n\nAnd what he did, he never stopped the money from going, but postponing it to make sure that there was no corruption. Completely within his constitutional power and Congress has no authority to compromise that. And the GAO is completely wrong.\n\nHANNITY: And, by the way, Jason Chaffetz, I found that the GAO thought that Obama broke the law many times and wasn't a big deal then, was it?\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, multiple times the GAO was found -- and, of course, the media never made any hay about it.\n\nBut, Sean, the thing is so frustrating is that the money flowed. It did so before the deadline. I mean, what's the problem here? The money actually went to Ukraine. It went before the deadline.\n\nAnd thank goodness, President Trump is doing what he promised to do. He is not just going to simply take hundreds of millions of dollars and throw it into the government without making sure that they are actually going to do things like clean up corruption. That's what the president said he was going to do. That's exactly what President Trump has tried to do.\n\nAnd the GAO, for them to come out with this result, is absolutely wrong. It is totally 100 percent wrong and I totally agree with Professor Dershowitz.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Remember, too, the GAO is a congressional organization. They always side with Congress over the president, because they work for Congress, even though they are nonpartisan.\n\nHANNITY: Ahh, well said.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: They work for Congress, not the executive branch.\n\nHANNITY: By the way, I paid for a hard copy of the book. If I would have known you could get it for 99 cents, I want a refund.\n\nCHAFFETZ: He can give free one. He can give you a free one, Sean.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: All right.\n\nCHAFFETZ: I read both of your books. Thank you both.\n\nAll right. Buckle up. I talked to him before the show. You don't want to miss this. The great one -- what's really motivating the Democrats during this impeachment hoax, charade.\n\nAnd later, the war inside the Democratic Party, reaching a breaking point.\n\nWe are going to tell you why with Dan Bongino and Geraldo. Let's see if they fight again tonight, straight ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: All right. So, last night, a Jeopardy contestants were stumped by a photo of a certain, well, compromised, corrupt, cowardly, congenital liar congressman. Pretty funny. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: U.S. representatives for 12.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: One fifty-third of California's House delegation is this Intelligence Committee chairman.\n\nHis name is Adam Schiff.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nHANNITY: Joining us now, the author of The New York Times bestseller, Unfreedom of the Press, we call him a great one. He hosted the number one show, 8:00 p.m., right here on the FOX News Channel, Life, Liberty, Levin, nationally syndicated radio host and friend of the program.\n\nGreat one, I know you've got a lot to say tonight. I won't even throw a question at you.\n\nMARK LEVIN, FOX NEWS HOST: I won't even have enough time but let's start.\n\nRemember this? Anybody remember this? This was the Mueller report. Remember all this? Hundreds of subpoenas, hundreds of witnesses, millions of pages of documents. Nothing. They still have nothing.\n\nI want to tell you how concerned the Democrats are about foreign interference in our elections. First of all, Obama did nothing to stop the Russians from interfering in the 2016 election. In fact, his administration spied on this president of the United States when he was a candidate.\n\nIt was Hillary Clinton who colluded with the Russians and the DNC. They paid for that dossier. You know all this.\n\nBut let's talk about the Democrats and how serious they are about foreign interference in our elections. I'll go to my book, briefly, if I may. Back in the 1990s, we had a president by the name of Bill Clinton. He was impeached, but he wasn't impeached for what I'm about to talk about. He was running for reelection.\n\nThe media really didn't care about the scandal that broke. The L.A. Times and a few others did. And here's what they wrote: The chief of China's military intelligence secretly directed funds from Beijing to help reelect President Clinton in 1996. Former Democratic fundraiser Johnny Chung told federal investigators. Chung said he met three times with intelligence officials who ordered $300,000 deposited into the Torrance businessman's bank account to subsidize campaign donations intended for Clinton, according to sources.\n\nChung spent around a great deal of foreign money on Democratic candidates and organizations, and bought himself repeated access to the White House.\n\nHe contributed more than $400,000 to various Democratic campaigns. This is Chinese military money.\n\nVisited the White House no fewer than 50 times and brought numerous Chinese associates to events with the president and first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton. That would have been Trump's opponent, you might have remembered in 2016.\n\nCharlie Trie, a longtime friend of President Clinton, raised $1.2 million in foreign dollars for the Clinton legal defense fund and the DNC. In March 1996, Trie dropped off a donation of $460,000 at the Washington office of the Clinton defense fund with some of the money and sequentially numbered money orders made out in the same handwriting. He visited the White House\n\n22 times.\n\nLos Angeles Times, James Riady, another longtime friend of President Clinton, who heads the worldwide Lippo Banking Group, pleaded guilty. He was involved.\n\nThe Times also noted that former Democratic fund-raiser, John Huang, a onetime official at Lippo, pleaded guilty in the scandal a few years ago. What did he do? Huang raised more than $1.5 million from illegal foreign source, visited the White House 78 damn times.\n\nThere is your Democrat Party.\n\nNow, what did Nancy Pelosi say when the Red Chinese military was spreading millions of dollars around to the Clinton campaign, to the DNC, and all the rest? She didn't say a thing.\n\nWhere was the independent counsel investigation? There was no independent counsel investigation.\n\nWhere was most of the media? They were nowhere.\n\nHere's another one for you, Democrats, out there. In the 1980s, we had a president called Ronald Reagan. He was phenomenally popular. But Ted Kennedy wanted to stop his reelection.\n\nWhat did he do? Information in the files. It's been reported by The London Times. Been reported by Professor Kengur (ph), in the files of the KGB, through back channels.\n\nThe Lion of the Senate, who many on the left wanted to be president of the United States, tried to collaborate with the KGB to defeat Ronald Reagan. Ronald Reagan, in his second term. There's your damn Democratic Party.\n\nWhat else? Oh, the GAO comes out. Perfectly timed. Gives a damn, another bureaucracy. Donald Trump broke the law.\n\nIt's not what it says. Donald Trump broke the law, they say. Well, if Donald Trump broke the law, as they point out in PJ Media today, well, then so did Joe Biden.\n\nRemember that billion dollars that Joe Biden said, hey, look, Ukraine, you're not getting that billion dollars unless you fire that prosecutor? Well, that billion dollars was appropriated by Congress in March, 2014 by a vote of 399-19 in the House, 98-2 in the Senate. And he tried to blackmail the Ukrainians and he tried to threaten withholding of funds. But where is the line that Joe Biden broke the law?\n\nNow, we have this guy, Lev Parnas. I told you, don't have a lot of time, but I'm moving. Who is Lev Parnas? Well, he is the latest guy that the Democrats are going to grab. He has been indicted on multiple felony counts. H is a foreigner who used foreign money and try to put foreign money into our campaign.\n\nNow, the Democrats want to hear from him and the media call it evidence. Evidence? Now, the media took here before with Michael Avenatti? Where is he today? His ass is in jail.\n\nRemember the porno star, Stormy Daniels? Where is she? No idea.\n\nMichal Cohen, remember him? He was going to bring down Trump on campaign charges. Where is he? He is in federal prison.\n\nNow, something funny about these two articles of impeachment. There is no constitutional violation. There is no statutory violation. There is no violation of a federal court order.\n\nThis is why they keep throwing up smoke. And I want to tell these five Republicans of the Senate, the weak links in the chain -- Romney, Collins, Murkowski, Gardner, and the other one skips my mind, luckily, Alexander.\n\nLet me tell you something. You have a duty to uphold the Constitution. What the House of representatives has done here is destroy the Constitution. It's your job to fix it. It's your job to stop them. Not aid and abet by calling witnesses that the Democrats want.\n\nNo. No witnesses. No witnesses. This should be dismissed. This is a disgrace. That's it.\n\nHANNITY: The one great one, Mark Levin. Sunday night, 8:00 p.m., right here, Fox News. Number one show Sunday night at 8:00 p.m.\n\nAnd up next, new reports, dark money group linked to AOC, spending money in the hopes of hurting Biden's campaign. Dan Bongino, Geraldo, straight ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nHANNITY: All right. Here to react to all the left's hypocrisy, Fox News correspondent-at-large, Geraldo Rivera, FOX News contributor, Dan Bongino.\n\nYou know, Geraldo, you've got to help me out here.\n\nGERALDO RIVERA, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT-AT-LARGE: OK.\n\nHANNITY: How do you get to the spot, and just totally ignore quid pro quo Joe and zero experience Hunter. How does the left do that?\n\nRIVERA: Well, I don't think that they will be able to, Sean. If indeed they insist on calling witnesses, I think that Bidens are fair game. And once that starts unraveling -- you know, let me just say in a broader sense that the fact that Joe Biden is still the front runner is an indication of how weak the Democratic field is.\n\nI mean, with all due respect to the former vice president and the gaffes and all the rest of it, when you look at that field, that field -- there's no way on earth that they can stand toe-to-toe with the president. I think that's fueling the impeachment. But when I'm disappointed with, Sean, is that you failed to mention when you introduced me the fact that, you know, I have a robust life in terms of liking a drink now and then. I've been sober for a week, because I promised not to have a glass of alcohol until the president is acquitted, because I'm confident he will be. And the sooner, the better, so he can get the party back on.\n\nBut I think that Democrats --\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHANNITY: I've been out here, Geraldo.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Selfie one night, Geraldo, out of those drinks, maybe it's a good thing.\n\nDan?\n\nDAN BONGINO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, listen, Sean, if this was any other prominent politician on tape like Joe Biden is on tape threatening to have a prosecutor fired who was in fact fired, was investigating his son, who had come as you adequately say, no experience to get this, what,\n\n$50,000 to $80,000 a job month, whatever it was, it's bad either way, in a country where his father is the point man connected to the Obama administration as his vice president, I mean, it would be an international scandal.\n\nThe fact that the media has downplayed this now, now that Joe Biden is running for president.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nHANNITY: Downplayed? They act as though nothing wrong happened.\n\nBONGINO: Yes, what's interesting about this is that they did cover it before Joe Biden started to run. Now that Joe Biden could potentially hurt Trump, now, all of a sudden, they want to bury it, which is even worse than never covering it at all.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nRIVERA: Sean, one thing, one point if I can -- you know, now that they've tried to implicate the Lev Parnes interview to implicate the vice president, so, they're going after the president, they're going after the vice president, guess who is president of the United States if they successfully remove the president and the vice president? Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHANNITY: I'm getting the vapors.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHANNITY: Dan, that's frightening, right?\n\nBONGINO: It is frightening.

Catriona Gray's life forever changed in December 2018 when she was crowned Miss Universe in Bangkok, beating contestants from 93 other countries.\n\nThe 24-year-old singer and model, who was representing the Philippines, wore a sparkling red dress that she said was inspired by the Mayon Volcano, as she was handed the crown in front of a roaring crowd.\n\nBut instead of celebrating her new reign, Gray went into hiding.\n\nFox News spoke with the beauty queen about becoming Miss Universe, why she temporarily disappeared and how she managed to feel confident while rocking a swimsuit.\n\nFox News: What was going through your mind when it was announced you had won Miss Universe?\n\nCatriona Gray: I don't think anything was going through my mind. Like you could just see from the expression on my face, I was just ... I don't know. I guess the word would be incredulous. I feel like I entered into a dream state when I look back on the memory. It feels like such a blur.\n\nAll the excitement, all the work from the past couple of months, all the effort just pinnacled to this one point. But I just remember walking out there and hearing the cheers and seeing the Filipino flags, and I just knew that I felt so fulfilled that I was able to bring that kind of joy to my country. Because I knew, I just knew that so many Filipinos all over the world were watching on their screens, just not at the arena themselves, and they were just so, so happy and that I was able to create that kind of happiness. I felt over the moon.\n\nFox News: It's been reported you went into hiding after you won. What happened?\n\nGray: Well, I did go into hiding, mostly because I was in the Philippines for a charity event, but it wasn't actually my homecoming event. So I didn't really do a lot of interviews or talk to the media. And another thing is that Christmas and New Year for me is a time for family. I'm an only child, and I'm very, very close with my parents, who actually live in Australia.\n\nSo before the coronation in Thailand, the only time that I was with them previously, was in March of 2018. So that Christmas and New Year break was only one of the two times in the whole year that I was able to be with them and spend time with them.\n\nSo that is why. And I always take a hiatus, and take quiet time during moments like those, like Christmas and New Year. Because as I said, it's really a time for family for me. But my family is so proud of me. Especially my mom and dad, being so close to me. And they're incredibly, incredibly thrilled. I am so blessed to say that they supported me since day one. And for them to be there on the coronation night was very, very special.\n\nFox News: You became a viral sensation for your walk during the swimsuit portion. Where did your confidence come from?\n\nGray: As confident as I look onstage, backstage, I was really, really nervous. I am quite a conservative person, just as an individual. Even when I'm on the beach wearing a two-piece, I feel quite ... I want to be conservative. So, of course, being on a stage and in front of so many people, I was really nervous.\n\nI'm proud of my body. I feel strong in my body. My body has carried me through the whole journey, has given me energy, has given me the strength to do my job. And I feel healthy and that's why I really just wanted to have fun out on stage, you know? I just wanted to really feel beautiful. So I walked with confidence. And it was fun.\n\nFox News: You originally didn't want to pursue pageants because you were worried about being scrutinized and judged. What changed your mind?\n\nGray: I initially didn't have an interest in pageants just because I saw it as a show. I didn't see past that final coronation night. But of course, being from the Philippines, pageantry is a world in its own. We don't have Superbowl, we have pageants. And seeing the kind of platform that it had the potential to be, that's what really drew me to pageantry. Because I was already working as a volunteer in some of my charities, and I realized what a bigger reach I could have if I went into pageantry with it. So actually, that was the main reason I pursued pageantry.\n\nSo after my first international pageant, I didn't really want to join again. I felt like once was enough for my life. And the thing is, there is such high expectations on you, placed, being a Philippine representative. Because our girls do so well, and year after year, we do send such amazing women to represent the country. So I was afraid to put myself out there again. Because it is such a public arena. We are exposed to so many different people, negative and positive, through social media. It really did take overcoming some of my fears. But looking back now, I'm so glad that I decided to do it again, to pursue it again. Because if not, I wouldn't be Miss Universe today.\n\nFox News: How do you deal with the pressures of looking a certain way, especially in the era of social media?\n\nGray: It is definitely a journey. A very personal journey. And as much as I want to say I do have thick skin, there are days or there are certain comments that really do hurt. And I think that's completely natural.\n\nI just constantly tell myself that I should be the only one to define my worth and what I'm capable of, and how I perceive myself. And that I should never source that worth from other people, especially strangers on social media. They don't know who I am, the length of my journey, who I am as a person. So why should I let their words define me? Or allow me to change how I view myself, or to think negatively about myself. I just tell myself that I know my worth, I know my capability, and that's what really drives me.\n\nFox News: What does being Miss Universe mean to you, especially with the current political climate?\n\nGray: I really feel that the younger generations, especially, could do with more role models, more people to look up to. And being a Miss Universe, I really feel that my job is to be a spokesperson. Yes, the basis of it is a pageant, but that's only one night. The rest of the year, it's me really working as a spokesperson, lending my voice to different causes and different organizations.\n\nAnd me, as Catriona, I really want to bring my creativity into that, especially my love for music and my love for the arts. And I feel that that's a way that I can connect to people, that I can communicate with them to either create awareness or educate them on something, that's what being a Miss Universe means to me. And I feel that a Miss Universe really does have the potential to teach people things or to bring people to a cause. And that's why I think we do have a role to play in today's society.\n\nFox News: There are some people who may feel pageants are outdated, or that they glorify a certain look over anything else. How would you respond to such claims?\n\nGray: I would challenge those people to really see past what's onstage. We're not just there for that one night and that's it, that's the finished thing. Behind every girl is a story, there's a journey. There's something that they're passionate about. And the women that I competed with, they are incredibly successful. Some are medical students, some are budding lawyers, some are business owners, artists, they're such accomplished women. And they all have something to not only pursue but also a reason why they do what they do.\n\nAnd I think that's exactly what Miss Universe represents, the coming together of women from all around the world who have their own stories to tell, who are empowered, who do have their own purposes. And it really does give them that platform. And that's what I would challenge. We are not just there to put on a show, but behind the scenes, we're also talking country to country.\n\nWe're not only learning about different cultures which, you know, teaches us understanding, but we also broaden our view of the world. And I think that's an amazing thing. Because with that, we're given the platform to share our experiences. And if we can share a message of inclusivity, of understanding and respect, I think that in itself is a really great thing, too.\n\nFox News: Before you pursued the pageant world, you used money earned from modeling to buy a plane ticket from Australia, where you were raised, to the Philippines. Why the Philippines?\n\nGray: There was the whole aspect of me wanting to rediscover my roots. I had just graduated from high school, and I didn't really know what I wanted to pursue for university. So I wanted to take a gap year to take the time to kind of discover myself. Being a sheltered only child, I wanted to discover who was I on my own.\n\nIt was a journey of self-discovery for me, and it made sense to go to the Philippines first because that was my heritage. It's my roots. And I wanted to discover that.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
There was no formal announcement by the Giants or co-owner John Mara on Wednesday relaying that Dave Gettleman is coming back as general manager.\n\nAsked about this, Mara smiled and said, Well, he is coming back, if you want a formal announcement about that.''\n\nIt clearly was not something weighing on Mara's mind, whether he needed to move on from Gettleman. The reason for the return is not based wholly on the performance of the team – the Giants this season finished 6-10 and, once again, did not make the playoffs – but rather on the way Gettleman and Joe Judge, the first-year head coach, worked as allies in their first year together.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nHe and Dave worked very well together, Mara said. All of our personnel decisions I thought improved significantly this year. They were able to agree on basically every decision we made. I thought our draft was solid, our free agency moves were solid and I think we have the foundation for something that can be very successful going forward.\n\nGettleman, who turns 70 next month, went 9-23 in his first two years running the entire football operation. There is no change to the structure of how the organization goes about finding and procuring players.\n\nThe general manager and the head coach collaborate on personnel decisions, Mara said. Hey haven't agreed 100 percent of the time but my father [franchise patriarch Wellington Mara] used to have a saying, 'If you both agree all the time then I don't need both of you.' I haven't had to intercede on one occasion to break any ties.\n\nThey managed to talk it through and work it out, showed good communication and at the end of the day the decision that gets made is a New York Giants decision, it's not Joe's decision or Dave's decision. They collaborated really well and that's one of the reasons why I'm optimistic about our future.\n\nI just didn't think making a change at this point in time was something that was going to be beneficial.\n\nMara lauded the job Judge did in his first year as a head coach at any level. The Giants started out 0-5 and were 1-7 at midseason but rallied to go 5-3 in the second half of the season.\n\nLooking back a year ago I can tell you we're very pleased with the selection we made at head coach, Mara said. I thought Joe did a very good job, considering what he had to deal with.\n\nHere you have a brand new head coach at 38 years of age and look what he was asked to deal with, a pandemic, no offseason program, no mini-camps, no preseason games, virtual meetings, protocols that kept changing and he loses his best player [Saquon Barkley] in Week 2. I thought he showed great leadership and great adaptability, nothing seemed to faze him during the year. Something has to change he just made the change and we went from there. I thought he showed real leadership and grit and determination the entire time. I thought he represented our franchise very well, the way I want our head coach to represent our franchise.\n\nI thought he established a great foundation and a great culture, I know that 'culture' word is overused but I think it's so important and I think we have the beginnings of a very good culture here.''\n\nThe record and missing out on the playoffs after finishing in second place in the historically bad NFC East were not acceptable, Mara, said, but he saw signs that the franchise is moving in the right direction.\n\nObviously I'm not pleased with the number of games we won,'' Mara said. I'm disappointed we didn't do better than 6-10 but I do see progress in the building. I think the quality of the people we have in the locker room improved a great deal. I think we have some great leaders down there. I think we've established a basis for a foundation that can have continued success going forward and I'm excited about what the future holds for this team.''\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMara said, There's a different feeling in the building now that there has been in a number of years.''\n\nMara was asked how long the fans have to wait for the Giants to produce a winning team.\n\nWell, hopefully not too much longer because I can't wait too much longer, quite frankly. I'm tired of sitting up here at the end of the year trying to explain what went wrong and why I feel optimistic about the future, Mara said. I want to do it after a winning season.''
House Democrats are sweeping into power this week on a campaign promise of improving government for ordinary Americans. But first, they'll have to get government reopened from the partial shutdown.\n\nAs the Congress gavels in for the 116th session the early votes will be the usual ones — establishing the House rules and electing the House speaker, presumably California Democrat Nancy Pelosi. But the new majority will quickly pivot Thursday to a pair of bills to fund the parts of the government that have been shuttered in the dispute over money for President Donald Trump's border wall with Mexico.\n\nIt's a cold opening for the new majority, setting up an early confrontation with the Republican-led Senate and the White House and testing the House Democrats' ability to make good on their campaign pledge to focus on kitchen-table issues in the new era of divided government.\n\nOur first order of business will be to end the reckless Trump shutdown and reopen the government, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the incoming caucus chairman, said in an interview. Then, he said, we will turn our attention to bringing our democracy to life and returning our government to the people.\n\nSo far, House Democrats appear largely unified in their plan to vote to reopen government without the money Trump is demanding to build the border wall.\n\nJeffries said that while Trump wants to waste millions in taxpayer dollars on a medieval border wall, Democrats are drawing a line in the stand against the spending they say won't make the border any safer.\n\nThe partisanship, rancor and dysfunction of the Trump shutdown is exactly what voters rebuked in November, said Rep.-elect Joe Neguse of Colorado, a new leader of the freshmen class, in the Democrats' weekly address. And that is why on Jan. 3rd, when the new Democratic House majority arrives, we will bring the hope, vision and goals of effective governance back to the forefront.\n\nBut with Trump dug in over the $5 billion he wants to build the wall, the shutdown could drag on. Senate Republicans are reluctant to consider the House bills unless they know the president is on board.\n\nThe first signal Trump has given that he may be willing to talk about the wall impasse came Tuesday, when he tweeted, Let's make a deal? He's invited Democratic and Republican congressional leaders to a White House meeting Wednesday on border security.\n\nDemocrats are eager to move forward in the House on multiple fronts.\n\nThey're set to approve a rules package on Thursday that sets a new tone for governing. For example, it requires that legislation first be considered in committees before bills are brought to the floor for votes. It bans lawmakers from serving on corporate boards. And it recognizes the diversity of the new freshmen class by easing a century-old rule against wearing hats on the chamber floor to allow Rep.-elect Ilhan Omar, a Muslim-American from Minnesota, to wear a head scarf.\n\nBy early next week, House Democrats are expected to consider a resolution to defend the Affordable Care Act in legal proceedings after a Texas judge ruled it largely unconstitutional in a legal challenge brought by Republican attorneys general from several states.\n\nH.R. 1, the first bill of the new House majority, is a good-government package that tackles campaign finance reforms and other issues. It will begin making its way through the newly bolstered committee process.\n\nAnd they will continue their oversight of the Trump administration and Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nIncoming Rules Committee Chairman Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., insists the new majority can walk and chew gum at the same time.\n\nStill, corralling a large House majority has never been easy, and Democrats are ushering in the largest class since the Watergate era. Republicans under retiring Speaker Paul Ryan all but gave up trying to the muscle the conservative House Freedom Caucus in line. It was the Freedom Caucus leaders who urged Trump to fight for the border wall money and reject legislation that would have prevented the shutdown days before Christmas.\n\nPelosi is expected to regain the gavel Thursday, securing the votes to become speaker even after some new and returning lawmakers signaled they wanted new leadership. She would be the first woman to hold, then return, to the office.\n\nBut divisions remain, rearing up even before the newly elected members are sworn into office, as many are eager for change and ready to confront Trump.\n\nRep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has been critical of the leader's plans to create a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. She prefers a panel that focuses on renewable energy investments and whose members refuse campaign donations from oil and other fossil fuel industries.\n\nOur ultimate end goal isn't a Select Committee, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted as the panel was being formed. Our goal is to treat Climate Change like the serious, existential threat it is by drafting an ambitious solution on the scale necessary - aka a Green New Deal - to get it done. A weak committee misses the point & endangers people.\n\nTrump and Republicans have been eager to widen those divisions, especially as the shutdown stretches into its second week.\n\nRepublican Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, panned the Democratic effort to reopen government without wall money.\n\nDemocrats vow to stay united as they work to reopen government and press on with the priorities.\n\nAs my mother used to say, 'This too shall pass,' Jeffries said. We will get past this shutdown and there will be ample opportunity for us to communicate with the American people and get things done on their behalf.\n\n___\n\nFollow on Twitter at https://twitter.com/lisamascaro

House Republicans are growing concerned that if Republican senators don't object to at least three states during the Jan. 6 certification of the presidential election results, that the entire effort will be worthless, sources told Fox News.\n\nLast month, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., was the first Republican senator to commit to objecting to the election results, specifically in Pennsylvania, while a group of GOP senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on Saturday said they would object to the certification unless there was an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission.\n\nGOP SENATORS, LED BY CRUZ, TO OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION, DEMAND EMERGENCY AUDIT\n\nBut House Republican sources told Fox News Sunday that there is a growing concern that the Republican senators will not object to enough states to make a difference in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, which has been called in favor of President-elect Joe Biden since November.\n\nTwo House Republican officials told Fox News that more than 100 GOP House members will object to the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\nIf the Republican senators don't object to enough states, the entire effort on Jan. 6th is worthless, a House Republican official told Fox News. To have any chance of impacting the outcome of the 2020 election, the Republican senators must join Republican House members in objecting at least three states and ideally all six states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Wisconsin.\n\nIf Republican senators only object to one state, Joe Biden will undoubtedly secure enough electoral votes to become president, the official continued, adding that the pressure really is on the Republican senators like Ted Cruz to join House Republicans here.\n\nIf they don't, it will be a great disappointment to the president, their constituents, and ensure a Joe Biden victory, the official said.\n\nCruz, on Saturday, was joined by Republican Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin.; James Lankford of Oklahoma; Steve Daines of Montana; John Kennedy of Louisiana; Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee, and Mike Braun of Indiana; as well as Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming; Roger Marshall of Kansas; Bill Hagerty of Tennessee, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama.\n\nThe group claims that the Nov. 3 election featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud and illegal conduct. So far, those claims of widespread fraud that could affect the results have not been substantiated in the courts or by state and local election officials.\n\nWe should follow that precedent, the group said in a statement. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, the senators intend to vote against certification.\n\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, they said in the statement.\n\nA source familiar with the effort by the GOP senators told Fox News that it was Cruz who orchestrated the push for the audit just days before the joint session of Congress on Wednesday to officially approve the Electoral College votes electing former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe senators and senators-elect are calling for Congress to appoint a commission to conduct a 10-day emergency audit of the election returns in states where the results are disputed. They cite as precedent the 1877 race between Samuel Tilden and Rutherford Hayes, in which there were allegations of fraud in multiple states.\n\nBut sources familiar told Fox News that the group of Senate Republicans is still discussing which states, if any, to object to on Jan. 6.\n\nAnother source familiar with their discussions told Fox News that nothing is decided yet.\n\nAnd two sources told Fox News that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., separately, may object to at least one state during the joint session, but it is unclear, at this point, which state, if any, that may be.\n\nPaul's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe issue of electoral college certification, though, is not being whipped by Senate Republican leadership, meaning that leadership is not driving the Republican conference in a certain direction. As previously reported, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has referred to this as a vote of conscience.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators on Sunday said that efforts to object to the Electoral College results this week by Republicans only will undermine confidence in the 2020 election.\n\nThe 2020 election is over. All challenges through recounts and appeals have been exhausted, said a statement by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., Susan Collins, R-Maine; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Bill Cassidy, R-La.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Angus King, I-Maine; Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Maggie Hassan, D-N.H.; and Dick Durbin, D-Ill.\n\nHAWLEY SAYS HE'LL OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION OF BIDEN VICTORY\n\nAt this point, further attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 Presidential election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results, they continued. The voters have spoken, and Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results.\n\nThe group added that in two weeks they will begin working with our colleagues and the new Administration on bipartisan, common sense solutions to the enormous challenges facing our country.\n\nThey added: It is time to move forward.\n\nPresident Trump's campaign has launched a number of legal challenges, while Trump himself has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Biden's victories.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press last month that to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\n\nFox News' Adam Shaw and Chad Pergram contributed to this report.
Spending her life in Los Angeles, Morgan Andersen knows natural disasters all too well. In college, an earthquake shook her home hard. Her grandfather was affected by recent wildfires in neighboring Orange County.\n\nIt's just that constant reminder, 'Oh yeah, we live somewhere where there's natural disasters and they can strike at any time,' said the 29-year-old marketing executive.\n\nPLANE CRASHES INTO MICHIGAN HOME, 3 KILLED ABOARD AS HOUSE SET ABLAZE WITH FAMILY INSIDE\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency has calculated the risk for every county in America for 18 types of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, volcanoes and even tsunamis. And of the more than 3,000 counties, Los Angeles County has the highest ranking in the National Risk Index.\n\nThe way FEMA calculates the index spotlights places long known as danger spots, like Los Angeles, but some other places highlighted run counter to what most people would think. For instance, eastern cities such as New York and Philadelphia rank far higher on the risk for tornadoes than tornado alley stalwarts Oklahoma and Kansas.\n\nAnd the county with the biggest coastal flood risk is one in Washington state that's not on the ocean, although its river is tidal.\n\nThose seeming oddities occur because FEMA's index scores how often disasters strike, how many people and how much property are in harm's way, how vulnerable the population is socially and how well the area is able to bounce back. And that results in a high risk assessment for big cities with lots of poor people and expensive property that are ill-prepared to be hit by once-in-a-generation disasters.\n\nCALIFORNIA MAN CHARGED WITH KILLING PRAYING ROOMATE IN HOSPITAL'S COVID-19 WARD\n\nWhile the rankings may seem counterintuitive, the degree of risk isn't just how often a type of natural disaster strikes a place, but how bad the toll would be, according to FEMA's Mike Grimm.\n\nTake tornadoes. Two New York City counties, Philadelphia, St. Louis and Hudson County, New Jersey, are FEMA's top five riskiest counties for tornadoes. Oklahoma County, Oklahoma — with more than 120 tornadoes since 1950, including one that killed 36 people in 1999 — ranks 120th.\n\nThey (the top five) are a low frequency, potentially high-consequence event because there's a lot of property exposure in that area, said University of South Carolina Hazards & Vulnerability Research Institute Director Susan Cutter, whose work much of the FEMA calculations are based on. Therefore, a small tornado can create a large dollar loss.\n\nIn New York, people are far less aware of the risk and less prepared — and that's a problem, Grimm said. The day before he said that, New York had a tornado watch. Days later, the National Weather Service tweeted that in 2020 several cities, mostly along the East Coast, had more tornadoes than Wichita, Kansas.\n\nIn general, Oklahoma is twice as likely to get tornadoes as New York City, but the damage potential is much higher in New York because there are 20 times the people and nearly 20 times the property value at risk, FEMA officials said.\n\nIt's that risk perception that it won't happen to me, Grimm said. Just because I haven't seen it in my lifetime doesn't mean it won't happen.\n\nThat sort of denial is especially true with frequent and costly flooding, he said, and is the reason only 4% of the population has federal flood insurance when about one-third may need it.\n\nLA COUNTY DA GASCON DEFENDS SENTENCING CHANGES, RESPONDS TO PROSECUTORS AFTER LAWSUIT\n\nDisaster experts say people have to think about the big disaster that happens only a few times a lifetime at most, but is devastating when it hits — Hurricane Katrina, Superstorm Sandy, the 2011 super outbreak of tornadoes, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake or a pandemic.\n\nWe're bad at taking seriously risks that happen only infrequently, said David Ropeik, a retired Harvard risk communications lecturer and author of How Risky Is It, Really? We simply don't fear them as much as we fear things that are more present in our consciousness, more common. That's practically disastrous with natural disasters.\n\nSomething like FEMA's new index opens our eyes to the gaps between what we feel and what is, Ropeik said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFEMA's top 10 riskiest places, in addition to Los Angeles, are three counties in the New York City area — Bronx, New York County (Manhattan) and Kings County (Brooklyn) — along with Miami, Philadelphia, Dallas, St. Louis and Riverside and San Bernardino counties in California.\n\nBy the same measurement, Loudoun County, a Washington, D.C. outer suburb, has the lowest risk of any county, according to FEMA. Three other Washington suburban counties rank among the lowest risks for larger counties, along with suburban Boston, Long Island, suburban Detroit and Pittsburgh.\n\nSome of FEMA's risk rankings by disaster type seem obvious. Miami has the highest risk for hurricanes, lightning, and river flooding. Hawaii County is tops in volcano risk and Honolulu County for tsunamis, Dallas for hail, Philadelphia for heat waves and California's Riverside County for wildfires.\n\nOutside risk expert Himanshu Grover at the University of Washington called FEMA's effort a good tool, a good start, but one with flaws, such as final scores that seem to downplay disaster frequency.\n\nRisks are changing because of climate change and this index doesn't seem to address that, Ropeik said. FEMA officials said climate change shows up in flooding calculations and will probably be incorporated in future updates.\n\nThis new tool, based on calculations by 80 experts over six years, is about educating homeowners and renters and communities to be more resilient, FEMA's Grimm said, adding that people shouldn't move into or out of a county because of the risk rating.
President-elect Joe Biden and his administration are feeling emboldened by the results in the Georgia special election, Special Report host Bret Baier said Wednesday.\n\nThe Senate minority leader might be moving to the majority if Jon Ossoff wins against David Perdue. Last year, in celebrating Biden's projected election victory in New York City, Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told a crowd: Now we take Georgia, then we change the world.\n\nGEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS: WHAT'S LEFT TO COUNT\n\nI think they're going to try to change as much as they can quickly and probably have a lot to do with power and setting up power for the future, Baier told America's Newsroom.\n\nHe believes Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., will have a lot of power in the new Congress as well as other moderates like Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who could work together and affect legislation.\n\nToday the Biden administration is feeling emboldened because while it may not change exactly what they're going to do, as far as what they thought the priorities were, it's going to change how big they were going to swing for the fences, Baier said. The scale will definitely change because of what happened in Georgia last night, he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR LIVE UPDATES FROM FOX NEWS ON THE GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nThe Ossoff-Perdue race could be headed to recount if the margin stays close. According to Georgia law, the losing candidate can request a recount if the margin is less than 0.5%.\n\nBut speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Gabriel Sterling -- the voting system implementation manager at the Georgia Secretary of State's Office -- predicted that both Warnock and Ossoff would finish with margin greater than 0.5%.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.
Overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, House Democrats on Thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees.\n\nAlthough planned portions of the rules relating to the House's handling of ObamaCare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's opposition to the measure.\n\nThree Republicans supported the Democrats' rules, including Pennsylvania Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, and New York Reps. John Katko and Tom Reed. In addition to Ocasio-Cortez, Hawaii Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and California Rep. Ro Khanna voted against the rules package.\n\nOn Wednesday, Ocasio-Cortez vowed to join Khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit.\n\nThe pay-go principle, Ocasio-Cortez charged in a tweet Wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\n\nWe shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added. But, Pelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back, tweeting: A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let [Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)] Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases.\n\nPay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. Last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOther rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through September 30 of the budget year once the House adopts a budget. The so-called Gephardt rule had offered the House much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the House and Senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote.\n\nThe rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. The Select Committee on the Climate Crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when Democrats last controlled the House. But, the House rules give the panel until March 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation.\n\nAnd, although hats have been barred in the House chamber for more than a century, a new House rule states that this prohibition does not include religious headwear. That means the rules will still preclude Democratic Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson from wearing her signature cowboy hats on the House floor -- but Democratic Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Muslim, will be permitted to wear a hijab.\n\nAdditional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.\n\nPortions of the rules had also provided that the House has the authority to defend ObamaCare, which was recently ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge, in court.\n\nDEM INTRODUCING IMPEACHMENT ARTICLES AGAINST TRUMP ON FIRST DAY OF NEW CONGRESS\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats Thursday night debated a combined spending bill to end part of the government shutdown.\n\nThe House late Thursday ultimately passed a bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb.8, by a 239 to 192 vote. But the bill does not include any new wall money, and Senate Republicans and the White House have both described it as a non-starter that will never become law. Five Republicans voted for the bill.\n\nAnother piece of legislation proposed and debated by Democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through Sept. 30. That bill, which the White House has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. ET, with seven Republicans joining Democrats to vote yea. The measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package.\n\nIn a news conference Thursday night, Pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since Dec. 22 amid demands from the White House that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border.\n\nHowever, Pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it.\n\nWe sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters. The president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. And we will do that. And we will have a discussion. Pelosi then interjected to remind Hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. ET, and joked that Trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent.\n\nTrump met with Pelosi and other senior Democrats at a contentious meeting on Wednesday in the White House Situation Room, which included Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., interrupting Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen within five seconds, according to Republicans at the meeting. The sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new Congress was seated Thursday.\n\nThe message is very simple: This is the first time in history that a government has been shut down while our new electeds have assumed responsibility, New York Democratic Rep. Nita Lowey, who chairs the House Appropriations Committee, said afterward.\n\nWATCH: TRUMP HOLDS SURPRISE PRESS CONFERENCE WITH BORDER PATROL UNION\n\nShortly after Pelosi's historic return to the House speakership, Trump made his first-ever appearance in the White House briefing room to congratulate Pelosi and reaffirm his commitment to the border wall.\n\nTogether with officials from the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing border patrol agents and staff, Trump insisted that we need protection in our country.\n\nI promise you, if you interview Border Patrol agents, they will tell you that walls work, Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol union, told the media after Trump's introductory remarks. I worked in Naco, Ariz., for ten years. We didn't have physical barriers in Naco and illegal immigration and drug smuggling was absolutely out of control. We built those walls, those physical barriers, and illegal immigration dropped exponentially. Anywhere that you look, where we have built walls, they have worked ... We need those physical barriers and we appreciate President Trump and all of his efforts in getting us those physical barriers.\n\nTrump himself likely will soon deliver that message in person to congressional Democrats. In a show of normalcy towards the end of a whirlwind day of history and drama on Capitol Hill, Pelosi on Thursday evening formally invited Trump to deliver State of the Union speech in Congress on Jan. 29.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Samuel Chamberlain contributed to this report.
There was a time, not that long ago, when Americans expected to learn election results on Election Night. Usually, they did. Were voting machines that much more efficient way back in, say, 2012? No, they weren't. The difference was that we just required most people to vote in-person back then.\n\nIn-person voting reduces fraud, and reducing fraud and the appearance of fraud used to be important to us. We wanted people to believe the results when they came in. We wanted to protect the system that made all of our good things possible. We wanted democracy to continue. But then everything changed.\n\nThe main driver of that change, they will tell you, was the coronavirus pandemic. It simply became too dangerous to show up in person to vote. But think about that for a second. If you can go to the grocery store -- and most people can and do -- then you can go to a polling place. There's no medical reason that you can't vote in person.\n\nAlmost no one in the media has ever made that point. They know that mail-in elections help Democrats, and that's the whole point. When Republicans complain about it, the left doesn't answer the question. They just get hysterical and start screaming about racism.\n\nSEVEN OUT OF 10 GEORGIA REPUBLICANS BELIEVE NOVEMBER ELECTION NOT PROPERLY CERTIFIED\n\nYou may be wondering what racism has to do with the potential health risks of in-person voting. We're going to let Jon Ossoff explain the answer. In a world of shallow politicians, Ossoff makes Beto O'Rourke look like Teddy Roosevelt. But he does know one thing: If you're worried about election fraud, you are a racist. Here he is Monday:\n\nOSSOFF: My opponent ... Kelly Loeffler and Georgia Republicans have been filing lawsuit after lawsuit to purge the rolls to make it harder for people to vote. It is an open attack on Black voters in Georgia and it's a disgrace and it's an echo of the legacy of Jim Crow.\n\nThis scam will continue for as long as people keep falling for it, and they do keep falling for it. Everything Democrats don't like is Jim Crow. Just in the last year, they've told us that in-person voting, the filibuster, even mispronouncing Kamala Harris name -- a name, by the way, she can't pronounce herself -- are all vestiges of America's racist history. So what's the remedy for a history this evil? You guessed it: More identity politics.\n\nRepublicans recently argued that thousands of Georgia voters should be excluded from participating in the election for this simple and obvious reason: Post office change-of-address records showed they had left the state. Therefore, they couldn't vote in Georgia because they're not in Georgia.\n\nGEORGIA JUDGE, STACEY ABRAMS' SISTER, RULES AGAINST VOTER PURGE BEFORE SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nThat seems simple and obvious, but that standard does not meet the burden of proof in the court of U.S. District Judge Leslie Abrams Gardner. Who is Leslie Abrams Gardner? She happens to be the sister of Stacey Abrams, the Democratic pretender to the governorship of Georgia. The case in question, by the way, involves a group funded by, you guessed it, Stacey Abrams.\n\nBecause this is an amazing time in our history, Gardner explained her refusal to recuse herself from the case like this: One can only assume that the argument is something to the effect that if my sister is actively engaged in a cause, I cannot be impartial ... This argument is mere speculation.\n\nNot surprisingly, Gardner gave her sister's organization exactly what they wanted. Therefore, thousands of people could vote Tuesday in Georgia, even if they no longer lived in Georgia. All they needed to do was identify as Georgia voters. Just as you can change your gender, you can also change your state of residence. You just identify yourself as such. That's how identity politics works.\n\nIt goes without saying that the real identities of Georgia's Democratic Senate candidates are off limits. You can call Raphael Warnock, for example, a pastor, a Christian, a pro-choice Christian. But don't you dare mention the words he actually utters in his sermons.\n\nWARNOCK, IN SERMON, CALLED BREXIT EXAMPLE OF 'ETHNOCENTRISM AND HATE'\n\nAnd Jon Ossoff, what's his identity? It's not an easy question to answer when the sum total of your personal achievements could fit comfortably in the ashtray of a sports car. At various points, Ossoff has claimed he once worked as a senior national security staffer on Capitol Hill, which is pretty funny because, in fact, he was what is called in Washington a legislative correspondent. That job consists mostly of responding to letters from constituents. In other words, he was the mail boy.\n\nHe wasn't even the mail boy in a very impressive office. Ossoff worked for a Georgia congressman called Hank Johnson, who was easily, hands down, the single dumbest member of Congress, and that's saying a lot. Back in 2010, just in case you think we're overstating this, Johnson asked a Navy admiral during a televised hearing whether the island of Guam might capsize if too many troops were moved on to a base there. Mind you, this happened before marijuana was legalized.\n\nThat moment became a blueprint for Jon Ossoff's entire career: Lean into your mediocrity. Don't deny it, embrace it. And when you're challenged, hide behind identity politics. That works. We know it does because that's all Ossoff has ever done.\n\nIn 2012, Ossoff went on Twitter and encouraged people who follow him to support one of the leading propaganda outlets for the Communist Party of China.\n\nHere's what he wrote: Esp. during 18th Party Congress, #follow @XHNews (Xinhua - Chinese state media).\n\nMost politicians might feel slightly hesitant about endorsing Chinese state run media in public, but not Jon Ossoff. If he learned anything from Hank Johnson, it's that if you're going to do it, you might as well go all in.\n\nLast year, we learned that Ossoff's media company received thousands of dollars from a Chinese-backed media giant. Ossoff didn't even bother to claim to care about transparency. In fact, he refused to release any more financial documents related to foreign investors. But stop asking questions, America is racist.\n\nThat's the answer to everything, but it would be nice if someone disagreed with that claim, because that claim is totally false. It's poisonous and it's wrecking what has been, for a couple of hundred years now, a pretty great country. But increasingly, no one pushes back. In fact, a lot of Republicans have been saying the same thing recently.\n\nLast May, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., didn't bother holding hearings on election integrity or mail-in balloting. That might have been nice. No, McConnell was busy attacking police officers and eulogizing George Floyd. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was on the street mouthing Black Lives Matter slogans on camera in a sort of Jane Fonda moment. Meanwhile, two Republican senators called for replacing Columbus Day, a day that celebrates the discovery of this country, with Juneteenth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf Democrats win both Georgia Senate runoffs, they're not going to be too concerned about Juneteenth. They have much bigger goals in mind, like eliminating the filibuster, adding new states to the union, packing the Supreme Court, and giving citizenship to tens of millions of illegal aliens, now known as their base.\n\nNone of that should come as a surprise. We've seen it coming for a long time. The question we need to ask right now is, why did so few Republicans do anything to stop it?\n\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the Jan. 5, 2021 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight.
Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence was on his back, reaching out desperately with his right hand to try to gather in the ball after it squirted through his arms as he was dragged down to the Superdome turf.\n\nThe Heisman Trophy finalist couldn't quite get a grip on it before it was ripped loose and ultimately recovered by Ohio State.\n\nAnd with that, Lawrence's bid to finish an extraordinary college football career with his second national championship in three seasons slipped away. The Tigers were down three touchdowns and the deficit grew even larger in the fourth quarter before No. 3 Ohio State celebrated a 49-28 victory over No. 2 Clemson in the College Football Playoff semifinal at the Sugar Bowl on Friday night.\n\nI missed a few throws and put too many balls on the ground, said Lawrence, who fumbled three times but only lost one. Obviously, it sucks to finish like this.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nFor the second consecutive season, Lawrence and Clemson got bounced from the CFP by being blown out in the Big Easy. Those are the only two losses in his 36 college starts.\n\nLast season, Clemson fell 42-25 to LSU in the national championship game on the same field, with Lawrence having one of the worst games of his career (18 of 37, 234 yards, no touchdowns passing). This year in New Orleans, like last year, Lawrence scored the game's first touchdown on a keeper, but later lost a fumble while Clemson was trying to close a yawning second-half deficit.\n\nLawrence played better overall this year, despite Clemson being without offensive coordinator and play-caller Tony Elliott, who was in COVID-19 protocol and did not make the trip to New Orleans. Lawrence finished 33 of 48 for 400 yards and two touchdowns with one interception.\n\nI tell you what, man, Trevor Lawrence, I know we didn't win the game, but you saw everything you need to know about that guy tonight, Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. I mean, he just, he wanted to play 'till the last second and give it everything he has. And that's just who he is as a person.\n\nThe way Clemson's defense struggled most of the game, giving up two scoring passes of 45 yards or more in addition to a 32-yard touchdown run, that wasn't nearly enough.\n\nWhen it was over, Lawrence had been outshone by Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields (22 of 28, 385 yards, six TDs).\n\nObviously they kicked our butt tonight, Lawrence said.\n\nThe season didn't end the way we wanted it to, but it was special, Lawrence continued. We just didn't get it done tonight for a lot of reasons. ... In games like this, you've just got to play well all the way around and we didn't do that.\n\nThat won't change anything regarding the Heisman Trophy, because the votes were already in. Lawrence is one of four finalists, along with Alabama QB Mac Jones, Crimson Tide receiver Davonta Smith and Florida QB Kyle Trask.\n\nTime will tell if it affects the thinking in pro football front offices. Lawrence, for much of this season, has been the consensus projected top pick in the 2021 NFL draft assuming he passes up his senior year at Clemson.\n\nStill, he'll be remembered as one of the faces of college football — on the field and off — during a tumultuous junior year.\n\nOver the summer, he was out front of both social justice marches and calls for the games to continue despite the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThere's not much I'd go back and change, Lawrence said. I'm proud of the man I've become over the time I've been (at Clemson). ... Yeah, it's been a crazy year.\n\nHis stances earned him the respect of his peers across the country, as did his play.\n\nIn three seasons, Lawrence has passed for 10,098 yards and 90 touchdowns, and has rushed for 943 yards and 18 TDs. He also went down in Clemson history as the QB for the program's third national championship team. He is the winningest quarterback in Clemson history and he led the Tigers to three straight ACC titles\n\nThat may have to suffice. After all, not many have done better.\n\nSwinney said Lawrence and Clemson senior running back Travis Etienne leave behind incredible legacies and set the standard at Clemson while never expecting anything more from their teammates than they were willing to give.\n\nTrevor Lawrence is a generational guy. He's going to be a great player for a long, long time, Swinney added. We're all sad that it ended the way it ended tonight. And we wanted to end it in Miami with a victory (in the national title game) and ride off into the sunset, but that wasn't to be.
Those hoping to visit Martin Luther King Jr.'s birth home and longtime church to celebrate his national holiday next Monday will be unable to do so if the ongoing partial government shutdown is not resolved soon.\n\nGovernment-funded parks, museums and landmarks nationwide have been shuttered as the White House and congressional Democrats came to an impasse over border wall funding Dec. 22, leading to the longest-lasting partial shutdown in history. Among the affected sites are major parts of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historical Park in Atlanta, at a time when visitation is at its peak, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports.\n\nThe doors of Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr. practiced his preaching on nonviolent resistance, and of his childhood home on Auburn Avenue, will be closed until further notice, much to the dismay of those hoping to celebrate King's legacy at his historic sites on Jan. 21.\n\nPARTIAL GOVRNMENT SHUTDOWN: 8 COMMON QUESTIONS AMERICANS HAVE\n\nEbenezer Baptist Church is a place of enormous significance in terms of Martin Luther King Jr.'s life and death. The civil rights leader co-pastored the church with his father for eight years, and it is the site where his mother was shot and killed in 1974, six years after her son's death. The horse-drawn buggy which carried King's body through the streets of Atlanta is also kept at the church.\n\nThe home on Auburn Avenue frequently has a line of visitors waiting to walk through its halls, and it was totally refurbished in 2017 in anticipation for crowds in 2018.\n\nPark Superintendent Judy Forte told the AJC they were expecting even larger crowds than usually this year, because the Super Bowl will be held in Atlanta next month. In addition to the historic hometown MLK sites in Atlanta, the The National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. will also be closed in the event that the shutdown lasts another week.\n\nBernice King, activist, author and daughter of Marthin Luther King Jr., was brought to tears while reflecting on the absence of National Park Service employees during the holiday this year.\n\nAIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS UNION SUES TRUMP ADMIN. OVER GOV. SHUTDOWN, CLAIMS RIGHTS VIOLATIONS\n\nI feel a little bit of sadness because our main partner in this area, in this district, is the National Park Service … and they are not here with us today. I didn't expect to cry over this, she told reporters last week, according to WTKR.\n\nThey are part of our family. Their struggle right now is our struggle, she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMore than 800,000 workers officially missed their first paycheck of the shutdown last week, leaving many federal employees to wonder how they are going to pay for their basic needs. Nine different governmental departments have been effectively closed, including Agriculture, Commerce, Justice, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, State, Transportation, and Treasury and the Interior - which contains 401 factions of the National Park Service.\n\nFor those residing in Atlanta still hoping to pay their respects next Monday, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change (better known as the King Center) will not be affected by the government shutdown, an employee confirmed to Fox News.
Top congressional Democrats rejoiced Wednesday following the results of Tuesday's highly anticipated runoff race in Georgia, where they are projected to pick up at least one more Senate seat and the outlook on the second race seems high in their favor.\n\nBuckle up! Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Twitter early Wednesday.\n\nHis comment comes ahead of what is likely be a contentious joint session of Congress where lawmakers will vote to certify the results of the presidential election. In a final test of loyalty to President Trump, several Republicans have promised to vote against the Electoral College's certification of President-elect Joe Biden's win.\n\nHOUSE DEM POSTS LEGISLATIVE WISH LIST WHILE AWAITING GEORGIA SENATE RESULTS\n\nDespite this, Democrats are high off of a crucial win Tuesday night, which came in spite of continuous attacks against the election process in Georgia and constant unsubstantiated declarations by Trump that widespread voter fraud occurred in November.\n\nIt feels like a brand new day, Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement. For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate -- and that will be very good for the American people.\n\nLater at a press conference, Schumer promised to make passing $2,000 coronavirus relief checks for every American a top priority for the new Congress, a measure repeatedly blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.\n\nBecause of the courageous leadership of Georgians, America will have a Democratic Senate working hand-in-hand with our Democratic House Majority and President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nGEORGIA ELECTIONS, BLUE WAVE BAD FOR BIG TECH, ANALYST SAYS\n\nGeorgia Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock made history, becoming the first Black senator in his state and ousting Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler from her position though she has yet to concede.\n\nMeanwhile, Democrat Jon Ossoff holds a tight lead against Sen. David Perdue, but the race remains too close to call, according to Fox News' Decision Desk.\n\nReverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff ran and won on the values of advancing equality and opportunity for working people across the state and the nation, Pelosi, D-Calif., said. In sending these two outstanding Democratic Senators to Washington, Georgians cast their ballots for a fairer, accountable and more compassionate America.\n\nInspired by our beloved John Lewis, Senators-elect Warnock and Ossoff's hunger for justice will bring necessary Good Trouble to the Senate, Pelosi added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSchumer also refused to commit to whether he would push to introduce a bill to do away with the filibuster, an unpopular change in Senate procedure that does not have the full backing of the Democratic party, with Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.V., being the most notable dissent.\n\nHouse Democrats laid out a preemptive wishlist of things they hoped to see succeed under the new Congress, including passing the DREAM Act and making strides on climate change.
Minority voters will be consequential to the Georgia runoff elections, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said on Monday.\n\nOn Fox & Friends, Gingrich noted President Trump received a higher Black and Latino vote in the 2020 presidential election than in 2016 and that shift could play into who wins the Georgia races that will determine party control of the Senate this year.\n\nThe Republican Party has consistently been doing better because, again, people who are earning a living, working hard tend to have an increasing bias towards us and towards lower taxes, Gingrich said.\n\nAnd you've had some two dozen African-American pastors come out and attack Raphael Warnock for being so rabidly pro-abortion and so willing to use tax money to pay for abortion. So there are values issues there, too. And I think that you'll find that we do better or continue to do better with Asian, Latino, and African-American votes as it becomes obvious how radical, how high tax and, frankly, how high-unemployment the Democrats are.\n\nGingrich, who represented Georgia's Sixth District in suburban Atlanta while in Congress, explained the phenomenon of minorities moving to the suburbs in recent years. Former Republican strongholds like Cobb County and Gwinnett County have grown steadily bluer as a result, while rural Georgia has become more Republican.\n\nWell, it's a fascinating demographic. What basically happened is that strong Republican voters have moved further and further out to small towns and communities like Dalton or like Rome, like Gainesville, Gingrich told.\n\nAnd at the same time, people who were crammed into the center of Atlanta have, as they've gotten wealthy, I mean, one of the great virtues of the Trump economy was the lowest black unemployment rate in history. Well, as people get more money, they like to move to the suburbs which is perfectly normal, Gingrich said.\n\nLOEFFLER'S WARNING BEFORE GEORGIA RUNOFFS: 'WE WON'T GET A SECOND CHANCE'\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., warned that Democratic victories in her state's runoff elections will mean a radical agenda that will drastically change life in the U.S.\n\nBoth Georgia Senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on Tuesday as Loeffler faces Warnock and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., takes on Jon Ossoff. With Democrats already having control of the House and the White House after November's election, Loeffler told Fox News Sunday that Democratic victories this week would result in drastic changes in Washington.\n\nIt's a choice, it's a stark contrast between the freedoms — our way of life here in Georgia — or socialism, government control, she said. We know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going to take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is not just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run health care, but he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne of those agents of change, Loeffler claimed, is her opponent Warnock, who she said did not represent her state's values and who would fundamentally change this country.\n\nPresident-elect Joe Biden was the first Democrat in 28 years to win Georgia in a presidential race, although Republicans in both U.S. Senate races, including the jungle race for Loeffler's seat with nearly two-dozen competitors, won more votes than their Democratic counterparts in November. No one cracked the 50-percent threshold, however, forcing runoffs in both contests.\n\nFox News' Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., who has garnered plenty of media coverage recently, hasn't been afraid to tell news outlets how she feels – especially those who have been critical of her.\n\nSaturday was no different as she expressed her dissatisfaction with CBS News' 2020 election coverage plans, calling out the network for not including an African-American journalist on their 2020 Election Team.\n\nBen F. Mitchell, a CBS News associate producer, tweeted, It's Official: The @CBSNews 2020 Election Team has assembled! on Friday.\n\nThe tweet included a graphic with pictures and names of eight 2020 campaign reporters as well as four campaign associate producers, including Mitchell.\n\nLate Saturday, Ocasio-Cortez retweeted the producer and called out his employer for not including an African-American in the group.\n\nWHOOPI GOLDBERG TELLS OCASIO-CORTEZ TO 'SIT STILL' AND 'LEARN THE JOB' FIRST\n\nThis [administration] has made having a functional understanding of race in America one of the most important core competencies for a political journalist to have, yet @CBSNews hasn't assigned a *single* black journalist to cover the 2020 election, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. Unacceptable in 2019. Try again.\n\nOcasio-Cortez called President Donald Trump a racist last Sunday on CBS News' 60 Minutes program.\n\nCBS News' public relations department tweeted a press release minutes after Mitchell's Tweet announcing the group.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ SAYS ICE IS VIOLATING HUMAN RIGHTS\n\nThe News Division will increase political reporting across-the-board by expanding its political embed unit, the press release said.\n\nIn separate responses to Ocasio-Cortez, National Journal Politics Editor Josh Kraushaar compared her to President Trump by calling her a media scold and noted that the group looked racially diverse (at least based on last names), with the exception of lacking an African-American. If there aren't strict racial quotas for every batch of hires, does it mean a company is racist?\n\nRep. Ocasio-Cortez did not take kindly to Kraushaar's response, joking that she should change her Twitter profile name to Alexandria 'looked racially diverse (at least based on last names)' Ocasio-Cortez\n\nDo you understand how fundamental the black experience is to American politics? And to American history? Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. One race isn't substitutable for another. It doesn't work like that.\n\nShe added, It's not about quotas. It's about understanding the country you're living in.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe freshman congresswoman returned to her exchange with Kraushaar on Sunday, claiming that his comparison of her to Trump was a false equivalence by diminishing Trump's 'enemy of the people' talk as 'scolding' & describing my call to hire a black journalist as the same thing.\n\nI never called anyone racist, just inadequate, she added. Also never called for strict quotas, just having representation of one of the most fundamental voting blocs in the American electorate.

Laura Ingraham interviewing the President starts right now. See you, Monday.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, FOX NEWS HOST: I'm Laura Ingraham, and this is the Ingraham Angle tonight from Washington. And do we have a show for you tonight? My exclusive interview with President Trump at the White House. It's been a wild week all around in Washington. Of course, the rest of the world. The President passed a monumental leadership test this week with flying colors. First, we had an Iranian missile attack in retaliation for the killing of terrorist mastermind Soleimani. Democrats of course predicted World War III would ensue. And as usual, the President proved them wrong. So, now hostilities aren't a deescalated state and Iran may and I underline may even come to the negotiating table. No one thought that was going to happen. Second, the President and the GOP held firm on impeachment. And boy, did that strategy pay off. After weeks of delay, Nancy Pelosi is finally caving, and she will transmit articles of impeachment to the Senate next week. Her plot to control the Senate trial has been completely foiled. Oops. Well, I had the great privilege of sitting down with the President for a wide-ranging interview today. He made news on all of these important topics and a lot more and he shared his plans for the New Year. Here's part one of my exclusive interview with President Trump.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, thanks so much for being with us tonight.\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Thank you, Laura.\n\nINGRAHAM: Today, Mike Pompeo gave a very forceful press conference on the fallout from the Iranian jetliner going down. His concern is that people aren't understanding the imminent nature of the threat of Soleimani, and he was pressed on that today. He said, there were large scale attacks planned on U.S. facilities, but he didn't go more specific. Don't the American people have a right to know what specifically was targeted without revealing methods and sources?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I don't think so, but we will tell you that probably it was going to be the embassy in Baghdad. You saw that happening. You saw with all of the men, very few women circling it and circling it very strongly and very viciously, knocking out windows and trying to get in and they were close to getting in and I called out the military. They said, we'll have it there tomorrow. I said, no, you'll have it there today. We're not going to have another Benghazi on our hands. And we did a really amazing job, get no credit for it, but we never get credit for anything and that's OK. In the meantime, we have the greatest economy we've ever had, a lot of other things. But I think you would have had another Benghazi had we not acted quickly. That could have been stopped. And this was stopped. And we had our Apaches going there, the great helicopters and they were dropping flares all over the place and a lot of things were happening. They had action real fast and everybody disappeared.\n\nINGRAHAM: City of large-scale attacks planned for other embassies and if those were planned, why can't we reveal that to the American people? Wouldn't that help your case?\n\nTRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been for embassies. And I think that probably Baghdad already started. They were really amazed that we came in with that kind of a force. We came in with very powerful force and drove them out. You know that ended almost immediately. But Baghdad certainly would have been the lead. But I think it would have been for embassy, could have been military bases, could have been a lot of other things too. But it was imminent and then all of a sudden, he was gone.\n\nINGRAHAM: Why is Nancy Pelosi describing her briefing as dismissive and disdainful? Mike Lee said it was insulting the Intel briefing. What wasn't said to mollify the concerns of some of your strongest supporters like Mike Lee?\n\nTRUMP: Yes, he is a great supporter. He is a friend of mine. He called me just a little while ago and he said, you know, I just wanted to get some more information and he was - look, I have also had calls from some of the senators, some of the congressmen said it was the single best briefing. One person said they've been there for 10 years. It's the single best briefing they've ever had. One said 20 years, the single best military briefing they've ever had. I understand what Mike had, Mike wanted certain things said and we just couldn't say, and we could probably say maybe individually to him and he's certainly a trustworthy person.\n\nINGRAHAM: Are you worried that the Democrats can't be trusted with classified information because that's kind of what it sounded like when Pence gave that interview and talked about sources and methods the other day.\n\nTRUMP: I am worried about it. Certainly, I am worried about it. Can you imagine, here we are split second timing executed like nobody has seen in many, many years on Soleimani. Can you imagine, they want us to call up and speak to crooked corrupt politician, Adam Schiff. Oh! Adam, we have somebody that we've been trying to get for a long time. We have a shot at him right now. Could we meet so that we can get your approval Adam Schiff. And he'd say well, let's do it in a couple of days. Oh! OK. Let's meet in a couple - it doesn't work that way. Number one. Number two, they leak. Anything we give will be leaked immediately. You'll see breaking news. We're about to attack in 25 minutes or do something. And by the way, I'm not somebody that wants to attack. I probably could have attacked five times, 10 times having to do with Iran. I've been very guarded because I don't want to do that. But we may have to do something. We have to be in a position where we can do it even from the negotiating standpoint. But hopefully it won't be necessary. We have tremendous sanctions. They're doing very poorly. They have riots all over their country and they could straighten out easy. But it's up to them. Whatever they want to be.\n\nINGRAHAM: Speaking of sanctions, Ilhan Omar, I think said today that this is akin to economic warfare against Iran, even though she supports sanctions against Israel.\n\nTRUMP: Yes. She hates Israel. She hates Jewish people. You just have to take a look at her rhetoric. It's incredible what's happened to the Democrats in Congress. They used to be supportive of Israel. Today, they're supportive of her and Tlaib. That's another real winner. Tlaib and AOC who knows nothing. AOC knows nothing. Poor student, poor everything and then she comes, and she talks about the Green New Deal and all these poor fools say, isn't it wonderful, isn't it wonderful. But you know as I said last night in Ohio, I don't like talking about the Green New Deal, it's too early. I want to save it for about two weeks before because they may change their mind.\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders was out. You're not surprised to hear this, discussing Iran. What happened. And he basically said this.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (D-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Just as we were led into Vietnam and Iraq by lies, the Trump administration is misleading us on Iran. They just did the assassination of Qasem Soleimani by claiming that he was planning imminent attacks and yet they produce no evidence that would justify this claim, not even in a classified setting.\n\nTRUMP: I don't see it happening. We are there for a very, very strong reason. They cannot have nuclear weapons. The Iran nuclear deal signed by President Obama gave 150 billion and that's when the real terrorist started. They took that money and they used it all over the place. You look at Yemen, you look at all of the things that were happening including Syria. They were using, Pallister (ph) gave 1.8 billion in cash, 1.7, 1.8 billion in cash. Green cash, beautiful green cash. You almost - how do they have the power to do this plane load of cash and instead of Iran saying, thank you very much. It's really nice. Let's go and get along. Let's do well. Let's do deals together. Let's build buildings in Iran. They said, Death to America and they said it when they were signing. When Kerry signed, and by the way, Kerry violated the Logan Act.\n\nINGRAHAM: He's out there. He's out there just slamming you.\n\nTRUMP: He totally violated. This man totally violated the Logan Act with his conversations. OK. But when Kerry was out there and making the deal and they had people screaming, Death to America, Death to America, who signs a deal while they're screaming Death to America.\n\nINGRAHAM: They're saying you destabilized the Middle East after campaigning as a man of restraint, not interventionism. Elizabeth Warren is saying this, Kerry saying this, all the old Obama folks are out there, Susan Rice, they're all kind of waiting in the wings, like see he's the guy that we told you he was.\n\nTRUMP: If you look at the Middle East right now, it's much tamer than it was when I got in. When I got in, it was just all over the place. Number one, we got rid of the caliphate, the ISIS caliphate. We have tens of thousands of ISIS prisoners. We've killed most of their fighters. We've gotten rid of ISIS. Now they come back and we take care of it. Other people should take care of it. Other countries should take care of it. Europe should take them back.\n\nINGRAHAM: Is NATO going to actually step up? I know they're committed to doing more in the Middle East. But what specifically is NATO going to contribute that's going to take some of the burden off the American taxpayers.\n\nTRUMP: So, when I came in as you know NATO was virtually a dead organization. It had no money. Nobody was paying except us. Practically nobody was paying. If you look at a chart of money and funds received, it looked like a rollercoaster down. Now, and Secretary Stoltenberg, I think he's terrific. In my first year, I raised $130 billion from them, not from us. And now he just announced $530 billion, all because of me. He's my biggest salesman. My greatest salesman Secretary Stoltenberg. But I said to him, look, you're there for Russia and Europe. OK. By the way, NATO is much more for Europe than it is for us and yet we--\n\nINGRAHAM: What are we protecting them from now, all the money we're spending in NATO. Who are we protecting them from?\n\nTRUMP: Well, they build an office building for $3 billion. They do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing before I got here. But I raised a lot of money. We can use NATO in other locations. We can use NATO as an example in the Middle East. And that's what we should do. I think frankly it's more palatable to countries in the Middle East, if an international force comes in rather than just the United States. And from our standpoint, let somebody else pay for it. Why are we always paying? We pay for everything. One thing, I moved our troops out of Syria - on the border between Turkey and Syria. That turned out to be such a successful move, Laura. Look what happened. Now they protect it. They've been fighting over that border for a thousand years. Why should we do it? And then they say, he left troops in Syria. You know what I did, I left troops to take the oil. I took the oil. The only troops I have are taking the oil. They're protecting the oil. I took over the oil.\n\nINGRAHAM: We're taking, we're not taking--\n\nTRUMP: Maybe we will, maybe we won't.\n\nINGRAHAM: They're protecting their facility.\n\nTRUMP: I don't know maybe we should take it. But we have the oil. Right now, the United States has the oil. So, they say, he left troops in Syria. No, I got rid of all of them other than we're protecting the oil. We have the oil.\n\nINGRAHAM: The Wall Street Journal is reporting today that after this strike, Mr. Trump told associates he was under pressure to deal with General Soleimani, take him out. From GOP senators, he views as important supporters in the coming impeachment trial in the Senate. Associates said sounds like you've got a leaker here in the White House or someone. What is it, it's just fake?\n\nTRUMP: They just made it up. It's fake news.\n\nINGRAHAM: OK. Wall Street Journal.\n\nTRUMP: They use the term, leakers. They just make it up. They're all very dishonest. Most of them are really - I mean 80 percent are dishonest and I mean really dishonest. They made that story up.\n\nINGRAHAM: So, no concern about Lindsey Graham or--\n\nTRUMP: No, not at all. By the way, absolutely not at all. We have tremendous support. Look in the House we own 196 to nothing and we got three Democrats. So therefore, it was bipartisan, I guess you could say. We got nothing. They had nothing. We didn't lose one Republican vote. As you know, that's very unusual. In the Senate I think I have the same if not more support, I don't have to do that. I would never compromise what we're doing with Iran and potential war and all of the things that we're doing so well--\n\nINGRAHAM: So, we're not doing Bush 2.0 here? This is not Bush 2.0. This is not WMD.\n\nTRUMP: You know what I want in the Middle East, I don't want people having nuclear weapons because they'll use them. I don't want people having nuclear weapons. That's my biggest thing.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, John Kerry was out there yesterday saying, well, you guys got out of the Iran deal and that's what's caused all this tension.\n\nTRUMP: By the way, you know how bad the Iran deal was? The Iran deal, I did a great thing getting out of the Iran deal. They gave 150 billion, they gave 1.8 and forget that. You couldn't do inspections of the most important locations. And you know another big thing, they have the right to do ballistic missiles. We couldn't go into areas and look; we'd have to give massive notice. So, if they were doing something that they could clean them up, it was ridiculous. But most importantly, it expires. This is a short-term agreement. And now once it expired, they have an absolute clear, unstopped path of nuclear weapons. Unstopped. In a very short period of time, the deal that President Obama made with John Kerry, who may be the worst negotiator I've ever seen that deal expires and you know what? Once it expires, you can't do what I did. I mean because they have a deal that says once it expires, they can do what they want to do. You cannot let Iran have a nuclear weapon. That's what I'm doing.\n\nINGRAHAM: Pete Buttigieg and other Democrats, I predicted this when I talked to Mike Pompeo yesterday are actually blaming your moves against Iran for the downing of that commercial jetliner in Iran, in Tehran, the night of the strikes by Iran to our Iraqi facilities. Your reaction to that charge?\n\nTRUMP: Well, a couple of people started that, and they got hit real fast by a lot of different people, not me. I think it's just low life. Look, he's not going anywhere. He was a lousy mayor of a place that is not doing well, and Indiana is doing unbelievably. Indiana, the state had the best year they've ever had. Thank you very much. But that city was badly run. You look at what's going on.\n\nINGRAHAM: Jackie Speier saying on this too.\n\nTRUMP: He's going nowhere. And she's another beauty. I mean take a look at her past. Check out her past please.\n\nINGRAHAM: The Iraqi Prime Minister has notified Mike Pompeo about potential plans, drawing up plans for U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. You ran on pulling out of the Middle East, why not use this opportunity to say, we're done.\n\nTRUMP: I'm OK with it. By the way--\n\nINGRAHAM: You're OK with removing our troops from Iraq?\n\nTRUMP: That's what they say publicly. They don't say that privately because if we leave that means they're not going to be--\n\nINGRAHAM: Why not leave?\n\nTRUMP: I'm not so bad with it. When I heard that I said I have it down to 5000 troops. We had many, many troops there in Iraq and we're there only in a training. We trained them. But if they'd want us to leave, but they speak different publicly than they do privately.\n\nINGRAHAM: But are we sending more troops to the region as we speak?\n\nTRUMP: We're sending more to Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is paying us for it. We're doing something that nobody has ever done. I said to Saudi Arabia, we have a very good relationship with Saudi Arabia, I said listen, you're a very rich country. You want more troops. I'm going to send them to you. But you've got to pay us. They're paying us. They've already deposited $1 billion in the bank. We are going to help them, but these rich countries have to pay for it. South Korea gave us $500 million. They never gave us - they gave us $500 million. I said you're going to help us along. We have 32,000 soldiers in South Korea protecting you from North Korea. You've got to pay. And they gave us $500 million. I mean you should have breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. I'm not sure anybody knows it. I might be sort of saying it, you have some - I mean its good stuff. But they are a wealthy country. They build all your television sets. They took that away from us. They build the ships. They build a lot of things. I said look, we're protecting you. You've got to pay. They paid us $500 million. They're going to pay us a lot more.\n\nINGRAHAM: Do you think that Iraq should repay the American taxpayer for these bases?\n\nTRUMP: Sure.\n\nINGRAHAM: For what we've done there.\n\nTRUMP: You heard that from me. OK.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes. Why don't we (ph).\n\nTRUMP: I said we built one of the world's most expensive airport facilities anywhere in the world. I mean I wish we had it in New York. I wish we had it in Washington. We build runways that are 15,000 feet long at LaGuardia, they're 7000 feet long. In fact, I think they're 20,000 feet long over there and deep thick concrete and steel. Nobody ever built runways like this. OK, it's way overbuilt, but that's OK. But we have billions of dollars into that. I said if we leave, you've got to pay us. If we leave, you have to pay us for embassies, you have to pay us for the money we put in.\n\nINGRAHAM: How you're going to collect.\n\nTRUMP: Well, we have a lot of their money right now. We have a lot of their money. We have $35 billion of their money right now sitting in an account. And I think they'll agree to pay. I think they'll agree to pay. Otherwise, we'll stay there.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Up ahead, my exclusive interview with President Trump continues. His thoughts on Nancy Pelosi's failed political gambit. The big news that the speaker is sending the articles to the Senate. And later, Raymond Arroyo reacts to the President's thoughts on the rogue royals and a lot more. Breaking news all ahead. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, we just learned that Nancy Pelosi is now, she's sending articles of impeachment next week to the Senate. What's your reaction?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think it's ridiculous. She should have sent them a long time ago. It just - it belittles the process. What they've done to impeachment. It's like I was interviewed by a very, very good writer, reporter somebody that you know very well. I can say Bob Woodward. He said, he's doing something and this time, I said maybe I'll sit down, because nobody has done more than me. I mean nobody - if you look at three years with the economy, with regulations, with the tax cuts, with everything, and all the things, we've rebuilt our military. Our military was totally depleted. Our military was old and depleted. And he said you know you don't look like somebody who's under impeachment, as you know he's slightly covered Nixon and he covered Clinton. But Bob Woodward, he said, you actually look like you've won everything, you look happy. I said, I am happy. So maybe I'm wired a little bit different.\n\nINGRAHAM: Impeachment managers anyone that you would prefer to see, she has a name--\n\nTRUMP: Well, we have a team.\n\nINGRAHAM: Her impeachment managers. They have a name--\n\nTRUMP: Well, I would love to ask a couple of their people some questions like Schiff, why did he lie? Why did he make up my statement? Totally made it up. But again, the whole thing unraveled when I put in the transcript because it's all about the transcript and it's all about the President of Ukraine saying, he did nothing.\n\nINGRAHAM: How long do you think this will last?\n\nTRUMP: Well, it depends. If they have a trial, probably takes a few days or a week and unless we want to have a bigger trial, where we bring in the whistleblower which I'd love to do, and I'd love to bring in the informer who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the second whistleblower who disappeared. I'd love to bring in the Inspector General. Why did he bring it up there? He should have never done it. He didn't want to see the call. He didn't want to see the call. He took this whistleblower, who's a fraud. He took the whistleblowers' report and he put it in. They said to him, no, if that's the case, if you have to do that, what we'll do is we'll show you the actual call. No, no, I don't want to see it. What's that all about? Why did he do that? Inspector General, so I'd like to interview the Inspector General. Why did he do that and put everybody through--\n\nINGRAHAM: You're worried about future presidents, what this is going to do to the presidency in the future?\n\nTRUMP: I think it cheapened the word impeachment. I think impeachment is a very ugly word, but I think this cheapen the word impeachment. I think Nancy Pelosi and Schiff, because he's corrupt. I mean he's the guy stands up at the United States Congress and repeats a conversation except it was a fraud. He made up a conversation. He was saying my conversation and it was totally wrong and he knew it. He said, don't call me, I'll call you. That's from the Godfather. That's a mafia statement. I never said that. He said eight times quid pro quo. It was no times. He made up a conversation and repeated it in front of Congress and because he has immunity, we can't do anything about it. I'd like to say, why did you do that? Now, these people are frauds and it's very bad. No, they've cheapened the word impeachment. It's a bad word to start off with. I really say, it's an ugly word. To me, it's a very ugly word, but maybe it played to our benefit.\n\nINGRAHAM: When we talk about impeachment now, it looks like McConnell is agreeing with Josh Holly's (ph)--\n\nTRUMP: Good.\n\nINGRAHAM: Proposition to dismiss these articles of impeachment, if Pelosi doesn't send them over. My question to you is, why not have it dismissed today? Why would McConnell just say, we're done with these games or do you want a trial, you want one?\n\nTRUMP: In many ways, I'd like a trial. And I'd love to have Sleepy Joe Biden. I'd love to have his son. I call him Where's Hunter, I've changed his first name to Where, Where's Hunter. I'd love to have the whistleblower who wrote a fake report. The whistleblower is a person that is you know who the whistleblower is. By the way, everybody knows who the whistleblower is.\n\nINGRAHAM: Whistleblower is still working in the White House?\n\nTRUMP: Everybody - I don't want to say. But everybody knows about the whistleblower and they know about the whistleblower's lawyer. But then, do you remember, there was a second whistleblower. I want to know what happened to the second whistleblower. What happened to the informer? Remember that an informer. They all disappeared when I gave the transcript because I gave a transcript and that blew everything apart, because we have an accurate. And if the only thing covered by the hearings was that now people agree. Everybody. Even our great Lieutenant Colonel, please call him Lieutenant Colonel or great Lieutenant Colonel agrees that the transcript was accurate. I think he had one word different. We'll change the one word, it meant absolutely nothing. The transcript was professionally done by the best people there. Just one second. So, we have a transcript. They never thought I'd release it. They probably never thought I had it. I can only say thank goodness they had it because otherwise I would have been falsely accused and it would have been sadly my word against them. But we had other people on that call. Think of this. I was going to do something wrong on a call where I know there are many people listening.\n\nINGRAHAM: Always.\n\nTRUMP: The President of Ukraine said, I did absolutely nothing wrong. He said, I had no pressure whatsoever. He didn't even know what we were talking about. And we called them before I released the transcript, because it's a terrible thing to have to release a conversation with a leader from another country, it's a terrible thing. I mean what are other countries other than Ukraine, what are they saying. So, anyway, they have no case.\n\nINGRAHAM: Why not call Bolton, why not allow him to testify. This thing is bogus.\n\nTRUMP: I would have no problem other than one thing. You can't be in the White House as President's future. I'm talking about future, many future presidents and have a security adviser. Anybody having to do with security and legal and other things.\n\nINGRAHAM: You're going to invoke Executive Privilege?\n\nTRUMP: Well, I think you have to for the sake of the office. I would love everybody to testify. I like Mick to testify. I like Mike Pompeo to testify. I like Rick Perry to testify. I want everybody, but there are things you can't do from the standpoint of Executive Privilege. You have to maintain that. So, we'll see where it all goes. But especially, a National Security Adviser, you can't have him explaining all of your statements about national security concerning Russia, China, North Korea, everything. We just can't do that. I think for the good of the office. Look, Nancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful Speaker of the House in the history of our nation. She has done nothing. The only thing she's done is she finally get done one of the best trade deals our country has ever made, the USMCA. That's with Mexico and Canada. But I did that. She doesn't even know what it says. She has no idea what it says. She was forced to do that. You know why? She wouldn't have done it, but she did nothing. So, now she can say, I signed something. She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst Speakers in the history of our country. Now, in all fairness, she's hurting our country. She's very bad for our country and she's become a crazed lunatic. But she will go down as I think maybe the worst Speaker in the history of our country.\n\nINGRAHAM: How do you get--\n\nTRUMP: And she'll be overthrown pretty soon, because she's doing very little. And the people are tired of it. And she's controlled by the radical Left. She's controlled by AOC. She's controlled by this Tlaib, it's another great one and she's controlled by Omar.\n\nINGRAHAM: We just heard that, they are thinking about adding another article on impeachment. They're floating this to include the events of the last few weeks. Here's what Chuck Schumer just said.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER (D-NY): Over the past few weeks, there have been several crucial disclosures of evidence that appear to further incriminate the President. Each disclosure bolstering the argument we Democrats have made for a trial that features the relevant witnesses and documents.\n\nINGRAHAM: Your reaction to their potentially adding to articles of impeachment. They still haven't delivered to the Senate floor.\n\nTRUMP: So, they can't win an election that's going to take place in 10 months. They know that and the only thing they can do, it's like quit there (ph). Congressman Green, when he said we can't beat him, we have to impeach him. And they all know that. They're making things up. This is the craziest thing anyone has ever seen. And the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes. They're not even allowed to be put in. It's a disgrace.\n\nINGRAHAM: Does it not show the weakness of their case, but they're still trying to rebrand this as something else?\n\nTRUMP: I think it's incredible.\n\nINGRAHAM: I've never seen anything like this. This is--\n\nTRUMP: I think it's incredible. I think it's really hurting them. Look, my numbers are the highest, my poll numbers. You have this guy that goes on television all the time. He gives phony numbers. My poll, as you know, my poll numbers right now today are the highest they've ever been. And, by the way, people love that we took this horrible terrorist. They love it, Soleimani. The love that we took him out. They think it's so fantastic. He should have been taken out over the last 20 years by somebody. He should have been taken out a long time ago. But my numbers are the highest they've ever been, and a lot of it is because of the impeachment hoax. It's a hoax. How would you like to be two, two-and-a-half years, I'm under investigation, federal investigation before I even ran, in my opinion, before I came down the escalator. But from the time I came down the escalator, I have been under investigation. They found nothing. They found nothing. Who else do you think in Washington --\n\nINGRAHAM: Few could have withstood it.\n\nTRUMP: No, no. Think of it, not only withstood it mentally. And I think --\n\nINGRAHAM: But accomplished.\n\nTRUMP: -- it actually energizes you, yes, because it makes me angry. But think, who else could have withstood that? You take some of these Democrat senators, they couldn't withstand it. You know what would happen? Number, one, they would fold up like an umbrella. And number two, they'd be guilty of a lot of stuff.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: More of my exclusive interview with President Trump in just moments. His thoughts on immigration, bringing in all those foreign workers, the economy, and whether he really trusts Google in the election year. Plus, a little later on, his thoughts on the latest royal scandal. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nAISHAH HASNIE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Live from America's News Headquarters, I'm Aishah Hasnie. Bernie Sanders leading in Iowa with the first nominating contest just weeks away. Twenty percent of likely Democratic caucus goers support the Vermont senators, that's according to the latest Des Moines Register/CNN poll. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is in second place with 17 percent, and former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg is third with 16 percent, and former V.P. Joe Biden has 15 percent. The Iowa caucuses are on February 3rd. Meantime, Texas is cracking down on new refugees. Governor Greg Abbott says his state is already overwhelmed and is now rejecting resettlements. It is the first state in the nation to do so under a Trump administration order granting local governments that authority. Abbott's decision is being denounced by refugee advocates and others. I'm Aishah Hasnie. Now back to The Ingraham Angle.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: You slapped the sanctions back on China, the tariffs, the extra tariffs, if they don't fulfill what they said they would do --\n\nTRUMP: Yes, well, I have the right to do that. But people don't realize, I still have the tariffs, 25 percent tariffs on China on $250 billion worth of goods. I still have those. And by the way, remember, they used to say we pay for it. No, no. China devalued their currency and they pay for it. And we have a great relationship with China right now. So I don't want to speak badly of anyone, but they are having the worst year that they've had. The last year was the worst year they've had in 67, it was 57, now it's 67 years. And they wanted to make a deal, and we made a deal. And it's a great deal. Now we have a phase two deal which will start at some point, but phase one was very important for banking. You know what we did, we opened it up to banking, but for banking, for our farmers, for manufacturers, it's a great, it's a great --\n\nINGRAHAM: If China, though, is --\n\nTRUMP: We have a lot of these deals that I've made, South Korea, Japan. Japan --\n\nINGRAHAM: Undocumented all of this. No one else has touched it.\n\nTRUMP: Remember this, they are all kicking in now. We didn't have anything. We had horrible deals or no deal. The Japan deal, we had no deal. We are getting $40 billion. What this is going to do for our economy is going to be amazing. And it was just signed a month ago, it's just now kicking in.\n\nINGRAHAM: On the human rights issue in China, you don't talk a lot about it, but it concerns a lot of your strongest supporters, evangelical Christians, Catholics, other people who are really concerned about human rights. You've got 1 million people in reeducation camps, internment camps, Catholics getting missiles in their pews at Christmas that had tributes to Xi instead of Silent Night, crazy stuff happening. Reagan saw the power of the moral argument for freedom and married it to the economic and military argument for peace through strength. Can you do more on that front without damaging your ability to make future trade agreements, more on the human rights front?\n\nTRUMP: Well, we're riding a fine line, because we are making not good trade deals. We're making great trade deals.\n\nINGRAHAM: But human rights count.\n\nTRUMP: They do count. And when you say Reagan, look, I was a big fan of Reagan, but he wasn't heavy into it. He wanted to do certain things, he wasn't really heavy into it. But he wasn't also making trade deals. He let Japan come in and take our automobile market. As much as I like Reagan, he was not good on trade.\n\nINGRAHAM: He didn't trade with the Soviet Union at all. We didn't have a big bunch of students from the Soviet Union coming into the United States.\n\nTRUMP: I think we should be able to trade with Russia. I think we should be able -- I think getting along -- by the way, getting along with Russia, now that the witch hunt has ended having to do with Russia, now that they spend $45 million, found nothing.\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President when you look at the trajectory of your administration, huge progress on trade, incredible progress on dealing with our political foes, ISIS, incredible deregulation, judges, you've done a lot. On the economy today, we found out that still added 146,000 jobs, unemployment historically low at 3.5 percent. But we do have a little bit of a stall out on wage growth, which you ran on, and we've seen some, 2.9 percent last year, 0.1 percent over the last month.\n\nTRUMP: I know.\n\nINGRAHAM: But we don't have a tight labor market. If we had a tight labor market, we'd be seeing real increases in wages. I hear that your team is planning on advocating more foreign workers coming in for some of these high-tech companies. I'm very concerned about that, as are a lot of your supporters.\n\nTRUMP: And so is Mark Levin a little bit.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, we are concerned, because Americans --\n\nTRUMP: So is the great Lou Dobbs. Lou Dobbs is concerned, too. But I'll say, Lou, here is the problem. I am demanding that Japan and all these countries that have these massive, we have trade deficits like nobody has ever seen before. I said you have to open up. I call Prime Minister Abe, he's a friend of mine. I say Shinzo, you have got to open up more plants in the United States. And they tell me, we want to do it, we want to do it. They start opening. They can't get labor. We need help. Otherwise, we could just say don't open up --\n\nINGRAHAM: If they couldn't get labor, wages would be going up. But wages aren't going up.\n\nTRUMP: Wage are going up.\n\nINGRAHAM: Not in the high-tech industry. We are seeing a plateauing of wages.\n\nTRUMP: It went up three percent and it went up 2.9 percent. In the last two year, wages have gone up more than they have 25 years.\n\nINGRAHAM: But for Google, why reward Google? Google is working against you in the campaign.\n\nTRUMP: I don't want to reward Google. I'm not a fan. I'm not a fan of Google.\n\nINGRAHAM: All they want is low skilled workers, low paid workers.\n\nTRUMP: I'm not a fan of Google. I'm a fan of great companies, OK.\n\nINGRAHAM: You did not run on bringing more foreign workers into the United States.\n\nTRUMP: It's not foreign workers. We have to allow smart people to stay in our country. Your graduate number one in your class at Harvard. You graduate from the Wharton Schools of --\n\nINGRAHAM: That's a small percentage of what they want.\n\nTRUMP: No, it's not. It's a lot.\n\nINGRAHAM: But you ran on people training their foreign replacements -- you ran against that. The Americans, it's humiliating for an American worked for a company for 30 years, now is told you have to train your foreign replacement, he's going to live in Korea, and you're going to pay him 20 percent.\n\nTRUMP: No, no, that's different. I would never do that. But we do need workers in our country. And I do want immigration policy. Nobody's been better on immigration then me. By the way we won the funding for the wall, and the wall has been built anyway because I was taking it out of the military and everything else. And now it's easier. We need people come. I got Foxconn to go into Wisconsin. They have to get people. They spent a fortune, they built the most incredible plant I've ever seen in Wisconsin, Foxconn --\n\nINGRAHAM: They why should we have American graduates of colleges and universities taking those jobs?\n\nTRUMP: We do. No, we do, we do, but we don't have enough of them. We don't have enough of them. And we have to be competitive with the rest of the world, too. The companies want to hire these people.\n\nINGRAHAM: They want to hear people they can hire for the cheapest amount because that's what they want.\n\nTRUMP: I'm not talking about cheap. I'm talking about brainpower. They want to hire smart people. And those people are thrown out of the country. We can't do that.\n\nINGRAHAM: You ran on America first.\n\nTRUMP: No, this is America first.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, I'm going to keep going.\n\nTRUMP: Excuse, I just have to finish this. If we tell smart people to get the hell out --\n\nINGRAHAM: That's not what we are saying.\n\nTRUMP: That's a bad thing.\n\nINGRAHAM: There is a never-ending appetite on the part of corporate America to bring in as much cheap labor as possible to drive down wages. That's going to happen.\n\nTRUMP: Laura, I have so many people coming into this country, you're not going to have to worry about it. It's always going to be a shortage. If somebody smart sitting in this position, we have so many companies coming in from Japan. Japan is doing many car companies. China now is going to start building a lot of things. They haven't been doing it too much. We have so many companies wanting to come in, and they don't have the labor. But they're coming in.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right.\n\nTRUMP: We're doing great. Our country is doing great, our economy is doing great.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: Coming up, the president on the Queen's Harry situation, and the news that the Olympics proposing to ban athletes' protests, politics particularly. Does he think that should happen here? Then our own Raymond Arroyo, will join me with reaction. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: Mr. President, I know you were close to the Queen, and she has a lot of affection for you. You have great visits over there.\n\nTRUMP: We have a great relationship.\n\nINGRAHAM: Would you be able to give her any advice for some of the rogue royals? What's happening there? It seems like there's a lot of tumult. And you've been so good at keeping your kids together in a close-knit family.\n\nTRUMP: I think it's sad. I do. I think it's sad. She is a great woman. I sat with her. I was supposed to be with her 15 minutes, I stayed an hour- and-a-half. By the way, I got killed by the press. She wanted me to stay. The press had no, no, he was supposed to be there, it's very rude. We had a great time. Then we had dinner. We were honored. Our country was honored. I sat with her for a long time, and she was smiling and laughing the whole time.\n\nINGRAHAM: Protocol is important for her. She has the tradition of the monarchy and the responsibilities.\n\nTRUMP: But we have a very great relationship. I think this was a blindside, she was blindsided by this whole situation, and I think it is too bad. But she has been, the Queen, it has to be an all-time record appeared. From the time she was 25, and now she's 94, she has never made a mistake, if you look. She's had like a flawless time.\n\nINGRAHAM: Do you think Harry should go back, come back and fix this?\n\nTRUMP: I think -- I don't want to get into the whole thing. But I find it, I just have such respect for the Queen, I don't think this should be happening to her.\n\nINGRAHAM: IOC announced today, and this is our final question, Mr. President, just announced that no politics at the upcoming Olympics, new policy, by any of the athletes. Would you like to see that extended to the United States where politics stay out of sports? I know you are going to the big LSU-Clemson game.\n\nTRUMP: I am, and I was responsible for getting the Olympics. The Olympics is coming to Los Angeles. And I was called by the mayor, and he said, could you do us a favor when I was president-elect. And he said, could you do us, and I worked very hard, and we got the Olympics. And we have the World Cup coming into the United States. And I don't know, I guess you can say no politics, but people are going to talk politics. I think politics -- I do believe I have made politics somewhat more exciting. The New York Times would be dead right now. It would be out of business.\n\nINGRAHAM: What are they going to do without you?\n\nTRUMP: The Washington Post would be out of business. I hate to say it, but cable television would be obsolete. Cable television would be out of business. So we'll go hopefully another five years, and we'll keep everybody happy. Thank you very much.\n\nINGRAHAM: Thank you so much. Fantastic.\n\nTRUMP: Thank you very much.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nINGRAHAM: President Trump offering his thoughts on the latest royal scandal across the pond, and banning political speech at the Olympics. FOX News contributor Raymond Arroyo is at the White House with me for this exclusive interview today. He joins us now. Raymond, I think Trump looked like he was in fighting form today. Look, no one sleeps, he doesn't sleep, I don't sleep, nobody sleeps, but he is unbelievably resilient.\n\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: He was on it, he was on it today. He was feisty, he had great humor. Laura, look, I always say his ability to greet opposition with a laugh and kind of diffuse people with that humor, that is a great quality to have in an office like this, particularly as you go into a campaign. He also went out of his way to take pictures with the entire team that was with us today. Unbelievable, really went out of his way. You made a lot of news in that interview lady. We learned that four embassies were targeted by Soleimani. For the first time he said the Iraqi government privately wants the U.S. to stay in their country. And he sounded off on Pelosi and the whole impeachment imbroglio. And for the first time, the president said he would invoke executive privilege to keep Bolton from testifying. Oh, and you and the president apparently our great sparring partner when it comes to Chinese and foreign workers coming into the country.\n\nINGRAHAM: Foreign workers. The thing that he also said which didn't get a lot of play, but people should take note of, when I pressed him about whether, why not our troops out of Iraq? That is what he ran on. I said, would you be OK with that? He said that I'd be OK with that, but that's not --\n\nARROYO: Privately that's not what he saying.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, he basically said I would be OK with that, but he's pulled in between.\n\nARROYO: Speaking of buts, I want to turn back to what the president said about Harry and Meghan Markle's royal temper tantrum.\n\nINGRAHAM: Megxit.\n\nARROYO: Or Megxit as they are calling it in the U.K. press. Madame Tussauds has separated Harry and Meghan, their wax works at least, from the rest of the royals at their --\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nARROYO: They cordoned them off. They went away, bye-bye. That is what you call a big step back. The royal family is holed up in emergency meetings with Harry while Meghan is already in Canada. Meanwhile, the president is sticking up for the Queen, and CNN, Laura, had the most incredible coverage of the day. In their telling him it was racism that forced Megharry away.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Let's talk about whether race has played a role in this royal feud.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Prince Harry, he has complained about how his wife has been treated, and he has specifically said part of it is because of racism.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think she should come to North America. We are much more welcoming. We will embrace you.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: You know, it was not raised that through these two away. It was rude that ticked the royal family off. This is the duke and duchess sucking up to the celebrities. That's all they've ever done. Oprah has come out to support them. But look, if you want to trade on your title, you have to live up to the office. And the royals are not just liberties. There are public functions and responsibilities. But my take on this is the Queen, as the president rightly said, 65 years on the throne, she has taken them to World War II, the Falklands, Diana, Brexit. Meghan Markle is hardly a challenge for this lady. She will survive and so will the royals.\n\nINGRAHAM: I think she is looking at this thing going oh, the petty squabbles of the youth.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nARROYO: But Laura, if they were racist, why would she let Harry marry her in the first place? They would have called the marriage off.\n\nINGRAHAM: Why would Khizr (ph) Khan be the mayor of London? I mean, this is just ridiculous. It has nothing to do with that, but this is all the left has. They were talking about the Situation Room photo from the night that the Iranians were lobbing those roman candles toward out military installations, and they said, look at the Situation Room photo. Not diverse enough. Only one woman, Stephanie Grisham, all white men in the room. So this is their focus, not whether America is better off or not.\n\nARROYO: Or that the best people are around the table who are experts in the field. We have got to go to the Olympic message of the president. You asked about the International Olympics Committee saying we don't want any political displays during these medal ceremonies. The president kind of dodged your answer dodged your question a little bit. But I like this idea. It allows us to come together, lets sports be a means of bringing people together. Don't divide people with your political messages. I would like to see in the United States, not only in the Olympics.\n\nINGRAHAM: I'd say shut up and compete. That is not as good as showed up and sing, shut up and compete.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nARROYO: Great job, congratulations on that.\n\nINGRAHAM: It was a lot of fun. It could have been a more -- every night there is something. Next week the trial is going to start the couple of days after Martin Luther King holiday. So that is going to start in earnest then.\n\nARROYO: And then the State of the Union. It's going to be a big year.\n\nINGRAHAM: And the Super Bowl, anything else. Raymond, thanks so much. Have a great weekend.\n\nARROYO: Thank you.\n\nINGRAHAM: My final thoughts on this amazing week when we return.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: What a week of shows. We had the breaking news on the missile strike on Tuesday. Then we had the secretary of state with us last night. And the president joining us for another exclusive tonight. And I'm telling you, the news shows no signs of slowing down next week because we expect the articles of impeachment to hit the Senate Tuesday or maybe Wednesday. And as always, we hope you join us right here for all of the breaking news, and the best analysis, and a little humor, you need that, too. So that's it from us tonight in Washington.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Politicians calling themselves Democratic socialists have made very-visible gains in the past year, with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez joining Congress on Thursday and Sen. Bernie Sanders becoming a party icon with the status to bring policies like Medicare-for-all into the mainstream.\n\nBut the trend goes well beyond those two, as polls show American voters across the country – in particular, young people and Democrats – increasingly warming to socialism over capitalism.\n\nThe shift is a recent phenomenon, and reflects a dimming view of capitalism more than anything.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBack in 2010, 68 percent of young people, 18-29 years old, said they approved of capitalism, while 51 percent said they approved of socialism, according to Gallup. Fast-forward to August 2018, and that same age group backs socialism over capitalism, 51 percent to 45 percent.\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, were evenly split between capitalism and socialism back in 2010. But now, 57 percent say they hold a positive view of socialism, compared with just 47 percent who say the same for capitalism.\n\nThe trend extends to high school students, according to a YouGov poll released in November, which found 14-17-year-olds split 50-50 on whether socialism or capitalism is better.\n\nAmericans as a whole, however, still prefer capitalism 56 percent to 37 percent.\n\nSOCIALISM RISING: DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION\n\nSo why the increase among some groups?\n\nPolling experts say Bernie Sanders' softer brand of Democratic socialism has sold well among young people partly because they have no personal memory of Soviet-style socialism.\n\nYoung people today do not remember the Cold War and thus don't associate socialism with an enemy of the United States, Emily Ekins, director of polling at the libertarian Cato Institute, told Fox News.\n\nSocialism historically has been linked to the Soviet Union's history imprisoning dissident voices in gulags, food shortages and economic stagnation. The Soviet Union went by the full name Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, or USSR.\n\nPart of the increase in support for socialism may also come from differing views over the meaning of the term.\n\nWhile Merriam Webster defines socialism as government ownership of production, and/or the abolition of private property – in line with how the word has been used historically – many Americans now think the word simply applies to the policies of prosperous nations with robust social safety nets like Denmark and Sweden.\n\nSanders himself seems to have changed his view about the meaning of socialism over the years. A young Sanders once praised violent socialist governments in Cuba and Nicaragua, but during his 2016 presidential campaign, he stated: When I talk about Democratic socialism, I'm not looking at Venezuela. I'm not looking at Cuba. I'm looking at countries like Denmark and Sweden.\n\nDenmark's prime minister at the time contradicted Sanders, saying: Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\n\nSince the 1980s, Denmark has in fact moved away from socialist policies. It privatized many industries, including a national phone system, an airport and railroads, and also deregulated many sectors.\n\nSpokesmen for Sanders, and the Democratic Socialists of America, did not respond to requests for comment for this report. But Sanders, when describing his philosophy, has often focused on the generous government programs and relative equality in countries like Denmark.\n\nWhat Democratic socialism is about is saying that it is immoral and wrong that the top 1/10th of 1 percent in this country ... own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent, Sanders told CNN's Anderson Cooper in a presidential debate.\n\nYou see every other major country providing health care to all people as a right except the U.S., Sanders added.\n\nExperts say it's generous welfare programs and wealth redistribution, rather than the official definition of socialism, that most American supporters endorse.\n\nThe good news is that people who say, 'Yes, I want socialism!' don't have a clue what they're saying, Tom Palmer, executive vice president at the Atlas Network who used to smuggle pro-freedom books into the Soviet Union, told Fox News.\n\nBut Palmer said he takes little relief from people's misunderstanding of the word: The bad news is that this is always true [that people don't know what socialism is really about] in every place where socialists take over and then utterly destroy the economy.\n\nWhile part of the rise in support for socialism may be due to generational miscommunication, another part is that younger people do tend to want bigger government.\n\nPutting aside the label of socialism, a 2017 Pew survey found that 57 percent of Americans 18-29 years old want a bigger government with more services, compared with just 38 percent of Americans 50-64, and 40 percent of Americans over 65.\n\nBut Ekins said opponents of a welfare state may not be squeezed out in the future, since young people tend to become less pro-government as they start working and paying taxes.\n\nAs evidence, she pointed to survey data from the late 80s. Then, Pew surveys found that 52 percent of baby boomers wanted more government, too – boomers now tend to oppose that. Generation X also moved in that direction as they aged.\n\nMany young people change their minds as they get older and take on more responsibility, Ekins said.\n\nIn the end, she said, people will have to discuss whether the U.S. can really afford a welfare state similar to the one in Denmark, without undermining human creativity, risk-taking, entrepreneurship ... or bankrupting the country.\n\nMaxim Lott is Executive Producer of Stossel TV and creator of ElectionBettingOdds.com.

Jayson Tatum scored 40 points and the Boston Celtics rolled to a 126-114 win over the Toronto Raptors on Monday night.\n\nPlaying without three of their top guards, the Celtics shook off a slow start to lead by as many as 26 in the second half. They shot 48.8% overall.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nTatum turned the game around with 21 points in the second quarter. He hit five 3-pointers on the night and converted all 13 free throws, finishing one point short of his career high set against New Orleans last January.\n\nDisappointed? No, Tatum shrugged. I'm going to get there soon enough.\n\nRookie guard Payton Pritchard had 23 points and eight assists in 32 minutes for the Celtics (5-3), and Jaylen Brown scored 19. Robert Williams III came off the bench to contribute 11 points and 15 rebounds.\n\nTatum was tremendous tonight but we had a lot of good performances, playing on a back-to-back with no excuses, Boston coach Brad Stevens said. We had a lot of guys out.\n\nPlaying in front of fans for the first time in 10 months was a refreshing change for Tatum. A maximum-allowed crowd of 3,740 attended the game in 19,000-seat Amalie Arena.\n\nIt felt great, he said. I missed playing in front of people. There were a lot of Boston people here. It felt different with people in the stands, but I enjoyed it.\n\nFred VanVleet led the Raptors (1-5) with 35 points and eight rebounds.\n\nVanVleet scored 14 in the first quarter and Toronto made seven of its first nine 3s to lead 28-15 through the first eight minutes. But the Raptors missed their next 13 tries from 3-point territory, and by the time VanVleet hit one with 7:24 left in the third quarter, they were down by 15.\n\nTatum took over late in the first half, scoring 13 points during an 18-2 Boston run. He finished the half with four straight free throws to put the Celtics up 61-46. They stretched the lead to 23 in the third quarter, and when Tatum went to the bench with five fouls with 9:52 left in the game, Boston led 109-83.\n\nThe Raptors, who have held double-digit leads in every game this season, shot 40% overall and finished 13 for 37 from behind the arc.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTIP-INS\n\nCeltics: Injuries to Marcus Smart (sprained right thumb) and Jeff Teague (sprained left ankle) depleted the backcourt. Kemba Walker is still recovering from a knee injury. ... Tremont Waters got his second NBA start at point guard. ... Boston had a 56-37 advantage in rebounds.\n\nRaptors: VanVleet tied C.J. Miles' franchise record of 38 consecutive games with a 3-pointer. ... Raptors coach Nick Nurse said 6-foot-6 Stanley Johnson will get more minutes because Toronto's smallish guards have been getting burned on defense. I can't keep putting out another small guard, Nurse said. Defense is mostly what we need. ... The Raptors entered as the worst shooting team (41.4%) in the NBA.\n\nNO HOME TEAM TO VISIT\n\nThe irony of playing on the road against a team playing 1,300 miles from its real home was not lost on Stevens, who didn't see an advantage nor a disadvantage to playing in Tampa. It is pretty interesting that the first time we're going to play in front of fans is down here in Florida, he said.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nCeltics: Conclude a four-game road trip Wednesday night at Miami in their first meeting since Sept. 27, when the Heat eliminated the Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals.\n\nRaptors: Open a four-game Western swing at Phoenix on Wednesday night.
President Trump ran in 2016 as a populist, not a conservative - and that's why he won. Populism is popular.\n\nAt its best, it's also positive, and that's what we argue for on this show. Positive populism - pro-worker, pro-family, pro-community. Those were the themes of my book, Positive Populism.\n\nBut President Trump needs to be careful. Some leading Democrats are trying to steal his winning populist message.\n\nSTEVE HILTON: MATTIS, KELLY MARCHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT BEAT. TRUMP WAS RIGHT TO FIRE THEM\n\nLook at Elizabeth Warren. Yes, it's easy to knock her on her dubious claim of Native American ancestry. But if you listen closely, she's basically running on the Trump message from 2016.\n\nThe populist bedrock of that platform was to make government deliver for working Americans, not the big donors and the big corporations. The focus was the middle class and working families -- and now that's Elizabeth Warren's focus, too.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL EPISODE\n\nBut the echoes go beyond the big picture. Look at what Warren said about Washington's corruption when she spoke in Iowa last week.\n\nWe need to change the rules in Washington, she said. Yes. It is about money in politics, it's about the influence of money. I have the biggest anti-corruption proposals since Watergate. Yes! How about we block the revolving door between Wall Street and Washington, you think?\n\nYes, great idea about the revolving door. But where have you heard that before? Oh, right - in 2016. Wasn't there something about draining the swamp, fighting big money, and yes, blocking the revolving door?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nAll of that money that's going to Hillary and Jeb and Scott and Marco and all of them - the people that are putting up that money – it's like puppets, Trump said back then.\n\nHe also proposed a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch and congressional officials and a lifetime ban on government officials lobbying for a foreign government.\n\nThat was unusual for a Republican candidate. And so was what Donald Trump said about student loan debt and health care. On student loans, he said, We will lower the cost of college and solve the student loan crisis. And he endorsed universal health care, saying in a TV interview, We're going to take care of everybody. I don't care if it costs me votes or not.\n\nWow. Cutting student debt. Health care that takes care of everybody. That 2016 candidate sounds uncannily similar to a certain 2020 candidate.\n\nI suppose imitation is the highest form of flattery. And Warren agrees with Trump on the need for infrastructure spending, too:\n\nWhat has happened to federal help for infrastructure? she has asked supporters. Where's all that new money that was promised for infrastructure that would help us in building more roads, that would help us building more mass transit? That would help us deal with the traffic congestion.\n\nGood question. What did happen to the infrastructure plan? But this political odd couple even seem to agree on trade and China.\n\nI'm going to instruct my treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator, the greatest in the world, Trump has said. Any country that devalues their currency in order to take unfair advantage of the United States and all of its companies who can't compete will face tariffs and taxes to stop the cheating.\n\nWarren has said the following on China: They looked the other way as China manipulated its currency to advance its own interests and undercut work done here in America … China has weaponized its economy without loosening its domestic political constraints.\n\nSounds like somebody went to Trump university!\n\nTo stop the Democrats from turning populism into their winning message in 2020, President Trump needs to reclaim the mantle - and he's got a perfect opportunity in just a couple of weeks' time.\n\nLook, we could go on and on – and we're certainly not endorsing Elizabeth Warren. In fact, many of her actual policies would be disastrous for working Americans.\n\nIt's also true that many of Donald Trump's populist promises have been delivered. The top of the list, of course, is jobs and the economy. The poverty rate is at its lowest point in a decade -- not by accident, but because of actual policy, like deregulation and tax cuts.\n\nOver 4 million jobs have been created since Donald Trump took office, with the lowest unemployment in half a century and earnings rising at the fastest rate in a decade. This is not by chance, but by policies that boosted business confidence and encouraged the hiring of American workers.\n\nAnd the clearest way of all in which President Trump has delivered his populist promise, for exactly the people he prioritized: the manufacturing industry has boomed after suffering for years. Over 400,000 manufacturing jobs have been created added under Trump, compared to a net loss of over 200,000 under Obama.\n\nLast year was America's best manufacturing performance since 1997 - since before China joined the World Trade Organization and sucked all those jobs away.\n\nBut beyond the economy, and despite the endless claims of the elitist establishment that the swamp is not being drained, the president did follow through there, as well. He signed an executive order banning administration officials from lobbying on behalf of a foreign government and put a five-year ban on executive branch officials lobbying the government after they leave office.\n\nTo stop the Democrats from turning populism into their winning message in 2020, President Trump needs to reclaim the mantle - and he's got a perfect opportunity in just a couple of weeks' time. Mr. President, here's how you can renew your populist revolution in your State of the Union address, with five positive promises that will help working Americans:\n\nOn jobs, fight the threat of automation by guaranteeing re-training for every worker who needs it. That means boosting your National Council for the American Worker, which helps prepare Americans for the needs of the future workforce. Under this effort, led by Ivanka Trump, over 100 companies have promised to re-skill a total of over 4.3 million workers. That's a great start but you can make much more of it. Give us that massive infrastructure program you promised. Make a pledge that by 2030, America, not China, will have the world's most modern systems for transportation, communication and energy. Rebuild America's struggling neighborhoods, too - whether urban, suburban or rural. You've already established a White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. You've got a plan for opportunity zones. These can be the vehicles for a real transformation that helps exactly the people who backed you in 2016 On health care, you promised to take care of everyone - and then the ideological nitwits in Congress took you off course. Trust your instincts. Work with Congress to deliver guaranteed health care for every American. Keep draining that swamp with a move that every American will cheer: Ban foreign government lobbying. Foreign governments have embassies they have ambassadors. Why the hell should they be allowed to use swampy lobbyists too? And why the hell should members of Congress and their staffs be allowed to deal with them?\n\nFive populist promises that will show you're putting working Americans first.\n\nDon't let Elizabeth Warren and the Democrats steal your winning message. We know that their brand of populism will set the country back. But Mr. President, you've got to show how your version can move America forward.\n\nAdapted from Steve Hilton's monologue from The Next Revolution on January 13, 2019.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM STEVE HILTON
South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told Fox News Sunday that he is hell-bent on ensuring that the next Supreme Court vacancy -- whether it is ailing Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat or otherwise -- is filled by a conservative, regardless of what outrage follows from the left.\n\nGraham, the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, emphasized that former Democratic Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid eliminated the Senate filibuster for federal appellate judicial nominees in 2013. Republicans later retaliated by eliminating the filibuster for Supreme Court appointments, meaning that a simple majority -- rather than a 60-vote supermajority -- is sufficient to confirm new Supreme Court nominees.\n\nMy Democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge we should confirm judges by a majority vote, Graham told Fox News' Chris Wallace. They changed the rules to accommodate President Obama. They tried to stack the court. They never thought [Hillary] Clinton would lose. So what you're gonna have is Harry Reid's and Chuck Schumer's desire to stack the court on their Democratic watch has come back to haunt them.\n\nGinsburg will miss next week's Supreme sessions and work from home, but her recovery from early-stage lung cancer surgery remains on track and no further treatment is needed, the court announced Friday. The 85-year-old's absence this past week from oral arguments -- her first since joining the bench -- after her surgery in December sparked speculation about a possible departure and led to low-key planning by the White House for that scenario.\n\nFollowing the contentious confirmation hearings of now-Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh, which were marked by a series of lurid, uncorroborated sexual misconduct allegations, Graham asserted that there would be pushback from the left regardless of whom Trump nominates.\n\nIf there is an opening, whether it's Ginsburg or anybody else, I will urge the president to nominate a qualified conservative and hopefully those people will get through – that person will get through, Graham continued. And I expect it to be along party lines, and this is what happens when you change the rules. This has come back to bite ' em. I predicted it would. And we'll see. I hope Justice Ginsburg serves for a long time. But if there's an opening on this court, I'm going to be hell-bent to put a conservative to replace whoever steps down for whatever reason.\n\nPressed by Wallace as to whether it was appropriate to nominate a conservative to replace a liberal icon like Ginsburg, Graham again said liberals have only Reid to blame -- and he suggested Kavanaugh's treatment meant that all bets are off.\n\nFURLOUGHED FEDERAL WORKERS, UNIONS MARCH ON WHITE HOUSE, AS MANY BEGIN APPLYING FOR UNEMPLOYMENT\n\nThey should've thought of that before they changed the rules, Graham responded. They tried to destroy conservative judges. I voted for [Sonia] Sotomayor and [Elena] Kagan, understanding what I was getting, so this decision by Reid and Schumer may come back to haunt them, but I am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee. And elections have consequences. The rules of the Senate were changed not by me, by them, and we had to do it on the Supreme Court because they would not give us any votes to nominate anybody. And Kavanaugh was a fine man, they tried to destroy him. All this is going to come back to haunt them one day.\n\nHe added: We don't need one Democrat to replace a liberal justice. And the reason that that's the case is because of what Harry Reid did. What he set in motion.\n\nSeparately, Graham asserted that President Trump is still ready and willing to make a deal with congressional Democrats to end the ongoing partial federal government shutdown, although the window is rapidly closing.\n\nGraham suggested that the White House would likely approve a compromise that extended protections afforded to Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients who fled natural disasters, in exchange for funding for Trump's proposed border wall.\n\nI just talked to him about thirty minutes ago -- he says, 'Let's make a deal,' Graham told host Chris Wallace. The plan is to do a deal. He is willing, in my view, to do wall-plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need, that's been done in the past -- see if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients. There's about 400,000. They're going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that.\n\nGraham added that Trump would be willing to offer work permits to recipients of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program for those brought to the U.S. illegally as children -- a compromise the White House had backed last summer. However, Graham noted, Trump's planned rescission of the DACA program is working its way through the appellate court process, as several federal judges have ruled that the White House violated federal administrative law by ending DACA without offering legally sufficient notice or justification. (The Trump administration has primarily argued that DACA was unconstitutionally enacted by Obama's unilateral order.)\n\nWH TELLS ARMY CORPS TO REVIEW POSSIBLE FUNDING SOURCES AFTER EMERGENCY DECLARATION\n\nThe DACA recipients, they're all tied up in court, but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable, if he could get wall funding. Graham said. I don't want to speak for the president. I don't want to lock him in. But I'm confident what I just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the White House and a lot of Democrats, and I'm just so frustrated we can't get in a room and hammer it out.\n\nGraham on Friday urged Trump to invoke his presidential emergency powers to immediately begin construction of the wall without congressional approval. The White House last week directed the Army Corps of Engineers to look at possible ways of funding border security, including potentially through the reallocation of unspent disaster relief funds, in a possible sign the administration is moving in that direction.\n\nWhat's [Trump] supposed to do, just give in? He's not gonna give in. — South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham\n\nThe South Carolina senator told Wallace he's not worried about Democrats similarly invoking a state of emergency to bypass Congress, both because they would have a weaker legislative argument and because Republicans would likely be more willing to compromise to achieve a compromise solution.\n\nChallenged by Wallace for his criticism of President Obama's use of executive authority to enact DACA as presidential overreach, Graham responded that no emergency was declared to enact DACA. Should the White House move forward with an emergency declaration, it has a handful of legal routes to take. The National Emergencies Act grants the president broad authority to declare emergencies, and several federal laws then could clear a path for the White House to move ahead with building a wall.\n\nOne statute, 33 U.S. Code § 2293 - Reprogramming during national emergencies, permits the president to apply the resources of the Department of the Army's civil works program, including funds, personnel, and equipment, to construct or assist in the construction, operation, maintenance, and repair of authorized civil works, military construction, and civil defense projects that are essential to the national defense.\n\nAnother law, 10 U.S. Code § 2808 - Construction authority in the event of a declaration of war or national emergency, permits the secretary of defense, in a presidentially declared emergency, to use funds that have been appropriated for military construction for the purpose of undertaking military construction projects.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGraham said reasonable Democrats -- including Delaware Democratic Sen. Chris Coons, who spoke to Wallace later on Fox News Sunday and suggested he is open to negotiation on the border wall -- would be willing to make a deal without forcing Trump to use those emergency powers. (I agree with the advice that Lindsey Graham just gave to the President which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on, Coons said. I personally don't think that a border wall is .... immoral.)\n\nBut, Graham said, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- who has called the wall an immorality -- has unreasonably cut off negotiations by saying she would not give more than one dollar to Trump's wall under any circumstances.\n\nEvery Democrat that I've worked with for about 10 years now has agreed to funding for barriers/walls on Obama's watch, on Bush's watch, and all of a sudden it's a bad thing on Trump's watch, Graham told Wallace. What's [Trump] supposed to do, just give in? He's not gonna give in.\n\nGraham concluded with his own possible last-minute fix to the partial federal government shutdown, which became the longest in the nation's history on Wednesday.\n\nI would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, Graham said. See if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off. See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation. But I think the legislative path is just about shut off because Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said 'Even if you open up the government, I'll give you one dollar for the wall.' As long as that's the case, we're never gonna get a legislative package, no matter what the Senate does.
Spun.\n\nSome guy with a mullet and loud voice had lobbed that one word my way.\n\nIn all his 1989 wisdom, he had flicked his feathered hair back and snorted over a soggy cheeseburger in our hick town high school cafeteria and said:\n\nYeah, that girl is right spun.\n\n2019 dawns here now.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ ANN VOSKAMP: TELL YOURSELF THIS WHEN YOU FEEL FORGOTTEN AND INVISIBLE AND UNIMPORTANT\n\nAnd it turns out that the prophet with the mullet has a point: I'm sorta spun– spun out by kids, by demands, by needs, by life.\n\nThe calendar fills like a pothole in a torrential gulley washer of a downpour. The laundry basket keeps overflowing – ok, flooding – the mudroom. There are the shelves spilling and the fridge emptying and the stove burning. And somewhere, there are people who can make New Year's resolutions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhat if you just want your New Year's Resolutions to be about One Revolution?\n\nWhat if you just want to make one turn in a spinning world and find the certain equilibrium of center again?\n\nOn the third day of a new year, I can see it in the middle of a messy table – what's sitting there small and still at the center of the Advent wreath, the center of everything spiraling and spinning:\n\nThe Life Line of Jesus.\n\nEven our calendars circle around this theology of time:\n\nThanksgiving, eucharisteo, always, always, precedes the miracle – and Thanksgiving always precedes Christmas, the miracle that Jesus comes, and right into our mess. And Christmas must precede the New Year, God with us – or our messes would have no hope for a new year, no hope for anything being made new.\n\nI pick up the Jesus at the centre, turn the smallness of Him over in my hands… I hold the memory, the seed.\n\nAnd the wonder Christmas whispers it right into the pragmatism of my New Year:\n\nIs Jesus merely useful for your life – or is He ultimately the most beautiful in your life?\n\nThe most important skill to have in 2019 is paying attention to Jesus – nothing else is worth spending your one beautiful year on. And the soul solution that we really need is preaching Jesus to ourselves.\n\nWhen Jesus is merely useful to me, I'm looking for a genie in a bottle, to give me the life I want.\n\nWhen Jesus is ultimately beautiful to me, I'm looking for His face in my life, to give Him the love I feel.\n\nWhen Jesus is merely useful to me, I want Him to move my world.\n\nWhen Jesus is ultimately beautiful to me, it's my heart that is moved – and this begins to change the world.\n\nWhen I see Jesus as useful, He's a gadget to make my life better. When I see Jesus as beautiful, He's a joy that makes my heart sing louder….\n\nAm I a Jesus-user?\n\nOr a Jesus-adorer?\n\nI turn that nativity Jesus over again and again in my hands. How do we stop being a bunch of Jesus-users? When did Jesus become more about business-like benefits to us instead of The Beautiful who calls us Beloved? The lights are still serenading in the tree.\n\nAnd I wrap my fingers around that nativity in my hand.\n\nLooking for the beauty of Christ in the everyday isn't some quaint exercise in poetry. It's a critical exercise in not being dead -- of being resurrected.\n\nYour new life, which is your real life, …. is with Christ.\n\nHe is your life.\n\nWhen Christ (your real life, remember) shows up again on this earth, you'll show up, too—the real you, the glorious you… ~ Colossians 3 MSG.\n\nIn a new year, the only hope of a new me, is only Christ in me.\n\nThe most important life skill to have in 2019 is to live aware that Jesus is the only life we have.\n\nNothing will happen this year apart from Him. Nothing will be remade, nothing will be transformed, nothing will be satisfying apart from Him. Jesus is the only life I have. His shed blood is the only blood I have. His given heart is the only heart I have.\n\nWhen your new year is about revolving around Jesus – you have everything you need for every other resolution. His identity is the only real identity I have.\n\nThe most important skill to have in 2019 is paying attention to Jesus – nothing else is worth spending your one beautiful year on. And the soul solution that we really need is preaching Jesus to ourselves.\n\nI sweep needles out from under the Christmas tree, and it's like finding the needle in the haystack, finding what I need for a new year. It's all getting simpler:\n\nJust be with Jesus.\n\nListen to Jesus. Rest in Jesus.\n\nWait for Jesus. Be Loved by Jesus. Wonder over Jesus. Live through Jesus.\n\nWhen who Jesus is overwhelms you – nothing that happens can overcome you.\n\nSteep your soul in Jesus and nothing is too steep to overcome.\n\nMaybe that fresh white canvas of 365 days that I am terrified to ruin?\n\nThe commitments, the kids, that I fear I am going to fail? The impossible mountains that lie ahead of me?\n\nIt was like the Father hushing all my fears as I stepped into a new year:\n\nDo you not realize that Christ Jesus is in you? 2 Corinthians 13:5\n\nMount Everest in front of you? But Christ Jesus is in you!\n\nThe wilderness stretched before you? But Christ Jesus is in you!\n\nThe Red Sea staring like a wall ahead of you? But Christ Jesus is in you!\n\nWhen your new year is about revolving around Jesus – you have everything you need for every other resolution.\n\nEverything boils down to one plan, one word, one commitment, just to keep whispering this over & over again: Jesus.\n\nTime with Him, keeping company with Him, walking with Him, resting in Him, living in Him, growing in Him, changing in Him, becoming like Him.\n\nJust –\n\nJesus.\n\nNo Additives.\n\nPure Grace.\n\nAll you need.\n\nWhen I long for nothing else, desire nothing else, hope for nothing else, but Jesus – I have everything I ever hoped for.\n\nThis isn't Sunday School cliché – this is real world oxygen. Try standing at a grave without Him. Try walking out of the doctor's office without Him. Try picking through the minefield of life without clinging to Him. Try it – who knows how 2019 could explode?\n\nJesus is not only our only way back to truly finding God – He is our only way back to truly finding ourselves.\n\nSo on the third day of the New Year, I wear His name on my wrist to remind me who I am. I pray His name gets pressed right into my paper thin skin. I pray I get branded. Marked. I don't know what else a new year needs: Intimacy with Jesus results in ultimately being like Him.\n\nWhat had Ignatius said?\n\nMy dear Jesus, is so deeply written in my heart, that if my heart were to be cut open and chopped to pieces, the name of Jesus would be found written on every piece.\n\nThat. The world can wax loud. The world can go ahead and explode. Just give me that – Let the name of Jesus be written so deep into me that my heart could explode and His name would be found on every shard.\n\nAll there is to see is Jesus.\n\nFor others to see Jesus in me. For me to see Jesus in others. All there is to be is Jesus.\n\nFor everyone, the call is to be Jesus. And to respond to Jesus in everyone.\n\nAll there is to mirror Jesus. Mirror to everyone the face of Jesus… And see everyone as mirroring the face of Jesus.\n\nWhatever you do or say, do it as a representative o fthe Lord Jesus... Col. 3:17\n\nWhatever you do, work willingly, as though you were working for the Lord Jesus…Col. 3:24\n\nThe New Year just got ultra-simplified:\n\nDo everything as Jesus.\n\nDo everything to Jesus.\n\n8 words.\n\nAnd the grace to actually do the everything?\n\nJust One Word: Jesus.\n\nThe world – the year – could spin...\n\nand even if it spun like it might explode...\n\nthe year has His love holding us like an anchor at the center – and we're all held....\n\nThe column was originally published on Ann Voskamp's blog, annvoskamp.com.
Kyrie Irving scored 20 of his 29 points in the first half to lead the undermanned Brooklyn Nets to a 130-96 win over the Utah Jazz on Tuesday night.\n\nBrooklyn, which entered the game having lost two straight and four of five, never trailed. The Nets led 35-14 after the first quarter and 63-44 at halftime. Brooklyn's 19-point halftime lead was its biggest in about 10 months. In the Nets' 139-120 win over San Antonio on Mar. 6, 2020, they had a 21-point (75-54) halftime lead.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nIrving was a prime factor in the Nets' first-half attack, scoring 18 points in the first quarter and 20 by halftime. Irving's 18 first-quarter points were the third-most scored by an player on any team in an opening quarter this season. His 20 first-half points marked the fifth time this season he had that many in an opening half.\n\n(Irving is) going to score, Bruce Brown said. He was hot. ... Kyrie just went crazy today.\n\nAs brilliant as he was individually, Irving had help from Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert.\n\nAllen recorded his third double-double of the season with 19 points and 18 rebounds.\n\nAllen credited a change of his pregame meal from pasta with pesto sauce to pasta with alfredo sauce for his season high in points and rebounds.\n\nI think that was the thing that turned my game on tonight, Allen said with a grin.\n\nLeVert came off the bench to score 24 points off the bench. Joe Harris chipped in with 10 points.\n\nIt's really satisfying, LeVert said.\n\nThe Nets did not let up in the second half as they cruised to their fourth win in eight games this season. A sequence in the final 1:34 of the third quarter all but put the game away. It began with an Allen alley-oop dunk off a feed by LeVert, followed by a jumper by LeVert, a breakaway layup for the Nets' sixth man, and Brooklyn's young big man buzzer-beating putback. In that stretch, Brooklyn extended its lead from 92-70 to 98-73.\n\nDonovan Mitchell led Utah (4-3) with game-high 31 points. Jordan Clarkson added 12, and Rudy Gobert and Royce O'Neale had 10 each for the Jazz, whose two-game winning steak was snapped.\n\nWe didn't come out ready for their pressure, Mitchell said.

Before the game, first-year coach Steve Nash said the length of the quarantine is kind of a moving target. Nash did add that he didn't think Durant would be able to participate in on-court activity this week.\n\nDurant, who was replaced in the starting lineup by Taurean Prince, is averaging 28.2 points, which leads the Nets and ranks fifth in the NBA. He is also averaging seven rebounds and 4.8 assists, and had played in six of Brooklyn's first seven games prior to Tuesday night after missing all of 2019-20 recuperating from a ruptured right Achilles tendon.\n\nJAZZ: In light of a report from ESPN which said seven seven members of the Los Angeles Clippers' support staff are quarantining due to a positive COVID-19 test following the Jazz' 106-100 win on New Year's Day, Utah coach Quin Snyder expects outbreaks of the virus will challenge all of the league's teams.\n\nWe've gone through similar things and I'm sure everybody will at some point this this season, Snyder said.

But at the end of the day, I've got to educate myself and I've got to inform myself even more.\n\nThe chaos at the U.S. Capitol led to four deaths and more than a dozen arrests.\n\nWisconsin officials' decision in the Blake shooting came Tuesday.\n\nThe officer who fired at Blake, Rusten Sheskey, 31, and the other officers will not be charged, Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley said. He said the decision was based on evidence that was not captured on widely shared cellphone footage of the Aug. 23 shooting.\n\nCELTICS, HEAT CONTEMPLATE BOYCOTTING GAME, RELEASE JOINT STATEMENT AMID US CAPITOL CHAOS\n\nGraveley said Blake, 29, was armed with a knife that was not visible in the video footage and admitted to having one during the incident. Statements that he was unarmed contradict what Blake, who had an active felony warrant for his arrest at the time of the shooting, told authorities, he said.\n\nSheskey, who is White, shot Blake, who is Black, while responding to a domestic disturbance. A woman had called 911 saying Blake refused to return keys to a rental car. Video footage of the incident captured Blake walking away from the officer and around a vehicle with his children inside, then he is shot seven times.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGraveley also declined to charge the two officers at the scene, Brittany Meronek and Vincent Arenas. The shooting left Blake paralyzed and sparked protests that devolved into riots over several nights. The unrest included two fatal shootings, arson, and the destruction of property.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has signed a gun rights bill that eliminates a person's duty to retreat before using force, despite previously voicing concerns that some lawmakers were ignoring legislation that he proposed following the 2019 mass shooting in Dayton.\n\nThe Republican governor's most recent measure, which was signed Monday, expands the so-called stand your ground right from an individual's house and car to any place, if that person is in a place in which the person lawfully has a right to be, the legislation states.\n\nHe said he signed the bill in the spirit of cooperation with the General Assembly, but had hinted as recently as December that he might veto the bill.\n\nGOP CONGRESSWOMAN BOEBERT DEFENDS DECISION TO CARRY GUN IN DC: 'I AM MY OWN SECURITY'\n\nI have always believed that it is vital that law-abiding citizens have the right to legally protect themselves when confronted with a life-threatening situation. While campaigning for Governor, I expressed my support for removing the ambiguity in Ohio's self-defense law … that is why I have signed this bill today, he said in a statement shared Monday on Twitter.\n\nHe added: I am very disappointed, however, that the legislature did not include in this bill the essential provisions that I proposed to make it harder for dangerous criminals to illegally possess and use guns.\n\nFor over a year, DeWine had called for measures that would toughen background checks and boost penalties for felons committing new crimes with guns.\n\nNRA, GUN-RIGHTS ADVOCATES HAIL ATF WITHDRAWAL OF PLANNED GUIDANCE ON PISTOL-STABILIZING BRACES\n\nThe governor has pushed these proposals since the Aug. 4, 2019, Dayton massacre that killed nine and wounded more than two dozen.\n\nNan Whaley, the Democratic mayor of Dayton and a sometimes ally of the governor, said she couldn't express my level of disappointment and accused him of giving in to extremists in his own party. Shortly after the Dayton shooting, she and DeWine pledged to work together on a bipartisan effort to change gun laws.\n\nOhio becomes the 36th state with a similar measure, officials told the Associated Press.\n\nOur state needs principled leaders who will stand up for what is right — not what is politically easy, Whaley tweeted.\n\nThe Buckeye Firearms Association praised the move, saying DeWine kept multiple promises, both publicly and privately with the association, to sign the bill.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe're very pleased the governor kept his promise to sign the repeal of Ohio's duty-to-retreat law that forces victims of violent crime to retreat before they're legally able to defend themselves, said Dan Rieck, the group's executive director.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer vowed to call for a $22 hourly minimum wage if he wins his longshot bid to unseat incumbent President Trump in November.\n\nSteyer, a billionaire who founded investment company Farallon Capital Management in 1986 and sold it in 2012, is campaigning heavily on addressing climate change.\n\nHe made the announcement during a campaign block party on Sunday while campaigning in South Carolina, according to The Associated Press. Progressive candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have released competing plans to hike the minimum wage to $15 per hour.\n\nSANDERS, BUTTIGIEG ARE WINNING THE 2020 CAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING RACE\n\nThe federal minimum wage rate has remained at $7.25 per hour for the past decade, though 29 states and Washington have set it higher. (At the beginning of January, more than 20 states raised base pay even higher). The annual earnings for a full-time minimum-wage worker are $15,080, which is slightly above the federal poverty line for one person.\n\nAccording to a Congressional Budget Office report published in July 2019, increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour could result in 1.3 million workers losing their jobs.

Real income is also reduced for nearly all people because increases in the prices of goods and services weaken families' purchasing power. Over time, as businesses increasingly pass their higher costs on to consumers, the losses in business income diminish and the losses in families' real income grow.\n\nOver the past seven months, Steyer has poured $14 million into blanketing South Carolina's airwaves with ads -- a strategy that's beginning to take hold.

Sanders is a close third.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE

But one of the best things about America's pastime is that the season is long.\n\n\n\nWhichever team you like is today in contention for the World Series. We are still six weeks from the start of spring training, but it will still be true in May and, for most of the teams, all the way until the All Star break, halfway through the season.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic nominating process for 2020 is going to be a great deal like that.\n\n\n\nYou will find below our first list of contenders for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination. There are 35 individuals who have at least expressed interest in running. Some have already filed papers, some have set deadlines for themselves, while others seem more likely to be just musing in the media.\n\n\n\nWe don't care… yet. For now, you just need to be a person who can credibly campaign and at least be considering a run.\n\n\n\nEven with those relatively permissive standards, 35 people is a huge field. It is a result of not only a pretty considerable amount of talent on the Democratic bench but also the fact that the Democrats believe President Trump is eminently beatable in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe incumbent's current condition – fighting with his own party over foreign policy, presiding over a government shutdown and still smarting from the spanking he took in 2018 – leads Democrats to think that almost anybody would have a chance in 2020.\n\n\n\nWe think Democrats generally are underestimating the potential for Trump's re-election. But there's no denying that the party's nomination is viewed as a prize of great value.\n\n\n\nThe names you see listed below are grouped here by their offices or careers. This is only useful here in the very early going when we are still five months away from the first debate. As we progress, new lanes and groupings will emerge based on the ideologies, personal traits, electoral strategy and attitudes of the candidates. But for now, job description will be enough.\n\n\n\nThis list is very much subject to change as candidates drop in, drop out, or otherwise disqualify themselves. But at the beginning of this long season, here's your starting roster:\n\n\n\nOBAMA CABINET\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden - Former Attorney General Eric Holder - Former Secretary of State John Kerry - Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro\n\n\n\nThere is already enormous nostalgia among Democrats for the Obama presidency and that is only going to increase. While Democrats may have grumbled about Obama's lack of fire or ineffectiveness, almost all of his initial luster has been restored by the mellowing effects of memory.\n\n\n\nBiden or another of Obama's acolytes may find success running as James Polk did in 1844, which was to seal and complete the vision of a past hero of the party. Andrew Jackson may have led the revolution that changed American politics, but it was Polk who cemented those gains in the most material ways.\n\n\n\nWe don't know what an Obama Democrat really is since his rise was a singular phenomenon rather than a movement. It may be only now, without the presence of his longtime rival, Hillary Clinton, that the Democrats get down to defining what that means.\n\n\n\nGOVERNORS\n\nFormer Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper - Washington Governor Jay Inslee - Montana Governor Steve Bullock - Former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe - Former Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley\n\n\n\nConventional wisdom holds that Republicans are more likely to nominate governors than are Democrats, but there's not a lot of evidence to support the claim. Yes, George W. Bush and Ronald Reagan both fit the model of big-state executives going national, but out of the 19 Republicans who have held the highest office only six were former governors. Of the 15 Democratic presidents seven, including two of the most consequential, Franklin Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, were former governors.\n\n\n\nMaybe it was just because Republicans nominated Thomas Dewey so often that it seemed like more…\n\n\n\nThat being said, any of the governors on this list would have to win as dark horse candidates. Hickenlooper, a moderate and successful businessman, has been nosing around a run longer than the rest, but is still a relative unknown inside his party.\n\n\n\nInslee is even less well known but does have an angle: If he runs it will be as the climate change candidate in the race. That would speak to a considerable portion of the Democratic electorate.\n\n\n\nSENATORS\n\nVermont Senator Bernie Sanders - Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren - California Senator Kamala Harris - New Jersey Senator Cory Booker - Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar - Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown - Colorado Senator Michael Bennet - New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand - Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley - Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey - Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy\n\n\n\nYou know the old Washington joke: What do all 100 members of the Senate see every morning when they look in the mirror? The next president of the United States.\n\n\n\nIt's crazy to think that 11 sitting senators will all compete for the Democratic nomination, and that's because it's not going to happen. You sometimes get the sense with senators that they say they're interested because it would be too embarrassing to say otherwise. If everybody else has an exploratory committee, why not you?\n\n\n\nEven so, there will be at least four serious contenders in the Senate that will make life much harder for Sen. Chuck Schumer as he tries to overcome his members' personal ambition for the good of the party overall.\n\n\n\nIt seems pretty clear that 2016 runner-up Sanders will be plowing the same ground as Warren who is doing her best to simulate gusto in her now-official candidacy.\n\n\n\nSo it seems for Harris and Booker, as well. The two of them were already jousting during the televised spectacle of the most recent Supreme Court confirmation hearings, trying to be the most woke and most brutal in their performances. Harris got the better of Booker then and, we expect, will be in good position to do so again.\n\n\n\nShe is particularly helped by the emergence of her home state as an early primary. California Democrats will go to the polls on March 3rd as opposed to June, their traditional primary month. That puts the largest trove of Democratic delegates up for grabs four weeks after the Iowa Caucuses. If you can't play in California this time around, you can't play at all.\n\n\n\nREPRESENTATIVES\n\nTexas Representative Beto O'Rourke - Ohio Representative Tim Ryan - Former Maryland Representative John Delaney - California Representative Eric Swalwell - Hawaii Representative Tulsi Gabbard\n\n\n\nIt's safe to say that House members don't have a great track record in presidential campaigns. Only two members of the House who never attained higher office have won the presidency: James Garfield and Abraham Lincoln.\n\n\n\nSo maybe what they lack in number is compensated for by quality. But it's certainly not the typical path.\n\n\n\nGiven the decreasing emphasis on candidate qualifications and the increasing ability for campaigns to speak directly to voters on a national scale, however, this could be the cycle. Certainly, O'Rourke's strong second in bright-red Texas gives him something to talk about.\n\n\n\nAs for the others, they better find a way to get famous pretty quick.\n\n\n\nMAYORS\n\nFormer New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg - Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti - Former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu - South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n\n\n\nNever in American history has anyone gone directly from the mayor's office to the White House. But then again, America never had a reality show host win the presidency before.\n\n\n\nThat conundrum will confront Democratic kingmakers again and again as they try to whittle down this massive field. If Trump, who had no experience in public service, can win why not someone with a lengthy background even if it's not on a national level?\n\n\n\nBloomberg seems to be the only one who can make an argument for top-tier status thanks to his famous name, ability to fund his own campaign and track record as an advocate for gun control. As a party switcher and mega-rich white dude he will have a long way to go to answer concerns from Democratic loyalists, but if he's serious about running after a decade of false starts, he could be a contender.\n\n\n\nBILLIONAIRES\n\nHedge fund manager Tom Steyer - Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\n\n\n\nIf the Trump administration is the beginning of a real oligarchy in the American presidency, Democrats don't want to miss the boat. They have two potential candidates with zero record of accomplishment in public service but lots and lots and lots of money.\n\n\n\nWhile Schultz's efforts so far have looked more like an identity crisis than a real candidacy, Steyer is a serious player. He spent much of the past two years generating a list of potential supporters through an impeachment petition he lavishly advertised on television. He also established credibility with liberal activists by funding insurgent candidates like Andrew Gillum in Florida.\n\n\n\nSteyer's longstanding efforts on climate change help, too. Whether that's enough to overcome Democratic aversion to nominating a white, Episcopalian hedge fund manager we don't know.\n\n\n\nCOULD BE\n\nFormer first lady Michelle Obama - Former New York Senator Hillary Clinton - Media mogul Oprah Winfrey - Actor Dwayne The Rock Johnson\n\n\n\nWe know, we know… They've said they're not running or at least tried to pour cold water on such speculation. We also know, however, these folks have big enough names, deep enough pockets and strong enough support among Democratic primary voters that they could still do it if they wanted to.\n\n\n\nThese could be candidates are limited to those who could make the run without a lengthy warm up. Every candidate likes to imagine that they could skip the coming 12-month endurance challenge, but only name brands could really do that.\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

We learned last month that my colleague Rep. Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat, had a friendly relationship for years with a Chinese spy. The Chinese Communist Party official funneled cash to Swalwell's campaign and even influenced hiring decisions in his congressional office.\n\nCongressman Swalwell sits on the House Intelligence Committee and had weekly access to highly-sensitive, classified material as a result.\n\nYet, he won't lose access to this information because members of Congress are far too often treated as a special political class, exempt from the rules that apply to the rest of our country. In this case, members of Congress are granted access to classified material without needing to go through the extensive security clearance process used to determine access to classified information that every civilian and member of the military goes through.\n\nThis is wrong and needs to change.\n\nMCCARTHY LAYS INTO PELOSI, CLAIMS DEMOCRATS AREN'T AWARE OF WHAT AMERICANS NEED\n\nWhen I was in the military, I had a TS-SCI and Q security clearance.\n\nTo obtain my clearance, I was interviewed and that including being asked psychological questions, allegiance questions, drug-use questions, lifestyle questions and even submitting to polygraphs in some cases.\n\nThen, my family and a person I knew at every single place I had lived, worked or attended school was interviewed to verify that the biography I provided was accurate.\n\nNext, these people gave the investigator names of people I knew whose names I did not provide so that they could also be interviewed.\n\nMy finances, bank records and more were also scrutinized.\n\nAs a member of Congress and former member of the military, I know from firsthand experience there is a big difference between being elected and being vetted to safeguard sensitive information.\n\nAs a result, I believe all members of Congress should be required to obtain a security clearance that can be taken away if they violate the public trust.\n\nTAMMY BRUCE SLAMS HOUSE DEMS' 'OBSCENELY MARXIST' DECISION TO REPLACE GENDERED LANGUAGE\n\nI put forward this proposal to be included in the rules package for the House of Representatives this week, which are the procedures that the House of Representatives will operate by for the next two years. Apparently to defend Rep. Swalwell and other members who leak information to their allies in the liberal media, Speaker Nancy Pelosi blocked my amendment.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi's dedication to protecting those who leak classified information is even more abhorrent when you consider what was included in the rules package:\n\nFirst, she included a provision striking so-called gendered language from the rules of the House of Representatives. This includes removing words she deems offensive such as mother, father, son and daughter—essentially restricting the House of Representatives from using these descriptions. This is yet another step toward forcing their radical, condescending, repressive and discriminatory views on all of us.\n\nPELOSI'S NEW HOUSE RULES ARE GENDER-NEUTRAL, CURTAIL GOP'S ABILITY TO FORCE 'GOTCHA' VOTES\n\nSecond, she further consolidated her own power by eliminating a vital tool used by the minority party to ensure the American people are represented.\n\nFor more than a century, the House rules have provided the minority with one last chance to make their voices heard before a bill is passed by introducing amendments to the final text and guaranteeing a vote on those amendments. Under this rules package, this safeguard—called the Motion To Recommit—has been eliminated.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi is not stopping there. A third provision in the rules package codifies censorship over members of the House, subjecting them to disciplinary action if they post or share information deemed to be distorted or manipulated.\n\nThe question, of course, is deemed by who?\n\nThe tech giants so eager to assert control over what is allowed to be shared don't have a great track record when it comes to deciding what information is accurate.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the November election, for example, Twitter banned the account of the New York Post for a story discussing an investigation into Hunter Biden even though the Department of Justice later confirmed the investigation was taking place. This rule change will hand Democrats and their allies in Silicon Valley another weapon to wield against Republicans whose opinions they dislike.\n\nThese are just a few examples of many that show a clear trend: Speaker Pelosi is more interested in maintaining her position atop the Washington, D.C. political class and satiating the radical desires of her followers than protecting our country's national security.\n\nCongressman Swalwell and other members of Congress from any party who do not take the responsibility to safeguard classified information seriously would lose access to this information if they were anybody else.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYet again, however, the Pelosi Doctrine is do as I say, not as I do.\n\nOur country is less safe as a result.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM REP.

The next time you get a flat tire, change it or you might get burned in a very literal fashion.\n\nPolice in Stamford, U.K., posted photos to twitter on Wednesday of a car that was engulfed in flames after they spotted it riding on a bare steel rim that was throwing sparks and pulled it over, SWNS reported.\n\nAuthorities had been alerted to a car weaving through traffic for miles and allege that the driver was drunk and operating the vehicle without a license.\n\nNo one was injured, but moments after the vehicle was stopped a fire ignited that completely burned the vehicle.\n\nAnd the danger posed by this type of situation isn't just to the occupants of the vehicle. Investigators determined that the massive and deadly Carr Fire that devastated Northern California was ignited by a car trailer with a flat tire that threw sparks into some roadside brush.\n\nFOLLOW FOX NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE
Protesters stormed the U.S. Capitol Wednesday afternoon in a major security breach as lawmakers were just starting the process of certifying the electoral win for President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nThe intrusion into both the House and Senate forced lawmakers to evacuate to secure locations. There was a least one shooting victim who was transported from the U.S. Capitol shortly before 3 p.m., Fox News has learned.\n\nThis is a coup attempt, tweeted Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill.\n\nOne protester made it inside the Senate chamber and sat in the chair where Vice President Mike Pence was presiding, declaring Trump won the election, according to a pool producer.\n\nSeveral dozen were roaming through the halls on the Senate side, yelling, Where are they?\n\nThe chaos and violence erupted at the Capitol as Republicans mounted their first challenge to Biden's victory within minutes of the counting of the Electoral College votes during a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. The formal objection set off a debate in both chambers and showed divisions between the GOP.\n\nBut the debate was cut short when supporters of President Trump breached the Capitol and forced a recess of both the House and the Senate due to a security threat. Capitol Police advised members to move inside the nearest office and seek cover. Lawmakers were told to get escape hoods under their chairs and move to the Rotunda.\n\nA Capitol security official announced over a speaker in the Senate: Lock all doors if able. If unable, seek shelter or concealment. Remain calm and await further directions. I repeat ... security threats, security threats, security threats inside the US Capitol.\n\nOne lawmaker told Fox News the protesters breached the House chamber and there were reports of shots were fired at some point, but details were unclear. Images show protesters breaking windows outside the chamber and security officials pointing guns at them to try to stop them from entering.\n\nAnother lawmaker, Rep. Scott Franklin, R-Fla., said lawmakers were evacuated.\n\nSecurity was breached and we've evacuated the chamber to a safe location, Franklin said.\n\nPence had to be escorted out of the Senate chamber. Trump supporters were seen outside trying to break through the Capitol doors, according to a video posted by The Recount. And then protesters made it inside, carrying their American flags and Trump flags.\n\nTrump urged the protesters to remain peaceful after the breach.\n\nI am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue, Trump tweeted.\n\nThe vice president went further, urging protesters to leave the Capitol.\n\nPence tweeted, The violence and destruction taking place at the US Capitol Must Stop and it Must Stop Now. Anyone involved must respect Law Enforcement officers and immediately leave the building.\n\nImages show a breach inside the Senate chamber, with protesters hanging from the balcony and taking over the chamber.\n\nPrior to the major security threat, Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, submitted a joint objection to counting Arizona's 11 electoral votes for Biden. They issued a one-sentence written note on why the state's votes should be tossed out saying they were not regularly given.\n\nPence, under tremendous pressure by Trump, acknowledged the objection met the requirements of being in writing and signed by one senator and one representative and he recessed the normally mundane session of counting electoral college votes so both the Senate and House could debate the validity of the Arizona results.\n\nGOP lawmakers stood and cheered the objection being accepted, therefore stalling the all but inevitable certification of Biden's win.\n\nGosar said he was objecting on behalf of 60 GOP lawmakers. They intend to keep on objecting Republicans may object to the Electoral College votes of up to six states that Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nAs the House debated the Electoral College results, the crux of the GOP argument was that state executives and courts changed election rules in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic to allow expanded mail-in voting or registration windows when only state legislatures should do so. Therefore, the arguement goes, votes cast under these new voting systems are invalid.\n\nYou cannot change the rules of an election while it is underway and expect the American people to trust it, said Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo.\n\nDemocrats and many GOP senators balked at this last-minute effort to overrule voters and overturn a presidential election.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the election wasn't even especially close and courts have resoundingly rejected Trump's legal claims, including sweeping conspiracy theories, that the election was stolen from him.\n\nMcConnell said his vote to certify Biden's election win will be the most important he's ever cast in his 36 years in the Senate.\n\nThe voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken, McConnell said. If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever.\n\nThe debate carried on as thousands of Trump supporters rallied outside the Capitol demanding the election results be tossed out. They were invigorated by a speech from Trump himself who again refused to concede his election loss and raised unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud that have been rejected by dozens of courts, state election officials and his own attorney general William Barr.\n\nTrump has demanded loyalty from Pence to try to overturn the results in Congress, which he doesn't have the sole authority to do, and from his GOP allies. The long-shot effort could drag on for hours depending on how many states received valid objections that require debate.\n\nRepublicans leading the charge in House acknowledged in some way the pressure from voters to do something and polling showing that Republicans have doubts.\n\nAmericans instinctively know there was something wrong with this election, said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio., citing Trump's crowd sizes and compared to Biden's smaller events.\n\nBut somehow the guy who never left his house wins the election, Jordan said.\n\nBiden purposely held smaller gatherings and relied on virtual events due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDemocrats said the free and fair election wasn't even close. Biden won the popular vote and the electoral vote 306 to 232, and all of Trump's legal remedies were rebuked.\n\nThat we are here with a substantial number of our members seeking to overturn an election is remarkable, tragic and all too predictable, said Rep. Adam Schiff, R-Calif., about Trump's claims for months of massive voter fraud.\n\nThe 2020 election is over and the people have spoken, added Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Lillian LeCroy, Jason Donner and Kelly Phares contributed to this report.
Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., warned that Democratic victories in her state's runoff elections will mean a radical agenda that will drastically change life in the U.S.\n\nBoth Georgia Senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on Tuesday as Loeffler faces challenger Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., takes on Jon Ossoff. With Democrats already having control of the House and the White House after November's election, Loeffler told Fox News Sunday that Democratic victories this week would result in drastic changes in Washington.\n\nIt's a choice, it's a stark contrast between the freedoms — our way of life here in Georgia — or socialism, government control. We know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going to take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is not just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run health care, but he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of change.\n\nOne of those agents of change, Loeffler claimed, is her opponent Warnock, who she said did not represent her state's values and who would fundamentally change this country.
Ransomware wreaked havoc in 2020. It may be even worse this year.\n\nThe average ransom payment jumped 31% to $233,817 in the third quarter from the second quarter, according to a report from Coveware.\n\nOne of the biggest fears in 2021 is that ransomware criminals will go after bigger and bigger targets.\n\nSEXTORTION CASE SHOWS HOW ABUSERS UP THE ANTE\n\nThe biggest change over the past 6 quarters is [criminals] now realize that their tactics scale to much larger enterprises without much of an increase in their own operating costs, Coveware said in its report. The profit margins are extremely high and the risk is low.\n\nIn a textbook ransomware attack, the attacker locks critical computer files. If the victim pays, the files are unlocked.\n\nIn 2021, hospitals are likely to remain major targets, amid the coronavirus pandemic, as criminals casually blow past any ethical red lines, said SC Media, a cybersecurity information site.\n\nAs hospitals are flooded with new coronavirus patients, attackers know that a hospital will be more desperate to pay the ransom to keep their operations running.\n\nIn addition to health care, manufacturing is expected to be a big target in 2021, Jim McGann, vice president of marketing and business development at Index Engines, a backup and cybersecurity firm, told Fox News.\n\nAnd the attacks will be more sophisticated than in previous years, he said.\n\nCybercriminals are deploying advanced technology, including machine learning, to aid them in penetrating security defenses, McGann said in a statement.\n\nAlso, expect backup systems to look very different, McGann added.\n\nSECOND HACKING GROUP SUSPECTED IN MASSIVE SOLARWINDS ATTACK\n\nBackup has not seen a lot of innovation over the last decade, but cyberattacks have generated a renewed focus on backup, according to McGann. New backup technology will provide sophisticated analytics, smarter machine learning, and isolated air-gaps for added security, he explained, the latter referring to a recovery technique where a copy of an organization's data is always offline and therefore cannot be accessed by attackers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLastly, one of the most dangerous trends expected to spill over into 2021 is a side hustle that attackers have been using, according to Sophos' 2021 Threat Report. Here, attackers not only hold the computer systems hostage but they steal the data and threaten to release it to the world if the targets fail to pay a bounty.
President Donald Trump told Fox News on Thursday that he has the absolute right to declare a national emergency if he can't reach an agreement with congressional Democrats to provide funding for his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe law is very clear. I mean, we have the absolute right to declare a national emergency, Trump told Sean Hannity in an exclusive interview. This is a national emergency, if you look what's happening.\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: IT'S TIME FOR TRUMP 'TO USE EMERGENCY POWERS TO FUND' BORDER WALL\n\nTrump did not lay out a specific timetable for when he might take such a step, saying: I think we're going to see what happens over the next few days. However, he appeared to hold out hope for making a deal to secure wall funding and fully reopen the government.\n\nWe should be able to make a deal with Congress, the president said. If you look, Democrats, in Congress, especially the new ones coming in, are starting to say, 'Wait a minute, we can't win this battle with Trump, because of the fact that it's just common sense. How can we say that a wall doesn't work?'\n\nThe president spoke to Fox News on the banks of the Rio Grande, where he traveled to argue his claim that a barrier would deter drug and human trafficking into the United States.\n\nTRUMP HIGHLIGHTS HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS HE CALLS FOR 'STRONG BARRIER' DURING BORDER VISIT\n\nDeath is pouring through, Trump said. We have crime and death and it's not just at the border. They get through the border and they go and filter into the country and you have MS-13 gangs in places like Los Angeles and you have gangs all over Long Island, which we're knocking the hell out of. There should be no reason for us to have to do this. They shouldn't be allowed in and if we had the barrier, they wouldn't be allowed in.\n\nThe president said a wall would be virtually a hundred percent effective and [House Speaker] Nancy [Pelosi] and [Senate Democratic Leader] Chuck [Schumer] know that, but it's politics. It's about the 2020 campaign, it's about running for president. That's what they're doing. They're already doing it. It's a shame. They've got to put the country first.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrats repeatedly have refused to approve any legislation to fund the wall. The standoff led to the partial government shutdown, which is set to his the three-week mark Friday.\n\nEveryone wants us to win this battle, Trump said. It's common sense ... Look, we're not going anywhere. We're not changing our mind because there's nothing to change your mind about. The wall works [and] if we don't have a steel or concrete barrier, we're all wasting a lot of time.
Rising Democratic star Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said in a new interview that she could fund her proposed Green New Deal in part by slapping a tax as high as 70 percent on top earners.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, sworn in as Congress' youngest member on Thursday, is one of a number of Democrats who backs the Green New Deal -- which aims to combat both climate change and income inequality with a massive and costly economic overhaul. Ocasio-Cortez has called it a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.\n\nA draft text circulated around Congress lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn an interview with Anderson Cooper to air Sunday on CBS's 60 Minutes, Ocasio-Cortez said the huge government expansion could be paid for in part by taxpayers contributing their fair share. She said that, like in the 1960s, tax rates for those with incomes up to $75,000 could be as low as 10 or 15 percent, but much higher for those earning millions.\n\nBut once you get to the tippie tops, on your ten millionth, sometimes you see tax rates as high as 60 percent or 70 percent. That doesn't mean all $10 million are taxed at an extremely high rate. But it means that as you climb up this ladder, you should be contributing more.\n\nSOCIALISM RISING: DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION, AS PARTY LURCHES LEFT\n\nThose on the left calling for higher taxes have frequently pointed to tax rates in place before President Ronald Reagan took office, to argue they are not unprecedented. But free-market conservatives have argued there were more loopholes in the '60s and '70s, meaning most high earners didn't actually pay those ultra-high rates.\n\nPresident Trump in 2017 signed a measure that slashed taxes across the board -- a move that was opposed by most Democrats. Democrats have called for those tax cuts -- particularly the ones for the wealthy -- to be reversed, while Republicans have argued that the cuts have helped fuel economic growth.\n\nWhile Ocasio-Cortez is seen as being on far left of the Democratic Party, her call for a Green New Deal is increasingly being embraced by more mainstream Democrats, including possible 2020 candidates such as Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass. In the House, the activist Sunrise Movement says that it has more than 40 House members who are backing the Green New Deal, including Reps. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Veronica Escobar, D-Texas.
When maths teacher Danny Marcok woke up yesterday, he was surprised to see a tail hanging from his split-system air conditioner.\n\nThe Melbourne man and his wife thought it was a rat's tail sticking out but Mr Marcok's wife Denise took a closer look with a torch and was shocked at what she saw.\n\nBuried deep inside the unit at the couple's home in Little River, 49km southwest of Melbourne, was one of the deadliest creatures on the planet — a 75cm tiger snake.\n\nMr. Marcok called in reptile relocator Stewy the Snake Catcher for a bit of help.\n\nThe expert snake handler soon coaxed the reptile out, even if it didn't want to leave.\n\nOn Facebook, he wrote that snakes can turn up in the darnedest places and that the tiger snake likely found a home in the air conditioner while chasing mice in the roof.\n\nDuring an interview with Today, Mr. Marcok said it was likely that the snake was in the unit the entire night.\n\nI thought it was a rat's tail sticking out of the air conditioner, he said. But when it moved back into the unit, I thought, 'Nup, a rat wouldn't move like that.'\n\nThe snake handler said Mr. Marcok was lucky he didn't stick his hand in the air conditioner to change a filter. He said the snake wouldn't have attacked him in his bed, but it would've tried to defend itself it if felt threatened.\n\nThe warmer weather is bringing snakes out from hiding.

A Rochester, N.Y., meteorologist was fired after allegedly using a racial slur on air Friday — an allegation he vehemently denied.\n\nWHEC meteorologist Jeremy Kappell was reporting from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Park in Rochester when viewers alleged he used a slur while saying the late civil rights movement leader's name.\n\nRochester Mayor Lovely Warren called for Kappell to be fired from the local NBC affiliate after the segment aired.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt is wrong, hurtful and infuriating that WHEC Channel 10 broadcast a racial slur in reference to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. during its Friday news broadcast. It is beyond unacceptable that this occurred, Warren said in a press release. There must be real consequences for the news personality involved and also for the management team that failed to immediately apologize and address the slur.\n\nKappell denied saying the slur.\n\nReplying to a viewer who tweeted wowww that video. he definitely says that all the time, which is why it slipped out on air, Kappell wrote Monday, For the record, I've never uttered those words in my life.\n\nHe also pointed out that ESPN host Mike Greensburg made also the same slip of the tongue almost a decade ago.\n\nKappell also tweeted that while he has not made a formal statement about the incident yet, he will soon.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rochester Association of Black Journalists released a statement condemning Kappell's clearly racist language.\n\nWhile we are aware that the station has issued an apology, we expect a complete explanation of what happened, who was responsible and why nothing was said immediately after the Friday broadcast, the statement read in part.\n\nNews10NBC general manager Richard Reingold said in a statement Monday, On behalf of News10NBC, I apologize for our broadcast of a racial slur in a reference to Martin Luther King, Jr. Park during our Friday evening broadcast (1/4/19). Upon learning of the incident, News10NBC leadership immediately initiated an internal investigation and internal discussion, and by Sunday had made a staffing change.\n\nThe statement continues, As a result of that broadcast meteorologist, Jeremy Kappell is no longer with News10NBC. We believe strongly in holding our reporters and anchors to the highest standard. We are proud of our dedicated newsroom professionals, and expect and require that each respects and understands that their behavior reflects directly on the station for which they work and the community we serve.\n\nThese words have no place on News10NBC's air, and the fact that we broadcast them disheartens and disgusts me; that it was not caught immediately is inexcusable. I regret that we did not immediately interrupt our broadcast and apologize on the spot, Reingold added.\n\nOur Friday broadcast does not represent the values of News10NBC, its hardworking staff, or the great people of Rochester. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. is one of America's greatest heroes – for whom I, and all of us at News10NBC, have the utmost respect. I am terribly sorry to all of our viewers. We are redoubling our efforts to ensure that this never happens again.
A Northern California church sparked outrage over a sign that read: Bruce Jenner is still a man. Homosexuality is still sin. The culture may change. The Bible does not.\n\nCaitlyn Jenner is formerly known as Bruce and revealed in 2015 that she is transgender and has become a woman.\n\nThe church, Trinity Bible Presbyterian Church, is located in Lake Shastina, Calif., which is about an hours' drive from the Oregon border.\n\nProtesters gathered in front of the church on Sunday to denounce what they called hate and slander and to show our love and support for the LGBT community, according to a Facebook page that organized the event.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJustin Hoke, the church's pastor, wrote on Facebook Wednesday that the sign's Plexiglass had been destroyed and the letters had been stolen.\n\nThe protesters denied having destroyed the sign, The Sacramento Bee reported. Hoke posted a picture on his Facebook Thursday of the sign back up with plaster covering the letters, writing: It's not pretty, but it's back up.\n\nHoke later wrote on Facebook: If a conservative mountain farming community is no longer a safe place to call sin, sin, then is anywhere in this country still safe for real Christians? according to The Siskiyou Daily News.\n\nAnother protest against the church's sign is planned for this Sunday, according to the organizer's Facebook page.
Luka Doncic had 33 points, 16 rebounds and 11 assists, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 30 off the bench as the Dallas Mavericks used a big fourth quarter run to pull away in a 113-100 win over the Houston Rockets on Monday night.\n\nDallas was on top by 3 with about seven minutes remaining before using a 14-3 spurt, with seven points from Hardaway, to extend the lead to 106-92 with about 2½ minutes remaining.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nHouston couldn't get anything going as the Mavericks took over. The Rockets missed five shots and had two turnovers in that span.\n\nHardaway, who made 8 of 10 3-point attempts, added another 3-pointer down the stretch to put the game out of reach.\n\nDallas coach Rick Carlisle changed his starting lineup to get more size against the Rockets and moved Willie Cauley-Stein, who is 7 feet tall, in for Hardaway for the first time this season.\n\nCarlisle heaped praise upon Hardaway for the way he played off the bench.\n\nIt was a really strong character performance by Tim, he said. He was great at both ends of the floor... Tim Hardaway showed what class and professionalism is in responding to a lineup change.\n\nHardaway didn't feel like the move was that big of a deal.\n\nYou've got to be a pro, he said. I'm here to help this team out any way I can. I just had to make sure I was ready when I got in the game to make an impact.\n\nChristian Wood had 23 points to lead the Rockets and James Harden added 21.\n\nWe were way too stagnant, didn't move the ball enough to put pressure on them and make it hard on them, coach Stephen Silas said.\n\nBoth Doncic and Harden were back after sitting out in their team's last game with injuries. Doncic returned after missing Sunday's loss to Chicago with a bruised quadriceps. Harden played after sitting out on Saturday against the Kings because of a sprained ankle.\n\nCarlisle was impressed that his team was able to slow Harden down and limit the Rockets to just 100 points.\n\nDefensively is where we're going to make our ground this year, he said. That's just how it's going to be. We've got to build on this somehow.\n\nHouston made just 11 of 40 3-pointers and Harden was 3 of 11 from long-range and 5 of 17 overall.\n\nI'm really just disappointed in our offensive effort tonight because that's not the game that I envisioned us playing, Silas said.\n\nThe Mavericks led by seven points to start the fourth before Houston opened the quarter with an 8-1 run to tie it with about 10 minutes remaining. Eric Gordon made three free throws to get things going and Sterling Brown had a 3 that tied it.\n\nDallas had a 16-point lead after a three-point play by Doncic with about eight minutes left in the third quarter. The Rockets then scored the next 14 points to get within 72-70 four minutes later. Harden had a step back 3-pointer in that stretch and Jae'Sean Tate capped it with six straight points.\n\nDoncic struggled during that time, turning the ball over three times and receiving a technical foul.\n\nThe Mavericks finally ended a scoring drought with a 3-pointer by Hardaway with less than three minutes left in the quarter.\n\nAnother 3-pointer by Hardaway later in the third extended the lead to six points before Gordon hit a 3 for Houston. But Doncic scored the last four points of the quarter to put the Mavericks up 84-77 entering the fourth.\n\nDeMarcus Cousins was ejected after receiving two technical fouls in about three minutes in the second quarter. The first one came when he and Cauley-Stein both got one after jawing at each other after fighting for a rebound.\n\nCousins was ejected when he yelled at an official after not getting a foul call after a layup with about nine minutes left in the first half. Silas was clearly unhappy with the call and stood inches away from a referee pointing and arguing about it for a couple of minutes before he was pushed away by Harden.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTIP-INS\n\nMavericks: James Johnson received a flagrant-1 foul after hitting Tate in the face on a foul in the third quarter. ... Cauley-Stein added 15 points with seven rebounds.\n\nRockets: Danuel House missed the game with back spasms. ...

After President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence wrapped up separate meetings on border security and the ongoing partial federal government shutdown on Sunday, Trump offered his strongest endorsement yet of a proposal to build a steel wall, rather than a concrete barrier, at the southern border.\n\nMeanwhile, a Democratic source told Fox News that the Pence-led meeting with bipartisan congressional staff at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building (EEOB) near the White House had accomplished little, and started nearly an hour late because Trump administration officials were unprepared. Trump called the meeting productive afterward, although he was not in attendance.\n\nThe president framed his new pitch for a steel wall as a concession to Democrats to move negotiations along, as the shutdown entered its 16th day. Meanwhile, Democrats published the full text of several spending bills to reopen the government on Sunday that the White House and Senate Republicans have long said have no chance of becoming law because they do not include any funding for a wall of any kind.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThey don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel, Trump told reporters after returning to the White House from a meeting with his advisers at Camp David.\n\nTrump also suggested he would rather wait until the Supreme Court rules on the legality of his administration's recission of the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program before negotiating with Democrats on the issue as part of the talks to end the shutdown.\n\nSeveral federal judges have held that the Trump administration's reasons for terminating DACA were legally insufficient under a federal administrative law statute, which requires adequate notice and justification before the government terminates a right it has previously granted.\n\nI would consider DACA, but ... I'd rather have the Supreme Court rule, and then work with the Democrats on DACA,' Trump said. I want to help with DACA, but ... you know, it's going to be before the Supreme Court very soon.\n\nAt the sit-down at the EEOB, Pence -- along with Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen -- on Sunday discussed a variety of border-security measures with congressional officials from both parties.\n\nDemocrats were given what they asked for, which was a detailed, breakdown list of the administration's proposals for border security that include the wall and other border protection measures, a House GOP leadership aide told Fox News. Democrats were given the opportunity to ask questions of Secretary Nielsen and hear DHS' justification for the specific funding requests. Their justifications made it abundantly clear why it is necessary to have this level of funding to effectively secure our border.\n\nA Democratic official familiar with the meeting, however, said no progress was made at the Pence sit-down and charged that the White House was unprepared.\n\nThe meeting today at 1 p.m. started approximately 45 minutes late because the White House did not have the information Democrats requested ready, the official told Fox News. Yesterday, Democrats asked for a full budget justification for the administration's position because the $5.7 billion wall request was not included in the administration's fiscal year 2019 request and the administration has not had a consistent position in various conversations with the Hill. Democratic staff did not receive a full budget justification today.\n\nRELIGION EXPERTS WEIGH IN: IS PELOSI RIGHT TO CALL THE WALL 'IMMORAL'?\n\n\n\nThe Democratic source continued: Three and a half months into a new fiscal year, the Administration did not present any commensurate cuts in the DHS budget to accommodate the increases they are seeking. Given the failure of the White House to present a full budget justification today, the Democratic staff pleaded again for the White House to change course and re-open government by supporting the [bill to fund DHS through February 8] and the six bill package that the House has passed and has received broad bipartisan support in the Senate. The Vice President said the President would not do that.\n\nNo further meetings between Pence and congressional staff are currently planned. For his part, Pence tweeted only that he was back at the White House Sunday afternoon.\n\nWhile Pence noted that the president was committed to securing the border, building the wall, & working to reopen our government, he did not characterize the meeting productive, as he did on Twitter after a similar get-together with congressional staff on Saturday.\n\nHowever, in his own tweet later Sunday afternoon, Trump called Pence's meeting as a step forward.\n\nV.P. Mike Pence and group had a productive meeting with the Schumer/Pelosi representatives today, Trump wrote. Many details of Border Security were discussed. We are now planning a Steel Barrier rather than concrete. It is both stronger & less obtrusive. Good solution, and made in the U.S.A.\n\nTrump's steel wall proposal was the continuation of a White House strategy that has developed in the past several weeks. Trump first floated the idea of using artistically designed steel slats for the wall, rather than concrete, in December.\n\nHe then suggested taking the concrete wall off the table at a Rose Garden news conference on Friday, as a concession to Democrats. And, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said in an interview on NBC News' Meet the Press on Sunday that Trump was willing to agree ... to take a concrete wall off the table in order to secure a deal to end the ongoing shutdown.\n\nWe've been in touch with a lot of people, and I informed my folks to say that we'll build a steel barrier --- steel -- that it will be made out of steel, that it will be less obtrusive and it'll be stronger, Trump said. And we're able to use our great companies to make it, by using steel.\n\nSome ex-White House officials have suggested Trump abandoned the idea of a concrete wall in the early days of his tenure. In an explosive interview published shortly before his departure from the Trump administration at the end of last year, former chief of staff John Kelly told the Los Angeles Times that the White House had left a solid concrete wall early on in the administration, when we asked people what they needed and where they needed it.\n\nEarlier Sunday, speaking to reporters before he headed out to Camp David to discuss border security with top advisers, Trump had predicted that the Pence-run meeting would not lead to any major developments.\n\nTRUMP POINTS TO OBAMA, HILLARY'S PAST REMARKS TO BOLSTER PUSH FOR BORDER WALL\n\nI don't expect to have anything to happen at that meeting, Trump said.\n\nPrevious meetings between Democrats and White House officials have been heated: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Nielsen, the DHS secretary, reportedly got into a tense confrontation on Wednesday in the Situation Room, with the California Democrat interrupting Nielsen's presentation on border security and illegal immigration, telling her, I reject your facts.\n\nThe president additionally said he was totally involved in shutdown negotiations and claimed to have tremendous support within the Republican Party.\n\nThe longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history lasted 21 days, and Trump has said repeatedly that current one may last more than a year if Democrats are not willing to fund some of the wall.\n\n.They don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel. — President Trump\n\nThe president also reaffirmed that he may declare a national emergency dependent on what's going to happen over the next few days to construct a border wall, and declared that Republicans and Democrats were going to have some very serious talks beginning on Monday.\n\nWATCH: TRUMP SAYS HE CAN 'RELATE' TO FURLOUGHED FEDERAL WORKERS, PROMISES NOT TO 'BEND' ON BORDER WALL\n\nHowever, speaking on Fox News Sunday, Democratic Rhode Island Rep. David Cicilline suggested Trump did not have the authority to declare an emergency to build the border wall.\n\nI don't think the president has that authority -- he would have to meet a very high standard, Cicilline said. Article I establishes the Congress of the United States and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money, so I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope he will try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first.\n\nThe Democrat-led House last week approved one amalgamated spending bill, addressing six areas of spending and one measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8. The House approved both bills on a bipartisan basis, but Senate Republicans and the White House have said they were non-starters without wall money.\n\nThis week, the House is set to start approving these measures on an individual basis. On Sunday, Democrats posted the full text of the bills, in keeping with their recent rules change requiring 72 hours of advanced notice to the public before members vote on most new legislation.\n\n\n\nFox News has learned the House Rules Committee will meet late Tuesday afternoon to tee up some of these measures for the floor. The Rules Committee is the gateway for most legislation to reach the House floor.\n\nThe House is expected to consider the Financial Services and General Government appropriations bill Wednesday. This measure deals with the Treasury Department and funds the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n\n\n\nBy the end of next week, the House likely will have passed different versions of all funding bills to re-open the government -- twice.\n\nIn an interview Sunday, South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned the shutdown could not end as long as the radical left insisted on calling Republicans racist for supporting immigration officials.\n\nWe're negotiating with people who will accuse all of us who support a wall as part of border security as racists, Graham said on CBS News' Face the Nation on Sunday. As long as the radical left is in charge, we're not going to get anywhere.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram and Chris Wallace contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 13, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: All right. I'm Laura Ingraham and this is The Ingraham Angle from a busy Washington tonight. Well, the news we made with the President on Friday night drove the news cycle all weekend and it didn't even stop today. Nancy Pelosi responded to President Trump. We're going to show you what she said before Congressman Lee Zeldin and Matt Gaetz are here to react.\n\nPlus, as the Speaker sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate, Alan Dershowitz and Gregg Jarrett are going to give you everything you need to know about what happens next. And I'm going to make a suggestion that Mitch McConnell must listen to and I mean must, I am going to tell you what that is. Just a few moments.\n\nAnd this is shocking, investigative journalist Lee Smith is going to tell us that he has evidence that the Obama administration sent notes to the now deceased terrorists Qasem Soleimani and he's here exclusively with those details. Wow. And my Can't Miss Angle on the state of the 2020 Democrat field, that's going to come a little later on in the show.\n\nBut first. last week was a big one for The Ingraham Angle. We not only had two news making interviews with the President and the Secretary of State, but we also shattered the liberal media narrative that Nancy Pelosi was some sort of political mastermind of strategy.\n\nThis entire impeachment gambit, it's just been an embarrassing failure from day one. So naturally, she's lashing out at Trump. Here's how she reacted when ABC's George Stephanopoulos showed her a clip from our interview.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS, ABC HOST: I want to show him on Friday night on Fox News.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: She is obsessed with impeachment. She has done nothing. She's going to go down as one of the worst speakers in the history of our country.\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF.: I don't like to spend too much time on his crazy tweets because everything he says is a projection. When he calls somebody crazy, he knows that he is. Everything he says you can just translate it back to who he is.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Is Nancy in a schoolyard at this point?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you aware that, I am rubber and you are glue and everything that you say to me bounces off me and sticks to you.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Here's the Speaker later on in that interview, sounding totally above board.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPELOSI: Everything that he has done whether it is in Syria vis-a-vis the Turks, whether it's been in Ukraine in terms of withholding assistance as they try to fight the Russians. His denial about their role in our election then and now all roads lead to - and sometimes I wonder about Mitch McConnell to what's he - why is he an accomplice to all of that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: That in and of itself tells you everything you need to know about the weakness of Pelosi's impeachment case.\n\nAnd by the way, I don't recall Pelosi getting all flabbergasted when Obama would not give lethal aid to Ukraine. And you don't hear talk about that at all. Suddenly, it's her number one issue. So, impeachment ploy didn't work, so they just go back to the old Russian narrative that failed on Mueller and it's failing now.\n\nJoining me now are two GOP Congressman Lee Zeldin, House Foreign Affairs Committee Member and Matt Gaetz, House Judiciary Committee Member. Congressman Zeldin, let's start with you. Why do you think the Democrats especially the Speaker, she's usually smarter than that? I mean I don't agree with her on a lot, but she's usually smarter than that. That was actually surprising even to me and I've been in this town longer than both of you probably combined, which is scary. But what do you think?\n\nREP. LEE ZELDIN, R-N.Y.: A lot of miscalculation. We saw it really since last fall, when they started this impeachment push and there was this rush, it was tripping over herself so desperate to rush, it's so urgent that we couldn't even provide fairness. We couldn't even provide due process to the President.\n\nAnd then starting 2020, starting an election year, she's coming out of the gate with a miscalculation with regard to these articles of impeachment and winning extra-long in order to send them over. A lot of miscalculations done by. I think it's going to be paid at the polls in November. And what she should be doing if she was smart, because she has all these Democrats in districts that Donald Trump won. She should be talking about delivering them wins to go back to their district, but instead all those Trump voters have to be fuming at these Democrats who represent, because they didn't send them to Washington to impeach the President--\n\nINGRAHAM: She have stuff to do. Let me say, we have a lot of stuff that needs to be done in this country. We have infrastructure that's crumbling. Go to any major airport compared to a lot of airports in Europe and Asia, it's ridiculous and they're messing around with these ridiculous investigations. Now, Gaetz, I want to show you what the media is saying. Some in the media are not even buying what Pelosi is now saying which tells you how desperate it is. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRACHAEL BADE, WASHINGTON POST REPORTER: She's clearly putting a positive spin on what a lot of Democrats have privately said was a failed strategy. I mean she and Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader in the Senate set out to number one, try to get a commitment from McConnell on witnesses, firsthand witnesses to have them testify in a Senate trial. She also said she wanted to see a resolution about how the whole proceedings would be governed. She got neither of those.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: And she's contrary to some of the reporting, we'll get into that, she's not to going to get in either of those. So, that's a Washington Post reporter.\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ, R-FLA.: This is a failed strategy and it's not that all roads lead back to Putin for President Trump. It's that all roads lead back to Russia for the Democrats in the absence of an agenda that actually works for the American people.\n\nTomorrow morning, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will huddle in their weekly caucus meeting and I expect it to be more tense than a family meeting at Buckingham Palace, because you've got these Democrats and Trump districts who feel like they've been walked off the cliff. They were told that this was imminent, this was urgent, this was a clear and present danger. And then even some of the more seasoned Democrats like Adam Smith, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee where I serve telling Nancy Pelosi, let's get on with it. This is starting to look ridiculous. Let's transmit the articles.\n\nBut it's my suspicion that that will ultimately lead to the least suspenseful trial in all of trials because we all know that the result will be the President being exonerated because he did nothing wrong in his call with President Zelensky.\n\nINGRAHAM: Lee, this is hurting clearly, if this goes at any length of time. Even the last few weeks - the three or four weeks that this has been going on. This has to help Biden and hurt those who are going to have to stay in Washington during the Senate trial. So, a lot of people think Nancy in her own way is putting her finger on the scale against Warren, against Sanders and for Biden. Do you think there's anything to that?\n\nZELDIN: There is. I would also add for Biden, the one thing that would harm him is that a lot of the narrative of what this Ukraine calls about the investigations was this Biden family scheme in Ukraine with Hunter Biden being not qualified for this position. And I think that that is one thing that would come back and bite him and who knows, it may end up benefiting someone who isn't a senator or Biden, maybe somebody like a Mayor Pete ends up benefiting from it. We'll see how that ends up playing up.\n\nThe President has been focused on an agenda. He has a team. He's got Tony Sayegh, Pam Bondi, Patsy Baloney (ph). They've got great people to White House focus on impeachment. But the President himself is focused on an economy that is ripping right now. On the national security front, he takes out Qasem Soleimani and the Democrats are so invested into hating Trump that they can't root for the Iranians, the millions of Iranians who want to pursue a new direction and they're trying to make the President look bad, taking out Soleimani.\n\nINGRAHAM: But speaking of Biden, Congressman Gaetz, House Intel Chair Adam Schiff, your good buddy says that the Biden's together are really irrelevant. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. ADAM SCHIFF, D-CALIF.: Do the Biden's have any relevant testimony? And I think the answer is that they don't. There has been no factual basis for these allegations against Joe Biden to ask the Senate, do these investigations that the President fraudulently sought to get Ukraine to conduct would merely turn the Senate trial on its head. Now that's something the President would love. But that's not a fair trial. That's a sham trial.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Listen to Joy Behar.\n\nGAETZ: Yes, boy. He's covering stuff up faster than a cat in a litter box. I mean when you look at the Biden behavior, it is exculpatory for the President. Think about it. If the Biden's are truly corrupt, it could never be an impeachable offense to investigate corruption or to ask our friends to investigate corruption pursuant to our treaties and so, we will put that evidence on if witnesses are allowed in this trial and we will I think be able to prove dispositively that this President as he has always done was putting the interests of the American people and the American taxpayer first. These were legitimate questions.\n\nAnd by the way, is there anyone who thinks that the Biden's just stopped at the Ukraine. They were running the same gambit in China and elsewhere because this is how corruption works. It's pervasive with these elements of permanent Washington.\n\nINGRAHAM: President has an obligation to safeguard the American people's money. And he was doing it in Ukraine. And that's one of the reasons why he was elected. It is great to see you both tonight. Thanks for both coming on.\n\nZELDIN: Good to see you.\n\nINGRAHAM: And speaking Pelosi by the way she's huddling with House Dems tomorrow to choose the impeachment managers as she prepares to send the articles to the Senate. THE INGRAHAM ANGLE was told to expect the articles to be transmitted on Wednesday. So, if that's what happens from here.\n\nJoining us now is Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor Emeritus and author of Guilt by Accusation. Along with him is Greg Jarrett, Fox News Legal Analyst and author of Witch Hunt.\n\nAlan what happens - well, I was going to say it this way, the Articles of Impeachment arrive in the Senate. Couldn't and shouldn't, this goes back to my advice I'm going to give and I'm going to throw it out to you. Couldn't Mitch McConnell dispose of this travesty right off the bat? I think this even setting a precedent for these two articles of impeachment abuse the process and obstruction, obstruction for not going to court, abuse of process on these nebulous flawed grounds is ridiculous. I would either dismiss it or decide it immediately. I wouldn't entertain this nonsense at all. Thoughts.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ, HARVARD PROFESSOR OF LAW EMERITUS: There's no question that these two articles of impeachment are unconstitutional. They do not satisfy the constitutionally required criteria for impeachment.\n\nPresident Trump's lawyers could make a motion to dismiss or one of the senators could make a motion to dismiss and take a vote right away. Whether they decide to do that or not will be up obviously to the members of the Senate, maybe to the Chief Justice initially. But I have absolutely no doubt that the two articles of impeachment, abuse of power which every president since Adams has been accused of, by their political opponents and obstruction of Congress, which is another way of saying, the President exercised separation of powers and checks and balances in an entirely proper way should never come to actual trial.\n\nINGRAHAM: Right.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Charging somebody with a non-crime and then the lawyer making a motion to dismiss which would be granted.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, the more I was thinking about this Gregg, and we would get into Romney in a second, but the more I was thinking about this tonight, get ready for the show. I thought, we have all this important stuff bearing down on us, let alone a presidential election in November. And Mitch McConnell is going to sit up there and entertain like motions and have this travesty play out. This thing has been held in the House for obvious reasons, a failed strategy or whatever. But this is a flawed constitutionally infirm two articles of impeachment and even entertaining this in a trial to me sets a terrible and dangerous precedent.\n\nGREGG JARRETT, FOX NEWS LEGAL ANALYST: Well, I agree with you. It lends legitimacy to illegitimate articles of impeachment. The second one is an utter joke. Obstruction of Congress for asserting a legal right to resist a subpoena. If Congress disagreed, their remedy is to go to federal court, it's always been that way. So that one should immediately be dismissed.\n\nThere was a motion to dismiss in the Clinton impeachment trial. It failed, because there were nearly a dozen felony offenses identified as abuse of power by the independent counsel Ken Starr. Here, there are no felony offenses. There are no high crimes and misdemeanors. They talked ad nauseum about extortion and bribery and in the end, they realized, there was no evidence for that. So, they conjured this wonderfully amorphous term, abuse of power. And you know I agree there ought to be and there probably will be a motion to dismiss and it should be seriously considered and voted upon.\n\nINGRAHAM: 51 votes is what you need. You've got to get Manchin, Joe Manchin and a couple of them more, middle of the road--\n\nJARRETT: Doug Jones, Alabama.\n\nINGRAHAM: I'd go to Doug Jones and Joe Manchin said, you know this is ridiculous. We know this is ridiculous. This is terrible for the country. And Mitch McConnell has got it. I think there's too much messing around with this. I thought about this a lot tonight.\n\nAlan, Democrats lost their gambit to dictate the terms of impeachment clearly, and now they're essentially just smearing the Senate.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Look, it hurts me as a liberal Democrat--\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: Senate allows the President to basically dictate how the Senate is going to conduct its trial. If the Senate becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of the White House, then absolutely the Congress will no longer be an equal branch of government.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, so Alan that's basically what Bernie Sanders is saying too. And he's saying we should just ignore the Senate in some cases. This is what happens when you have a fraudulent impeachment proceeding at the outset. This is where it's gone.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 said the greatest danger is for impeachment to turn on how many votes one party can have against the other party. And that's exactly what happened. Look, it would be ideal if we had impeachments that were neutral, objective, bipartisan. That's what the framers had in mind. But this case doesn't rise to that level in any sense.\n\nAnd so, it was partisan in the House. They created the rules of engagement, making it partisan, rushing to judgment and then delaying judgment and suddenly they expect the Senate to ignore partisan affiliations. In an ideal world that would happen, but in the political world created--\n\nINGRAHAM: Never.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: By the House of Representatives, it's unlikely to happen.\n\nINGRAHAM: Gregg, here's what Romney said, Senator Romney from Utah said about having more witnesses testify.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UTAH: There's the - if you will, the Clinton impeachment model, which is to say that we have opening arguments and then we have a vote on whether or not to have witnesses. That's the approach I favorite. And at that point I'll be voting in favor of considering witnesses. Clearly John Bolton. Yes. I mean he's someone who I would like to hear from.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: I have no words for Mitt Romney. I supported him in 2012. I mean I like Mitt Romney. I have no words for him. OK. I'm just not in that.\n\nJARRETT: Romney belongs to the Romney party.\n\nINGRAHAM: What is this? What's in the water in Utah. That's my question. I love Utah, so don't send me emails. What about this, Gregg? There are reports that four Republicans now want more testimony.\n\nJARRETT: Well, we'll wait and see.\n\nINGRAHAM: Is that a cause for concern?\n\nJARRETT: It is a cause for concern because they're essentially asking for the Senate to which is a jury to do the job of prosecutors in the House--\n\nINGRAHAM: Factfinders.\n\nJARRETT: The prosecutors in the House had a chance to subpoena people like Bolton or Mick Mulvaney or Rudy Giuliani. They didn't do it. The one subpoena they issued, they withdrew and now all of a sudden, Nancy Pelosi is trying to engage in a quid pro quo to extort the Senate to do the job that the House was supposed to do. At the same time accusing the President of an impeachable quid pro quo. The hypocrisy and irony is, lost on no one.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: But nobody should forget that John Bolton doesn't get the last word as to whether he testifies. He may want to testify.\n\nJARRETT: That's right.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: But it's the President's decision whether to invoke executive privilege--\n\nINGRAHAM: He told me; he was going to invoke it. Yes, he told me on Friday. He told me that on Friday.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Right. Then it goes to court and the courts will decide.\n\nJARRETT: And he has every right to invoke it.\n\nDERSHOWITZ: Hard to imagine anything more privileged than conversations about the national security between the President and his National Security Adviser in the Oval Office\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, apparently Mitt Romney doesn't think so and I don't know about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, but if they could put aside their dislike for some of what the President says or does for the Constitution and what's good for the country, they'd get thumbs up from me and a lot of other people. So, gentlemen, thanks so much.\n\nAnd coming up, did you all notice that former Obama administration officials last week rushing to defend Iran. Now, what might that be about? Investigative Reporter Lee Smith has uncovered shocking connections. We're going to bring him here next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: My Friday interview with President Trump didn't just drive the impeachment news, we also broke major news on the strike against Qasem Soleimani.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Did he have large scale attacks planned for other embassies?\n\nTRUMP: I can reveal that I believe it would have been four embassies.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: What the President said was he believed that it probably and could have been attacks against additional embassies. I shared that view.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The intelligence showed that they were looking at U.S. facilities throughout the region. The threat was imminent. I saw the intelligence.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, we brought up the fact that the former Obama administration officials were out in force defending the Iranians, yes, and attacking the President. The question is why?\n\nJoining me now is Lee Smith, investigative journalist, author of the Plot Against the President and Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n\nLee, you say there is a reason that the Obama officials seem very upset over the killing of Soleimani.\n\nLEE SMITH, AUTHOR, PLOT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT: Qassem Soleimani was in many ways the cornerstone of the nuclear agreement that they made in July 2015. The Obama administration made that deal not with the imaginary moderates, but with the hardliners and no one was a harder man in that regime than Qassem Soleimani. He really was the cornerstone of the deal in many ways.\n\nINGRAHAM: Victor, it is quite something is it not to hear this man described as some type of revered military figure like, he's just a scholar at Iran's version of the Hoover Institution, Victor, there you have it. And by any means necessary, must resist President Trump.\n\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, I think they're embarrassed Laura, because it wasn't just appeasement but they had an actual tapestry of a new Middle East in which Iran would balance all of our traditional allies, Israel and the moderate Gulf regimes and we would give them cash and they would bank it, they would get more technological information in exchange for that. They would have peace for our time and John Kerry and Barack Obama could wave a paper and say, we've got an agreement.\n\nAnd what really happened was that infusion of cash and the cessation of those sanctions created a terrorist whirlwind from Iran into Lebanon, into Syria, into Yemen. And they're embarrassed about it, because this plan was bankrupt, it was crazy. And I think Secretary Pompeo and Trump realize that and yet they know that our real interests are in China with - in dealing with China and there's existential threat. So, they're sort of like sheriff's backing out of this Middle East saloon and saying, this place is a mess, but we're going to have a revolved result and restore deterrence. And that's hard to do.\n\nBut this was a policy by the Obama administration that was not accidental, and Lee is absolutely right.\n\nINGRAHAM: I spoke to him.\n\nHANSON: And that's why they're embarrassed.\n\nINGRAHAM: I spoke to this Iranian activists, incredible woman, Erica Kasraie about the media reaction here. And she says they are not telling the real story. Check it out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nERICA KASRAIE, IRANIAN AMERICAN ACTIVIST: What I want the American people to know is that the majority of the Iranian people view Qassem Soleimani as a terrorist who has terrorized the entire region. They don't relate to the narrative that the Left has been giving.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, Lee, so shocking. It was shocking to see, and Pelosi spoke out about the protests that erupted on Sunday in Iran. After Iran admitted it shot down that airliner killing 176. And she said oh, they're just - they're upset because of the airline.\n\nSMITH: Right.\n\nINGRAHAM: That's all it is, it's this airline. They were fine before the airliner.\n\nSMITH: Well, it's worthwhile keeping in mind when you're looking at Democratic officials like Speaker Pelosi and when you're looking at the press, including the most prestigious brands in the media that these were - these constituted the Iran deal, echo chamber that helped sell Obama's deal with Iran. So, they have a lot at stake in protecting Obama's foreign policy legacy.\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, before we get back to Victor, you said in this new piece of yours that the goal for the Obama administration was never to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. It was to stop them from building it during the Obama term. That's quite an accusation.\n\nSMITH: Well, I mean if you look at what happened - if you look at the sunset clauses meaning the different provisions built into the deal that were set to expire sometime after Barack Obama left the White House, that's very clear. It tells you what they were doing. They were passing it on to the next administration.\n\nINGRAHAM: It was like a hot potato except you're dealing with nuclear, nuclear potential.\n\nSMITH: Thank goodness--\n\nINGRAHAM: Fallout.\n\nSMITH: They passed it on to Donald Trump instead of Hillary Clinton, as it turns out.\n\nINGRAHAM: Victor, speaking of former Obama folks, your favorite Victor, John Kerry was on television tonight. Don't you know? Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: On the Iran front, could he Bumble himself into war?\n\nJOHN KERRY, FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE: Yes. Obviously, he could. I mean he almost did. It's a sad day when the United States of America has to rely on the decision of a regime that we neither like nor trust to have them be the ones who behave somehow in a way that saves Donald Trump from his own decision.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Just so everyone understands what he just said. John Kerry, former Secretary of State just said that Iran deserves credit for being restrained and reserved after that attack, attempted attack on our embassy, after everything they've done to kill American soldiers, build IEDs, the terrorism throughout the Gulf region. Our former Secretary of State just siding with Iran.\n\nHANSON: That's not the first time, Laura. Remember that during our discussions of getting out of the Iran deal, he was meeting in a shadow capacity in Paris with Iranian officials, in a way that would weaken our ability to protect our interests and get out of that flawed deal. And it's part of a larger narrative. They're really angry about the Soleimani death. But Donald Trump was very deliberate. He explained what happened. He didn't go to the White House Correspondents Dinner like Obama did and joke about predator assassination.\n\nHe didn't go on the campaign trail like Joe Biden. GM is alive, bin Laden is dead. He didn't cackle like Hillary Clinton when he said, we came, we saw, Gaddafi died. And so, it's been very serious, and I don't understand the schizophrenia that targeted assassinations are fine, we can joke about them and then - and the Logan Act exist here and there. But if there ever was a Logan Act, John Kerry has been violating it with his--\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, shuttle diplomacy, when he's no longer Secretary of State. Lee and Victor, fascinating. Thank you so much both of you. And we were told that the Democrats 2020 candidates were a veritable field of dreams. How many times have we hear that old trope? What happened? Well, my ANGLE explains next and then Dinesh D'Souza responds, it's going to be a doozy. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: The field of shattered dreams, that's the focus of tonight's ANGLE.\n\nIt began with such promise, didn't it? In their desperate desire to oust our incumbent president, the Democrat party produced more than 20 candidates, from political rookies to seasoned pros. They came from Texas, New Jersey, California, and places in between, all claiming to have what it took to dispatch their ultimate political nemesis, Donald Trump.\n\nWell, in the Democrats' case, if you built it with these goofballs, the people will run. But it wasn't so much the candidates' talent or skill set that excited the resistance media that was covering all of this. It was what the field collectively represented.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Democratic field is obviously big. It's more diverse than many other years.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: People really are excited about this field.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is the most diverse field for a nomination ever.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a field that I think Democrats can be proud of.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: The d-word, diversity. This was supposedly, of course, the most racially, ethically, gender diverse field of candidates the country had ever seen, the world had ever seen. It was just what the left had been waiting for after four years of Donald Trump. Surely alone the fact of diversity would bring back disaffected Democrats and independents, and trump Trump's booming the company.\n\nOr maybe not. After months of uninspiring stump speeches and lackluster debate performances, it became pretty clear, didn't it, that most of the candidates were duds. And starting in December, the diverse field started to vanish faster than a Jamie Lee Curtis film. First Kamala, as in Harris, bowed out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: Sorry.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nHARRIS: Right?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Then Julian Castro.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJULIAN CASTRO, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Keep reaching for your dream, and keep fighting for what you believe in. Ganaremos un dia.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: I love that stage shot.\n\nAnd today, we learned that Spartacus himself, it cannot be, Cory Booker, he's also calling it quits. Frankly, I was shocked, what with his high polling numbers of, I don't know, six percent? But let's not forget the Dems' latecomer candidate who had entered the race just seven weeks reinjecting the field with much-needed diversity and that common man's touch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I think the point that they are making and a lot of people are making is you are a billionaire who is buying this election. What is your response to this?\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, D-FORMER NEW YORK MAYOR, PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I'm not buying anymore. I'm doing exactly the same thing they are doing, except that I'm using my own money.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Trump calls him Mini-Michael Bloomberg. I think major, though, is more appropriate, as in major waste of money. So what now, though? I guess a lot of fretting and awkward admissions, that's what.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: A lot of folks pointing out, #demssowhite. You've got another candidate of color dropping out of the race. Kamala Harris is gone, Julian Castro is gone, now Cory Booker is gone.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It's going to be an overwhelmingly white debate, an all white debate.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: How one of the most diverse fields in the history of the Democratic Party came down to white candidates at the top of it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: So you live by the racial litmus test, you die by the racial litmus test. Instead of focusing on who the best candidate is, whatever color or gender, background, Democrats obsess on immutable characteristics. And they should never be the basis for promotions or jobs or political losses, not immutable characteristics, no. Ever heard of merit or experience or political talent?\n\nIt should also be noted that this stage of the 2016 election, at the same stage, the GOP actually itself had a more diverse field than the Democrats have now. They had an African-American candidate, Ben Carson, joining two Latino candidates, Cruz and Rubio. But remember, they are conservative, so they don't count in the Democrats' been counting.\n\nBut frankly, diversity is the least of the Democrats' worries, if you ask me. Their top three candidates, those old white folks, they are struggling to find a coherent message, and at this point are just at each other's throats. The Sanders campaign is reportedly telling volunteers manning the phone backs or knocking on doors to frame Warren as the candidate of the elites. When she heard this, Warren went on the warpath.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MASS., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I was disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me. He knows who I am, where I come from. We all saw the impact of the factionalism in 2016, and we can't have a repeat of that.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh, but she's trying, because Warren has begun pitching her on backchannel stories to the media in an effort to hobble Bernie. Here is today's headline from CNN. Bernie Sanders told Elizabeth Warren in private 2018 meeting that a woman can't win, sources say. But just hours ago, Warren went on record saying it's true, and that Sanders, quote, disagreed during their meeting that a woman could win the nomination.\n\nAnd then there is the frontrunner, Joe, what state am I in, Biden. Other than remind everyone that he was Obama's vice president for either years, what exactly is he doing to excite the Democrat base? He is a human gaffe- omatic, pulled his string and some crazy nonsense will come out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, (D) PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Corn-pop was a bad dude.\n\nPoor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids.\n\nMake sure the television -- excuse me, make sure you have the record player on at night.\n\nThis is the United States of America. There is nothing we are uncapable of doing.\n\nThe kid used to come up and reach into the poll and rub my leg down so it was straight, and then watch the hair come back up again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nINGRAHAM: I just can't. Sometimes, though, through all of that, sometimes voters probably just forget which Biden is actually running.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He's the only one who can beat Donald Trump in the November election, the only one. I know we have great Democrats, great Democrats running, great. Let them be secretaries of whatever.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Whatever.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump is enjoying the show from the White House. It sure looked like he was having fun Friday during our interview.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders seeming to make some headway against Elizabeth Warren in some polls. What do you make of this? Is Bernie Sanders really --\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Could be. It could be. Joe can't string together a sentence. He's having a hard time. The other day a number of times he couldn't distinguish between Iran and Iraq.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: The uphill battle that these Democrats face is November isn't because they are not diverse enough. It's because they are not pragmatic enough. Free health care, free college, free preschool, frozen fossil fuel industry, open borders, higher taxes -- it is not going to grow the economy. It's not going to grow your 401(k), your bank account, or whatever, as Jill Biden would say. Empowering governments means taking away power from you. More power for the government means less freedom for you. By the way, it's the same government that thinks wasting millions on dead- end investigations and impeachment is more important than infrastructure and lowering prescription drug prices. The 2020 Democrat field of dreams has turned into a mud pit, one that most voters just want to avoid.\n\nAnd that's THE ANGLE.\n\nJoining me now is Dinesh D'Souza, conservative author and filmmaker. Dinesh, did I miss anything about the Democrats' field of shattered dreams here?\n\nDINESH D'SOUZA, CONSERVATIVE FILMMAKER: I think you are quite right that they began with a diversity parade. You have two groups of people, the ones claiming to be diverse, Buttigieg, I'm gay, Cory Booker, I'm black, Kamala Harris, I'm black and a woman, so I'm a twofer. And then the other candidates like Elizabeth Warren and others, Beto, aspiring to be diverse, and pretending to be diverse in ways that they were not. So it was a diversity parade and a diversity charade.\n\nAnd then it all kind of imploded, and all these diverse candidates showed that they had lack of gravitas, they were downright silly, they fell away, and now you've got this kind of old white guys' parade that's left over.\n\nLook, the strongest candidate against Trump is going to be somebody who has to assure the country that they can keep the country safe, that they can protect a strong economy even while protecting the welfare state, a kind of pragmatic centrist, like you say. But they have driven those people out of the field, and they did it right at the beginning.\n\nINGRAHAM: Bernie Sanders, Dinesh, he says he's the guy. Check it out.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, D-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I am the strongest candidate to beat Trump. To beat Trump, you are going to need a massive voter turnout. And the only way you do that is through a campaign of energy, of excitement. You've got to bring working people, you've got to bring young people into the political process.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: He's on the rise right now, Dinesh, and Warren is taking a hit or two, and Bernie is trying to capitalize on it.\n\nD'SOUZA: Part of the reason why Warren has plummeted, I think, is because there's a fakery to her. The insincerity of even her dance moves are just so nausea inducing.\n\nBernie, for all his craziness, is nevertheless authentic. In fact, this is one characteristic he shares with Trump. People who meet Trump, people who encounter Trump, say this guy is real, he's the real deal. He is what he is. Bernie is what he is. Now, I don't like what he is. I just read an article about how Bernie was thrown out of a commune because he didn't want to do any work. He wanted to talk about politics all day. The commune was all about self-sufficiency, growing your own food. So Bernie is making the case for being a bum, and there's a little bit of us that wants to do that. We don't want to get off the couch, we don't want to go to work. So there is a little bit of us that is Bernie, and I think that's the secret of Bernie's appeal.\n\nINGRAHAM: All right, Dinesh, speak for yourself, OK. There's not a lot of time to sit on the couch at my house, but that's actually a good point. If you get kicked out of the commune because you are too lazy, that is actually just not a good thing. Dinesh, appreciate it tonight. Thanks so much.\n\nAnd coming up, this isn't California or New York. There is an all-out gun grab going on in the home state of the NRA. This is a can't-miss debate. Run on the guns under Governor Blackface -- sorry, Northam. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGOV. RALPH NORTHAM, D-VA.: We are not going to go door-to-door and confiscate individuals' weapons. We are going to pass common sense legislation that will keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep Virginia safer.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Governor Ralph Blackface Northam downplaying Democrats' plans to strip people of their Second Amendment rights. We've already seen this play out in California, New York, places like Massachusetts, Maryland, terrible on gun rights. Now you can add the Commonwealth of Virginia, perhaps, this list of states looking to, yes, take guns from the hands of law-abiding Americans.\n\nHere to debate is Jason Roberge, who is a veteran who is running for Congress in Virginia as a Republican. Along with me is Mark Levine, a Democrat Virginia state rep who is pushing many of these gun control measures. I want to add that Michael Bloomberg's group, he's running for president, 2020 tie in, has given 175k to the Democrat caucus in the Virginia state house to push these gun-grab initiatives. He's virulently anti Second Amendment. Jason, just how aggressive is this push going to be?\n\nJASON ROBERGE, R-VA. CONGRESSIONAL CANDIDATE: Sure. So The Democrats basically just started their session in Virginia.\n\nINGRAHAM: They run both houses.\n\nROBERGE: They run both houses. They have the House of Delegates and the State Senate there. And they also, Governor Northam has the governorship. They are introducing as many bills as they can to limit our rights. They are trying to take away our firearms any way they can. They want to up the age restriction, the age minimum to get the --\n\nINGRAHAM: The most important thing about this, and we are going to get to Mark in a second, the most important thing people have to understand, an assault style weapon -- people hear that and they think, oh, my God, a machine gun. No. What is an assault-style weapon under the statute? As I'm reading the statute, it's any semiautomatic weapon that holds 10, correct, 10 in the clip, 10 or more in the clip? Most Sig Sauer, we have pictures of them, Sig Sauer 9-millimeter, Glock 9 millimeter, ARs, AK style weapon, the most popular hunting rifle in the United States is the AR-15, correct, depending on the size of the clip would be banned, those style guns?\n\nROBERGE: Yes. Basically any of these guns that hold a resealable clip or magazine. The way you can read the statute, it's very vague. And they are purposely doing this because they want to take away millions and millions of these guns.\n\nINGRAHAM: Mark, is it true that these guns, however you want to define this assault style, and as a lawyer, the language, you could drive a truck through it, and they did it on purpose. But if this thing gets passed, there's no grandfather provision in the provision that most want, not grandfather provision, meaning you become a felon in the Commonwealth of Virginia if you have one of these weapons as a law-abiding citizen, yes or no?\n\nMARK LEVINE, D-VA. STATE REPRESENTATIVE: No. You are wrong. You need to read the bill. There is a grandfather clause.\n\nINGRAHAM: I have it. It didn't pass.\n\nLEVINE: You are allowed to keep your weapons. We're not taking people's guns away, and the list you gave is not an accurate list either. So no, I'm afraid you're misinformed.\n\nINGRAHAM: You define for our audience, OK, I challenge you to define what an assault-style weapon is under the statute's language.\n\nLEVINE: So it's very similar to what was under the federal assault weapons ban of 1994 to 2004. So it is having an extended magazine --\n\nINGRAHAM: Ten.\n\nLEVINE: A weapon that fits an extended magazine.\n\nINGRAHAM: Ten.\n\nLEVINE: More than 10 bullets.\n\nROBERGE: Why? How does that protect -- you're trying to protect the public, though.\n\nLEVINE: That's the same one that, by the way -- and to say it's against the Second Amendment, just to be clear, this has been consistently ruled by all the courts to be constitutional. First circuit, second circuit, third circuit, fourth circuit, D.C. So if you don't like it, you may not like it, but it is clearly within the Second Amendment. So let's just be clear about that. If you don't like it, go to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nROBERGE: How is it by limiting the number of bullets a gun can receive, how does that protect the public safety?\n\nLEVINE: That's a great question. Let me answer that question.\n\nROBERGE: OK, go ahead.\n\nLEVINE: So if you look at mass shooters, particularly look at what happened in Tucson, Gabby Giffords is alive today because the killer had to change the magazine. In Nashville, that brave men and the waffle house jumped on a person changing the magazine.\n\nINGRAHAM: Let's talk about the church in Texas.\n\nLEVINE: When you have to change a magazine --\n\nINGRAHAM: This is a game we can play all day long.\n\nLEVINE: When you have to change a magazine --\n\nINGRAHAM: Mark, stop grandstanding on my show. You can do it all day long. You can do it in a church where we have a person licensed to carry weapons as we had in Texas or Florida where people are allowed to carry a weapon that has an extended clip in it that's 10 or 12. And you can defend a lot of people getting killed with a clip that's 10 or more period. So the idea the government is going to tell you that you can't defend with a type of clip or magazine is obscene.\n\nLEVINE: Laura, if 12 people are coming to get, you are probably the bad guy. You do not need a 30-bullet magazine to hunt. If you can't shoot a deer in 10 bullets --\n\nINGRAHAM: We've got to go, but the government has no right to determine this, no right to do this. And they are not going to allow people to hold these guns.\n\nLEVINE: They do it in 10 states. Take it up with the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nROBERGE: It's a straw argument. It's a straw argument. It's a terrible argument.\n\nINGRAHAM: We will. We will take it to the court. Jason and Mark, this is a hot topic. We've got to do an hour on this topic, it's so hot.\n\nComing up, we bid adieu to someone who gave us great joy. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Tonight we remember our dear friend, Spartacus.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I will be a president for all people in America.\n\nI will have a woman running mate.\n\nI see every single day that this economy is not working for average Americans.\n\nDonald Trump is a guy who, you understand, he hurts you.

Booker confesses that he is a Trekkie.\n\nHere's a bit of advice to everybody. You're going to have a spectacular failure, have a documentary team there to capture it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Thanks to Samantha and Whitney for putting on that tearful goodbye.\n\nShannon Bream and the Fox New @ Night team, take it all from here.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

Authorities are investigating the death of a U.S. Marine who died of a gunshot wound early Tuesday inside a barracks on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., according to reports.\n\nThe gunshot was not self-inflicted, a D.C. police source told Washington's FOX 5.\n\nAuthorities believe the Marine was killed by another Marine by accident, during a shift change around 5 a.m., when weapons are unloaded before being handed off to the next shift, the report said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe injured Marine later was pronounced dead at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, the Washington Post reported.\n\nNo arrests were made, and neither Marine was identified.\n\nThe deceased Marine was described only as having been in his early 20s, the Post reported.\n\nAuthorities stressed that the investigation was in its early stages, according to the newspaper.\n\nThe shooting was at least the third at the Capitol Hill barracks in the last six years, according to the Post.\n\nThe previous incidents were both self-inflicted gunshot wounds, with one of them being fatal, the newspaper reported.
Christian Bale made his feelings about former Vice President Dick Cheney quite clear in his acceptance speech for the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Vice — and it was much different from the respect he showed Cheney in an interview with Fox News last month.\n\nBale, 44, thanked his wife, Sibi Blazic, profusely before getting political.\n\nThe critically acclaimed British actor said he was cornering the market on charisma-free a—holes ... What do we think, Mitch McConnell next?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHe added, Thank you to Satan for giving me inspiration to play this role.\n\nBale previously spoke to Fox News about playing Cheney, expressing his admiration for the former George W. Bush administration member, but he had never spoken about the Republican Majority Leader.\n\nHe was a wonderful family man — he's a great dad, he's an avid reader, he has a brain like a vice and he constantly reads history, Bale told Fox News of Cheney at the premiere of Vice on Dec. 11 in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was very laid-back. He would have been very happy to be a lineman in Wyoming if he hadn't met Lynne, who said to him, 'No, that doesn't cut it. You need some ambition.' What would have been if they hadn't met?\n\nHowever, when asked if he believes the real-life Cheney will find the movie enjoyable or irksome, Bale could only speculate.\n\nI think he'll certainly find it entertaining, at the very least. I think he's very thick-skinned — you know. He has no remorse or regrets about what he's done — he always says, 'I would do it again in a minute.' He doesn't back down — he doesn't apologize about anything, Bale said. So, I think he's a thick-skinned guy and I'd love to hear his thoughts. He's a very intelligent individual, no matter what your thoughts are about him — he's a smart cookie. So, I do hope so.\n\n'VICE' STAR CHRISTIAN BALE ON WHAT HE LEARNED ABOUT DICK CHENEY, WHY HE DON'T DO ANOTHER BODY TRANSFORMATION\n\n\n\nFans were struck when Bale first stepped out having put on weight to play Cheney in the film. As fans of the former Dark Knight star will note, he's prone to completely adjusting his body to better play a character. However, after the Cheney transformation, the actor admitted that this may have been the last major body change for the star.\n\nRight. Yeah, I think I'm done — you know. Everything hurts, he said with a laugh. Everything hurts now. I've gotten really stout thinking if I can manage this again, and the answer is probably no.\n\nVice also stars Amy Adams playing Lynne Cheney, Steve Carell as Donald Rumsfeld and Sam Rockwell as Bush and many others.\n\nVice led the Golden Globes nominations with six nods, but Bale's win was the film's only victory of the evening.\n\nLate Sunday, the Church of Satan responded to Bale's speech, tweeting, To us, Satan is a symbol of pride, liberty and individualism, and it serves as an external metaphorical projection of our highest personal potential. As Mr. Bale's own talent and skill won him the award, this is fitting. Hail Christian! Hail Satan!\n\nFox News' Julius Young contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from The Ingraham Angle, January 6, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nLAURA INGRAHAM, HOST: And yes, as Hannity said, I am back. And I'm Laura Ingraham. This is The Ingraham Angle from of course, we're back. So, it's a really busy Washington. Now, and moments, I am going to explain why the killing of an Iranian General Qasem Soleimani reveals Trump as a true pragmatist.\n\nAlso, two of the biggest Congressional players in the impeachment drama react to today's announcement from John Bolton about his potential testimony. Senator Ron Johnson and Congressman Doug Collins among others are here exclusively.\n\nPlus, President Trump has a way of revealing folks, doesn't he? For who they really are. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee, they're going to tell us how the Left and the media are now defending the world's largest state- sponsor of terrorism. I thought I'd seen it all until the last few days.\n\nAnd Raymond Arroyo is here. Now, this is special. It's a Monday appearance for Raymond. But of course, when the Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais gave celebs some really great advice at the award show. Too bad they didn't listen. He's going to explain later in the show why something I wrote 17 years ago was a little bit ahead of its time.\n\nBut first, Trump, the realist. That's the focus of tonight's Angle.\n\nAs with issues like immigration and trade, on the Iran situation, President Trump has been forced to clean up the messes created by previous two administrations. Now post 9/11, George W. Bush thought that once we invaded Iraq, WMD or no WMD, once we kill Saddam Hussein and then disbanded the Iraqi military. Well, democratic institutions would eventually take flower. Well, that was a colossal and cruel joke.\n\nThe Kurds were happy and did greet us as liberators. But with the evil Saddam gone, Iran was also empowered and started building many of the IEDs that killed so many coalition forces.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH, FORMER PRESIDENT: Major combat operations in Iraq have ended in the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. The transition from dictatorship to democracy will take time. But it is worth every effort.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: We're still waiting for that. Well, in February 2006, when I was broadcasting my radio show from Iraq, the enlisted soldiers, some on their third deployment at that point told me, they said Laura, the place is a disaster. Iran is crawling around everywhere or their emissaries. They're building these weapons that are blowing up my buddies. But back then, I frankly didn't want to believe it.\n\nNow two years later, Obama was elected in part on his promise to pull us out of Iraq. Of course, Obama took a completely different approach. He made things worse. He thought that as long as we ended combat operations in Iraq, we could bribe Iran to get better behavior from Iran. So, the $1.7 billion was the settlement of a decades old arbitration claim between the U.S. and Iran. An initial 400 million of euros, Swiss francs and other foreign currency was delivered on pallets, January 17th. Now that's the same day, Tehran agreed to release four American prisoners.\n\nNow, pallets of cash were delivered in the dark of night to the Iranian regime. Now, one of the most disgusting acts of American capitulation, I can recall in my lifetime. Remember also the Iran nuclear deal itself was full of holes, but Secretary of State John Kerry, he insisted it was the best we could do and thought Iran's signing on to that agreement would be a stabilizing process.\n\nOf course, nothing could have been further from the truth. There is no evidence that Iran started behaving any better after the deal and in no serious Republican or Democrat is even attempting at this point to argue that. Iran never released Bob Levinson, a former CIA officer, whom they've held for 13 years, ditto for at least five other American who've been held prisoner on absurd spurious grounds.\n\nTerror acts committed by Iran's proxies have continued unabated and the Islamic Republic was behind the rocket attacks on our embassy in Baghdad and in Basra in 2018. The Shiite militia rocket attack that killed an American contractor and wounded four U.S. troops, just two weeks ago was the 11th barrage in just two months.\n\nNow, this doesn't even take into account by the way all of the other American blood that they have on their hands.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are also responsible for 17 percent of all-American soldiers' deaths in the Iraq war between 2003 and 2011.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Back to the point I was making earlier about the time I was there in 2006 and what I was hearing. And General Qasem Soleimani, he wasn't some bit player in all of this.He was the orchestrator of these terrorist assaults. The attack on the U.S.\n\nembassy in Iraq was just the latest. He was also so brazen and so comfortable, this really blows my mind, by the way that he was freely operating at the Baghdad airport. I'm surprised he was like working in a bookstore there. He was planning to kill or terrorize more Americans, very bold about it.\n\nThus, handed these cards and with the escalation on the ground that put our troops and personnel at risk, Donald Trump had to weigh the options and he had to make a decision. So, was it better for the U.S. to allow Soleimani to parade openly around Iraq with no forceful response after he fomented the attack on our embassy and was plotting more?\n\nPresident Trump decided that the answer was an emphatic no.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We would've been culpably negligent had we not taken this action, the American people would have said that we weren't doing the right thing to protect and defend American lives. President Trump has been crystal clear.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Ordering an airstrike on Soleimani was given all the facts and all the history, we just went over. A perfectly reasonable decision. So, will this trigger some retaliation from Iran? Perhaps. But the world's leading state-sponsor of terrorism, they certainly didn't need any excuse to wreak havoc against American interests. They've been doing that for a long time. They've been our enemy for like over 40 years.\n\nDemocrats accuse the President of acting precipitously though and destabilizing the region, which isn't surprising. If Trump says the sky is up, they're going to say, it's down. But think about this for a moment.\n\nMost Democrats today believe that we as Americans are safer with that murderous thug alive and boldly spreading his influence in the country where we lost thousands of our servicemen? Really? These are the same people by the way who called themselves anti-war when Obama was president. But they never gave Trump credit for his policy of military restraint.\n\nAs is so often the case, Trump forces Democrats to reveal themselves and the media. They're so caught up with resisting and hating Trump for everything he does and breeze that over the weekend, they literally sounded more empathetic to the mourners of an Iranian mass murderer than to the families of the soldiers he killed and maimed with attacks carried out inside Iraq.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: In Iran, he is seen as a revered military leader. So, he had enormous respect and position there.\n\nFAREED ZAKARIA, CNN HOST: It's difficult to convey how revered he is in Iran. This guy is regarded in Iran as a completely heroic figure, personally very brave.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It was a targeted attack on a government, official, a high-ranking military official.\n\nANDERSON COOPER, CNN HOST: I was trying to think of somebody, and I was thinking of de Gaulle.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Remember, when Bill Marr got into all that trouble for saying the9/11 attackers were a reference and as courageous. What are these guys doing? Whereas Bush was too idealistic about what was possible in Iraq and whereas Obama was too defeatist about Iran, Trump's a realist, he's a pragmatist.\n\nHe made a calculation that as long as this general was alive, things would be more dangerous for the United States. Soleimani was not acting as a brake on the Iranian regime. He was acting as an accelerant.\n\nIt's the Democrats position of appeasement toward Iran that's endangered American interests and allies for years and years. If our position, a friend of mine gave me this idea, I wish I could claim it as my own. But if our position right now, we listen to the Democrats is that we cannot eliminate a known and unrepentant terrorist for fear of reprisals from his homeland. Then that means the situation in the region is truly hopeless.\n\nAnd thus, if that's what we believe, then we should agree all of us on an immediate withdrawal of all troops from the region. Otherwise, the troops are just sitting ducks along with contractors, NGOs et cetera.\n\nPresident Trump decided that the status quo was unacceptable. He was and is correct. Now, I want to say it's very important. You know my views on these endless wars. It's important that the President listens to his judgment here, that he doesn't listen to the same people who got sucked into Iraq in the first place.\n\nThe Bush doctrine is dead, and Trump helped bury it. Thank God. His recent tweets notwithstanding, the President, I think is very smart, he's very smart enough to know that another war of choice or needless escalation will end up harming American interests, not to speak of his re-election chances.\n\nAmerica First, America Safe, America Strategic, America Smart. And that's The Angle.\n\nAll right, joining me now is Congressman Michael Waltz, House Armed Services Committee Member and the first Green Beret to serve in Congress.\n\nAlso, with me is retired Brigadier General, Robert Spaulding, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute and a former Director for Strategy at the NSC, as well as Victor Davis Hanson, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution.\n\nCongressman Waltz let's start with you.\n\nWhy are the Left and the Never Trumpers really upset that Trump acted?\n\nREP. MICHAEL WALTZ, R-FLA.: Well, first I want to say Laura, you're absolutely right and as a combat veteran, I find it appalling, some of this criticism. And my question for the Left is, how many American body bags are enough. Because apparently, 600 wasn't enough from the Iraq war and we want to just have more and more and more before it's OK for the President to stop this escalation and act.\n\nAnd secondly, you know they've got this false choice that they're throwing out there, either we do nothing and continue to appease the terrorists, or we have World War III with D-Day style invasions of Tehran. There is a lot of room in between. There is a lot of options. That is not on the table and nor does the President need authorization to defend our embassies, to defend our troops to strike back and to stop this escalation. He's absolutely right. We're preventing further war. We're not escalating into war. We're stopping Iran's escalation. And I think it was absolutely the right move.\n\nINGRAHAM: First, the Democrats, they didn't like that Trump was pulling troops out of the Middle East, trying to end these endless wars. Now, they're upset that he's taking action.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y.: I really worry that the actions the President took will get us into what he calls another endless war in the Middle East.\n\nIf in Congress and I will do everything I can to assert our authority, we do not need this President either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: General?\n\nBRIG GEN ROBERT SPALDING, SENIOR FELLOW, HUDSON INSTITUTE: Well, this I mean clearly what the President did improved our - probably our stability in the Middle East and security of American forces there, for two reasons.\n\nOne, deterrence is about capability and intent. The strike clearly shows the President's intent to punish Iran, if they cross the line.\n\nAnd second, Soleimani was hopscotching around the Middle East--\n\nINGRAHAM: It's unbelievable.\n\nSPALDING: Creating chaos, everywhere he went. Quite frankly, I'd given up hope that we were going to do the right thing with regard to his actions all the way back to my time in Iraq back in 2007.\n\nWALTZ: We should have a long time ago. A long time ago.\n\nINGRAHAM: Literally. I was rah rah war in Iraq, because I love our troops. I support our troops. Those enlisted guys remember Trump met with the enlisted soldiers couple of weeks ago. They kept saying, Iran, the story is Iran. Don't drop Iran. That's the story. Remember, General Casey, he didn't really want to get into the Iran situation with me in an interview. I like him a lot, but he didn't want to touch that. I'm telling you; this Iran thing has been brewing for so long, it's been happening for deadly consequences.\n\nWALTZ: A terrorist is a terrorist whether they're Shia or Sunni, whether they're wearing a foreign uniform or whether they're not.\n\nSPALDING: We spent billions on MRAPs and we never did a thing about the IEDs that were the cause of having to build those MRAPs.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well we - Victor Davis Hanson, I want to go to you on this.\n\nBernie Sanders spoke out tonight about this situation. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: You can say there are a lot of bad people all over the world running governments. The President of China now has put a million people in - Muslims into educational camps, some would call them concentration camps. But once you start this business of a major country saying, hey, we have the right to assassinate, then you are unleashing international anarchy.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Victor, he also compared this to Putin's killing his dissidents. He also said that. Reaction.\n\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, SENIOR FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTE: Yes, I think that Trump has really confused people, Laura, because he showed restraint by not reacting to the interception of ships in the Gulf of Hormuz earlier. He didn't react to the drone attack. And then when he did, he didn't brag about it.\n\nRemember in 2012, Joe Biden toured the country right before the campaign or during the campaign said, bin Laden is dead. GM is alive. Then when Hillary went into Libya and Gaddafi was pretty horrifically murdered on the street, she said, we came, we saw, ha-ha-ha, he died. He hasn't done that.\n\nAnd I think what Trump - everybody understands, and this is what frustrates the Democrats is, he's got a very unique view of the Middle East. He's saying you know what we don't need its oil anymore, we're self-sufficient.\n\nIsrael is self-sufficient in oil. The Arab street is on our side, it's anti-Iranian and the Palestinians have lost their global resonance.\n\nAnd so, it's a new situation, the Middle East is not in the middle of anything anymore and yet he's saying that in this situation with Iran, we were very patient and now we've reestablished deterrence and the levers that adjudicate whether one side wins or loses a war or diplomatic, economic and military. And in this particular situation with Iran they have neither. None of those three and all their decisions are bad in their case.\n\nAnd Trump is saying, we reacted. I showed restraint. Now it's your turn, see what you're going to do, and I don't think they're going to do what everybody thinks we're going to do, because they don't really have any options.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nHANSON: And it's very hard to be an interventionist when - yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, and even Merkel was saying, it was justified. But I want to go back to this point because I am not a neoconservative. I do believe we have wasted an enormous amount of blood and treasure and the American people clearly don't want that; we're never going back to those days Those days are over. The Republican Party and they don't want that anymore. Maybe people at defense contractors want it and make a lot of money, I understand that, but that's what not the people want.\n\nThe Atlantic today, I'm going to read this. Title was, it's 2003 all over again, Congressman Waltz. The factors that made the Iraq war a disaster are present here, false and dubious claims, hubristic thinking, lack of foresight and planning, civilian military divides, ideology eclipsing practical strategy, all of this means that while the Iran crisis might not be the disaster on the scale of the Iraq war, it could easily be a disaster. Your reaction to that. Are we creeping into a potential long conflict with Iran?\n\nWALTZ: No, I don't think we are. I think this was a response to stop the series of escalations. The President's made it clear that if they escalate again, our response will be overwhelming. The last thing the Iranian regime wants is a war with the United States because the thing they value the most is their own survival and they know they would be destroyed in such a conflict. They have in a whole history of escalating right up to the edge and when faced with strength, they backed down.\n\nWhen faced with weakness, they're emboldened, and they'll continue.\n\nINGRAHAM: I just still can't believe; he was in the airport.\n\nWALTZ: Until--\n\nINGRAHAM: It's unbelievable.\n\nWALTZ: They're stopped. So, I think that's the dynamic. The President understands the dynamic. And to the Atlantic, we're not looking to build Switzerland. The Trump administration is not looking to create Switzerland or a perfect democracy, but we do still have a counter-terrorism mission.\n\nAnd what Obama missed was just pull everybody home and wish the problem away.\n\nINGRAHAM: Give them their rights.\n\nWALTZ: Right. And we got ISIS, we got attacks throughout Europe. We got inspired attacks in the United States. So, even though the energy play is lessened, the counter-terrorism piece is still real. But that doesn't mean we have a million American troops; we can do that with a very small footprint forward.\n\nINGRAHAM: General Spalding, a lot of people on the Left are focusing on the reference to the cultural sites in a tweet by the President, saying that that comment - even a reference to it, reference to it could unify the Iranian people who don't even agree on these issues and probably want this regime gone against Washington. Are you concerned about that?\n\nSPALDING: I actually think the Iranian leadership is going to have to take a reassessment based on the strike. So, whatever language the President uses, it kind of reinforces this sense of unpredictability on - so they don't know where the line is. And if they don't know where the line is, they have to reassess. And I think you're going to see a level of stability as a result, not just in Iran. I think it sends a message to Beijing, to Moscow and Pyongyang that they need to pay attention to what the President is saying.\n\nINGRAHAM: VDH, really quickly. Speaking of China, I'm always focused on China you know. Victor and I are China focused as is General Spalding. What are they thinking here? What's their angle on this potential conflagration if there is one?\n\nHANSON: They don't know what Trump is going to do. They didn't think he would ever initiate tariffs. North Korea doesn't know what he's going to do. And so, meanwhile, time and all three of these situations on the U.S.\n\nside because China needs a recalibration of this tension with us. It's not sustainable for them.\n\nAnd the same thing with North Korea, these sanctions are sharvy North Korea and all of the cards, everybody is hysterical Laura, but the cards - if you just look at it dispassionately or on our side with Iran, with North Korea, with China, it will just calm down and let these things play out. We're the ones with the sanctions. We're the ones with a strong economy. We're the ones with the largest military. And as long as we don't overreach or try to as you say nation build or go into some large expedition, we're in great shape.\n\nINGRAHAM: Trump's not going to do that.\n\nHANSON: I think that's what's frustrating with the Democrats. I think they understand that. They don't know what to do about it.\n\nINGRAHAM: But you see Chuck Schumer reading those comments. I mean he's been in Senate for like decades. He should read his comments. He knows what he thinks, doesn't he or does he not? What do you think? When he's on the Sunday shows. Very odd.\n\nGentlemen, great discussion. Thank you so much, all of you.\n\nWALTZ: Thank you.\n\nINGRAHAM: And John Bolton says, he's now willing to testify in the Senate impeachment trial, if he's subpoenaed. But is that going to happen? And what effect will it have? Senator Ron Johnson is here exclusively with reaction. Plus, was killing Soleimani illegal. That's new thing they're claiming. Congressman Doug Collins, I cannot wait to hear him on that. Stay there.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: Oh! Could the Left actually see one of their impeachment fantasies come to fruition. John Bolton testifying in the Senate trial.\n\nWhile the former National Security Adviser said today that he would testify if he received a Senate subpoena. If. Of course, Democrats are using this as a political cudgel against Republicans.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSCHUMER: Given that Mr. Bolton's lawyers have stated, he has new and relevant information to share. If any Senate Republican opposes issuing subpoenas to the four witnesses and documents we've requested, they would make it absolutely clear, they are participating in a cover-up.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: So, the senators are participating in a cover-up or the White House. I'm trying to keep it all straight. Our next guest actually spoke to John Bolton about the Ukraine mess last August, I shouldn't think the Left should be celebrating.\n\nJoining me now, exclusively Senator Ron Johnson, Chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee. Senator, Bolton seems like he's latest in the long line of the silver bullets, the Left believes it has here. What do you think?\n\nSEN. RON JOHNSON (R-WI): Well, first of all, Happy New Year, Laura.\n\nINGRAHAM: Happy New Year. Thanks for coming on. We've been trying to get you in a while.\n\nJOHNSON: I'm not sure what else John would really add to this. I haven't spoken to him since - we really talking about Ukraine. We share the same position, but from my standpoint, President Trump has been unbelievably consistent in why he had reservations about Ukraine. And it starts as a candidate when he didn't think Europe was doing enough in their own defense. And then, throw that into that mix, the corruption of Ukraine.\n\nThat's what he stated in the White House on March 23rd.\n\nHe was consistent in my conversation on August 31st and talking to John Bolton, making the same point. So, I don't know what else he would add. But the House obviously didn't make their case, so they're hoping that the Senate will make the case for them. That's not our job.\n\nINGRAHAM: But what is that scenario, where the House doesn't go to court to get it - to try to enforce a subpoena, but now they're like foisting it on McConnell. So, now McConnell - you have to--\n\nJOHNSON: We're supposed to.\n\nINGRAHAM: You have to issue a subpoena that would - that - you have to go to court, get a subpoena and push it forward. How does that ever work?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, I don't think it does.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nJOHNSON: And so again, I don't know what Nancy Pelosi is doing to me. Her strategy seems totally bizarre. What I hope is this week, our conference will come together. I don't think we should let Nancy Pelosi run the Senate. And so, the Wall Street Journal, you should have had a column a couple weeks ago basically suggesting we should change the rules of Senate, don't require articles of impeachment be delivered. They already voted on it. We take up the trial. We basically tell Nancy Pelosi; we start the trial Tuesday at 1 o'clock.\n\nINGRAHAM: Show up or not.\n\nJOHNSON: Bring your managers, if not the President's team will have his defense ready. And if you don't put out a case, we'll rule it to the President's defense. And by the way I think that's essential, I think the President needs a chance to defend himself.\n\nINGRAHAM: I don't like this idea of this hanging out over him during an election. That would be kind of a strategy on the part of the Democrats albeit a weak one. So, how do you avoid that?\n\nJOHNSON: Or during a crisis in Iran.\n\nINGRAHAM: Right.\n\nJOHNSON: Laura, there has been so much damage already been done to this country--\n\nINGRAHAM: Horrific.\n\nJOHNSON: Because of this. The fact that now any future president will have a hard time having a candid conversation with another world leader, because we've exposed these transcripts and of course within two weeks of this President taking office, conversations between world leaders were leaked. I don't know who President Trump can trust inside the administration. Think of that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, he still has people on the National Security Council, detail staff who are working against his policies, burrowed in right now.\n\nThey are there.\n\nJOHNSON: You tailored the news stories came out after the missile attack against General Soleimani.\n\nINGRAHAM: Soleimani.\n\nJOHNSON: And yes, there are still people leaking inside the administration, trying to undermine his policies.\n\nINGRAHAM: Ben Carton (ph) said, you must hear this testimony from Bolton.\n\nHe had direct knowledge intimately involved in conversations with the President. And if you don't, then basically implying you're all part of a cover-up.\n\nJOHNSON: Well, if it was that crucial, why didn't the House go to court and try and get that testimony?\n\nINGRAHAM: They said, they didn't want to drag this out. They wanted to get this impeachment before Christmas, Senator.\n\nJOHNSON: And so now, she's holding out the articles of impeachment, it makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nINGRAHAM: So, you think in the Senate, this thing should be dealt with expeditiously and would you have an opportunity to appoint or ask for managers to come? Maybe, she didn't pick them.\n\nWhy can't someone else pick them?\n\nJOHNSON: I would just give her the opportunity. Your managers can show up at 1:00 on Tuesday, next Tuesday, and put on the case. We will give you 24 hours of floor time. If you don't show up, the president's team will be ready. We'll give his team 24 hours. And then we will decide what to do.\n\nMy guess is we've heard enough. It's such a weak case.\n\nINGRAHAM: How many votes do you need to change the rule?\n\nJOHNSON: Fifty-one. Fifty-one.\n\nINGRAHAM: Only 51.\n\nJOHNSON: Yes.\n\nINGRAHAM: I can't wait to see how this plays out. But it's too serious not to deal with expeditiously. Senator, thanks for coming in tonight. I really appreciate it.\n\nAnd speaking of impeachment, one House Democrat now suggesting that they add a new article -- killing a terrorist.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. RO KHANNA, D-CALIF.: He would be, again, violating the Constitution by disregarding Congress. And it's illegal. It's, frankly, another impeachable offense for him to continue an escalation without Congress's authorization.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Are you suggesting that if the president did not abide by a resolution if it were to be passed by the House, by Congress, that you would potentially add that to articles of impeachment against him?\n\nKHANNA: It's definitely on the table. There is no greater offense, in my view, than sending American troops to war without congressional authorization.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Again, we keep saying we thought we'd heard it all. But here to respond, Doug Collins, ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nCongressman, Democrats didn't seem to care when Obama was droning individual citizens abroad, including Americans, didn't ask for permission, didn't ask for consultation. It just happened. What is different?\n\nDOUG COLLINS, R-GA., HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE: Nothing is different except Obama was president and now Trump. Mr. Trump is actually doing something that actually helps out country. What's offensive is Ro Khanna.\n\nLet's just be honest, here. Every time he opens his mouth it's not helpful to America. It's not helpful to anything.\n\nThey just came off an impeachment issue in the House, and I think what is actually happening is Nancy Pelosi is sitting here saying, oh, my God, this was so bad. This was actually worse than I thought it was, but I had to do it to appease my left. And now let me just hold it out here and play political. If I was one of her 31 members who were in Trump districts, and after she went up and got real solemn and said this is duty and our solemn, sworn --\n\nINGRAHAM: Prayerful.\n\nCOLLINS: Prayerful. This really is our duty, and it's a conscience vote.\n\nAnd then within an hour you go out and use it as a political toy. Nancy Pelosi, she has no credibility, and Ro Khanna has less than her.\n\nINGRAHAM: Cory Booker, one of the many Democrats speaking out about a supposed violation of the War Powers Act by the president in dealing with Soleimani. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. CORY BOOKER, D-N.J., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It is dangerous now to allow the president of the United States to grow in war powers, undermining those checks and balances, because you may have a sober, deliberative president like President Obama, but the next one could be an impulsive, capricious, un-strategic thinker like President Trump.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCOLLINS: Wow. Deliberative, this the President Obama who sat in the White House and allowed basically drones to attack anything that he wanted to and got complete immunity from the left, complete immunity from the Democrats.\n\nAnd now you have a president who took out a general who had blood on his hands? What do we say to somebody, what do we say to these troops having to go there? What do we say, this was said by my friend Mike Wallace, what do we say to those Gold Star families, what do we say to those who have been maimed, what do we say to those who Soleimani did to our country, and when we had a chance to take him out the president acted in very realist terms, as you said earlier. And we did it with purpose.\n\nHere's the problem, the War Powers Act is not covered under that. This is a president taking a self-defense action for our country, taking it directly to our enemy, taking it directly to someone who previous administrations said was a terrorist and was committing terrorist acts. He was not even supposed to be out of Iran. Think about this, under the old agreement, he was not even supposed to be traveling around like he was.\n\nINGRAHAM: Iran was also boasting that it was gradually eroding any thought of really abiding by this ridiculous Iran nuclear deal. Over the summer, they continued to talk, we're not going to be doing this. So we couldn't trust them, never could, despite Obama's idealistic, naive approach.\n\nCOLLINS: Laura, you just told me something amazing, that they actually attempted to keep this up. They never attempted to keep this up. The moment after it was signed, they were still traveling. Soleimani was traveling. They were still testing their weapons. They were still running the centrifuges. This was simply an appeasement by the Obama administration. The president had to clean it up. In this essence, he did. And what we've got also to think about now is Iraq is being run by Iran. This is what we have to understand.\n\nINGRAHAM: Should we pull out of Iraq?\n\nCOLLINS: I think we have got a small footprint there. We're talking about to do exactly what we need to do. We don't need to be sending troops back in. What we need to do is be able to --\n\nINGRAHAM: He is sending more troops over there?\n\nCOLLINS: Well, I think he's sending in there to be -- again, what amazed me, when you had the Democrats said, oh, we have no plan for this. The president has a plan for this. He understands that there's going to be attacks. Again, what they don't like is here's a president being a president. This is what they have not seen in eight years. They saw an appeasing president. They saw a president who drew red lines in the sand and said oh, we might do this, but didn't do it. President Obama made promises he didn't keep. President Trump makes promises he keeps.\n\nINGRAHAM: Prediction, will Nancy Pelosi send those articles of impeachment this week to the Senate?\n\nCOLLINS: I hope so. I think it's time to stop playing with this country.\n\nIt's time to stop playing with the voters of this country. It's time to stop playing in the destruction of democracy that they did in the House of Representatives. They broke every rule to get here. It's now time -- if you have such a strong case, then Adam Schiff, I think what they need to find is go after to the Wizard of Oz. They need to find the Wizard and find some courage. They need to find heart, because they've lost it complete. If they have a case, then make their case. If not, shut up.\n\nINGRAHAM: Dismiss this thing, get it on for the country's sake. Congressman, great to see you.\n\nCOLLINS: Good to see you as well.\n\nINGRAHAM: First appearance in the new year by Collins.\n\nUp next, Trump has once again lured the left into defending what most of us think is indefensible. It doesn't stop them. Mollie Hemingway, Mike Huckabee are here, and they're going to tell us why liberals keep falling into this trap.\n\nAnd what do Golden Globes, that ridiculous awards ceremony, tell us about the next election, if anything? Stay tuned.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You remove Soleimani from the battlefield, but we have increased threats to Americans.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is a bad guy. He's gone now. But the point is, what is Trump's foreign policy? It's incoherent.\n\nREV. AL SHARPTON, CIVIL RIGHTS ACTIVIST: No one is a sympathizer of the general. We are talking about the act, and we're talking about the fact that now we are upping the ante, talking about war crimes.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: They're not even making any sense. Yes, he is a bad guy, but. If Ronald Reagan was the great communicator, Trump could be the great revealer. At every turn he is forcing Democrats to stumble all over their words, completely contradict what they said five minutes ago, and also the media, they are showing their true colors as well. In this case, they seem to be standing with Iran's sovereign right to exist to foment terror around the world.\n\nJoining me now, Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at The Federalist, Fox News contributor, and Mike Huckabee, former GOP presidential candidate and Fox News contributor as well. Mollie, the president once again has the left all tied up in knots on this Soleimani thing. At the end of it you might as well thought he just worked at an NGO and was bandaging up poor animals who were caught in some horrible natural disaster by the way they're talking about him.\n\nMOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, THE FEDERALIST: It does seem that they're having trouble sticking with a particular narrative when it comes to Soleimani, Iran. First, they're telling us it's no big deal. Then they're highlighting the people who are mourning his death. They said that Trump doing this might have been a wag the dog effort to distract from impeachment. Last week supposedly he couldn't wait for impeachment, which is why Nancy Pelosi had such leverage. They can't stick with a particular storyline and it's making them looking like the only thing that they are consistent, and it is what they're consistent about, is opposition to Trump.\n\nINGRAHAM: Governor Huckabee, when you think about how Trump has been an advocate for a more restrained approach to deployment of our military, and you I have talked about this, he's never gotten any credit for that from the left, not at all. But now they are mad that he is actually doing something to protect American interests against this craven mass murderer.\n\nMIKE HUCKABEE, FORMER ARKANSAS GOVERNOR: He is not sending thousands of troops into ground combat, but he has taken on a mass murderer, a person who has not only killed over 700 Americans, but a person who has killed tens of thousands, we don't even know how many, of his own people in Iran.\n\nThis person is not a nice guy, and why anyone is defending him. It's only good reason for people of America to say do I really want to elect Democrats who hate Donald Trump even more than they detest a mass murderer?\n\nAnd the truth is, no, they just can't stand him. And they will side with Iranian government and all of its excesses of terror before they will appreciate this president.\n\nI just want to remind you, Laura, when Usama bin Laden was killed and Obama ordered it, I celebrated that publicly and on television, and I praised him and said I am glad the president made the decision. I think every Republican did. Why can't Democrats accept this? And I heard one of them the other day say it was the right thing to do but the wrong person did it.\n\nThat's how sick they are. That's sick.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, you can't even -- there's no words to describe a reaction like that.\n\nMollie, Barbara lee joined the Jayapal bandwagon with a tweet saying the following, People of Iranian descent including American citizens and Green Card holders are reportedly being detained by Customs and Border Patrol officials. We can't let this stand. Please contact my district office.\n\nIt gives her phone number. It turns out the CBP debunked this entire report. So this is like the -- there was a red scare. This is the Trump scare. Everything is an internment camp, basically.\n\nHEMINGWAY: And people really should be skeptical when they are told things. The previous two presidents had problems trusting intelligence that they shouldn't have trusted. You can never get mad at people for asking to the goods on intelligence or being skeptical that another president will embroil us in a war in the Middle East. But yes, you need to check your facts, and you need to not fall for conspiracy theories and whatnot. And that's not happening.\n\nINGRAHAM: Governor, real quick, I had to get reaction to this latest leftist outrage. When the evangelicals laid hands on and they prayed over the president on Friday, some in the media reacted in total horror, calling it cult-like. But when church members lay hands on Biden to pray, it's an inspirational, moving moment. What does that tell us?\n\nHUCKABEE: It's just the absurdity of what we are dealing with. Some people eat their soup louder than others. It doesn't mean their soup tastes better. Some people are very expressive in their faith, others are very reserved. But the point is, if Donald Trump is a part of anything that is spiritual or the evangelicals are around him, it's cult-like. But if it happens with Biden, it's just a wonderful expression of an affirmation of a faith that he doesn't practice very well because he is supposedly to be a Catholic, but he's yet pro-abortion. That's a hard one to reconcile.\n\nINGRAHAM: Mollie, real quick, do you think Nancy Pelosi sends the articles of impeachment to the Senate, yes or no?\n\nHEMINGWAY: I do think they'll get sent. I think that she tried her gambit. It totally failed. And she has no option but to send them.\n\nINGRAHAM: Got to get it in the rearview at this point. Governor and Mollie, thanks so much.\n\nIf you missed the Golden Globes last night, there are a few moments that you have to recapture and revisit with Raymond Arroyo who will join us in a special appearance, never shows up on Mondays, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nINGRAHAM: It's time for the Golden Globes with Raymond Arroyo. Host and comedian Ricky Gervais exposes Hollywood hypocrisy in the woke celebrities.\n\nThey all ignore his advice. Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo here with all details. All right, Raymond, I thought for a second you were going to wear a tuxedo and really embarrass yourself. But tell us about Ricky Gervais, liberal, Atheist, Trump-hating Ricky Gervais.\n\nRAYMOND ARROYO, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: I hate to tell you, I am wearing a tuxedo, but we'll get past that. He pulled no punches. Right out of the gate, Laura, Gervais said we are going to get laughs at Hollywood's expense, and then he offered them this warning.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRICKY GERVAIS, COMEDIAN: If you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech. You are no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. Most of you spent less time in school than Greta Thunberg.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nGERVAIS: So if you win, come up, accept your little award, thank your agent and your God and --\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: Laura, let me tell you, Gervais really stole the Golden Globes. He won the Golden Globes. Don't tell the folks at the L.A. Times that.\n\nTheir TV critic Lorraine Ali said he was disrespectful, disingenuous, and he could not read the room. My take is he was reading the living rooms across America. This is what people have been saying for years. They hate the politics at these award shows. And maybe these celebs should have heeded Gervais advice, Laura, but they didn't. Michelle Williams won a Golden Globe for playing Gwen Verdon on an FX show, but all she could talk about was not her career but how it was made possible by abortion.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I wouldn't have been able to do this without employing a woman's right to choose, to when to have my children and with whom.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: She then encouraged women to rush to the voting booths this November, Laura, to protect abortion rights. Again, so out of touch. This is why, incidentally, the ratings have fallen, yet again, to an eight-year low for this broadcast.\n\nINGRAHAM: Raymond, 17 years ago I wrote Shut Up and Sing. Shut up and sing, shut up and act, shut up and direct. It's 2003, I am glad Ricky Gervais has come along to my views. And what about Patricia Arquette. By the way, she blocked me on Twitter. I just found that out. She could not help getting political.\n\nARROYO: I saw that.\n\nINGRAHAM: Yes, she could not help getting political. She's now a foreign policy expert?\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We're not going to won't look back on this night in the history books. We will see a country on the brink of war. So while I love my kids so much, I beg of us all to give them a better world. We have to vote in 2020 and we have beg and plead for everyone we know to vote in 2020.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nARROYO: Laura, looking at Patricia Arquette, I'm reminded of something my wife Rebecca mentioned as we watched this. For all the talk of respecting women and the era of Me Too hanging over this awards ceremony, I think there was some confusion among certain actress about exactly what the Golden Globes referred to. There was more cleavage on that stage than the San Andreas fault, Laura. I could not believe some of these outfits.\n\nThroughout the ceremony it seemed the outfits got worse and worse. Like Frederick's of Hollywood were dressing these women. It was really an outrageous, I have to say. The whole evening got worse and worse.\n\nINGRAHAM: Now, Raymond, first of all, you wrote a great piece on the Golden Globes at FOXnews.com, which everybody should check out. But from beginning to end, other than Gervais, it was one incomprehensible moment after another. And Joaquin Phoenix, God bless him, he's a great actor, but what was he even saying?\n\nARROYO: They were talking about, by the way, Laura, the Australian fires. They just arrested 12 people in Australia for those fires. They were blaming it on climate change. Wrong again.\n\nINGRAHAM: Raymond, fantastic analysis. We've got to go, and we'll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are a lot of Australians in the room tonight, and I know we are all very grateful for the call outs to our fellow compatriots who are suffering.\n\nWhen one country faces a climate disaster, we all face of climate disaster.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nINGRAHAM: Well, as Raymond noted, there are reports tonight out of Australia that it was arson, perhaps not climate change. Well, they have arrested many people who apparently have been found with accelerants and other arson-related material.\n\nWe'll bring you updates on that. And it's raining. Four days of rain expected in key parts of Australia. That's great news.\n\nNow, that's all the time we have tonight. It's good to be back. Shannon Bream and the Fox News @ Night team take it all from here.\n\nShannon, I intruded on your hour, and I apologize greatly. I just -- I blew the clock. It's my fault.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

It's been a couple of days since now-Senator Mitt Romney's petty and divisive Washington Post op-ed smearing President Trump. The failed 2012 presidential candidate also made his feelings known about him in March of 2016 when he gave a speech condemning, again, the character of then-candidate Trump.\n\nIn that earlier screed, he also predicted that Trump's economic ideas would be a disaster for the country, and would lead entrepreneurs and businesses of all stripes to flee America. That prediction, like all the rest of his enraged pearl-clutching that night, didn't age well.\n\nIn the aftermath of that 2016 attempted knee-capping of candidate Trump, I was especially struck by Romney's ostentatious moral preening. This week he returned, standing upon his same well-tended molehill of superiority to again point at and accuse the president of, sigh, being a bad, bad man.\n\nTAMMY BRUCE: MELANIA TRUMP, FIRST LADY AND ROLE MODEL, RISES ABOVE DEMOCRATIC PETTINESS\n\nBut Romney's effort casting himself as the arbiter of character rings hollow for some who worked on, or were involved with, the Romney 2012 campaign for the presidency.\n\nOver the years, our current Ambassador to Germany and former Fox News contributor, Richard Grenell, and I became friends. Everyone was very excited when Romney, having won the GOP nomination in 2012, chose Ric to be his national security spokesman for the campaign. As the New York Times put it at the time, Mr. Grenell, a 45-year-old with a sharp wit, had joined the Romney campaign in April with sterling recommendations from Bush-era foreign policy figures, and an impressive résumé. He had served as a United States spokesman at the United Nations under four ambassadors during the Bush administration…\n\nChoosing Ric as his campaign national security spokesman was a natural and inspired choice. But when character mattered, Romney choked.\n\nWhile the following details have been presumed by many and written about by some, they have never been confirmed by Ric, who has a policy to never speak publicly about those for whom he has worked. Over the years, however, he has spoken to me about the details of his time on the campaign. But now, as Romney struts in with his smug rehab as the nation's moral arbiter, a more complete picture of the politician is warranted.\n\nAfter just three weeks with the Romney campaign, Ric resigned. There has been speculation about what exactly led to his departure. The fact of the matter is he was pushed out after Mr. Romney failed both a character and moral test: to stand up for someone he hired who was being attacked for being gay.\n\nBut it wasn't just refusing to stand up for someone he knew was the best person for the job. The Romney campaign responded to the criticism by asking Ric to stay quiet and not speak publicly about anything. The character-filled Romney was asking the gay man to go hide in the closet.\n\nThe last straw was when the Romney campaign told Ric to pretend he wasn't present during a conference call he arranged. In the aftermath, the New York Times reported of the bizarre scene, It was the biggest moment yet for Mitt Romney's foreign policy team: a conference call last Thursday, dialed into by dozens of news outlets from around the globe, to dissect and denounce President Obama's record on national security, reported the newspaper in May 2012, But Richard Grenell, the political strategist who helped organize the call and was specifically hired to oversee such communications, was conspicuously absent, or so everyone thought…\n\nRic, in fact, was present and listened as reporters asked if he would be joining the call and wondering why he wasn't there. The message was clear. He was facing a deliberately untenable situation, which would appall any serious person. He consulted with mentors and then resigned from the campaign.\n\nHe also made the decision to never say a bad word publicly about Mr. Romney. Ric even wrote a piece in the Wall Street Journal endorsing Romney over Barack Obama, because it was the right thing to do.\n\nDid Romney recognize Ric's display of character over the years in how he handled that debacle? Likely not.\n\nDue to Romney's failure to defeat Mr. Obama, Ric had to wait four more years before the nation had a candidate and then president with the character to not just recognize Ric's talent but stand by him. Ric is now our Ambassador to Germany because President Trump made sure a passive-aggressive senate confirmed his nomination.\n\nMr. Romney says he doesn't like what Mr. Trump stands for. But perhaps the fact that Mr. Trump actually stands for something is what really outrages the also-ran.\n\nIn 2012, Mr. Romney's communications strategist was asked how the candidate's message would change now that they were headed into the general election. The answer revealed just how vapid, or dare I say, devoid of character, Romney really was.\n\nFrom the March, 21, 2012 edition of the New York Times, Mr. Fehrnstrom on Wednesday reached for a word to describe how Mr. Romney might pivot to the general election, the one that came tumbling from his mouth was 'Etch A Sketch,' the children's drawing toy in which nothing is ever permanent, reported the newspaper. 'Everything changes,' Mr. Fehrnstrom, 50, said on CNN, with a slight smirk that suggested he believed he was about to use a clever line. 'It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.'\n\nPresident Trump's personal mistakes have been the subject of non-stop public investigation, commentary and debate every single day, every hour, every minute, for years. We know the man, we know what he's done, and most of all, we know who he has become.\n\nDonald Trump, and his entire family, left comfortable lives, where their days were not filled with death threats, invective, lies, anthrax hoax letters, harassment on airplanes, in restaurants, mocking by the liberal media, accusations of being traitors, Nazis, and targeted by a weaponized federal government with the intention of nullifying his electoral success.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYes, he became president, and family members have joined him, in working to deliver promises made on a campaign trail to bring back jobs, the economy, border security, the rule of law, and national security to this nation. In other words, he promised to bring back the future for American families.\n\nPresident Trump's promises and conversations with the American people during the campaign and every day since aren't written on an Etch A Sketch, and every day he pays the price for not being like Mitt Romney.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TAMMY BRUCE
Running from one year into the next may not be most people's idea of holiday revelry, but since 1979 doing so has become an annual tradition for tens of thousands in New York City. Until now.\n\nLike so many other longstanding events, the Midnight Run in Central Park from 2020 to 2021 was scuttled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But I nevertheless have terrific New Year's Eve memories of racing with a cast of colorful (some costumed) characters in the shadow of the city's skyscrapers and under the glow of festive fireworks.\n\nAs my friend and fellow runner Lynne recently told me: I never ran in the Olympics, but at midnight in Central Park I got a sense of what it must feel like.\n\nFLORIDA ATHLETE BECOMES FIRST PERSON WITH DOWN SYNDROME TO FINISH IRONMAN TRIATHLON\n\nOrganized by the New York Road Runners Club, the four-mile race winds its way through the famed metropolitan oasis. Sparkling cider is offered at the water stops, though in the early years champagne was available.\n\nBut of all those cold, late-night runs, one stands out more than the rest because of a man I met at two miles into the run.\n\nLarry was older than me, his bearded face weathered and a bit worn, but his pace was steady and comfortable.\n\nAny resolutions for the new year? I asked him as we matched stride for stride on Central Park's inner loop.\n\nJust hoping this year is better than the last, he said matter-of-factly.\n\nTaking the bait, I responded. What happened last year?\n\nWife said I was running too much, ignoring the family, Larry said. I was lacing up my shoes one day for a workout, and she said, 'If you walk out that door, when you come back, we won't be here.'\n\nSo, what did you do? I asked.\n\nI went for my run — and when I came back, sure enough, she was gone, Larry said.\n\nLarry went on to tell me how he sensed the marriage was a mistake from Day One.\n\nI remember standing at the front of the church and watching her walk up the aisle, he said. I had a bad feeling about it.\n\nI never got to ask why he felt such dread, but one can imagine. Too many people are more in love with being in love than truly loving their significant other. Romance may make the world go around, but it's also a daily decision and not just a euphoric elixir rush of dopamine, adrenaline, vasopressin and oxytocin.\n\nLarry said the biggest lies are the ones we tell ourselves. We ignore obvious signs and problems, hoping for better days instead of taking action to make changes.\n\nMy old pastor and friend Dr. Jim Singleton once told a story about an old dog moaning and groaning on the wooden floor of a hardware store. When a customer expressed concern, the proprietor told him the dog was sitting on a nail.\n\nWhy doesn't he move? the shopper inquired.\n\nI guess it doesn't hurt him enough to get up, the owner replied.\n\nWe're too often like that dog — lamenting a lot but lazily going along with the status quo. Taking action is what separates success from failure. Because even if you don't entirely solve the problem you set out to tackle, the mere pursuit and effort will change you for the better.\n\nIn reality, Larry's running didn't cause his divorce. It only magnified underlying and unresolved problems. Any number of things could have helped him, from premarital counseling to a heart-to-heart conversation with a trusted friend. He simply ignored all the warning signs.\n\nLarry isn't the only one ignoring or running from his problems. America is full of people doing the same thing. Whether wallowing in unfulfilled relationships, going to jobs we don't like, or spending money we don't have to impress people who don't care about us, the human condition bends towards apathy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAfter one of the most difficult years in memory, of being locked down both literally and figuratively, I think action needs to be the operative word of 2021.\n\nIt's time to stop talking and start doing. Don't run from your problems. Face them head-on.\n\nStruggling in your marriage? Ask for help. Pastors and counselors are a great place to start.\n\nUnhappy in your job? Do something small every day to work towards something better.\n\nA dream written down with a date becomes a goal, says film producer Greg Reid. A goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. A plan backed by action makes your dreams come true.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI lost sight of Larry just before the finish line, but often think of him each New Year's Eve, including this one. I'd like to think he made changes in his life. His struggles have helped me with mine, and I hope they might also help you tackle yours as we head into 2021.\n\nAnd now that we've entered 2021 after COVID-19 tragically claimed the lives of over 346,000 Americans in 2020, I think we can all agree with Larry's wish: Just hoping this year is better than the last.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE FROM PAUL BATURA
Whether through taxes or net neutrality regulations, the Obama administration has seized every opportunity to expand federal control over the Internet. But at least until now, we've always been able to rely on Washington to defend the Internet as a global beacon of freedom and democracy.\n\nUnfortunately, this seems to be changing, as the White House recently announced plans to transition from supervising the Internet's architecture and may shift some of these responsibilities to countries like Russia and China, which would portend disaster for advocates of political dissent and Internet freedom.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nAlthough the U.S. government doesn't control the Internet in the literal sense of the term, it has had contractual oversight over the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), a California-based nonprofit that manages the back end of the Internet by assigning domains (.com, .org, .edu and the like), IP addresses and other basic web protocols.\n\nAlthough most casual Internet users aren't aware of ICANN, it plays a critical role in keeping the Web running, and for over 10 years the U.S. government has held sole jurisdiction over it.\n\nMore On This... It's nuts to give control of Internet to countries with poor records on free speech\n\nThe U.S. government hasn't always been a paragon of Internet freedom, but throughout its tenure overseeing ICANN, the Web has grown in leaps and bounds into a global force for democracy, with little interference from Washington.\n\nThe same cannot be said of many other global powers – most notably Russia, which has a horrific record on free speech, and China, infamous for its Internet censorship.\n\nSo long as ICANN has remained under American supervision, governments hostile to free speech have not been able to halt the progress of the worldwide open Internet.\n\nBut this is about to change, as the White House has announced plans to give up its oversight of ICANN when its contract expires next year and transition to globalized Internet supervision.\n\nIdyllic as it may sound for the Internet to be overseen by one harmonious global community, shared international oversight creates problems at every level and is more likely to spark diplomatic flare-ups and restrict Internet access than to achieve any kind of progress.\n\nUnder the present system, governments have the power to regulate what appears on the Internet within their borders, but without oversight of ICANN they have no control over what Internet users in other countries have access to.\n\nThus, the Chinese government can block its citizens from accessing Western media outlets, but it can't prevent people outside China from reading online stories that are critical of Beijing.\n\nBut if China is given even partial control of ICANN, it could theoretically use its power as a diplomatic bargaining chip and attempt to bar the entire world from content it finds objectionable.\n\nMoreover, transferring oversight of ICANN to the global community will almost certainly involve the participation of the United Nations, which has long clamored for increased authority over the Internet.\n\nU.N. oversight of the Internet, like nearly every other U.N. diplomatic venture, is doomed to fail because it would rely upon nations with competing interests – and in many cases, hostile motives – to work as a team to secure the world's most valuable resource.\n\nThis team would be stacked with regimes hostile to free speech, gay rights, women's rights and religious freedom, including Russia, China, and the Middle East dictatorships that turned off Internet access during the Arab Spring.\n\nThe White House's decision to turn ICANN over to potentially hostile interests is a continuation of its recent string of troubling Internet policies.\n\nLast year, Secretary of State John Kerry echoed many of the world's autocrats by claiming that this little thing called the Internet … makes it much harder to govern. Kerry and the White House should be upholding the Internet as a democratizing force with the power to liberate oppressed people, not belittling it and providing cover for oppressors.\n\nThe world's autocracies are unfit to share control of the Internet, and it would be both a diplomatic blunder and technological step backward for the United States to voluntarily invite these regimes to the table.\n\nAlthough Washington hardly has a perfect record on free speech and Internet rights, it is miles better than the alternatives, and it should vigilantly defend its role as global protector of the free Internet instead of eagerly passing the buck.\n\nThe U.S. long ago seized the high ground on Internet supervision – to the benefit of Web users worldwide – and the White House needs to reconsider its decision to give that ground up.
A former head of British intelligence agency MI6 has warned that Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal with the European Union threatens British national security by placing control of British security in foreign hands.\n\nThe letter, written by former MI6 head Sir Richard Dearlove and former defence chief Lord Guthrie, and obtained first by Sky News, claims May's controversial withdrawal agreement hurts NATO as well as our close bilateral defence and intelligence relationship with the USA and urges MPs to vote against the deal.\n\nBRITISH PM THERESA SURVIVES NO-CONFIDENCE VOTE DESPITE BREXIT CHAOS\n\nThe first duty of the state, above trade, is the security of its citizens, the letter says. The Withdrawal Agreement abrogates this fundamental contract and would place control of aspects of our national security in foreign hands.\n\nThe deal, which is expected to be defeated in Parliament next week when it is voted on, has split May's Conservative Party and sparked numerous resignations -- with Brexiteers unhappy that it would keep the U.K. in a customs union until a trade deal is forged. The so-called backstop to prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, has led to fears that it would keep Britain in the E.U. permanently.\n\nFormer Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said in his resignation letter that it would give the E.U. a veto over our ability to exit.\n\nDearlove and Guthrie say that the deal threatens to change our national security policy by binding us into new sets of E.U.-controlled relationships. According to The Daily Telegraph, the letter also says that the deal is the exact opposition of the people's instruction to take back control when Brits voted in 2016 to leave the bloc.\n\nIn response, 10 Downing Street told Sky that the claim by the former chiefs is completely wrong.\n\nSPAIN AGREES TO BACK BREXIT DEAL AFTER SECURING CONCESSIONS FROM BRITAIN, EU\n\nThe letter is the latest blow to May's push to get her agreement through Parliament ahead of Britain's scheduled departure from the bloc at the end of March. She has faced pressure from the pro-Brexit wing of her party to step down, but survived a vote of confidence from her own party last month.\n\nShould she lose the vote on the deal next week, as expected, May will likely face fresh pressure to resign and possibly another vote of confidence -- this time in Parliament. That could, in turn, lead to a general election. Those who have opposed Brexit have renewed calls for either a second referendum or a delay in Britain's departure.\n\nMay did receive a boost on Thursday from Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who said in a press conference alongside May that Japan supported her withdrawal agreement and that the whole world wanted to avoid a situation where the U.K. left the bloc with no trade deal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMay told reporters that it was her deal, or no deal at all:\n\nThe only way to avoid no deal is to have a deal and to agree a deal, and the deal that is on the table, the deal that is the deal that the E.U. has made clear is the only deal, she said, before calling it a good deal.
The progressive agenda seemed more likely to succeed Monday after the House approved rules that would purportedly exempt policies like Medicare for All and the Green New Deal from a fiscal responsibility measure aimed at offsetting deficit increases with additional revenue.\n\nCongress initially passed the PAYGO or pay-as-you-go rule in 1990 but it expired in 2002. Democrats later reinstated the rule in 2007 but former President Obama carved out room for the 2009 stimulus designed to absord the impact of the financial crisis.\n\nThe new exemption, approved on a party-line vote (217-206), applies to the COVID-19 response and efforts to address climate change. More specifically, H. Res. 8 allows the Budget Committee Chair to exempt the budgetary effects of measures to prevent, prepare for, or respond to economic, environmental, or public health consequences resulting from climate change.\n\nPELOSI'S NEW HOUSE RULES ARE GENDER-NEUTRAL, CURTAIL GOP'S ABILITY TO FORCE 'GOTCHA' VOTES\n\nThis is huge, tweeted Squad member Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass. These reforms remove 2 structural barriers to our agenda for equity and justice and will allow us to advance bold policies like Medicare for All, a Green New Deal and an equitable COVID recovery.\n\nThe House Progressive Caucus similarly cheered the idea as a way to prevent big ideas from getting bogged down by procedural hurdles or harmful austerity measures.\n\nAnother rule change hinders the minority party's ability to alter legislation through a motion to recommit. That measure prompted condemnation from Rules Ranking Member Tom Cole, R-Okla.\n\nWith today's changes, the majority is seeking to silence views they are afraid of with no regard for this institution or the American people's trust in our constitutional responsibility to govern, and govern well, he said, according to Roll Call.\n\nMonday's news came as House Democrats maintained their majority but wrestled with internal divisions over socialism policies like Medicare for All.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., has been reluctant to force a vote on Medicare for All, she and others insisted on movement with the Green New Deal.\n\nWOULD THE GREEN NEW DEAL BRING THE US CLOSER TO SOCIALISM?\n\nAs a resolution, the Green New Deal doesn't enact any particular policies but directs Congress to pursue many goals such as universal health care, which Ocasio-Cortez seeks to achieve through Medicare for All. Conservative groups have estimated the deal would cost trillions of dollars, create an unsustainable financial burden for the economy, and burden the average household with tens of thousands in annual costs.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation attempted to use the Energy Information Administration's National Energy Model to forecast the impact of steep carbon taxes aimed at reaching the net-zero greenhouse gas emissions goal. Not only did the model crash, it failed to approach anywhere near the goal outlined in the Green New Deal. The closest Heritage was able to get was a 58 percent reduction in emissions, achieved through a $300 carbon tax -- taxes above $300 crashed the EIA's model.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., have argued that the cost of inaction on climate change is unsustainable. According to Sanders, the proposed solutions -- infrastructure and investment -- would boost the U.S. economy as well during a time of widespread joblessness.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDuring the primaries, he released details about how he proposed to pay for his version of the Green New Deal, which he says would cost $16.3 trillion. That included $3.085 trillion from penalizing the fossil fuel industry for their pollution and from eliminating fossil fuel subsidies.\n\nHe also warned that without action on climate change, the U.S. will lose $34.5 trillion by the end of the century. He also predicts savings as high as $70.4 trillion over 80 years by averting climate catastrophe.
The U.S. military carried out airstrikes in Iraq and Syria on Sunday — days after a U.S. defense contractor was killed at a military compound in a rocket attack.\n\nMilitary jet fighters conducted precision defensive strikes on five sites of Kataeb Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Iraqi militia, Jonathan Hoffman, a spokesperson for the Pentagon told Fox News. Two defense officials added that Air Force F-15 jet fighters carried out the strikes.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien traveled Sunday to Mar-a-Lago in Florida to meet with President Trump and discuss the strikes, a senior administration official told Fox News.\n\nRELATED: U.S. TROOPS INJURED IN IRAQ ROCKET ATTACK THAT KILLED US CONTRACTOR, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nU.S. officials have blamed the militia for a rocket barrage Friday that killed a U.S. defense contractor, wounded four U.S. troops and two members of the Iraqi Security Forces (ISF) near Kirkuk, in northern Iraq.\n\nMilitary forces said the attackers fired more than 30 rockets in Friday's assault — the 11th rocket attack on U.S. and Iraqi forces since late October, according to a U.S. defense official.\n\nFive locations — including three Kataeb Hezbollah areas in Iraq and two in Syria — were targeted, Hoffman said in a statement.\n\nHe said the U.S. strikes will weaken the group's ability to carry out future attacks on Americans and their Iraqi government allies.\n\nIraq Prime Minister Adil Abdul-Mahdi denounced the strikes, saying that the leader of the Iranian-based militia is a U.S. designated terrorist.\n\nAby Mohandis (is) blamed for the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait two months after Beirut, he said. But his militia fought against ISIS and is under the umbrella of Iraq's security forces.\n\nEarlier this month, Pompeo blamed Iran for two separate rocket attacks on the Baghdad International Airport, on Dec. 9 and 11, where U.S. and Iraqi forces are located on the other side of the commercial airport.\n\nPompeo said if any Americans were harmed in the future, it would be answered with a decisive U.S. response.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., responded: Today's strikes against Iranian-backed groups in Iraq and Syria are a justified response to the killing of an American and the wounding of several American service members and Iraqis. Tehran must stop attacking Americans or else face even graver consequences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTony Badran, a research fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called the attack an important moment in the U.S.'s Iraq policy.\n\nEspecially over the past decade, counterterrorism has not only encouraged inertia, but also has served as a smokescreen to put the U.S. in a de facto alliance with Iran, including the Obama administration providing Iranian-led militias with cover and support for ground operations, he added. The Trump administration has been slowly moving away from that, first through quiet acquiescence to ti Israeli strikes and now by retaliating directly against attacks by these militias. This change in posture is as necessary as it is overdue.\n\nFox News' Rich Edson, Mike Emanuel and Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.
The government is in partial shutdown and full gridlock. The Mueller report is overdue. The Democrats are starting a raft of investigations. China is in a tailspin. Economists are predicting a recession and the stock market is gyrating. The generals are quitting over Syrian withdrawal plans. And the Democratic left is rising as the presidential cycle is starting.\n\nSo, in the words of an old TV show, Car 54 where are you? Meaning How are we possibly going to get through the mess that is January 1, 2019?\n\nPerhaps the first thing that needs to be sorted out is the stalemate over border security. What started out as a Trump folly is gradually shifting somewhat. Most Americans don't favor a wall, but they do favor beefed up border security including barriers where it makes sense.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARK PENN: NO WINNERS IN THIS GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN – BOTH SIDES SHOULD COMPROMISE TO REOPEN GOVERNMENT\n\nWhen working for Bill Clinton in 1995, we defended against the then-Republican shutdown with the need to protect Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment and, day-by-day, we won. It was a big message defending hundreds of billions of dollars of vital programs.\n\nToday, the Democrats' only message is they won't spend one ten thousandth of the budget on a border wall. It is an appeal to the base, but is a weakening hand with a policeman killed in California and Democrats' statements that they won't compromise even $1. They have the chance to split the difference, make a deal for DACA and turn this into a win-win or let it drag on as a lose-lose. I think there will be a compromise sooner than later.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNext, Robert Mueller has had, believe it or not, almost two full years, more than $30 million and all the unbridled power inherent in a special counsel's office – and has come up empty-handed. The zealots Mueller brought in to bring down the president don't want to give up and so they keep expanding their investigation rather than end it for the good of the country.\n\nThey seem to have hit dead ends with Roger Stone, Paul Manafort and General Michael Flynn. They can write a report condemning the president but the Russian collusion goods don't seem to exist. They may just keep on going, picking up new investigations from the Democratic House committees, and act as a permanent presidential investigation unit. But eventually I think the Supreme Court, which will start to get cases that could limit their power and authority, and the appointment of an unrecused attorney general, will catch up to them if they don't end it soon. Expect their report by March 15, 2019.\n\nMaybe 2019 will be the year that America returns to its political senses, reduces gridlock, cuts good trade deals and enjoys a strong economy.\n\nThe Democratic investigations and impeachment mantras are starting up. Depending upon what is in his tax returns, Trump will release them and laugh or fight it all the way to the Supreme Court. Most of the Congressional subpoenas will be ignored and slow-walked. No doubt an impeachment would be a crowd pleaser for the Democratic base and Trump could face some manic days with the release of the Mueller report, just as Bill Clinton faced tough days after Ken Starr released his report. But absent something dramatic and new, Trump Acquitted is the likely headline out a Senate trial, so Democrats will think twice about going down this road. Censure might be a logical way out, but I'm not sure logic will prevail.\n\nWith fear-mongering now the stock and trade in the age of social media, this is supposed to be the year of the recession, and for the last six weeks a chorus of economists have been saying our economy is all but dead. But wait. Wages are rising, Christmas spending will set records, and the new jobs report out Friday showed a healthy job market with 312,000 jobs smashing through the downbeat estimates. Just maybe we still have a strong economy and that recession talk will have to wait a year. On the other hand, China may be in real trouble so it is likely that after having lost a third of the value of their stock market, they will come to the table and cut a deal. The base these Chinese leaders have to worry about favor bread over ideology.\n\nIn a December surprise, General James Mattis quit over the Syrian troop withdrawal. Not since President Harry Truman fired the revered General Douglas MacArthur has a president had to contend with a general opposing civilian rule in such a bold manner. But the decision to draw down 2,000 troops was hardly a momentous military decision in the leagues of sending hundreds of thousands of troops to Korea, the decision to start the Iraq war or to use the atomic bomb against Japan. It was more likely a pretext to leave the administration and surely there will be a multimillion-dollar book contract next. Military command moves on, and this is just another failed power play.\n\nFinally, the Democratic left is rising as the presidential cycle is starting. Yet it is the moderates who won a rules change that stops the left from holding no confidence votes on the speaker, undercutting the power of splinter groups to disrupt the caucus. It is the moderates who won the seats that put the House back in Democratic hands, and while the left may dominate the early presidential cycle and in the media cycles, I think it's the moderates who will emerge to push for getting things done for the country on infrastructure, immigration and health care.\n\nFortunately, there are no national elections this year so the press of partisanship could take a back seat to progress. Just maybe 2019 will be the year that America returns to its political senses, reduces gridlock, cuts good trade deals and enjoys a strong economy. On January 4, 2019, those predictions seem somewhat crazy as we are in a partial government shutdown, headed for an impeachment and many believe a recession is around the corner. Call me an optimist.
This is a rush transcript from Tucker Carlson Tonight, January 2, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON, HOST: Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson Tonight.\n\nLast weekend, as you saw Grafton Thomas carry out a horrifying stabbing attack at a Hanukkah party in Monsey, New York. Listen to the daughter of one victim described the aftermath of that.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: He has a fractured skull. He has been sliced, like through his neck. He has a shattered arm. The doctors do not have high hopes for him. He may never be -- I mean, if he wakes up, he may never be able to walk, talk or even process speech again.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Awful. So far the coverage of the attack in Monsey has focused on the rising number of violent anti-Jewish incidents in New York and across the country, as well as on Thomas's own psychiatric issues which were significant.\n\nBut we must be honest and tell you there was another factor at play and that was ideology. Thomas was only on the street in the first place because politicians long ago decided to side with criminals over normal people in New York.\n\nBy the time he began stabbing strangers in the synagogue, Thomas had already been arrested seven times, in some cases for violent offenses like assault, resisting arrest and killing a police animal.\n\nNow, despite all of that, the only jail time Thomas ever received was in 2013 on a drug offense, somehow he was able to kill a police animal and never go to jail.\n\nIn other words, Grafton Thomas gave us plenty of warning. The people in charge of protecting us just decided to ignore those warnings.\n\nBernard Kerik was once the New York City Police Commissioner and he joins us tonight. Bernie, thanks so much for coming on. How did this happen?\n\nBERNARD KERIK, FORMER NEW YORK CITY POLICE COMMISSIONER: Well listen, I've been, you know, talking about this for the last year where I think the city, the State of New York is irresponsible in creating these laws where they're not holding people accountable.\n\nOn January 1st, just two days ago, you know, we signed into law and it's gone into effect where people that burglarize, that Rape 3 -- Rape third class, and a number of different crimes, violent crimes are now being considered not violent. And people aren't held when they get locked up.\n\nThey're just turning them around right through a turnstile. I think it's -\n\n- this is a demonstration of how the city is going to implode if they don't fix it and fix it fast because you're going to continue to have people like this out on the streets.\n\nCARLSON: Most of what you're saying is intuitive. It's obvious. Normal people, I think, know it instinctively. So why the change? Was there a groundswell of support for letting people out of prison or not putting them in prison for killing police animals, for example, or rape? I mean, how did we get here?\n\nKERIK: Well, I think it's this left wing liberal socialist push, where we villainize the police. We embolden the criminals. We let people out. You know, there was the criminal justice reform push.\n\nYou know, here's the bottom line. There should be criminal justice reform.\n\nBbad people that do bad things belong in prison.\n\nWe put Rod Blagojevich, the Governor of Illinois in prison for 14 years for talking about politics on the phone.\n\nCARLSON: I agree.\n\nKERIK: But you have people committing getting violent acts, violent acts against others, and they turn around and let them out to go out and do it again the next day, and the next day after.\n\nYou've had -- you had a woman who committed three acts of violence in three days, and she's been let out every day after.\n\nCARLSON: So you started on the New York City force, at the Police Department when New York was dangerous. You took over running the department when it had become safer, it was still safer after you left and now you're seeing it move in the opposite direction. It almost seems like we know what to do to make the city safe, but we're not doing it on purpose.\n\nKERIK: You know what, Tucker? Nobody knows how to fix the city and how to reduce crime better than I did, and I do because I was there when the Renaissance occurred, but it looks like this Mayor and this Governor, they're trying to diminish and destroy all the programs that were put in place that reduced crime by 65 -- violent crime by 65 to 70 percent, homicide by 70 to 75 percent.\n\nAnd what they did in this -- with these new laws where they're letting people back out on the street, it's going to diminish quality of life and it's going to enhance violence.\n\nCARLSON: It just shows you what political leaders can do the damage they can wreak. I mean, all of our attention is on the national stage. But here you have just a Mayor, just as Mayor of a city, causing remarkable damage to people.\n\nKERIK: Well, listen, all you have to do is look what's happened in the last week, in the last 24 hours. This thing should be reversed. The Mayor should be screaming out of his mind to get it reversed.\n\nHe's not out there. He's not doing it. It endangers the public. It's irresponsible. It's dangerous to the police officers to put their lives on the line on a daily basis to go out and arrest people. It's a shame.\n\nCARLSON: It's depressing. Bernie Kerik, thanks so much for that.\n\nAs you just heard, New York City appears to be doing everything that it can to create more Grafton Thomas's. A New Year's Day new bail laws went into effect in New York State. Those aren't going to help.\n\nPretrial detention and cash bail have now been eliminated for almost all misdemeanor and nonviolent felony cases, even some violent felonies are included. What does it mean? It means the crimes like burglary, stalking, petty assault, many drug offenses, even some types of arson and robbery are no longer bail crimes.\n\nIn the words of Governor Andrew Cuomo himself, the guy behind this, 90 percent of criminal defendants will now be back on the street right after being arrested.\n\nHabitual offenders will find it even easier than ever to commit more crimes immediately after getting caught. With no bail constraining them, there is no incentive to show up for court, so of course, many will simply disappear and reoffend.\n\nWho benefits from this? It's hard to see who benefits from it, except the people getting out of jail.\n\nLast week, New York resident Tiffany Harris allegedly assaulted three Orthodox Jewish women in Brooklyn. Harris was arrested, charged and released. On Sunday she was arrested and charged with another assault and she was released again.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, guess what she did? She got arrested for a third time.\n\nThis time she is finally being kept in custody. That's New York.\n\nBut Democratic presidential candidates have made it clear that if they take power in Washington this fall, they will make the rest of the country every bit as inviting for criminals. Watch this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. KAMALA HARRIS, D-CALIF.: I have been a leader in the United States Senate on saying we need to get rid of the cash bail system.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS, I-VT., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: They're in jail because they are too poor to afford cash bail. You understand what I'm saying? We're going to end cash bail.\n\nSEN. KIRSTEN GILLIBRAND, D-N.Y.: We should get rid of cash bail entirely.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN, D-MA., PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: How about we stop making poverty a crime? No more cash bail. This is crazy.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Is this what the country wants or needs? Is this a peaceful place where law-abiding citizens feel safe and protected and ought to be, increasingly it's not.\n\nFor about half a decade, criminal justice reform has been one of the chief obsessions of our ruling class. Eliminating bail is just one prong of the offensive that they are waging. They're also demanding shorter prison sentences, fewer cops in quote, over policed neighborhoods, whatever that is, voting rights for violent criminals in prison and more.\n\nNow, often these policies enjoy support from guilt-ridden Republicans who have forgotten who they represent. The year 2019 just ended and so now, we can bring some data to this conversation and fully assess the human toll of these policies.\n\nWe have the numbers. Here's what they are. In Philadelphia, a city we've taken a close look at in the show under the direction of Soros funded DA, Larry Krasner, the city recorded 359 murders for the year. That's the most in more than a decade.\n\nIn other words, people died as a result of these policies, more than a hundred and it's not just in Philadelphia. Baltimore had 348 murders last year. That's the most since 1993 and at a per capita level, it's the deadliest year on record in Baltimore.\n\nIn 2014, Dallas had only 116 homicides this year after the far left, John Creuzot promise not to prosecute thefts valued at less than 750 bucks. The murder rate went up to over 200.\n\nIn Charlotte, North Carolina, 57 homicides recorded last year -- 57. This year, Charlotte reached that number before the end of June and then just kept going. The city finished with 108 murders on the year. That's the most since the early 1990s.\n\nHow about Washington, the nation's capital? Well in 2012, D.C. had just 88 murders. Even two years ago, there were only 116, but this year, 2019, 166 murders. See a trend? You should because it's everywhere.\n\nWe could spend half the show resetting the stats for city after city -- St. Louis, Raleigh, Seattle, Louisville, Cincinnati -- we could go on and on.\n\nThe point is across the country, in city after city, murder rates have surged dramatically compared with just five years ago. This is happening.\n\nThese are not fake statistics. They're the most real.\n\nAnd even in cities where violent crime hasn't surged, locals are dealing instead with property crimes and quality of life offenses, which are significant, in some places, severe.\n\nSan Francisco, for example, facing an epidemic of shoplifting and car robberies, it has made life unbearable for many taxpayers. We've got a series on that running next week, which you won't want to miss.\n\nThe bottom line is, normal people don't want criminal justice reform. They want criminal justice enforcement. They've always wanted that. So why aren't they getting it?\n\nHeather Mac Donald has thought a lot about this question. She is the author of the book, The Diversity Delusion, a frequent guest on the show, and she joins us tonight. Heather, thanks so much for coming on.\n\nHEATHER MAC DONALD, AUTHOR: Thank you, Tucker.\n\nCARLSON: So I don't think there is any topic on which there is a greater divide between what the majority of citizens of all parties, all colors say they want and what they get from the people in charge. Why is this complicated for our leaders?\n\nMAC DONALD: Because they're in the grips of a false narrative, which says that the criminal justice system is racist. This massive wave of de- incarceration, decriminalization that is going on across the country as you point out, Tucker, is being done in the name of racial justice.\n\nWell, guess who those homicide victims are overwhelmingly? Black.\n\nCARLSON: Exactly.\n\nMAC DONALD: Law-abiding blacks. The criminal justice system, Tucker, is not racist. The incidence of people in prison is because of crime, not their skin color.\n\nPrison today remains a Lifetime Achievement Award for persistence in criminal offending. You have to work very hard to get yourself sentenced to prison, and yet, the elites are convinced and they're trying to persuade the rest of the world that America's endemic racism is willy-nilly throwing black people in prison and throwing away the keys. That is simply not the case.\n\nCARLSON: I can't resist pointing out that at the very moment when we're literally letting arsonists go free, Roger Stone is facing life in prison for what? It's not even clear.\n\nSo the political penalties have gotten stiffer, but the penalties for violence and mayhem have almost disappeared in a lot of cases. But again, there's no constituency for this outside of like small pockets of affluence on the coast, like normal people are not for this. They never have been for it. So how do our leaders get away with it?\n\nMAC DONALD: Well, the activists are for it, the academia is for it. Again, the universities are the source of this narrative that says that everything about America today is defined and created by racism. And I guess, the public does not have a voice.\n\nBut we if we get a rise in crime, like we did in the 90s, it is going to swing back again. Right now, we are living off of the law enforcement reforms that said policing matters, that incarceration matters, and we've gotten lazy, and the elites are back in the saddle, you know, and it's going to take a lot of thousands of more black lives lost to criminals who should be in jail before this gets turned around.\n\nCARLSON: Let me ask a quick question. So when Bernie Sanders or someone like him stands up and says, the only reason these people are in jail is because they're poor, just like demonstrably false.\n\nI've never heard a Republican candidate or any Republican officeholders say, you know, that's just a flat out lie actually. We have the numbers, you're wrong. Why do they never stand up for simple law and order?\n\nMAC DONALD: They're scared. I mean, they're absolutely terrified of the racism charge. I was at a House Judiciary Committee hearing that talked about the criminal justice system. I was very disappointed in the Republicans. They just spouted bromides about our men and women in blue without actually combating the lie that the criminal justice system is racist.\n\nAs for this idea that cash bail affects the poor. Listen, in New York City, only seven percent of misdemeanor arrestees have any kind of bail set for them. And that's because they have long felony arrest records and only\n\n0.6 percent of misdemeanor arrests, these are actually in jail.\n\nIn fact, most people are put on the streets anyway. And so this bail reform law is a solution in search of a non-problem that is only going to create more crime.\n\nCARLSON: Well, exactly. There you go with your statistics and those spooky numbers. We appreciate it though. Heather Mac Donald, thank you so much.\n\nMAC DONALD: Thank you, Tucker.\n\nCARLSON: Another Democrat dropped out of the presidential race, and once again, the press is distressed by this. They are calling Democratic primary voters bigots for not supporting him, are they?\n\nPlus, Joe Biden says putting coal miners out of work is no big deal. They should just learn to code. Can they? That's next. Amazing.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCARLSON: There's an awful lot of news tonight, but we want to pause and acknowledge something that's happened in the Democratic presidential race. Julian Castro is out.\n\nIn other words, until this morning, he was still running for President. You'd be forgiven if you assume that he dropped out months ago. That's how effective his candidacy was.\n\nThe only time he got any attention was at the first Democratic debate, you might remember. It was back in June, where he addressed the pressing problem, one of the biggest problems this country faces, how do biological men get abortions? He had an answer.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJULIAN CASTRO, D-FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I don't believe only in reproductive freedom, I believe in reproductive justice. You know, what that means is that just because a woman or let's also not forget someone in the trans community, a trans female who is poor doesn't mean they shouldn't have the right to exercise that right to choose.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: So there was that and he won a vote or two with that unusual argument. His other argument was that voters should vote for him based on his identity. The video announcing the end of his candidacy opened and closed with a line in Spanish, which basically said it all, vote for me because of my background and because I speak Spanish.\n\nThe irony, though, is that Julian Castro actually can't speak Spanish. He is just totally fraudulent. Now, there's nothing wrong with not being able to speak Spanish. Actually, that's not a crime.\n\nIn fact, if anything, Castro could have celebrated that is proof that immigrants assimilate into American study as they have for hundreds of years. That's a good thing. We used to be for that.\n\nBut the vision of actual assimilation has no currency in the modern Democratic Party, where people are constantly divided up by skin color, nationality, gender and language.\n\nSo instead, he had to play up his views on immigration, which honestly, were kind of extreme. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCASTRO: Instead of building a wall or closing the border, we should choose compassion instead of cruelty.\n\nALISYN CAMEROTA, CNN ANCHOR: The feeling from this administration is that we are in a full-blown crisis and that they are overwhelmed by it. How do you think?\n\nCASTRO: You know, I don't believe their narrative. I don't believe the BS.\n\nWe should decriminalize people who are coming here, crossing the border.\n\nWe need to increase the number of refugees that we take into this country.\n\nAnd if we're not careful, if we don't get this right, in 20 or 30 years, this nation is going to be begging for immigrants to come to this country.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: Begging -- and if you're not, you're not grateful. You're a bad person.\n\nWell, as we said, he is out of the race and over on MSNBC, they're taking it hard. Some of the anchors pointed to Castro's departure. It's just the latest evidence that the Democratic primary electorate is racist.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Julian Castro, the only thing Latino running ends his campaign today leaving the Democrats even less diverse. Following the earlier departure, of course of Senator Kamala Harris.\n\nAs of now, there are going to be five white candidates on this next debate stage. Is that sustainable for the Democratic Party?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: David Perino is the first person we go to, to figure out what's going on in this race. She hosts The Daily Briefing, of course with Dana Perino. We're always grateful to have her.\n\nSo Dana, you keep hearing from Democrats, this grave disappointment in their own primary electorate suggesting that they're bigots for supporting, I guess, Biden and Bernie, what do you make of that?\n\nDANA PERINO, FOX NEWS HOST: And then I wonder if the media organizations are going to send out a bunch of reporters all across the nation to find out what actually is happening in this country as they did after the 2016 election results.\n\nAnd the thing about Julio Castro is that he gave the D.N.C. Convention speech back in 2012 and he became the candidate of tomorrow, but he was a candidate of tomorrow for so long that it became yesterday.\n\nHe never was able to get a foothold. And the two things that you point out, the two major policy positions on abortion and on immigration, he never got enough support that those policies were actually scrutinized.\n\nIf you think of someone like Elizabeth Warren and Medicare-for-All, that got the full treatment, but Julian Castro, ever since 2012 thought that he was going to be on that stage, maybe the nominee? I think that he will, though, be on the VP shortlist, even if he really doesn't deserve to be, but his name will be on the list.\n\nBut I don't know if they'll actually choose him because there's many other people that show that they were able to get some base of support.\n\nCARLSON: You make such a smart point. I mean, if I get up and said, you know, if a biological man gets pregnant, I promise I'll pay for his abortion. I'd be laughed at and I'd probably lose my job, right?\n\nBut he was so ignored that he could say that and people were like, oh, yeah, okay. You know, whatever. I just want to ask you --\n\nPERINO: That's when you know you're in real trouble. If you say something like that and like -- it's like if a tree falls in a forest, like if you say something like that on a debate stage and everyone goes, yes, well, it's just like helium. Okay.\n\nCARLSON: Yes, you could just be floridly and say that and nobody cares.\n\nSo this happened in New Hampshire on Monday. Joe Biden explained how coal miners should adapt to having their jobs regulated out of existence. They should just learn a completely different profession from scratch. Watch.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, D-PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I come from a family -- we're in an area where there is coal mining in Scranton. Anybody who could go down 300 to 3,000 feet in the mine sure in hell can learn how to program as well.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: So this just -- this struck me as so very similar to a line that we heard not very long ago, basically dismissing the concerns of people whose industries, particularly the coal business has been regulated out of existence. Is that a wise thing even for a Democrats to say right now?\n\nPERINO: So you're saying I think you're talking about the Hillary Clinton comment in the 2016 campaign.\n\nCARLSON: I am. That's right.\n\nPERINO: In which basically she was like celebrating the fact that they were going to try to put coal out of business, and then she had the deplorables line and she never really came back from that.\n\nI think the thing about Joe Biden is that a lot of people will give him the benefit of the doubt and they will think, well, Joe means well. Okay, like, he doesn't really -- he doesn't want us to be without jobs. He cares about us -- like, he has that.\n\nBut there is an elitist attitude about coal that it belies the entire Democratic Party. The truth is, if he wants to win, he is going to have to try to win back some of those workers ion the rust belt, including coal workers.\n\nCARLSON: Right.\n\nPERINO: And I think that what he could have done, since apparently America is in a mood to wildly spend on government programs, why not try to ratchet it up and I would -- he could have said something like, I'm going to commit\n\n$15 billion for this community, specifically to help them, make sure that they're taken care of et cetera.\n\nNow, one thing that happened last week, the taxpayers are going to bail out a lot of the coal pensions because they were mismanaged by the executives, not the workers, but by the executives and guess then who gets on the hook for that? The taxpayers.\n\nAnd Joe Biden doesn't do any of that. He bypasses it and says something they could learn to code, which I think will come back to haunt him.\n\nCARLSON: So I just wonder quickly, I mean, that kind of tells you a lot about how that community is viewed in the Democratic Party. I mean, is it that hard if you're promising, you know, everybody a chunk of cash, just to say that, you know, Kentucky, Southwest Virginia and West Virginia, here's some -- but they can't because they don't like those people.\n\nPERINO: I think that it's showing that you have some -- I mean, think about Bill Clinton, right? I feel your pain. He didn't really, right?\n\nCARLSON: Yes.\n\nPERINO: But people thought that he meant it when he said that. Joe Biden has the capability to be that kind of guy as well. But what he said the other night was much more in line with sort of the fundraising circuit for Democrats, not the people circuit.\n\nCARLSON: Yes. Mistake. Dana Perino, great to see you tonight. Thank you.\n\nPERINO: Okay. Happy New Year.\n\nCARLSON: Happy New Year. So you were celebrating this past week with your family, but permanent Washington was plotting yet another war in the Middle East.\n\nTonight, there seems to have been another big step toward that war. We will be asking a question nobody seems to be raising. Is it a good idea?\n\nAn update and what's happening tonight after the break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCARLSON: We have an unexpected Fox News alert for you, something that has just happened in Iraq. The situation there, heating up very quickly without any debate here in Washington.\n\nIraqi television has just confirmed that Qasem Soleimani, a former general in Iran's Revolutionary Guard and the Commander of the Quds Force has been killed in a rocket attack apparently initiated by the United States near the Baghdad airport, along with the top official in the Iraqi Shiite militia. Now, what were they doing in Iraq? Unclear.\n\nBut his death comes several days after tensions kind of came out into the open in that country. Last week, if you've been following this, you know, an American civilian contractor was killed by militants in Iraq. The U.S.\n\ngovernment blamed that attack on Iran and it retaliated with strikes.\n\nIn response, protesters blockaded the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. It's basically where we were when the show started tonight.\n\nDefense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States is prepared to launch additional preemptive military strikes against Iranian interests in the region, which apparently are what we are seeing right now.\n\nNow, again, there's been virtually no debate or even discussion about this, but America appears to be lumbering toward a new Middle East war. And we have to say it's one that official Washington has wanted for decades.\n\nFor example, disgraced National Security adviser, John Bolton has made it his life's mission to start a war with Iran and tonight, Bolton may be finally getting his wish. Should you be happy about that? That's the question.\n\nWell, the last time we took John Bolton's advice in the region, Iran became far more powerful than it was before, before we took John Bolton's advice.\n\nWhy? Because things were never quite as simple as they claim they are in Washington.\n\nIn this case, the very people demanding action against Iran tonight, the ones telling you the Persian menace is the greatest threat we face are the very same ones demanding that you ignore the invasion of America now in progress from the south. The millions, the tens of millions of foreign nationals living among us illegally; the torrent, more significantly of Mexican narcotics that has killed and disabled entire generations of Americans -- nobody cares, in case you haven't noticed.\n\nPay no attention to all of that, these very same people tell us. The real threat is Iran. Well, they're liars. And they don't care about you. They don't care about your kids. They are reckless and incompetent. And you should keep all of that in mind, as war with Iran looms closer tonight.\n\nCurt Mills is a senior writer at the American Conservative. He joins us now. So Curt, this is unfolding, even as we speak. Where could it go from here?\n\nCURT MILLS, SENIOR WRITER, AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE: Well, like you said, if you liked the Iraq War, Tucker, we're back with a sequel, the Iran War.\n\nI would say the deep concern is, look, a general in the Iranian forces being assassinated is not necessarily something to mourn or begrudge the U.S. getting involved in.\n\nCARLSON: That's right. I agree.\n\nMILLS: The question is, though, is this a Franz Ferdinand moment? Is this a situation where a great power gets involved with the middle tier power and gets the world into a world war?\n\nIran, I think is a problem for the U.S. and its allies in the region. But it is not an existential threat, like China or Russia. China or Russia, particularly China would love to see another decade or two of Americans my age, dying in the sand for no particular purpose.\n\nCARLSON: Well, that's exactly it. It's not that anyone I think in the United States has particular affection for Iran or trust in its government, much, much less the Revolutionary Guard or the Kurds forces. Of course not.\n\nBut it's the intemperance with which the foreign policy establishment in Washington describes the threat that I think makes sensible people nervous, that Iran is the greatest threat we face. I mean, it's so prima facie absurd that it makes you wonder what their actual agenda is.\n\nMILLS: It's a joke. It's a joke. I mean, I think the real question is, why do we still have troops there? So you see the Baghdad embassy protests. And to be clear, this is not just an embassy. This is a fortress. It's been a fortress since we took out Saddam in 2003 and American troops there, if we're not going to re-annex, the country are effectively hostages.\n\nThey're just -- they're sent there. So the question the President, who I think rightfully ran in 2016, against the Bush legacy. The question is, does he want to re-invade Iraq?\n\nI understand there are people in his Cabinet that are selling him that Iran is not Iraq? But the fact of the matter, Iran is quite similar to Iraq.\n\nWe're talking about Iraq, 16 years later, it's still Iraq.\n\nIn order to counter Iran, I think the choice is clear. The President should contain Iranian influence in the region. We should avoid a hot war, which we are barreling towards at all costs.\n\nCARLSON: So my sense of it is, the President doesn't seek war and he is wary of it, particularly in an election year, but I think he was elected on the promise that he would avoid wars except when absolutely necessary.\n\nBut there are a lot of people around him and certainly in the city of Washington who have been preparing for this, agitating for it, Bolton is one of many for an awfully long time and you wonder if it's possible that he might be outmaneuvered by them and that we might find ourselves moving toward war despite what the President wants.\n\nMILLS: Right. So I think the President of the United States' convictions on this matter are sincere, but I think it's relevant, particularly extremely relevant matters of war and peace and life and death, who he staffs his administration with.\n\nI know, Bolton is a bugbear for you. But in some ways, Bolton because he is so flamboyant, and so infamous and notorious. He actually was a bit of a problem for the Iran Hawk Crusade, more middleweight, more circumspect managers like Robert C. O'Brien, Bolton's successor might actually be more effective at Trojan horsing, what I think would be a tragedy in the Middle East.\n\nIran is not Iraq, it's twice as big. It'd be twice as bad. We're weaker than we were 16 years ago. If President George W. Bush struggled to win reelection in 2004, if Trump does, he is cooked.\n\nCARLSON: I think that's right. Curt Mills. Great to see you tonight. Thank you for that.\n\nMILLS: Thanks. So you hear a lot from the left about how concerned about the environment they are. But you've noticed that those concerns have always conveniently dovetailed with acquiring more political power and crushing their political enemies.\n\nCalifornia saw major wildfires this year and according to the Nation magazine, there's a clear culprit -- private homeownership is the problem.\n\nAnd we're quoting now, The idealization of individual homeownership created the scorching landscapes we face today. Individual homeownership should be seriously questioned.\n\nBanning private homeownership? Will that stop wildfires? It would fix the environment. How about building fewer shopping malls? No one ever thinks of that. No, it won't. It will make the government more powerful. It'll make regular people less happy and less free. And of course, that is the point.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a lifelong Californian. He is a fellow at the Hoover Institution and we're happy to have him tonight. Professor, thanks a lot for coming on. Do you think that wildfires besetting your state mean that people should not be allowed to own their own homes?\n\nVICTOR DAVIS HANSON, FELLOW, HOOVER INSTITUTION: Well, it's a characteristic of the left that they envision natural and man-made disasters as opportunities to ram down agendas that we otherwise wouldn't vote for, and that's what Rahm Emanuel said, never let a crisis go to waste.\n\nI think it was AOC's Chief of Staff who said the New Green Deal was really not about climate change, but changing the American economy along socialist lines. This had nothing to do with climate change or our fires, Tucker.\n\nWe've only gone up about one degree in a century in California. That's mostly because of asphalt and cement and our cities, and precipitation hasn't changed. What it is about is that we have a hundred million trees and underbrush that grew out -- that died out of the 2014 to 2016 drought.\n\nWe never harvested them for green reasons and the underbrush took over and then, PG&E which was at one time as you remember as a Californian, the best utility in the United States. It's ossified. It's calcified. It's over regulated. It's got all these green mandates. It's got to use expensive energy production.\n\nIt doesn't have a capital to update its transmission lines, and when I was a kid, the wind didn't have much of effect it does now.\n\nAnd then finally, I think this is really important that California zoning laws have made a lot of places that were really habitable not open to urbanization or suburbanization in the Bay Area, or LA. So people move out to areas that they didn't used to live in to find cheap places to live because everything is so expensive in California.\n\nAnd when you have infrastructure -- infrastructure that is rated about the worst in the nation, our highways and bridges, and it's hard to get to these places. The freeways are packed. We haven't built a major reservoir since New Melones Dam in 1983. So it's a kind of a perfect storm.\n\nAnd you know, Tucker when state and local officials can't solve existential problems, they blame other reasons and when they can't deal with homelessness and then you banned plastic bottles at San Francisco Airport.\n\nWe can't deal with utility or wildfire damage, then you say climate change did it and we've got to become socialists.\n\nCARLSON: Well, I mean, it's dysfunctional because it's crowded, and it's crowded because of their immigration policy and they won't admit that.\n\nThey did this, as you know. Professor, thank you so much.\n\nHANSON: Thank you.\n\nCARLSON: So attacking homeowners is just one facet of the broader assault on normal people in this country. In the City of San Francisco, progressives are working constantly to create their ideal vision of an American city.\n\nBut the opposite has been the effect. It is now unsafe, unhealthy, unaffordable, and for many, unlivable. It's a dystopia in a lot of ways.\n\nThe most beautiful city in our country.\n\nWe sent a team of producers to San Francisco for an in-depth exclusive investigation into what is happening there. And the effect it is having on the dwindling pool of middle class residents.\n\nOur special series debuts next Monday, and it continues all week. Here's a short preview of what we found.\n\n(VIDEO CLIP PLAYS)\n\nCARLSON: Oh, it's -- even the trailer is all too much. It's shocking what we found.\n\nWell, up next, free speech may be dying in parts of America, but Adam Carolla and Dennis Prager are ensuring the First Amendment would at least go down fighting.\n\nTheir documentary is back in theaters and they join us next to talk about it. Stay tuned.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCARLSON: Freedom of speech is America's most distinctive, right. It's a free country. Remember they used to say that back when it was. But it's also the most embattled of all of our rights.\n\nIn the name of safety and sensitivity, a coalition of big tech monopolists, universities and political activists are fighting to limit what you're allowed to say, and punish those who stray outside the accepted boundaries.\n\nBut last year, comedian Adam Carolla who is a genius, and radio host, Dennis Prager, also kind of genius, teamed up to release No Safe Spaces,\n\nkind of a brilliant documentary about the American Anti-Speech Movement.\n\nHere's part of it.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDENNIS PRAGER, FOUNDER, PRAGER U: Israel sent me into the Soviet Union when I was 21 years old, because I knew Russian and Hebrew, and I was sent in to smuggle out the names of Jews that I would find in the Soviet Union and to smuggle in religious items and so on.\n\nAnd I really experienced what most people in the West have never ever experienced -- life under a totalitarian regime.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nCARLSON: It's a great movie. And if you want to see it in theaters, you still have a chance to do that. The film is having a limited release this weekend, thanks to strong support from grateful viewers.\n\nAdam Carolla and Dennis Prager, join us tonight. Gentlemen, thanks both for coming out. I haven't talked to you since the film came out. Just to start with you, Adam. What was the risk? Did anyone tell you that you're not allowed to say the things you said in the film? Did the irony loop come complete?\n\nADAM CAROLLA, COMEDIAN: It is interesting when people are talking about free speech, but it's free speech that they want to vet and make sure it's okay for them to hear before you can say it.\n\nI did notice the clip was all Dennis Prager, by the way, so I'm going to get my publicist on this.\n\nPRAGER: Yes. This resentment is a very big problem.\n\nCARLSON: Well, I think he may be close to one of my producers.\n\nPRAGER: The problem is -- it's a big problem. We enjoy each other too much. We're looking for problems.\n\nCAROLLA: Yes. We're still kind of in the newly wed phase of our relationship.\n\nCARLSON: So what are -- but even newlyweds, they may sublimate it, but there's usually tension. If you could identify one thing that divides you bitterly, what would it be?\n\nCAROLLA: He likes gefilte fish, and I wouldn't feed that stuff to my cat.\n\nPRAGER: No, you said you did feed it.\n\nCAROLLA: Yes, I did. Feed it to my cat.\n\nPRAGER: Your cat liked it. I asked you specifically how it went over in the Corolla home. You said the cat loved it.\n\nCAROLLA: Yes, he gave me a jar of gefilte fish.\n\nPRAGER: Yes, I did.\n\nCAROLLA: By the way fish isn't supposed to be in jars. Just for your information. It should be on platters or it's supposed to be above a fireplace in a hunting lodge. Your aquarium. That's right.\n\nCARLSON: Exactly.\n\nPRAGER: By the way, this was the danger working with him.\n\nCARLSON: So has the problem gotten better?\n\nPRAGER: No.\n\nCAROLLA: The gefilte fish is as bad as it has ever been.\n\nCARLSON: No, that's -- I mean, I think that's there's not any room for improvement there at all. But the question of speech, do you think the country has become freer or less free in the last year?\n\nPRAGER: No, it's -- it is less free. There's no question. And you could -- there's an interesting proof. Read the reviewers in the mainstream media, not to mention left wing media, on how they have contempt for the film.\n\nWhen the film features liberal after liberal, including President Obama, speaking about what's going on, on campuses, but they can't even acknowledge that this is going on when they see the film, which is about the suppression of speech.\n\nCAROLLA: I have a slightly different feeling on it. Yes, well, here's what I think. I feel like the pendulum is starting to swing back the other direction.\n\nI mean, the comedic community and I feel a lot of my cohorts in the comedy world are starting to push back against it because they're at their saturation level. And I feel like the group that started this thing is starting to double down on it, starting to really work it harder.'\n\nIt's sort of the same subject is racism. As racism fades from our society, a certain group is tripling down their efforts to make sure it's alive and well, or at least we think it's alive and well.\n\nPRAGER: I think he is right about the comedic community. That's correct. Outside of that, I don't think it's true. San Francisco 49'er color announcer -- and I'm not sure you could use that term any longer -- simply said in describing the Baltimore Ravens quarterback who is a terrific quarterback and who is black and he said, you know, there might be the slight half second advantage in a handoff because the ball is black and the uniform is black and he is black. So the offensive line doesn't see it quite as quickly.\n\nAnd the guy was said, you're a racist. And unless he apologized profusely as in Mao's China in the Cultural Revolution, he would have lost his job.\n\nCAROLLA: Defensive line, but we know what you're talking about.\n\nCARLSON: So I wonder if we are at the point though where --\n\nPRAGER: That's right, defensive line. You are right and that was a boo- boo.\n\nCARLSON: I wonder if it's counterproductive -- okay, but the point remains, is it -- I mean, what about the people who are facing this problem and there are a lot of them, not just famous people, but normal people who are under attack by the HR department down the hall. What's the right response for them? Should they go through the Mao's China routine where they apologize and beg forgiveness? Or do they stand on principle?\n\nPRAGER: Well, I won't -- I don't know what Adam's position is on this. But I think -- first of all, apologizing means that you think you were wrong. I don't know how people live with themselves when they are right, and they publicly announced that they were wrong.\n\nIt's so humiliating that I personally couldn't do it.\n\nCAROLLA: Well, I think we're going to have to do it this way because I do my own podcast. I have my own pirate ship. I have autonomy. I can say what I want. I don't have to apologize. And thus, I'm not asked to apologize because I never apologize.\n\nBut for guys who do announcers for the 49'ers, what are they to do?\n\nPRAGER: No, I know. It's a horrible, horrible dilemma.\n\nCAROLLA: What we have to do is all stop apologizing at the same time. I mean, if there's one guy with a gun, we just have pool cues and we all need to charge them at once. If we do it one by one, we'll be taken out one by one.\n\nPRAGER: By the way, just let me remind people, because it's a great film.\n\nnosafespaces.com and they can find out where it's playing.\n\nCARLSON: And I think they will. Adam and Dennis. Good to see both tonight. Thank you.\n\nPRAGER: Thank you.\n\nCAROLLA: Thank you.\n\nCARLSON: So months after Jeffrey Epstein's death, however, that occurred, his alleged fixer is still free. Where is she? New reports tonight about where and who is protecting her? Remarkable story. Trace Gallagher fills us in after the break.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nCARLSON: Well, according to multiple sources Ghislaine Maxwell was Jeffrey Epstein's fixer, the person who facilitated his abuse of teenage girls.\n\nBut since Epstein's death, Maxwell has rarely appeared in public and has not been charged with any crime.\n\nNow, according to a new report, that is not an accident. Apparently she is being protected. Chief breaking news correspondent, Trace Gallagher has more this story. Hey, Trace.\n\nTRACE GALLAGHER, FOX NEWS CHIEF BREAKING NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Tucker. The question has long lingered about whether his ex-girlfriend and confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell would face charges for allegedly recruiting and grooming these young girls for underage sex.\n\nBut our corporate cousin, The New York Post says, for now Maxwell is untouchable with the source saying, quote, Ghislaine is protected. She and Jeffrey were assets of sorts for multiple foreign governments. They would trade information about the powerful people caught in his net -- caught at Epstein's house.\n\nAdding, quoting here, She is not in the U.S. She moves around. She is sometimes in the U.K., but most often in other countries such as Israel, where her powerful contacts have provided her with safe houses and protection.\n\nAnd separately, we should note, a friend of Ghislaine Maxwell tells The Sun newspaper that she has enough dirt on those powerful contacts that she expects to avoid any prosecution at all -- Tucker.\n\nCARLSON: A little test to whether justice is real. Trace Gallagher, thanks for much for that tonight. Good to see you.\n\nWell, that's it for us. We'll be back tomorrow, 8:00 p.m., the show that's a sworn enemy of lying, pomposity, smugness and groupthink. Good night.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC.

President Trump used his first-ever prime time address from the Oval Office on Tuesday night to make his case for funding a southern border wall -- as well as to emphasize the human cost of what he called the growing humanitarian and security crisis of surging illegal immigration.\n\nThe speech, which was followed moments later by a rebuttal from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, drew seemingly deep lines in the sand while also emphasizing the importance of compromise. Republicans and Democrats plan to meet Wednesday to continue negotiations to end the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding, now in its third week. (Trump has said the shutdown could last for years if no deal is reached.)\n\nNoting that more Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War, the president, looking directly into the camera, called for closing the pipeline that permits vast quantities of illegal drugs – including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl – to cross the border.\n\nEvery week, 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone – 90 percent of which floods across from our southern border, Trump, who signed a bipartisan opioid bill into law late last year, remarked at the beginning of his address.\n\nHe continued: This is a humanitarian crisis – a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul. Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States – a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system.\n\nThe president then paid tribute to several Americans killed by suspected illegal immigrants, including California police Cpl. Ronil Singh, who was murdered the day after Christmas -- allegedly by an illegal immigrant suspected of driving drunk. The suspect had multiple prior arrests, and Republicans have charged that California's sanctuary laws, which prevent local law enforcement from cooperating with federal immigration authorities, led to Singh's murder.\n\nAmerica's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold-blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border, Trump said. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON: WHY DO SOME CONTINUE TO DENY ISSUES AT THE BORDER?\n\nTrump added: In California, an Air Force Veteran was raped, murdered and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.\n\nWealthy politicians ... don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. — President Trump\n\nOver the last several years, I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration, Trump continued. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices, or the sadness gripping their souls. How much more American blood must be shed before Congress does its job?\n\nApparently responding to Pelosi's widely reported comment that a wall would be immoral, Trump remarked: Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside.\n\nIn the end, reiterated his call for new border technology and $5.7 billion for a physical border barrier, and sought compromise: To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife, whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken? Trump asked.\n\nIn a joint, nationally televised response broadcast minutes later, Pelosi, D-Calif., and Schumer, D-N.Y., did not focus on any possible compromise, and instead condemned Trump's rhetoric and what they called his obsession with building a border wall. (Trump won the night by talking compromise, Washington Post columnist Marc Thiessen wrote Tuesday.)\n\nMuch of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice, Pelosi, standing next to Schumer, charged. The President has chosen fear. We want to start with the facts.\n\nThe fact is: On the very first day of this Congress, House Democrats passed Senate Republican legislation to re-open government and fund smart, effective border security solutions, Pelosi said, referring to bills that did not include funding for Trump's border wall.\n\nBut, the president is rejecting these bipartisan bills which would re-open government – over his obsession with forcing American taxpayers to waste billions of dollars on an expensive and ineffective wall – a wall he always promised Mexico would pay for, Pelosi continued.\n\nSchumer added afterward: There is an obvious solution: separate the shutdown from the arguments over border security. There is bipartisan legislation – supported by Democrats and Republicans – to re-open government while allowing debate over border security to continue.\n\nWATCH: BORDER PATROL AGENTS FIRE TEAR GAS AS 150 MIGRANTS ATTEMPT TO STORM BORDER, SOME THROW ROCKS\n\nThe symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a thirty-foot wall, Schumer concluded. So, our suggestion is a simple one, Mr. President: Re-open the government and we can work to resolve our differences over border security. But end this shutdown now.\n\nOn social media, the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) called out Schumer and Pelosi's previously strong support for border wall funding, and appeared to join in with other Twitter users mocking the two senators' demeanor during their response address.\n\nConservative commentator Ben Shaprio compared Pelosi and Schumer's look to that of the nefarious fictional villains from the James Bond spy franchise, before reposting another Twitter user's image depicting Schumer as a used car salesman. Others likened Pelosi to the aristocratic character Lucille Bluth in the television comedy series Arrested Development.\n\nVermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, widely considered a potential 2020 presidential contender, delivered his own rebuttal that asserted climate change and health care are more urgent crises than illegal immigration. Sanders listed a variety of people who will potentially suffer if the shutdown continues.\n\nSecurity at our nation's airports could be threatened if TSA employees and air traffic controllers are not getting paid, Sanders said. You want a national emergency? 30 million Americans have no health insurance and many more are under-insured.\n\nNegotiations are slated to continue throughout the week to resolve the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced an additional 420,000 to work without pay. On Wednesday, Fox News learned, Trump will head to Capitol Hill for a policy lunch with Senate Republicans. Congressional leaders from both parties have been invited to the White House for a 3 p.m. ET sit-down afterward.\n\nThe president, during his address Tuesday, vowed that the wall would very quickly pay for itself in part because the cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion dollars a year – vastly more than the $5.7 billion dollars we have requested from Congress. Trump added that the wall will also be paid for, indirectly, by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico and suggested that his offer to make the wall out of steel, instead of concrete, was a concession to Democrats.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump plans a personal visit to the Mexican border, where his administration said an illegal immigration crisis has been worsening by the day.\n\nReacting to Trump's speech, Senate Republican leaders -- who have said they will not pass Democrats' spending bills without border wall funding -- reaffirmed that they've stood by the White House's position.\n\nTonight, President Trump reaffirmed his commitment to addressing the humanitarian and security crisis at our nation's southern border, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said in a statement. His proposal to increase security through physical barriers suits the reality on the ground. It's what career Border Patrol experts support and are asking for. And it simply builds on earlier legislation that Senate Democrats like then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Clinton, and Senator Schumer previously supported with enthusiasm.\n\nPELOSI SPARS WITH DHS HEAD IN SITUATION ROOM: 'I REJECT YOUR FACTS'\n\nMcConnell continued: The past eighteen days have shown that Democrats' refusal to negotiate is not due to any principled objection, but simply due to partisan spite for the president. For the men and women of the Border Patrol, for the safety of American families, and for all Americans who deserve a fully operational federal government, I sincerely hope my Democratic colleagues will come to the table and help deliver a solution.\n\nSome legal and political analysts were less enthusiastic. As expected, [Trump's address] was laden with emotional appeals, with the president presenting a parade of horribles, John Cerone, Professor of International Law at The Fletcher School, told Fox News. He added that a wall would have only limited efficacy compared to other options.\n\nUltimately, the only way to stop irregular migration is to give people some hope of regular migration, Cerone said. Expanding pathways for regular migration, in particular by creating new employment visas and raising the limits on existing categories, is a win-win situation.\n\nThe number of illegal border crossings is down from 1.6 million in 2000 to less than 400,000 last year. But, the number of families coming over the border has risen sharply, putting a strain on health care and immigration services that came into sharp focus with the deaths of two migrant children in December.\n\nAdministration figures have shown that 161,000 family units crossed the border in fiscal 2018, a 50 percent increase from the year before. Homeland Security officials also have said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 percent increase.\n\nAfter a sit-down with Democrats over the weekend, the White House issued a series of budget demands, including a new request for $800,000 for humanitarian needs. But, mostly, Trump still wants his wall, which Democrats have described as immoral as well as no solution to illegal immigration.\n\nIn a pre-emptive move, the White House said Monday that tax refunds would be paid despite the shutdown. That shutdown exemption would break from past practice and could be challenged.\n\nEmphasizing that he was not abandoning his security argument, Trump said in a fundraising email Tuesday: I want to make one thing clear to Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi: Your safety is not a political game or a negotiation tactic!\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi, for her part, has also sparred openly with the White House. She reportedly engaged in a tense confrontation with Nielsen on Wednesday in the Situation Room, interrupting Nielsen's presentation on border security and illegal immigration, telling her, I reject your facts.\n\nIn her brief response address on Tuesday night, Pelosi used the word facts six times, in an effort to contrast with what she called Trump's rhetoric of fear.\n\nThe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge – a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened, Pelosi said.
This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday, January 5, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nChris Wallace: I'm Chris Wallace. A potential turning point in the Middle East as President Trump orders an airstrike that kills Iran's top general.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nDonald Trump: He was plotting attacks against Americans but now we've ensured that his atrocities have been stopped for good.\n\nChris Wallace: Tehran vows a hard revenge after a drone strike takes out General Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds force.\n\nMale Speaker: When this general is martyred, the whole U.S. army is put on alert in the entire region.\n\nChris Wallace: Now as more U.S. forces head to the region, what happens next in the Middle East?\n\nMike Pompeo: We don't seek war with Iran but we at the same time are not going to stand by and watch the Iranians escalate and continue to put American lives at risk.\n\nChris Wallace: We'll ask Secretary of State Mike Pompeo live only on Fox News Sunday. And get reaction from Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen. Then Congress returns from break to its standoff over impeachment.\n\nMitch McConnell: We can't hold a trial without the articles.\n\nChuck Schumer: We are no closer to establishing the rules for a Senate trial than when we last met.\n\nChris Wallace: We'll ask our Sunday panel where the process stands more than two weeks after the House vote. And our power player of the week, the true Hollywood story of the head of the Motion Picture Association.\n\nMale Speaker: I went from working from Kermit and Miss Piggy to the president of the United States.\n\nChris Wallace: All right now on Fox News Sunday.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: And hello again from Fox News in Washington. The deadly strike on Iranian general Qassem Soleimani marks a major escalation in the standoff between Washington and Tehran raising fears of all-out war, the U.S. sending more than 4,000 additional troops to the Middle East this week as Iran promises to seek revenge. In a moment we'll speak live with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But first let's get the latest from Kevin Corke at the president's Mar-A-Lago retreat in Florida. Kevin.\n\nKevin Corke: Chris, the Iraqi parliament convenes an extraordinary session this Sunday. They're considering whether to ask the U.S. to withdraw troops from their country. Now that consideration comes just a couple of days after that American drone strike took out an Iranian general on Iraqi soil, sparking fears of a wider regional conflict. [begin video clip]\n\nKevin Corke: Over the weekend, Iraq's prime minister strongly criticized the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and prominently took part in the massive anti-U.S. protest in Baghdad. White House officials said it was Soleimani who directed the recent assault on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and was responsible for killing hundreds of Americans worldwide. In Iran, a massive funeral procession through several cities to honor the slain general who many considered the second-most powerful man in the Islamic Republic. Overnight, President Trump tweeting, If Iran attacks an American base or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way. And threatening to strike 52 Iranian sites representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago. Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif responding, Targeting cultural sites is a war crime, and Iran's telecommunications minister called Trump a terrorist in a suit.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nAfter a two-week vacation here in Florida, the president makes his way back home, where he'll be considering entanglements abroad and a possible impeachment trial here in the states. Chris.\n\nChris Wallace: Kevin Corke reporting from Mar-A-Lago. Kevin, thank you. Joining us now here in Washington, the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo. Welcome back to Fox News Sunday, sir.\n\nMike Pompeo: Chris, it's great to be with you. Thanks for having me on this morning.\n\nChris Wallace: Do you know that the Iraqi parliament is holding an emergency session today to discuss the question as to whether U.S. troops, the 5,000 troops we have there, should remain in country? It has just come across the wires the Iraqi prime minister says, It is in the interest of both Iraq and the U.S. to end foreign troop presence in Iraq, and he also says that the killing of General Soleimani and also a top militia leader who was backed by Iran, Muhandis, were political assassinations. Your reaction, sir.\n\nMike Pompeo: Chris, the American people should know that President Trump will never shy away from protecting and defending America. It's what we've done over these past weeks and days. It's what we've done over our entire three years with our Middle East strategy. The activity that you're seeing today is fully consistent with that. The American people should know we will continue. The president tweeted it again last night. We will take the actions necessary to keep Americans safe. You know, as for the activity today with respect to Iraq, we've been in their country. We've been supporting Iraqi sovereignty. We've been continuing to take down the terrorist threat against the Iraqi people. The prime minister is the resigned prime minister. He's the acting prime minister. He's under enormous threats from the very Iranian leadership that it is that we are pushing back against. We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there to fight the counterterror campaign. And we'll continue to do all the things we need to do to keep America safe.\n\nChris Wallace: But if Iraq, it is a sovereign country, if they demand that we leave, one, will we leave? And if we do, won't that dramatically hurt the fight against ISIS and stability in the region?\n\nMike Pompeo: So, we'll have to take a look at what we do when the Iraqi leadership and government makes a decision, but the American people should know we'll make the right decision. We will take actions that, frankly, the previous administration refused to take to do just that.\n\nChris Wallace: President Trump says that General Soleimani was planning a imminent attack against Americans. You have said it was a big action that could potentially kill hundreds of American diplomats and soldiers. What was the plan? Who were the targets? And how soon?\n\nMike Pompeo: Yes. President Trump was right in what he said. So was I. We'll share all the intelligence if we can. I was the CIA director for a little while, Chris. There's things we simply cannot make public about what it is we knew at that time and what in fact we know today about the continuing activity. I think General Miller got it right when he said we would have been culpably negligent had we not gone after Soleimani when we had the opportunity. He was actively engaged and plotting against American interests. We need to look no further than what he had personally done over the days before that where an American was killed on December 27th. There's no surprise. There's plenty of public evidence about the bad behavior of Qassem Soleimani. He was a designated terrorist and we did the right thing.\n\nChris Wallace: I just want to press to this degree. The -- he had been targeting Americans and other people around the region for decades. The blood of 600 Americans was on his hands for -- during the Iraq war. The question is, that there are some intelligence agents who are talking to media outlets who are saying yes, he was doing bad things but it was another day in the Middle East and some congressional leaders who have been briefed now say that the intelligence was not of an imminent attack that was bigger, more worrisome. Don't the American people have the right to some understanding of what it was, why it was so urgent to take out Soleimani now?\n\nMike Pompeo: It's interesting. I haven't heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence make the comments that you just described. I think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior American leaders had in their possession would've come to the same conclusion that President Trump and our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to America, more risk through inaction than there was through the action that we took. I think it's very clear. I think it's very plain. We'll do everything we can to share this information with the American people, but I think the American people understand too, there's certain things you just can't -- you can't put out in public. You got to protect Americans who are out collecting the intelligence. The intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and protect them.\n\nChris Wallace: Iran's leaders are vowing a crushing response using words like a hard revenge. What do we do if they strike back, if they retaliate? Is there a plan and is there -- because of the fact that we went after Soleimani -- has there been a change in U.S. response where we're no longer going to go after the enemy in the field we're now going to go after Iran's command and control.\n\nMike Pompeo: Well, Chris, the American people know that there's a strategy. There's a strategy that has been several years in the making now, that we've been working on. It's been a diplomatic strategy. It's been an economic strategy. You're now seeing elements of the military strategy. And with respect to targets, President Trump talked about 52 targets last night. That's not new in the following sense: we've made clear to the theocrats and kleptocrats that are running Iran today, running it into the ground against the will of their own people -- we made clear to them that we would not respond just against these proxy forces that they run, in Yemen, and in Syria, and in Iraq, and in Lebanon. We made clear that this cost would be brought home to them, to the leadership regime in Iran, and that we would raise costs. We wouldn't just attack their asymmetric efforts; we would respond in a way that imposes costs on the decision-makers who are putting American lives at risk.\n\nChris Wallace: So, you're saying to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, you're saying to President Rouhani, you're saying to leaders of the Revolutionary Guard, Don't think that you're off limits?\n\nMike Pompeo: What I'm saying is exactly what President Trump has said. We will take responses that are appropriate and commensurate with actions that threaten American lives. That's what we've done so far, Chris. There's no reason that the American people or the Iranian regime should ever expect we'll do anything different.\n\nChris Wallace: You talk about the strategy. The president has been pushing what he calls the maximum pressure strategy since he took office. He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018. He imposed tough economic sanctions. And this summer, he suggested that the strategy was working. Take a look.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nPresident Trump: Iran is a much different country than two-and-a-half years ago. When I took over, Iran was all over. They had 14 to 18 different sights of confliction. They were all over. And now, they just want to -- oh, they want to negotiate a deal so badly.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: But in 2019 alone, Iran hit six ships, shot down a U.S. drone, launched an attack against Saudi oil facilities -- a damaging attack. And for all the talk of isolating Iran, they just conducted joint exercises with China and Russia. So, the question is, has the president's maximum pressure strategy made Iran less aggressive or more?\n\nMike Pompeo: Panicked aggression on the part of the Iranian leadership, because they know that the Iranian people are demanding enormous change. And they know that the Iranian people are supported by America in that demand for change. Yeah. We've built out a huge coalition, Chris. Gulf states, Israel, countries all across the whole world who are joining us. They are joining us not only in the efforts in the Strait of Hormuz, but in air defense efforts all across the region. The malign actor of Iran has been identified. Remember where we came in, Chris. Remember where we came in. In 2015, the Obama-Biden administration essentially handed power to the Iranian leadership and acted as a quasi-ally of theirs, by underwriting them -- underwriting the very malicious -- that killed Americans. Those resources, the money that they had to build out those forces throughout the Shi'a Crescent was provided to them by the nuclear deal. We allowed Europeans to go do business there. We provided them $150 billion, pallets of cash. All of these things are the very challenge that the Trump administration has had to correct. The strategy is working. We're going to stay the course. And we will protect and defend the American people at every step, Chris.\n\nChris Wallace: Just so you know, I will be asking Senator Van Hollen about that in the next segment. President Trump also says that he is keeping his campaign promise to pull U.S. troops out of the Middle East. Here's what he had to say in October.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nDonald Trump: The plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing agents all over the world. It was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years. Let someone else fight over this long, blood-stained sand.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: But just this week, this week, the U.S. deployed 100 Marines to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, plus 750 to the region, and now another 3,500. Is the president pulling us out of endless wars in the Middle East, or with this action this week, did he take a big step back in?\n\nMike Pompeo: Endless wars are the direct result of weakness, and President Trump will never let that happen. We're going to get it right. We're going to get the force posture right. We're going to get our facilities as hardened as we can possibly get them, to defend against what Iran may potentially do. But make no mistake: America's mission is to have our footprint in the Middle East reduced while still keeping America safe -- safe from rogue regimes like the Islamic Republic of Iran, and from terrorist activity, broadly, throughout the region.\n\nChris Wallace: So, is it fair to say that while the big strategy is to pull the U.S. out of endless wars, at least in the short term, there could be more of a commitment?\n\nMike Pompeo: The Obama administration created enormous risks to the American people in Iran. This administration is working to reduce that risk.\n\nChris Wallace: Finally, some analysts suggest that the impeachment of President Trump has emboldened enemies like Iran and North Korea to think that they can confront him. Do you think that, as misguided as it may be, that some of our enemies think that this president is more vulnerable because of the impeachment effort?\n\nMike Pompeo: You should ask Mr. Soleimani.\n\nChris Wallace: I understand that. But he was going ahead before you killed him. And the question is, do you think that impeachment is emboldening our enemies?\n\nMike Pompeo: I don't. I think that our adversaries understand that President Trump and our administration will do the right thing to protect American people, every place that we find risk.\n\nChris Wallace: Secretary Pompeo, thank you.\n\nMike Pompeo: Thank you, Chris.\n\nChris Wallace: Thanks for coming in on a very busy weekend, sir.\n\nMike Pompeo: You bet. Yes, sir. Thank you.\n\nChris Wallace: When we come back, Democrats raise questions about the wisdom and legality of the president's decision to take out Soleimani. We'll talk with a top Democratic senator, Chris Van Hollen. That's next.\n\n[commercial break]\n\nChris Wallace: The Senate returned, Friday, to its continuing stand-off over how and when to hold a trial after the impeachment of President Trump. And now, that's further complicated by the explosive developments with Iran. Joining us now here in Washington, Democrat Chris Van Hollen of Maryland. Senator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n\nChris Van Hollen: Good to be with you, Chris.\n\nChris Wallace: As soon as the drone strike took out Soleimani, you and other Democrats started criticizing the action. President Trump and his top officials say that there was an imminent attack, and that that taking out Soleimani prevented it. You just heard Secretary Pompeo say that again on this program. Don't you believe them?\n\nChris Van Hollen: I think we learned the hard way, Chris, in Iraq, in the Iraq war, that administrations sometimes manipulate and cherry-pick intelligence to further their political goals. That's what got us into the Iraq War. There was no WMD -- and --\n\nChris Wallace: Let me just interrupt. I understand that that's happened in the past. Are you saying it's happening now?\n\nChris Van Hollen: I'm saying that they have an obligation to present the evidence. They did not notify the Gang of 8. The one opportunity they had, just two days ago, to brief senior staff at the top secret level, they provided no evidence to support their claim of an imminent threat. Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy. There's no debate there. But the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported. And what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting Americans at greater risk. In fact, Secretary Pompeo's own State Department, right after these attacks, urged Americans to leave Iraq. So, obviously, they thought it was a more dangerous situation there the day after than the day before, and as you've just reported, we sent 4,000 additional troops to Iraq, this from a president claiming he wants to get out of wars in the Middle East.\n\nChris Wallace: All right, but there's no question, and you certainly would agree, that Soleimani was our enemy. He had been responsible, directly or indirectly, for the deaths of hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq war. There's no question that he was -- he wasn't taking a vacation as he was traveling around the Middle East this last week. He was making more plans for terror attacks, spreading Iran's malign influence. Why not kill him?\n\nChris Van Hollen: Well, because you have to look at what the consequences are, right? We don't go around killing all the very bad people in the world. We have President Trump embracing Kim Jong-un, the leader of North Korea who's got a lot of blood on his hands and is responsible for the death of Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, and yet he's getting love letters from the president of the United States. So, the question is, do we further our interests by killing Soleimani? And everything we've seen is we've actually increased the risks of war dramatically, we've put Americans at greater threat, and we seem to have accomplished Soleimani and the Iranians' main goal, which is to undermine our influence and support in Iraq. We now have the top Iraqi leadership, the president and the prime minister, condemning the United States' action. We have Parliament meeting to talk about expelling U.S. forces. What was Soleimani's main goal in Iraq? It was to get the Americans out, to undermine our influence. So, we seem to have accomplished what Soleimani was trying to do but couldn't, so in death he's actually accomplished his goal. That is a -- that turns back U.S. interests in the region.\n\nChris Wallace: You have been tweeting ever since the Soleimani takedown. Here's one of them. The Constitution makes clear that a president may not go to war without authorization from Congress, and we have not authorized war with Iran. But, Senator, the White House says this is not war, that Soleimani was a terrorist, and this was an act of self-defense, which a commander-in-chief can always take.\n\nChris Van Hollen: My point, Chris, is we're now headed very close to the precipice of war. You just heard the president this morning talk about targeting Iranian sites, including cultural sites, which is, in fact, a war crime if the president was to carry that out. The point we're making is that the president is not entitled under the Constitution to continue this escalation and take us to war without congressional action. That's what the Constitution requires. Look, I heard Secretary Pompeo talk about this. You asked him about the maximum pressure strategy. They've not accomplished any of their goals. They had very unrealistic goals. All they have done under maximum pressure is escalate the chance of war with Iran, something President Trump said he wanted to avoid, but a lot of people around him, like Secretary Pompeo, have been urging a confrontation with Iran for a very long time, including when he was a member of Congress.\n\nChris Wallace: I want to pick up on this, because here was another one of your tweets in the last couple of days. The administration's reckless policy over the last three years has brought us to the brink, but the president -- and you just heard Secretary Pompeo say, no, it was President Obama who brought us to the brink; it was the Obama nuclear deal which funneled billions of dollars back into the regime that they used to spread their brand of terror across the Middle East, and also, it was the Obama administration's decision to focus exclusively on the nuclear program and to ignore all the other malign activity by Iran throughout the region.\n\nChris Van Hollen: Well, first of all, they didn't ignore it, but the Obama administration correctly observed that a nuclear-armed Iran would be even more dangerous than an Iran that did not have nuclear weapons. And so, what this administration did was they ripped up that agreement, essentially divided us from our allies, and the result has been this increased actual activity from Iran in the region.\n\nChris Wallace: Well, not necessarily. I mean, you look at the reports that because of the fact that there are economic sanctions and Iran is economically strapped, that Hezbollah is starved for money, Hamas is starved for money. Isn't that a good thing?\n\nChris Van Hollen: So, look, there's no doubt that the maximum pressure campaign is putting pressure on Iran, but to what end? Secretary Pompeo had a list of, like, 11 things the Iranian regime had to do, and it was never realistic, and that's why they've got no endgame. And that's why we're here right now, after this latest escalation, at much greater risk of going to war with Iran, which would be very damaging to the United States. Obviously, it would be damaging to Iran, but it would be very damaging to the United States.\n\nChris Wallace: All right --\n\nChris Van Hollen: Iran has continued to prosecute its efforts in Syria throughout the time of this administration, so the notion that they've succeeded in doing anything to stop Iran's malign influence is nonsense. What they have done is dramatically escalate the chance of war.\n\nChris Wallace: All right, I want to switch dramatically -- different subject. How long do you think that Speaker Pelosi should hold on to the articles of impeachment? Mitch McConnell, the Senate Majority Leader, has made it very clear, he's not going to be cowed by her, he's not going to be pressured by her; the Senate is going to run its own trial. At some point, doesn't she have to hand over the articles, and for the good of the country, doesn't the Senate have to get on with a trial?\n\nChris Van Hollen: Well, Speaker Pelosi has made very clear she will send over the articles of impeachment.\n\nChris Wallace: When?\n\nChris Van Hollen: She's also been --\n\nChris Wallace: Wait, wait. When?\n\nChris Van Hollen: When she feels it's appropriate, and I think that, you know, that will happen. But the issue, Chris, is that we have a constitutional duty in the Senate to have a trial, and it needs to be a fair trial, and every American recognizes that a fair trial means you get to call witnesses, you get to have relevant documents. We've seen in the last two weeks more emails that have surfaced that show this Trump administration trying to cover up key emails showing that the president of the United States -- confirming again, he ordered the hold on vital U.S. Ukrainian military assistance. And so, why not get those documents? President Trump himself said that he wants Mulvaney to testify. He said that months ago. Why shouldn't we have witnesses? That is the question.\n\nChris Wallace: Okay, I've got one last question. I've got less than a minute for you to answer. Do you have any concerns about holding this trial right now with the president in this growing confrontation with Iran and potentially an international crisis? Is that a good thing for the Senate to be trying whether or not to remove the president at this particular moment?\n\nChris Van Hollen: We have a constitutional duty -- when it comes to the issues of war, Congress and the Constitution has the power to declare war despite what the president may think, and we have a constitutional duty to try the president in an impeachment trial when the House of Representatives sends us the articles of impeachment.\n\nChris Wallace: Even --\n\nChris Van Hollen: I think our system is strong enough that we can do both. I very much worry about what the president is doing right now to escalate tensions and the likelihood of war in Iran, but our country will have to deal with both these issues at the same time.\n\nChris Wallace: Senator Van Hollen, thank you. Thanks for coming in today, sir.\n\nChris Van Hollen: Thank you.\n\nChris Wallace: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss what happens next in the growing confrontation with Iran. Plus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump's decision to kill General Soleimani? Just go to Facebook or Twitter at Fox News Sunday, and we may use your question on the air.\n\n[commercial break]\n\nChris Wallace: With the world on edge over possible retaliation after the U.S. killed Iran's top military leader, we want to replay part of an interview we conducted with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani back in September. He said then, It's not Iran that's the main sponsor of terrorism, but the U.S.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nMale Translator: Today America unfortunately is the supporter of terrorism in our region and wherever America has gone terrorism has expanded in the wake. Wherever we have gone on the other side we have defeated terrorism.\n\nChris Wallace: You have given hundreds of millions, perhaps a billion dollars to Hezbollah, to Hamas, to various groups. That is not a support of terrorism? Hassan Rouhani Well, when you label people who fight for the defense of their country and their lands as terrorism. So, those who are the subjects of occupation what should they do? Be passive and just look?\n\n[end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: And it's time now for our Sunday group. Josh Holmes, former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown's Institute of Politics and Public Service, former Democratic Congresswoman Donna Edwards, and former Trump national security council spokesperson, Michael Anton. Michael, does the decision to escalate dramatically and I think we would agree it was a dramatic escalation to take out Qassem Soleimani, does it make the U.S. more safe or less safe and if Iran decides as -- keeps its promise to retaliate dramatically, does the Trump administration have a strategy?\n\nMichael Anton: I don't know that I necessarily agree that this was a dramatic escalation. You could interpret it as justified retaliation for all kinds of things that you've talked about earlier in the program that Iran has been doing without much of a response. So the main point I would want to make here is the Iranian regime since 1979 has a history of getting very aggressive, getting used to not facing pushback, not getting retaliation, and when they finally do get pushback, they tend to back down and go into the turtle mode for a little while and that may yet happen again. We've seen that happen in the past. They haven't faced much retaliation for, as you said, spending the enormous windfall they got out of the Iran deal all around the Middle East, creating proxies, creating little colonies, building out their empire, and they, I think, got overconfident and to some extent that overconfidence is exemplified by the fact that Soleimani went right into Iran and the airport -- sorry, into Iraq in the airport completely confident that he owned the place and that nothing would happen to him. So, I think this stuns the regime and is as likely as not to maybe make the regime retreat a little bit and lick its wounds and reassess.\n\nChris Wallace: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and on the issue of the president's decision to take out Soleimani we got this on Facebook from Phil Martin. What is the difference between what President Trump did and what former President Obama did to Osama bin Laden? Congresswoman Edwards, how do you answer Phil?\n\nDonna Edwards: Well, I mean, there are two main differences and one is that Osama bin Laden was a non-state actor and here you have an attack directly in the Iraqi -- Iranian hierarchy and look, nobody's out there, you know, saying that Soleimani was not a bad guy. He was a bad actor, had been for a couple of decades, but the question is whether this was the smartest way in which to conduct an overall foreign policy in the region and whether -- and I believe it has actually made the region and the United States interests a lot more vulnerable.\n\nChris Wallace: Well, let me just pose this then. So, they -- Iranian-backed militias in Iraq launch a number of strikes last -- the week before last, I think it was a week ago Friday and kill an American contractor and hurt a number of American soldiers. We respond with a number of strikes that kill about two dozen of those militia men. They then attack our embassy. No, they didn't kill anybody, but it was pretty shocking what they did to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. Are we supposed to just let it go?\n\nDonna Edwards: Well, what I'm saying to you is that I think among the options, the range of options, that the president has, the question is, do you take one and I believe they did in taking the action in killing Soleimani that actually, you know, the downstream puts us in a much more difficult position and I don't -- and I think right now, it's not really clear to me that just like pulling out of the Iran deal, that this administration has said -- has mapped out what the end game is, what's the next part of this strategy.\n\nChris Wallace: All right.\n\nDonna Edwards: And I think without that, then the United States interest and our ability of our allies to stand with us in this becomes much more complicated.\n\nChris Wallace: Josh, I want to move to a different aspect of the questions that people are asking this week. President Trump very publicly and has reaffirmed it as recently as this fall that the situation in Syria ran on getting the U.S. out of endless wars in the Middle East. But as I discussed with Secretary Pompeo, this week alone he sent more than 4,000 U.S. troops into the region. So, are we getting out? Are we getting deeper?\n\nJosh Holmes: Well, I don't think that's inconsistent at all. I mean, I think his overarching policy as Secretary Pompeo articulated very clearly is to remove America from these endless wars and these conflicts in Syria, the conflicts in Iraq and beyond, but that also cannot override immediate security threats. You need to be responsive to that and I will just say, I'm totally stunned at the notion that somehow America is the one that is bringing this to a higher escalation level. The president's critics may not have been paying attention to what's happened over the last couple of years, but just because they're more focused on trying to impeach the president of the United States than the health and well-being of American soldiers in Iraq, doesn't mean that things aren't happening. This guy has tried -- has killed over 600 American soldiers, all right? Just last week, we watched him storm the embassy in Baghdad. Now, how America is the aggressor here is beyond me but what they did is for the first time in a long time, and I'll argue that the president has been extremely reluctant to engage in this kind of thing, but first time in a long time tell Iran not anymore. You're not going to be attacking American assets or American personnel without severe repercussions and I think that's a great thing for this country.\n\nChris Wallace: Well, here is how the president described and explained his action on Friday.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nDonald Trump: We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: Mo, what about the argument that, as I've recited in the interviews with the two previous guests, that there are a number of actions that Iran has taken this year going after ships, shooting down a drone, attacking Saudi oil facilities; just in the last week they killed an American contractor, hurt -- badly injured a number of American soldiers, and then stormed the U.S. embassy. What about the argument that President Trump needed to stand up to this Iranian aggression and show resolve?\n\nMo Elleithee: Yeah, it's interesting. One of the president's rationales for withdrawing from the Iran deal was that by doing so and imposing these crippling economic sanctions on the regime, it would bring the regime to its knees. In fact, the exact opposite has happened. The regime has become more and more emboldened and has done -- has been escalating its rhetoric. Look, my concern here is, and as others have said, is what are the ramifications regionally? This was not our first opportunity to go after this guy. Stan McChrystal, who was no -- you know, who was fired by President Obama, he was no fan of Obama foreign policy.\n\nChris Wallace: He was one of the top generals and he was at one point leading our effort in Afghanistan.\n\nMo Elleithee: Talks openly about the time he had an opportunity to take him out but that there were bigger regional concerns. We're going to --\n\nChris Wallace: He now says he thinks the president -- President Trump made the right decision.\n\nMo Elleithee: Well, we'll see, right? I mean, if you look at what just happened moments before this panel came on the air where the Iraqi prime minister standing before the Iraqi parliament called this a political assassination and that the United States should withdraw all troops from the country. This is -- there is now a huge mess on the ground in the Middle East. And the United States is going to have to be ready for that. The fact that --\n\nChris Wallace: Okay.\n\nMale Speaker: -- the government -- the president has to be ready for all these unknown --\n\nChris Wallace: I --\n\nMale Speaker: -- moving pieces --\n\nChris Wallace: He absolutely does. I've got about a minute left in this segment. And Michael, I want to leave it with you. You've posited that, maybe, they needed a punch in the nose, and now they're going to pull back. And they've gotten too aggressive. There's a flip side of that. What if Iraq goes ahead and expels U.S. troops? What if Iran -- and that certainly is much of a possibility as your scenario -- strikes back? What do we do then?\n\nMichael Anton: Well, if the Iraqis decide they want U.S. troops to lead, one thing I could say with confidence is President Trump will not be on the phone begging them to say, Please let us stay. He'll call their bluff. And I think the Iraqi leadership knows that the big winners of that will not be Iraq, necessarily; it'll be Iran. And so --\n\nChris Wallace: I understand. But that --\n\nMichael Anton: -- so --\n\nChris Wallace: -- would hurt us, wouldn't it, if Iran is -- takes more over control of Iraq?\n\nMichael Anton: Well, as you said earlier, the president really would like to get as much out of the Middle East as possible. But he didn't run as an isolationist. It's important to remember: he ran as kind of a Jacksonian. His philosophy of foreign policy is very simple. Live and let live. We will live and let live as much as possible. But if you hit us, if you mess with us, if you strike us, if you kill our people, we will hit back very, very hard. That's why, what he -- what he's doing is essentially retaliatory. It's not long-term nation building. He has no interest in staying in the Middle East, or rebuilding it, or transforming it for the long term.\n\nJosh Holmes: But does that mean we would cede control of Iraq, after all we've put into that and all we've lost --\n\nMale Speaker: We can't [unintelligible] --\n\nMichael Anton: It is a sovereign country, as you have -- and others have said. If the Iraqi-elected government says, We don't want you there, we don't have a way to stay, and the president's not going to beg them to say.\n\nChris Wallace: We have to take a break here, panel, because we've got more to talk about. When we come back: Democrats' state of play on trying to remove President Trump. How long can Nancy Pelosi hang onto the articles of impeachment and hold up a Senate trial?\n\n[commercial break]\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nMitch McConnell: Their turn is over. They've done enough damage. It's the Senate's turn now to render sober judgment as the framers envisioned.\n\nChuck Schumer: There has never, never, in the history of our country, been an impeachment trial of the president in which the Senate was denied the ability to hear from witnesses.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: With the Senate back in session, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer making no progress in agreeing on ground rules for an impeachment trial of President Trump. And we're back now with the panel. So, Josh, where are we on a Senate trial? Is your former boss there, Mitch McConnell, is he going to hold firm and say, Nancy Pelosi, you're not going to dictate what's going to happen here? And secondly, you had -- over the recess, you had two Republican senators -- Collins and Murkowski -- both express concerns about McConnell's hardline stance. What do you think of the chances that McConnell holds firm, that you could get them and maybe two other Republicans -- which would give Democrats, potentially, a majority -- to call witnesses and basically run the kind of trial the Democrats want to?\n\nJosh Holmes: Well, first off, this whole thing is kind of confusing to me, as to why Nancy Pelosi believes that it increases her leverage, by holding the papers. I mean, every day that she holds them, they look more and more bizarre. And the closer and closer that they get to the Iowa caucuses -- which, of course, throws off the closing arguments for every 2020 Democrat running against President Trump, ultimately -- but secondly, she has no leverage here. This is not about trying to control the contours of the Senate. She's never going to be able to do that. So, this ends only one way; and that's when she sends the papers over without any kind of preconditions. That's basically what McConnell said this week.\n\nChris Wallace: Okay. And what about my second question, which is, if you -- you've got 47 Democrats. If they were to get four Republicans, they'd have 51. They'd have a majority -- assuming they all vote together. And then they could call Mick Mulvaney. They could call John Bolton. What's the prospect of that?\n\nJosh Holmes: Yeah. I mean, that's, like, the if and -- ifs and buts, and candy and nuts, [unintelligible] Christmas in every day. There's no chance of that happening. Let me tell you why -- specifically because what McConnell was advocating for is an imminently reasonable process, one that was adopted 100 to nothing in the Clinton impeachment trial in the 1990s. And what that does is provide the impeachment managers from the House and the president's defense team the opportunity to lay out their cases. And what is agreed to at the front end is that framework. After you get through that framework, then senators are -- after they go through a series of questioning, are able to look at what's missing. And at that point, you can have a discussion about whether you bring in different pieces of evidence, whether you bring --\n\nChris Wallace: Like witnesses.\n\nJosh Holmes: Right. And so, the question is, as -- are we concerned -- is there a concern that senators are ultimately going to back a Democratic proposal to lay out this entire thing on the front end?\n\nChris Wallace: Right.\n\nJosh Holmes: No, no. Absolutely not, because what it does it create complete chaos. And I've got to tell you: Democrats don't want it either because they're a lot closer to getting 51 for Hunter Biden than they are for anybody in the Trump administration.\n\nChris Wallace: Congresswoman Edwards, how long can Nancy Pelosi hang on to these articles of impeachment? I mean, it was the Democrats -- it was Pelosi, it was Schiff -- who said Donald Trump -- we've got to move forward because he is a clear and present danger. Now they are the ones holding up the process to remove him.\n\nDonna Edwards: Well, no. I mean, I think we should examine that where we are right now is precisely because Mitch McConnell openly said that he wasn't going to have a fair process. And I think it's legitimate for Speaker Pelosi to actually keep open this process as long as she needs to. I mean, she's going to turn over the articles of impeachment, but she does want assurances, given that McConnell came out straightforwardly and said he wasn't going to have a fair process and that he was coordinating with the president. And so, you know, and I think that she actually has created leverage, because, in fact, she opened up the space for Murkowski and Collins. And I'm waiting for this phase -- for Mitt Romney, who stands nothing to gain in this process by aligning himself with the administration, with the president -- to make sure that there is, indeed, a fair process.\n\nChris Wallace: All right. We're going to continue. We'll have plenty of time to continue that conversation. Let's turn to the Democratic presidential campaign, because we just got the fourth quarter, the end of 2019 fundraising numbers for all of the Democratic candidates, and they're pretty interesting. Put them up on the screen. Bernie Sanders led the field in the fourth quarter, raising $34.5 million. Pete Buttigieg, Joe Biden, and Elizabeth Warren are closely bunched about $10 million behind, and then it's another $5 million back to Andrew Yang. Mo, how do you handicap the race at this point?\n\nMo Elleithee: It's jump ball. I mean, look, Iowa is going to winnow the field to some extent. You know, typically people historically have talked about two or three tickets out of Iowa. You could have as many as four or five out of Iowa this next time, and it's anybody's game. Those are tremendous numbers for Bernie Sanders, but they're tremendous numbers for everyone in the field. The biggest question heading into Iowa just under 30 days from now is, will those senators that are running -- Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders, Amy Klobuchar, Cory Booker -- will they be able to be on the ground in Iowa, or are they going to be stuck here in Washington? And for someone like an Amy Klobuchar or an Elizabeth Warren who are, like, right there, right? They're right there to get one of those tickets. They can't afford to cede weeks of ground to someone like Vice President Biden or Mayor Buttigieg.\n\nChris Wallace: So, maybe this is Nancy Pelosi's strategy. Hold up the Senate trial so they can campaign.\n\nMo Elleithee: My guess is it's not that. That's not it. But it is going to be a real issue.\n\nChris Wallace: We should point out that while they were raising that amount of money, Donald Trump in the fourth quarter raised $46 million, far more than any of the others. He's built up a huge campaign war chest, has more than $100 million cash on hand, which raises the question, Michael, how big an advantage for the president, how big a disadvantage for the Democrats, that he's building up this war chest, just sitting there, basically? He's got a couple of people running against him, but nobody serious, while the Democrats, with the money they've raised, which is impressive, are going to spend all of it going after each other.\n\nMichael Anton: Well, it's been a long time since an incumbent president was defeated for reelection: 1992. There's enormous advantages to incumbency.\n\nChris Wallace: And he faced a primary challenger.\n\nMichael Anton: And he faced a primary challenger, and it also took a third-party independent, who got the highest independent vote in U.S. history, at least in the 20th century. So --\n\nChris Wallace: [unintelligible]\n\nMichael Anton: -- it was an extraordinary confluence of circumstances that don't look to be repeated, and President Bush, who was defeated in 1992, also faced a very bad economy, which is -- remember, it's the economy, stupid -- the number-one issue Bill Clinton ran against him on and was able to seize on. The Democrats don't have that right now. I think, you know, anything is possible. The economy could turn sour sometime during this year, but at this point in the 1992 campaign the economy had already been in recession for a while, and people were very discontented. That's not the case right now. So, President Trump looks very strong to me.\n\nChris Wallace: Congresswoman Edwards, when you look at not just the money but also the polls, I mean, the thing that I have to say surprised me, Bernie Sanders had a heart attack in the fourth quarter, and there was a lot of talk about that the party wasn't going to go as far left, that they were pulling the voters; they were pulling back to the center. You saw the rise of Buttigieg, Biden with considerable strength. There are a lot of people out there that still support and are giving money to Bernie Sanders.\n\nDonna Edwards: Well, there are. I mean, he's shown, you know, resilience and energy. But I would say that Joe Biden has actually shown a lot of resiliency, too, for all the attacks and for all the talks of the demise of his campaign. I look to see a resurgence, frankly, of somebody like an Elizabeth Warren. She's got money on hand, she's got a ground game in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, and has the ability to organize that forward. And then Amy Klobuchar, I think you're right. I mean, she's on the rise, but she can't afford to be taken off the field.\n\nChris Wallace: You realize you haven't winnowed at all. [laughter]\n\nDonna Edwards: I haven't at all.\n\nChris Wallace: You haven't winnowed out; you've winnowed in.\n\nDonna Edwards: I'm not ready -- I'm like most voters. I'm not ready to do that quite yet. But I do look at the collective energy in the Democratic field. You can see that in the fundraising, where collectively the field still seems to be able to demonstrate that, from small donors across the board, that Democrats do still have the, you know, wind at their sails.\n\nChris Wallace: Thirty seconds, Josh. Who in that field is the biggest threat to Donald Trump and the reelection campaign?\n\nJosh Holmes: Oh, I don't think we know yet. I think they all have vulnerabilities, I think some unique vulnerabilities. I think the Bernie Sanders-Elizabeth Warren wing in the midst of a really good economy is absolutely devastating for Democrats. I don't know how you make the case that you change the American economy when you're doing this [unintelligible].\n\nChris Wallace: So, basically, they're all going to lose, right?\n\nJosh Holmes: So, that's what I'm saying.\n\nChris Wallace: [laughs] All right. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, our Power Player of the Week, the man who serves as the ambassador from Hollywood to right here in the nation's capital.\n\n[commercial break]\n\nChris Wallace: Hollywood's awards season kicks off tonight with the Golden Globe Awards, and it's shaping up to be a big year for Netflix, the streaming service that used to be an outsider in the movie industry. We spoke with an insider who's working to change that. He's our Power Player of the Week.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\n[music playing]\n\nCharles Rivkin: This is the place in Washington, D.C. where Hollywood meets Washington.\n\nChris Wallace: Charlie Rivkin is talking about the Motion Picture Association, one of D.C.'s most powerful lobbying groups --\n\nMale Speaker: Action.\n\nChris Wallace: -- which advocates for the film, TV, and streaming industry.\n\nChris Wallace: Two-point-six million Americans wake up every single day and go to jobs that are supported by this business.\n\nChris Wallace: The MPA's members are Hollywood's elite studios like Disney and Warner Brothers, and now, Netflix. Why did you push so hard for Netflix to join the MPA?\n\nCharles Rivkin: I believe the MPA should be the home of the leading content creators on the planet, and clearly Netflix is.\n\nFemale Speaker: Netflix.\n\nMale Speaker: Netflix.\n\nFemale Speaker: Netflix.\n\nChris Wallace: This year Netflix scored 17 Golden Globe nominations.\n\nMale Speaker: Would you like to be a part of history?\n\nMale Speaker: Yes.\n\nChris Wallace: More than double any other studio.\n\nMale Speaker: It's what it is.\n\nChris Wallace: But Rivkin says the streaming giant is a partner, not a rival of the silver screen.\n\nFemale Speaker: Enjoy your movie.\n\nChris Wallace: What about the owners of movie theaters?\n\nCharles Rivkin: The more technologically savvy the consumer is, the more he's likely to go to the movies. So, I don't believe there's cannibalization.\n\nChris Wallace: For decades, the MPA was led by power broker and our first-ever Power Player. Jack Valenti.\n\nJack Valenti: I thought, Movies, television, wow. That's what I'd like to do for the rest of my life, and by jingoes, I've darn near done it.\n\nChris Wallace: The industry has changed dramatically since then, and so has the MPA. The headquarters reopened this fall and now features iconic movie props.\n\nCharles Rivkin: This is Elton John's Gucci jacket, signed by Elton John, and it was worn in the film. And here, the original Aqua Man outfit. Here's our new theater --\n\nChris Wallace: But the MPA's secret weapon has always been its movie theater --\n\nCharles Rivkin: This is state of the art.\n\nChris Wallace: -- where Washington politicians enjoy private screenings of new releases.\n\nCharles Rivkin: The last theater was -- when it was built, was good for its time. This is 120 seats. We had to have the best screening room in all of D.C.\n\nChris Wallace: Rivkin's father was an ambassador; his godfather, former senator and then Vice President Hubert Humphrey. But Rivkin chose entertainment over politics, becoming the first person to run the Jim Henson Company outside of that family.\n\nKermit: Hello.\n\nMultiple Speakers: Yippee.\n\nChris Wallace: But Washington called, President Obama appointing him ambassador to France. He brought Hollywood with him, hosting stars like Clint Eastwood, Jodie Foster, and Samuel L. Jackson, who met with young immigrants there.\n\nCharles Rivkin: He talked about his story, the American story. He's the embodiment of the American dream.\n\nChris Wallace: Rivkin says he's lived his own dream. Charles Rivkin: I went from working from Kermit and Miss Piggy to the president of the United States. For me, joining a hundred-year-old institution and helping to modernize it for our new era, this new incredible golden age of content, is very satisfying. [end video clip]\n\nChris Wallace: Despite the popularity of home streaming, movie theaters remain packed. The domestic box office for 2019 is projected to be more than $11 billion. And that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, said on Monday that he was willing to testify at President Trump's impeachment trial if subpoenaed. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify, Mr. Bolton said in a statement on his website.\n\nGuy Benson got reaction on this significant development from Senator John Cornyn (R-TX).\n\nListen Below:\n\nFull Transcript:\n\nGuy Benson: We begin the program with U.S. Senator John Cornyn, a Republican of Texas, who joins me now. Senator, great to have you back.\n\nSen. Cornyn: Thanks, guy. Happy New Year.\n\nGuy Benson: Happy New Year to you. Let's start with impeachment. I want to get to Iran as well. But there was a significant development today. Former National Security Adviser John Bolton, who we know, of course, around here at Fox, pretty well put out a statement saying that after weighing all of the issues, he has, quote, concluded that if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify. He is one of those witnesses that we've heard Democrats talking about. The House didn't bother to subpoena him. But I think there could be some merit to hearing what he has to say. What are your thoughts on that development involving John Bolton? Should he testify?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's entirely likely that his testimony would be helpful to the president, because it would identify basically a foreign policy dispute which is reserved to the president under the Constitution, is really his sole authority as a as a basis for impeachment for this. Now, the third time in American history. So he could. It could well be beneficial. And as to the second count, which is obstruction, you'll recall that the Adam Schiff did say he was wanted to subpoena Ambassador Bolton. But when Ambassador Bolton said he wanted a court to instruct him whether to comply with the subpoena or whether to invoke executive privilege, as the White House had insisted that he'd look to the court for guidance and Adam Schiff dropped it like a hot potato. So I don't know how this would come out the way I read the ambassador's offer. He didn't say what he was testimony would be, but he would respond to the subpoena. And I would expect anyone who was subpoenaed by the vote of 51 senators to respond. But what their testimony actually turns out to be, that's another matter.\n\nGuy Benson: Would you vote in favor of hearing from John Bolton if there was a vote on that subpoena, whether it's, let's say, in your one of your committees, the Judiciary Committee of Chairman Graham decided, OK, let's do it under our auspices or whether it was the full Senate. Do you personally support hearing from John Bolton in this process?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I would want to know what he has to offer that would help illuminate the issues. The two articles of impeachment that have been issued by the House of Representatives, that would be that would define the scope of any Senate trial. But I think it really is a is an admission by the House, in essence, that in the Senate Democrats that they believe that the basis the 17 witnesses who did testify in the House and the record that they develop there are really inadequate in order to make their case in the Senate. So they're looking for anything and everything, including additional witnesses, in order to bolster that case in the Senate, because they know what they've got so far isn't really sufficient to get the job done.\n\nGuy Benson: Senator, I have to say, Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, is frequently touted as a master tactician. I think sometimes that reputation has been earned. But I am still flabbergasted that they passed these articles of impeachment, rushed to do it before Christmas, and time was of the essence. It was very urgent for the well-being of our very republic that they do it as soon as possible, which is why they raced through everything and then shoved it in a drawer. Both articles in a drawer and it's been sitting there collecting dust now for weeks. It is 2020. Are you surprised that this continues to be the status quo? What exactly are they doing?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I'm I am a little surprised because I agree with you. I think ordinarily Speaker Pelosi is a pretty shrewd political tactician. But I think here she got forced to do something she did not want to do in the first place, which was to proceed with the impeachment. You may recall her comments back in March of 2019, where she said only if it was bipartisan and the case compelling would it be worn. The divisiveness that would necessarily arise out of an impeachment proceeding. And then she proceeded after that. Months after that to basically cave in to the demands of the most radical members of her own party. I think that's what happened here. And now she's finds herself in a a bit of a box canyon. And it's not clear exactly how she gets out of this unless, of course, Senator McConnell succumbs, which I know he will not do to the entreaties of Senator Schumer to recreate the circus like atmosphere in the House, in the Senate. We're not going to do that. We will take it seriously. We will perform our constitutional responsibilities. But I think this is a box that. Speaker Pelosi has gotten herself in, and it's going to be fascinating to see how she gets out of it.\n\nGuy Benson: Do you have any sense of when this trial might happen because they have to send them over at some point, you would think, except the media keeps talking about an impasse or a standoff. The standoff is totally created by one sidedness, by not just passing along the articles like the last House of Representatives to impeach a president. Did I just. It seems I'm mystified.\n\nSen. Cornyn: Yeah, well, you would think that that Senate Democrats who negotiated a procedural arrangement for the President Clinton impeachment, that they would be satisfied with that same arrangement being used in the impeachment trial of President Trump. But they're not. And they're asking for more. As we've discussed and I think they know how this ends, because it's going to take 67 votes to convict and remove President Trump. And they're doing all of this less than a year, about 11 months until the next general election. I think it's it's really backfiring on them. They know it is. And they're they're desperate to try to find a way out. But so far, they haven't figured it out.\n\nGuy Benson: Last question on this subject. Senator Schumer and a few of his colleagues have gone out there and said that Republicans in the Senate, including Senator McConnell, Leader McConnell, are not impartial jurors. They can't be impartial. They're coordinating with the White House. And there have been calls for recusal, are saying that they're really not fulfilling their constitutional duty in this process. What's your response when you hear that critique?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I I I wonder whether Senator Schumer thinks that Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden I guess he is no longer in the Senate. Amy Klobuchar and other senators running for president are, strictly speaking, impartial writers. It's not a good it's not a good analogy. I know all of us, including myself, have used that as an analogy, but it's not the same thing as an impartial jury in a criminal or civil case that would be tried in a court of law. We know that the that this is primarily a political matter and one where the people who cast their vote, either in the House from the Senate will be held accountable by the people they represent. That's what this is. So I think it's it's hypocritical, particularly if looking back on the way that Senator Schumer and others conducted themselves in the Clinton impeachment, he actually ran for the Senate against Senator Al D'Amato, saying if elected, he would vote to acquit President Clinton. That's not exactly impartial.\n\nGuy Benson: No, it's the opposite. Right. Is. It was pledging to be partial. Right. So. Exactly. It's a it's a rich it's a rich line of criticism from him. Given his past that you've just outlined there, Senator, let's move to Iran and the strike on Soleimani, the Iranian general and terrorist mastermind. Your reaction? We've had the weekend to think about it. I know D.C. is buzzing and people are fighting about it. Your assessment?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, the world is a better place for for this. And certainly while we don't know what Iran's response is going to be, I think President Trump acted within his authority to defend the United States, our troops and our interests in the Middle East against somebody who has American blood on his hands and who's been known to be part of a designated terrorist organization, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard and particularly the Kurds force that has is well-known throughout the Middle East, providing things like explosively formed penetrators, which would cut through the armor of American soldiers in Afghanistan and Iraq like a knife through a hot knife, through butter. So nobody should mourn the demise of general Soleimani And the president did operate within his constitutional authority. I think what we've just been discussing and the disarray of the House over this impeachment matter shows the wisdom of the founding fathers giving these sort of decisions under the Constitution to the commander in chief and not 535 members of Congress. I think the contrast between the way that the death of Osama bin Laden was greeted on a bipartisan basis in the way now that Soleimani death is being greeted on a partisan basis, is tells tells the story.\n\nGuy Benson: I have seen some television interviews where prominent Democrats, for example, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, former DNC chairwoman, she's a member of Congress from Florida. Also, Elizabeth Warren, one of your colleagues in the Senate who's running for president. They have suggested that President Trump Green led the attack against Soleimani as a means of distraction from impeachment. What do you make of an allegation like that?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I think it's irresponsible and I think it defies reality. I mean, the truth is it's the Democrats who are trying to change the subject and trying to create a further circus like atmosphere here in the Senate because of their lack of success in dealing with this impeachment matter in the House. This is obviously a totally separate matter. I respect people what Democrats like Joe Lieberman and Jay Johnson, who both said in recent days that this is well within the president's authority and a necessary act. And I also respect great leaders like Ryan Crocker, who today I think is in The New York Times, wrote a piece about why this was within the president's authority, why it was necessary. And it was a former CIA director and CENTCOM commander, David Petraeus, who made the point that this is more significant in terms of our fight against radical Islam than was the death of Osama bin Laden. So this was a a very big deal. And I think the president is to be commended for his decisive action in the face of a real threat.\n\nGuy Benson: Last question. It deals with that last point that you made, the real threat. There are some people questioning the intelligence about imminent attacks or what Soleimani was up to. I know there are briefings scheduled for some of your colleagues on Capitol Hill later on in the week. Based on what you've seen, what you've heard, what is your understanding of the solid ness of that intelligence?\n\nSen. Cornyn: Well, I have read the the war powers notification that the president sent over here. I think he has to do it within 48 hours of of the of the strike. And he did. I think we all know generally what the role of Iran has been. The national sponsor, international sponsor of international terrorism, who the sponsoring force, pro-Hezbollah, Hamas and other radical groups. I just think that the the idea that this was not a threat, then that's who Soleimani was somehow an innocent and didn't deserve. What he got is just flies in the face of the reality that we all that we all understand and know. But we will be further briefings. I just wonder whether the facts will matter to our friends who've already made up their mind. Anything President Trump does, they're against reflexively.\n\nGuy Benson: Yes. Those very same impartial jurists. Right. Same the same folks,in some of those cases. A lot going on. Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, we so appreciate your time on this Monday. Thank you.\n\nSen. Cornyn: Thank you, guy.\n\nGuy Benson: We are just kicking off the program and the week it's the Guy Benson's show. Stay with me.
New House rules unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are completely gender-neutral, strip away GOP opportunities to force awkward votes and preserve lawmakers' ability to carry firearms at the Capitol.\n\nThe House's 45-page rules package that will be voted on Monday after the new Congress commences would also continue proxy voting during the coronavirus pandemic, ban lawmakers convicted of certain crimes from visiting the House floor again, and change payment rules on legislation related to the virus and climate change that previously required lawmakers to identify new revenue sources or spending cuts to fund their priorities.\n\nPelosi announced the visionary rules package with Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., on Friday and said it reflects the values of her diverse Democratic majority.\n\nDemocrats have crafted a package of unprecedented, bold reforms, which will make the House more accountable, transparent and effective in our work to meet the needs of the American people, Pelosi said.\n\nThese future-focused proposals reflect our priorities as a caucus and as a country -- including crushing the coronavirus, addressing economic disparity, combating the climate crisis, advancing inclusion, and promoting integrity in government.\n\nIn an effort to be inclusive to those who don't identify as a specific gender, the rules package strips all mention of gender-specific pronouns and terms such as man, woman, mother and son.\n\nThe Office of the Whistleblower Ombudsman, for instance, is renamed in the rules to the Office of the Whistleblower Ombuds.\n\nThere's nothing in the rules that prohibit members from using gender-specific terms when speaking on the House floor or conducting business.\n\nHouse GOP leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., mocked the inclusionary effort as stupid.\n\nHowever, progressive leaders in the House cheered the new rules. Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said the changes will allow Democrats to push for a bolder agenda.\n\nProgressives fought for the exceptions of the budgeting rules to open the door for their high-priced legislation, like Medicare-for-All and the Green New Deal. Omar also praised the new rule that curbs the ability for the minority party, in this case the GOP, to bring a Motion to Recommit to the House floor with language changes to legislation that is about to be passed by the majority.\n\nPROGRESSIVES PRESSURE AOC, OTHER DEMS TO FORCE PELOSI'S HAND ON MEDICARE-FOR-ALL VOTE\n\nThese motions have frustrated Democrats because Republicans have presented gotcha motions on bills they oppose in an effort to force Democrats to vote on some items they'd like to avoid, one Democratic source said.\n\nFor instance, Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz., offered a motion to recommit on the House floor in December to landmark legislation that was about to pass to legalize marijuana. Lesko wanted to add language that private sector employers retain the right to test employees for marijuana use. She was able to pick off 11 Democrats for her motion, but it still failed. The overall legislation passed the House.\n\nWhile Motions to Recommit (MTRs) typically fail and serve mostly messaging purposes to show divisions in the Democratic Party, some have been successful.\n\nIn one instance in 2019, the House was on its way to passing a bipartisan gun background check bill. Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., offered a Motion to Recommit before final passage to require reporting to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) when an undocumented immigrant tries to buy a gun, setting up potential deportation.\n\nEnough Democrats agreed to the GOP provision to have it inserted in the final bill. Collins still voted no on the legislation, which was never signed into law.\n\nThe new rules would block Republicans from forcing a vote on specific language changes. They would only allow Republicans to offer a Motion to Recommit to send a bill back to the committee without instructions on language.\n\nMcCarthy slammed the changes as a way to silence the minority.\n\nThe Democrats just destroyed over 100 years of representation in Congress, McCarthy said in a statement. Nancy Pelosi wants to silence your voice and consolidate what little power she has left. Her time is limited.\n\nFOURTH TIME THE CHARM: IOWA REP.-ELECT MARIANNETTE MILLER-MEEKS TO BE SWORN IN SUNDAY\n\nThe new House rules also authorize funding for the House Administration Committee to investigate election disputes underway in Iowa's 2nd District, where Democrat Rita Hart is contesting a six-vote win by Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks.\n\nIn a win for Rep.-elect Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., the new rules do not include a Democratic proposal to ban lawmakers from carrying guns at the Capitol, just like visitors are prohibited from bringing in firearms.\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT BLASTS DEMOCRATS FOR TRYING TO BAN HER FROM CARRYING GUN AT CAPITOL\n\nMembers of Congress are allowed to have firearms on Capitol grounds, although there are certain places where they can't carry, such as the House chamber, Speaker's Lobby, cloakroom and the Rayburn Room. Boebert, a Second Amendment enthusiast, has been seeking an expansion of where she's allowed to carry -- prompting concern from some Democrats.\n\nA group of Democrats had sought to insert language into the rules package to ban firearms completely by lawmakers, but that proposal did not make the final draft.\n\nThe new Congress will be sworn in on Sunday. The House will vote on whether Pelosi will remain speaker. Her majority is much slimmer, in part due to a record number of GOP women being elected in November.
The last election of the unprecedented 2020 election cycle is finally upon us.\n\nTuesday's the day that voters in the state of Georgia go to the polls to decide what America's future looks like. To paraphrase President Ronald Reagan, will we still be the shining city on a hill?\n\nThe stark reality is that if radical Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff prevail in their campaigns against Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler in Tuesday's runoff elections for United States Senate, the country we know and love will soon be unrecognizable.\n\nVictories by leftists Warnock and Ossoff would hand control of the U.S. Senate to dangerous New York career politician Chuck Schumer. Schumer has vowed that if he becomes majority leader of the Senate, he has plans to change America.\n\nSEN. DAVID PERDUE: GEORGIANS SHOULD VOTE FOR ME & SEN. LOEFFLER TO STOP DEMS' RADICAL SOCIALIST AGENDA\n\nVoters in Georgia must understand that Schumer is a left-wing partisan who means what he says one hundred percent. Schumer has made clear he's on a mission to make the United States the next failed socialist experiment in world history.\n\nThere are many distractions oozing out of the Washington swamp and their allies in the fake news media lately. Their goal is to make patriotic Georgians take their eyes off the ball and forget about the importance of today's Senate elections.\n\nVoters in Georgia must not let the elitist forces on the left get their way. I don't care what political party you belong to. If you value the Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the rule of law, you must cast your ballot for Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.\n\nThere are things in America that transcend partisan politics. The nuclear family, individual liberty, freedom of religion, free market capitalism, respect for law enforcement, and the idea that if you work hard and play by the rules you can accomplish anything in America. These ideals are all on the line today in Georgia.\n\nThings that truly matter to the future of our country are hanging in the balance. Thankfully, these bedrock ideals are things that reasonable Republicans, Independents, and Democrats agree upon. A patriotic coalition of Georgians must come out in force to protect them.\n\nJON OSSOFF: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS – HERE'S MY MESSAGE FOR PEACH STATE REPUBLICANS\n\nWith Schumer in control of the Senate and Speaker Nancy Pelosi holding the gavel in the U.S. House of Representatives, the unhinged radicals would be free to impose their fringe agenda and ideals on the rest of us.\n\nStanding in their way are millions of hardworking Georgians who love their country, their God, their communities, and the heroic veterans, police, and first responders they call neighbors. Georgia, there's only one message left to send: please shut out the noise, stay focused, and vote like it's the most important thing you've ever done.\n\nIf you oppose socialism, and if you favor government with a check and balance that guards against radicalism and lawlessness, vote for David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler.\n\nThe Peach State deserves two U.S. Senators who represent their interests in Washington.\n\nSEN. THOM TILLIS: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS – SEND PERDUE, LOEFFLER BACK TO DC, SEND PELOSI, SCHUMER A MESSAGE\n\nIf Warnock and Ossoff make it to the Senate, New York will have four Senators and Georgia won't have any.\n\nWarnock and Ossoff would immediately surrender their voting cards to Chuck Schumer because Schumer is responsible for raising all the funds from the D.C. swamp to help elect them.\n\nSEN. MARCO RUBIO: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS -- THE FATE OF OUR NATION IS IN GEORGIA'S HANDS\n\nThe phrase the stakes could not be higher may sound cliché by now but in this case it happens to be the truth. Marxism-Leninism is at the gates.\n\nWashington Democrats' warped dream of fundamentally changing our beloved Constitutional Republic into a socialist disaster is in reach. These Democrats want to reverse the entire successful Trump America first agenda, which means raising taxes, open borders, gun confiscation, unrestricted abortion on demand, and bowing to the demands of the left-wing cancel culture mob.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn the entire history of our nation, if there was ever a party in Washington that needed a check and balance in the U.S. Senate, it's these unhinged Democrats.\n\nSo if you understand the importance of the filibuster, vote for Perdue and Loeffler.\n\nIf you want a watchful eye kept on Communist China, vote for Perdue and Loeffler.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf you prefer nine Supreme Court justices and oppose the Democrat court packing scheme, vote for Perdue and Loeffler. And if you support law and order, vote for Perdue and Loeffler.\n\nCountless Americans from the other 49 states will have Georgia to thank if a pro-America coalition of voters galvanize and turn out in record numbers to spare us from the nightmare scenario of complete Democrat control of the legislative branch of government during the 117th Congress.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DAVID BOSSIE
A Beverly Hills police chief is at the center of an ugly, costly and lengthy legal battle after the wealthy city agreed to pay $2.3 million to settle a lawsuit brought by a former high-ranking police officer amid an onslaught of other allegations.\n\nChief Sandra Spagnoli, a self-described change agent, was hired in 2016 and lavished with praise from the city's mayor and council members, as well as Vogue magazine, for aggressive reforms, but now she faces accusations of misconduct herself.\n\nSpagnoli is accused of referring to yarmulkes worn by observant Jews as funny little hats, asked if she had to dress Mexican when invited to a meal at a Latino employee's home, and reacted with revulsion when she was informed that an employee was gay. Other court documents contain allegations that Spagnoli had sex with subordinate officers who were later rewarded with promotions, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nCapt. Mark Rosen, who is Jewish, accused Spagnoli of harassment and workplace misconduct, denying him promotional opportunities based on his religion.\n\nRosen immediately retired after the $2.3 million suit was settled in December, but said he fears for his colleagues.\n\nI am concerned for my co-workers I am leaving behind, the officers and civilians alike who continue to be victimized, Rosen said.\n\nSpagnoli faces at least 20 civil suits or employee complaints of racial and sexual discrimination, according to court records.\n\nShe has repeatedly denied the allegations, characterizing them as pushback to her efforts to change the agency.\n\nI'm disappointed at some of the personal attacks against me, particularly because I can tell you I love this community. I love being a key factor in public safety and making a difference, she said. It hasn't been easy running the department while under fire from different directions.\n\nThe decision to settle Rosen's lawsuit was made by the city's insurance company, according to a spokesman.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Incoming New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez affirmed on Wednesday that she will vote against a House rules package proposed by Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, in a dramatic show of defiance that sets up yet another early showdown with her own party's establishment.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said she will join California Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna on Thursday -- the first day of the new Congress -- to oppose the so-called pay-go rule backed by Pelosi. That rule would require that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal defecit.\n\nPay-go would not apply to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. Last in effect in 2010, pay-go would replace the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending.\n\nThe Pelosi-supported pay-go principle, Ocasio-Cortez charged in a Twitter post Wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation.\n\nWe shouldn't hinder ourselves from the start, she added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi deputy chief of staff Drew Hammill fired back shortly afterward, tweeting: A vote AGAINST the Democratic Rules package is a vote to let [Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)] Mick Mulvaney make across the board cuts, unilaterally reversing Democratic initiatives and funding increases.\n\nHammill argued that federal law already provides for a kind of pay-go mechanism that requires OMB to offset the cost of deficit-increasing legislation by forcing indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts in federal mandatory spending. Without enacting the separate pay-go rule provided by the Pelosi-backed rules package, Hammill suggested, the Trump administration could simply overrule congressional Democrats. (Mulvaney has also been named acting White House chief of staff, in addition to his OMB duties.)\n\nA study released in July by the Mercatus Center at George Mason University said Ocasio-Cortez's proposed 'Medicare for all' solution would increase government health care spending by $32.6 trillion over 10 years, and require historic tax increases. The study's author has said both Ocasio-Cortez and Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, a frequent ally of the incoming congresswoman, had misinterpreted his study when they argued that Medicare for all would actually save money.\n\nSo far, only Ocasio-Cortez and Khanna have publicly come out against the rules package that includes the pay-go provision. A total of 218 representatives must vote 'yes' to pass the new rules, meaning that ordinarily, 18 Democrats would need to vote against the rules package in order for it to fail.\n\nHowever, one Republican has said he will support Pelosi's package, which would raise the needed number of Democratic defectors to 19 to kill the proposal.\n\nHOW MUCH WILL OCASIO-CORTEZ'S MEDICARE-FOR-ALL PLAN REALLY COST TAXPAYERS?\n\nThe dust-up came nearly two months after Ocasio-Cortez, moments after arriving on Capitol Hill for freshman orientation, joined an impromptu sit-in outside Pelosi's office to push for congressional action on climate change.\n\nWe need to tell her that we've got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen, Ocasio-Cortez said while standing in the middle of a group of around 200 protestors holding signs reading Green Jobs For All.\n\nAlthough Pelosi said in a statement afterward that we welcome the presence of these activists, the episode highlighted a growing rift between establishment Democrats and up-and-coming politicians such as Ocasio-Cortez and Khanna, who each unseated longtime party incumbents.\n\nOther rule changes proposed by Pelosi and unveiled Sunday would eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and make it easier to suspend the debt ceiling. The rules package also would remove term limits from committee chairmanships and establish a climate-change committee.\n\nAdditional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held.
Week 17 of the 2020 NFL season could be the last time several coaches are on the sidelines for their respective teams as a handful are expected to get the boot after Sunday's games.\n\nFOX Sports' NFL insider Jay Glazer detailed on FOX's NFL pregame show which coaches were safe, who was on the bubble, and those who were not expected to return next season.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe Los Angeles Chargers' Anthony Lynn, New York Jets' Adam Gase and Jacksonville Jaguars' Doug Marrone are all current head coaches who are not expected to be back in 2021, though nothing has been made official or finalized as of yet.\n\nGlazer added that he didn't think the three interim head coaches – the Atlanta Falcons' Raheem Morris, Houston Texans' Romeo Crennel and Detroit Lions' Darrell Bevell – would be made permanent head coaches.\n\nThe Bears' Matt Nagy was put into Glazer's time will tell category. The Chicago Bears are on the verge of a playoff berth but need to beat the Green Bay Packers to solidify a spot. It's been an up-and-down season for the Bears, but going into Sunday they've won three consecutive games.\n\nGlazer said Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson and Cincinnati Bengals coach Zac Taylor are considered to be safe. He said Pederson might need to make a few changes to his coaching staff, though. Meanwhile, Taylor has only won six games heading into Week 17 but is expected to get another season in Cincinnati.\n\nBaltimore Ravens' defensive coordinator Wink Martindale, San Francisco 49ers' defensive coordinator Robert Saleh, Tampa Bay Buccaneers defensive coordinator Todd Bowles, Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Brandon Staley, Tennessee Titans offensive coordinator Arthur Smith, Buffalo Bills offensive coordinator Brian Daboll, Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and Carolina Panthers offensive coordinator Joe Brady were named as some of the hot coaching candidates.\n\nGlazer said that college coaches Pat Fitzgerald, Urban Meyer, Jim Harbaugh, P.J. Fleck and Matt Campbell have been gaining interest as well as ex-Bengals coach Marvin Lewis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGlazer said he expected a lot of change coming in the next 48 hours.
President Trump used his much-disputed television time to portray the border as a humanitarian and law-enforcement crisis of the heart and soul, but not before some media organizations preemptively accused him of spreading lies about the issue.\n\nThe president, in sober tones, said nothing about declaring a national emergency, focusing instead on how migrant children are used as human pawns and how drugs and criminals are pouring across the border. He also made the economic case, saying illegal immigrants drive down wages, especially for blacks and Hispanics. And he declared that the federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only — that the Democrats refuse to provide $5.7 billion for border security.\n\nNancy Pelosi, with Chuck Schumer, soon offered the rebuttal, saying the Democrats were all for border security, but not an ineffective wall. She said Trump was holding federal workers hostage and that his remarks were full of misinformation and even malice — a phrase the Democrats had used hours before the Oval Office address.\n\nIn similar fashion, some cable news anchors who had been predicting the president would lie in his speech came on the air soon afterward to make that charge, which was not leveled at the Democratic leaders.\n\nMSNBC host Nicolle Wallace argued that Trump said a half-dozen things that are wrong, falsehoods, lies, and that the address itself was a scam based on a non-existent crisis.\n\nCNN's Gloria Borger said Trump was trying to make the case that I'm not just about a wall, when in fact he is.\n\nABC's Cecilia Vega opined that just because you say it's a crisis doesn't necessarily make it one.\n\nOn Fox News, Sean Hannity cited a man killed in a drunk-driving accident by an illegal immigrant and picked up on a Trump statistic from the speech: If we lose 4,000 lives in a two-year period, is that a manufactured crisis?\n\nBut there were also legitimate efforts at fact-checking. On Chris Cuomo's CNN show, a panelist noted that Barack Obama doesn't have a wall around his home (the president made reference to wealthy politicians who he said erect such barricades.)\n\nPELOSI, SCHUMER ACCUSE TRUMP OF SPREADING 'MISINFORMATION,' 'MALICE' IN OVAL OFFICE ADDRESS\n\nDespite the enormous buildup, nothing that either side said seemed likely to change many minds — or hasten an end to the 18-day partial shutdown.\n\nIn the run-up to the speech, some journalists offered the equivalent of a pre-buttal to the president.\n\nOn CNN, contributor Carl Bernstein said: I think we need to identify the real national emergency in this country and that is the question of whether or not Donald Trump is fit to be the president of the United States.\n\nEarlier, the hand-wringing by the broadcast networks over whether to air the speech was quite revealing. It suggested nothing less than a double standard for Donald Trump.\n\nIt's true that the networks, who sacrifice lucrative advertising when they air prime-time speeches, occasionally turned down requests by Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. But those episodes tended to be years into their tenure after they had already carried a number of evening speeches or press conferences. This, by contrast, was Trump's first Oval Office address.\n\nTRUMP LAMENTS 'CRISIS OF THE HEART AND A CRISIS OF THE SOUL' AT THE BORDER\n\nThe self-righteous preening by some journalists and commentators was something to behold. There was no need to carry Trump, they said, because he'd just give a political speech. As if every speech by every president isn't on some level political. When Bush addressed the nation on Iraq, he was speaking of war and peace — and saying some things that turned out to be untrue — but he was also making the political case for an invasion.\n\nTrump didn't deserve the airtime, some of the pundits argued, because he'd just lie. Or he shouldn't be on live; first reporters should pick apart his lies and then air the taped speech.\n\nThese preemptive accusations shed light on the media mindset. It's not that Trump doesn't sometimes utter untruths. He claimed, for instance, that the ex-presidents backed him on a border wall, but every living former president has said that isn't true.\n\nBut the way it should work is a president gets to make his case on television, and then the networks and the rest of the media can spend days or weeks analyzing, rebutting and truth-squadding his remarks.\n\nMy sense is that the broadcast networks reluctantly agreed to take the speech because they knew they'd get pilloried for saying no.\n\nWhen the Democrats announced that Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer would be delivering the response, ABC, CBS and NBC wasted no time in agreeing to carry it. The decision makes sense, given the huge public interest in the shutdown drama.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere's a case to be made that this is an artificial crisis, with Trump using the border situation to pound away at his signature promise to build a wall and the Democrats determined to deny him that funding. But there's also a very real crisis, in which both parties play a role, as 800,000 federal workers continue to go without paychecks and the ripple effects of the partial shutdown are increasingly hitting the economy.\n\nBut there's no denying the political dimension of the shutdown. Half an hour after the Trump speech, his campaign sent out a fundraising pitch saying he will NOT cave to the Democrats when it comes to YOUR SAFETY…The President is counting on you in this fight, we must hit our goal of $500,000 in ONE DAY.
As a consumer of political content, I'm sure you've already been inundated by articles and TV segments analyzing the importance of the Georgia Senate run-off elections on Tuesday. Control of the Senate means, in no uncertain terms, that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will be able to bring their agenda to life… or not.\n\nIt was central to both Biden's primary and general election campaigns that he was the candidate best suited to be able to work with Republicans and I believe that's very much the case.\n\nHe has decades long relationships with key GOP officials, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and has shown throughout his career that he is very effective at reaching across the aisle to work on bipartisan legislation.\n\nBut for all of Biden's goodwill and effort in this arena, it is obvious that Republicans have no interest in working with him. Biden can make all the overtures he wants, McConnell has been clear. He sees Democrats as the enemy.\n\nDONNA BRAZILE: GOP SENATE CANDIDATES IN GEORGIA ARE TRUMP PUPPETS WHO ACT LIKE CONTESTANTS ON 'THE APPRENTICE'\n\nIt follows that divided government isn't good enough. In order for anything to be accomplished in Washington, and I mean anything, McConnell cannot remain in control.\n\nIt's underrated and often forgotten just how sick Americans are of the inaction in Washington. Congress enjoys an approval rating in the low teens on a good day and voters overwhelmingly believe representatives are more concerned with themselves and playing politics than what's best for Americans.\n\nNeed evidence? Look no further than the drama over the COVID-19 stimulus package wherein 78% of Americans support $2,000 stimulus checks and the GOP still blocked it. They can't even work together with Democrats at such a dire time in history so it's quite obvious they won't be reaching across the aisle when we're out of this once in a century pandemic.\n\nThere will be another opportunity to approve a standalone bill that sends money to the American people soon after Biden's inauguration. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Joe Ossoff are in D.C., that will be possible. If Republican Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue win on Tuesday, McConnell will block that desperately needed assistance.\n\nThis is about so much more than COVID assistance, though. If Democrats hold a Senate majority, Biden should be able to make progress on key issues like the economy, health care, immigration and climate change.\n\nThese are policy areas where there is broad agreement amongst Americans.\n\nNearly two thirds of Americans favor increased taxes on the wealthiest Americans. That includes 77% of Democrats and 53% of Republicans. And over two thirds support an increase in the federal minimum wage. While a majority of Republicans don't support a $15 minimum wage, there is broad support for a raise beyond the current rate of $7.25.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act currently enjoys a 53% favorability rating as compared to just 34% who oppose it in the latest Kaiser Family Foundation polling. Nearly 75% believe that it's important that people with pre-existing conditions remain protected.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nOn immigration, Americans broadly support legal status for DACA kids. Recent polling shows 75% hold this position. They also believe immigrants are good for the country, this includes a majority of Republicans, and bring with them a strong work ethic and talent.\n\nAnd on climate change, nearly two-thirds of Americans believe government should act more aggressively to combat climate change. They also want the government to go further to reduce greenhouse gases, restrict power plant emissions, require more fuel-efficient cars and tax corporations based on their emissions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese aren't Democratic positions, they are American positions.

If you had a nickel for every time a Democrat used arguments about science in discussions about climate change, you'd be rich. Scientific studies about the existence of climate change – be it man-made or naturally occurring – are often used as cudgels against opponents of the left's radical environmental agenda or international regulatory regimes like the Paris Climate Accord.\n\nHowever, when it comes to legalizing recreational marijuana, Democrats sing a much different tune. Many of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.\n\nThe Big Pot legalization crowd willfully ignores decades of scientific research that provides clear and convincing evidence that frequent recreational marijuana consumption has a range of lasting negative health consequences.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ DR. MARC SIEGEL: SMOKING POT ROUTINELY MAY SEEM HARMLESS BUT DON'T BE FOOLED (EVEN IF IT'S LEGAL)\n\nMajor medical associations overwhelmingly agree that sustained marijuana usage – particularly of today's more potent forms of pot – can have both physical and neurological impacts, including reduced motor function and cognitive impairment, along with a range of other health risks.\n\nA study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that adverse health effects include addiction, impacts on brain development, possible mental illness and impaired driving ability.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine study found there is substantial evidence linking cannabis smoking and chronic bronchitis, development of schizophrenia and other psychoses.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatricians has raised alarm bells about the dangers for younger users on brain development. The Royal College of General Practitioners in Britain and the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction have also come to the conclusion that frequent use of marijuana has negative physical, psychological and neurological impacts.\n\nPerhaps most shockingly, the left has willfully ignored studies like one published in 2017 in the American Journal of Psychology showing a strong connection between marijuana and future opioid use.\n\nYou can cut the hypocrisy with a knife. Of course, the left is confident you won't notice it's really all about money and votes.\n\nOver the last decade, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the Drug Policy Alliance, and the Marijuana Policy Project have spent millions of dollars lobbying Democrats and donated overwhelmingly to Democratic candidates.\n\nSo much work has been done to advance the cause with Democrats that pro-pot groups are now turning their sights to Republicans.\n\nIn California – where plastic straws are considered dangerous – laws actually prohibit political contributions from the tobacco and oil industries, but permit them from the marijuana industry.\n\nMany of the same folks who have been pushing for healthier school lunches, soda bans, lower salt content in food and calorie disclosures at restaurants suddenly don't care about legalizing a substance that has been scientifically proven to worsen our national public health crisis.\n\n\n\nSens. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.; Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.; Cory Booker, D-N.J.; and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y. – all considered 2020 Democratic presidential contenders – have openly endorsed marijuana legalization or encouraged states to legalize. Yet, they've all also used scientific arguments to justify their positions on climate change.\n\nMany Democrats also see legalization of marijuana as a new way to generate more tax revenue to grow government, and they don't care if people are harmed. It is only logical to suggest that many of those adversely impacted by marijuana legalization would need more government services like unemployment, health care and welfare programs to assist them.\n\nIn New York, where Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo and new Democratic majorities in the state Legislature are pushing for legalization, a recent proposal even espoused the laughable proposition that revenue generated by pot legalization could be used to fix the New York City subways.\n\nHowever, qualitative research has shown that for every dollar in revenue generated, marijuana legalization may cost taxpayers $10 in government spending and programs. Big Pot is a big loser for taxpayers.\n\nFor Democrats, supporting marijuana legalization is a way to mobilize young and minority voters. For all their charges that Republicans are in the pocket of Big Pharma, marijuana will become a booming industry that will endear many cannabis workers, investors and users of the drug to the Democratic Party and its candidates.\n\nSo the next time Democrats start talking about science, tell them that strong and reliable science and research don't just matter when they fit the Democratic agenda. Ask them to refute decades of medical research that demonstrate the real harm caused by marijuana.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY TOM BASILE
It's gotten so late that it's early. You've been nose-down working and forgot to get groceries before the store closed.\n\nBut that was hours ago and the only current options are those with bright neon sights beaming into the dead of night.\n\nThese are common scenarios for so-called night owls, the yin to the yang that are early birds. They're typically awake when their neighbors are asleep.\n\nBut, unfortunately for our nighttime dwellers, those lack of nutritional options can have long-term health effects.\n\nMOM RECALLS C-SECTION HORROR AFTER SCAR SPLIT DAYS AFTER BIRTH\n\nA new study looked at the negative health impacts of being a night owl, particularly by examining what they're eating while awake during the wee hours of the morning.\n\nThe study, recently published in Advances in Nutrition, looked at available research and asked the question: Does when you go to bed affect your health? The short answer, according to the study authors, is yes it does.\n\nThe researchers — some of which are employees of food giant Nestle — focused on what's known as a person's chronotype. Your chronotype (or individual sleep pattern) is more commonly referred to as your circadian rhythm, or your sleep-wake cycles in relationship to the setting and rising of the sun.\n\nThe researchers examined available research on the health habits of daytime and nighttime people. They found, overall, that so-called night owls typically eat fewer fruits and vegetables and consume more energy drinks, alcoholic, sugary, and caffeinated beverages, as well as higher energy intake from fat.\n\nA few observational studies (those regarded as having the least amount of accuracy) also show night owls are more likely to change what time they eat and skip meals — most often breakfast.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the research definitely provides food for thought, it doesn't suggest a cause-and-effect relationship between staying up late and eating poorly.\n\nLike many other things in life, there are many more factors at play.\n\nThe life and diet of a night owl\n\nThose night owl hours are also when grocery stores and healthier restaurants that offer food delivery are typically closed.\n\nThat often leaves only corner stores and fast-food restaurants as the last bastion of sustenance, which will inevitably offer worse food options: those higher in sugar, salt, and fat.\n\nSamantha Morrison, a health and wellness expert for Glacier Wellness, says eating fatty and sugary foods late in the day require long digestion periods, which can cause unwanted weight gains, indigestion, and even increase the chances of having a stroke.\n\nOne of the most devastating consequences being a night owl can have on a person's health is the effect it has on maintaining healthy eating habits, she told Healthline. Eating a large meal in the evening can have a serious impact on your sleeping habits.\n\nEspecially when that large meal is something like a hot dog, a bag of chips, and a fountain soda or a Mega burrito from the corner store. Along with those options are the beer in the back coolers and the tobacco behind the counter.\n\nThose options, when plotted out on a timeline, typically create shorter lives filled with a lot of painful diseases.\n\nBut those who are more typically likely to work those hours — particularly freelancers, shift-workers, and those in the so-called gig economy — might not have another easy option.\n\nBABY ERUPTS IN LAUGHTER AFTER HEARING CLEARLY FOR FIRST TIME\n\nBen Taylor, founder of the advice portal for home workers and freelancers HomeWorkingClub.com, said one annoying thing about the chronotype research was that it seemed to suggest that being a night owl is a conscious choice, even describing it as a preference.\n\nAs someone who's been self-employed and working from home for many years, I am fortunate enough to be able to work around my own natural rhythms, Taylor told Healthline. While I can force myself onto a nine-to-five pattern, if left to its own devices, my mind and body always defaults back to night owl.\n\nTaylor says that the times that people wake and sleep have evolved, and it doesn't seem right that studies like this are reported on in a way that suggests night owls are making a poor lifestyle choice.\n\nFor some, it's simply not a choice.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says 9 percent of the U.S. workforce is still on the clock at 9 a.m. and 3 percent are still plugging away at 2 a.m.\n\nWhether it's working a graveyard shift in the back of an ambulance or living in one time zone and working in another, someone has to be awake when everyone else is getting those precious hours of sleep that line up with the sun's daily setting and rising.\n\nAnd some even prefer the night hours because it's quieter and less crowded.\n\nBut knowing exactly how a night-owl lifestyle can negatively impact your health and increase your chances of certain preventable diseases is the first step in avoiding it.\n\nDr. Steven Zodkoy, director of Monmouth Advanced Medicine and author of Misdiagnosed: The Adrenal Fatigue Link, says the biggest reason night owls exist is an abnormal cortisol rhythm.\n\nHe says most people have higher levels of the hormone cortisol in the morning, but, chronically stressed people get that peak later in the day.\n\nNight owls typically will have a shift in the normal pattern, Zodkoy told Healthline.\n\nEssentially, the later the brain fully wakes up, the later it's ready to settle down for the night.\n\nThat, Zodky says, can lead to poor sleep, fatigue, burnout, weight gain, anxiety, and other symptoms of Type-A personality traits.\n\nTo help minimize those effects, Zodky and others recommend exercise, relaxation, and other lifestyle changes. That includes the focus on food from the chronotype study.\n\nBesides long-term preventable health effects, the cliché lifestyles of the night owl could have an immediate effect on your finances because you could end up making some poor mistakes.\n\nDr. Sujay Kansagra, Mattress Firm's sleep health expert, says a variety of studies suggest night owls tend to do worse on a variety of measures, including school performance, self-regulation, risk-taking, and risk of mood disturbance.\n\nHe said the new research adds another interesting dimension to circadian science, some of which can likely be explained by the dietary choices for night owls.\n\nBut the bottom line question is, why do night owls have a poor diet? This is no doubt due to the mismatch in their internal circadian rhythm with the external clock, Kansagra told Healthline.\n\nHow night owls can protect themselves\n\nThe best thing you can do to avoid making impatient culinary decisions — especially if it's late and you have a case of the drunchies — is to plan ahead.\n\nThat means going out to the grocery store during those daylight hours when everyone else might be there and stocking up on healthy snacks.\n\nBaby carrots, bagged salads, rotisserie chickens, bananas, low-salt nuts, reduced-fat cheeses, whole grain crackers and bread can satisfy a lot of those late-night good mouthfeel snacks without adding unnecessary calories.\n\nAnd, if you're hankering for one more beer before bed, try picking up a 12-pack of canned bubbly water. Your brain gets the same refreshing feeling of cracking one last cold one with none of the alcohol.\n\nBut once the shift is over and it's finally time to go to bed, people who could be considered a night owl — whether by choice, diet, or profession — can also make some simple changes to get better sleep.\n\nBill Fish, co-founder of Tuck.com, says the human circadian rhythm has evolved over millennium, but it changed when Thomas Edison invented the light bulb back in 1879.\n\nUntil that time, humans woke up with the rise of the sun to either hunt or tend to the fields, he told Healthline. We then rested when it became dark.\n\nSo, while you're fighting eons of evolution and sleeping during the day, Fish recommends creating a sleep sanctuary with shades that blackout windows and a white noise machine to ensure you are allowing your body to naturally rest properly.\n\nOther than that, it's important to be mindful of what your body is trying to tell you.\n\nMonitor your diet to ensure you are consuming three quality meals per day, Fish said, and continue to do everything possible to monitor your health.\n\nThis article first appeared on HealthLine.com

And now you, like Snooki, JWoww and The Situation, are back, older and perhaps a bit wiser for the experience.\n\n\n\nAs you may have noticed, things are very different this time around. In the original, you were wingmen and wingwomen for a still-popular new president of your own party. The tension was whether or not you could fulfill all of your wildest dreams. You did not, but we're sure it was fun to think you might.\n\n\n\nIn the reboot, you are supposed to play the serious-minded grownups who act as a check on an intemperate, mercurial president of the other party. When you were last in this position we all marveled at once-and-future Speaker Nancy Pelosi's ability to move legislation even when it as unpopular and politically damaging.\n\n\n\nThere will be no serious legislating this time around. With a staunchly Republican Senate and a president interested in making you into his foil for re-election your options are extremely limited compared to before.\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, here is a realistic to-do list for House Democrats in the 116th Congress:\n\n\n\nTIE DOWN TRUMP\n\nWho's foiling who here? The best news from the 2018 election for Trump, aside from an expanded Senate majority, was that in losing the House he gained a sparring partner. Had the Republicans maintained a narrow majority in the lower chamber governing would have been hard and avoiding blame would have been harder.\n\n\n\nHis job now is to blame you for everything that goes wrong and paint your party as a wacky assortment of mixed nuts from every big city in the country.\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration's expectation is that you will devote yourselves to preparing articles of impeachment against the president, hoping that you will replicate the deadly overreach of the Gingrich-era House GOP. The other expectation is that you will beleaguer the administration with investigations, hearings and general legislative harassment.\n\n\n\nOn the first question, all of the impeachment talk hinges on what prosecutors find or don't find. So just cool your jets. On the second question, don't get your hopes up. As your Republican predecessors discovered, contempt of Congress isn't nearly as scary for administration officials as it sounds. They're going to blow you off and voters won't care any more about your howls than they did when Eric Holder stiff-armed the House GOP.\n\n\n\nIf you really want to tie Trump down, keep him at the negotiating table and make him do the part of the job he obviously dislikes. The current shutdown provides a pretty good blueprint for how Democrats can keep the president hunkered down.\n\n\n\nYour job, like the new Republican majority eight years ago, is to make the incumbent a one-term president. This approach may not be good for the country (it's not) but it's pretty much all that's left in this burned-over country that we call politics.\n\n\n\nVoters will not yet hold you responsible for what's wrong and you can keep telling your base that all of its wildest dreams will come true once you have total control of Washington again. *snort*\n\n\n\nDEVELOP A BRAND\n\nIt's not easy to make a new coalition, but that's exactly what your party needs you to do right now. With a mix of suburban moderates and urban left wingers your new majority has new clear mandate other than to be a check on Trump, and even there, as we discussed above, it's a matter of degree.\n\n\n\nEven though you are not going to be able to enact legislation, that doesn't mean you can't pass some. Certainly you have control over which topics you discuss.\n\n\n\nHealth insurance is an obvious choice, though it brings obvious tensions about methodology. But as Obama-era Republicans demonstrated solutions are more politically difficult than just good-old fashioned complaining.\n\n\n\nYou don't have to know what you want, you just have to make sure that the incumbent president gets the blame for whatever goes wrong. But you also have to have some kind of an economic agenda. Markets may look like the inside of a rental car after a Myrtle Beach bachelor party, but the president still enjoys a substantial advantage when it comes to his handling of the economy.\n\n\n\nInfrastructure would be a harmonizing subject for your conference and would undercut the president on an unmet promise to voters. If you get very lucky, you could pass something that the president would actually pressure Senate Republicans to pass.\n\n\n\nYou will face enormous pressure from your base to take large, symbolic action on firearms and climate change. This seems like a bad idea. Both would make for difficult votes for swing state members while accomplishing no change. Your 2020 nominee will not want to have to defend pie in the sky you passed to prove a point.\n\n\n\nSTAY SWITZERLAND\n\nAre any of you not running for president? You are not as bad as the Senate where 11 Democrats are running or may run for president, but you've got five current or former members dipping toes in the presidential waters.\n\n\n\nEven after the field thins out and even if the top tier includes no current lawmakers, there will be a serious backdraft from your party's nominating contest.\n\n\n\nMembers are likely to oppose or support legislation based on the self-interest of their campaigns. That will be annoying enough, but in addition those of you who still consider yourselves esteemed public figures will soon enough start making endorsements and pronouncements about the race.\n\n\n\nThis is very stupid. Outside of one or two iconic figures, none of your endorsements will make much difference, even if you happen to be from an early-voting state. This contest could turn into a food fight inside your own conference and derail your hopes for a successful two years.\n\n\n\nTry rehearsing the following like you were Nuke LaLoosh: We have a very impressive field. Democrats are lucky to have so many great choices. And of them would be better than the current president.\n\n\n\nPlayin' 'em one game at a time…\n\n\n\nBEND BUT DON'T BREAK\n\nBoth new and old members have lots of personal ambitions that will diverge from the good of your party and your hopes for full restoration in 2020. You have Democratic socialists on the left who, like the Tea Party in 2011, want to show maximum resistance. But you also have moderates in vulnerable seats who will want to take no chances.\n\n\n\nThe solution is very simple but very hard: You have to give in a little bit to avoid full rupture, but not so much as to really fracture your new coalition. Find ways to humor cranky members. Wild goose chases and special select committees make good busywork for members with more ambition than ability.\n\n\n\nAnd never overlook an opportunity to summon your party's single greatest unifier: Trump himself. There are no atheists in fox holes, but neither are there many free thinkers of any kind. The more your conference sees itself as under siege from Trump the easier it will be to keep it together.\n\n\n\nIt's unlikely, but be on the lookout for Trump overcoming his basic instincts and looking for ways to effectively divide your party by selective cooperation.\n\n\n\nSENDING NOT RECEIVING\n\nYou begin your time in the majority as you will likely end this Congress: Caught in some penny-ante fight with the administration. The current shutdown is over an absurdly small amount of money but an absurdly large portion of posturing.\n\n\n\nIt will be true for you as it is for every House in both divided and unified governments. If you can't pass bills, you lose. It happens every time.\n\n\n\nThe final miracle of Paul Ryan's unlikely speakership was the passage of a final, Hail Mary pass to push the shutdown back on the Senate. As soon as your conference becomes too divided to pass legislation you become sitting ducks.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: TBH\n\nThe truth is, that the great principles of the Constitution proposed by the convention may be considered less as absolutely new, than as the expansion of principles which are found in the articles of Confederation. – James Madison, Federalist No. 40\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: OH CHRISTMAS TREE\n\nSmithsonian: Tis the season … to kick millions of Christmas trees to the curb. … [I]n many places the trees are simply tossed in the landfill, where their pine needles break down, emitting greenhouse gases. Now, researchers at the University of Sheffield are offering a sustainable alternative to this sad fate. … Cynthia Kartey, a chemical engineer, found another use for pine needles. As it turns out, they are a great feedstock for creating other chemicals. … Using heat and solvents like cheap, environmentally friendly glycerol, the needles can be broken down into bio-oil and bio-char. Bio-oil can be further refined into glucose, which is used as a food sweetener, acetic acid used in making paint and adhesives, and phenol, which is used in mouthwash. The solid-bio char also has industrial uses. 'In the future, the tree that decorated your house over the festive period could be turned into paint to decorate your house once again,' Kartey says.\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 42 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 53.4 percent\n\nNet Score: -11.4 points\n\nChange from one week ago: no change\n\n[Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 52% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 52% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nI'LL TELL YOU WHAT: THEY COULD BE CONTENDERS\n\nThis week, in Dana Perino's absence, Chris Stirewalt is joined by Brianna McClelland to give an early look at the 2020 Democratic field.

The former governor of Maryland who abandoned his 2016 Democratic primary campaign against Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., after a third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses penned an op-ed in the Des Moines Register Thursday encouraging outgoing Texas Rep. O'Rourke to run. 'I will not be running for president in 2020, but I hope Beto O'Rourke does. And this is why,' O'Malley wrote. 'People are looking for a new leader who can bring us together. They are looking for a unifier and a healer. They are looking for a leader of principle, and they are now looking for a fearless vision.' … O'Malley added: 'Like so many other Americans, I believe we need new leadership to make that future a reality.'\n\n\n\nKraushaar: Warren, Booker already making rookie mistakes - National Journal: As the first leading contender to announce her intent to run for president, Elizabeth Warren has drawn ample scrutiny over her decisions. From publicizing the results of a much-mocked DNA test showing a trace of Native American ancestry to announcing her candidacy before the New Year when few were paying attention, there's plenty to second-guess. But more consequential than these tactical decisions is the big-picture strategy that a candidate adopts. And Warren, in the run-up to her announcement, has concluded that she can't deviate from an agenda embraced by the party's progressive activists. When moderates (and conservative Democrats) make up over half of the Democratic electorate, and in a prospective field filled with progressive candidates, such down-the-line liberal orthodoxy threatens to be a major political blunder.\n\n\n\nMinnesota's Klobuchar 'getting close' - [Minneapolis] Star Tribune: Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Wednesday that she is 'getting close to a decision' about running for president in 2020, as other prominent Democrats begin to jump in the race to challenge President Donald Trump next year. 'I'm continuing to talk to people about it,' the Minnesota Democrat said in an interview in her U.S. Senate office, a day before the start of a new congressional term. She said those discussions have been with a handful of longtime political advisers in Minnesota, some fellow U.S. senators and others. … Her likeliest strategy would be to win or finish strongly in neighboring Iowa, with its presidential caucus on Feb. 3, 2020. Klobuchar declined to put an exact timeline on when she'd reveal her plans. But she acknowledged that the likelihood of a large Democratic field vying to challenge Trump means she can't wait too long.\n\n\n\nRNC URGED TO CONSIDER RIGGING NOMINATION FOR TRUMP\n\nCBS News: A member of the Republican National Committee, fearing primary challengers to President Trump in the wake of incoming GOP Sen. Mitt Romney's scathing op-ed, is urging fellow committee members to change the rules to thwart intra-party threats to Mr. Trump in 2020. In an email obtained by CBS News, Jevon O.A. Williams, the national committeeman for the Virgin Islands, urged fellow elected RNC members … to close 'loopholes' in the nomination in a way that would make it tougher for even token challengers to Mr. Trump to enter the fray. … Williams also called for a resolution to declare Mr. Trump the presumptive nominee in 2020, calling for both of those moves to take place at an RNC winter meeting later this month.\n\n\n\nThe Judge's Ruling: The 'office pool' for 2019 - This week Fox News Senior Judicial Analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano asks a series of multiple choice questions on where the country will be a year from now.

'It's not going to be just Apple,' CEA chairman Kevin Hassett said in an interview on CNN. 'There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have sales in China that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with China.' Hassett argued that a softer economy in China is cutting into U.S. companies' sales there and that the economic pain gives Trump leverage in ongoing trade negotiations. 'That puts a lot of pressure on China to make a deal,' he said.\n\n\n\nHOUSE DEMS LOOK TO DIFFUSE DEBT LIMIT FIGHT\n\nRoll Call: A proposed House rules package wouldn't just reinstate the old rule that let the chamber avoid separate votes on the statutory debt ceiling 20 times in three decades starting in 1980. The new rules offered by House Democratic leaders, set for floor debate Thursday, would turbocharge the old 'Gephardt rule' into something completely new. It would allow the chamber to spin off a resolution 'suspending' the debt ceiling to the Senate, without a House vote, once the House adopts its own version of a budget resolution. That's a stark departure from the previous Gephardt rule, named for former House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., which required the House and Senate to jointly agree on the same budget resolution in order for the House to avoid what is typically a difficult vote on the debt ceiling. …Congress will have to address the debt limit later this year after a temporary suspension of borrowing authority expires March 1.\n\n\n\nNew Congress less Christian, but still more Christian than the nation - Pew: While the number of self-identified Christians in Congress has ticked down … the religious makeup of the new, 116th Congress is very different from that of the United States population. Within Protestantism, certain groups are particularly numerous in the new Congress, including Methodists, Anglicans/Episcopalians, Presbyterians and Lutherans. Additionally, Protestants in the 'unspecified/other' category make up just 5% of the U.S. public, but 15% of Congress. By contrast, some other Protestant groups are underrepresented, including Pentecostals (5% of the U.S. public vs. 0.4% of Congress). But by far the largest difference between the U.S. public and Congress is in the share who are unaffiliated with a religious group. In the general public, 23% say they are atheist, agnostic or 'nothing in particular.' In Congress, just one person – Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., who was recently elected to the Senate after three terms in the House – says she is religiously unaffiliated, making the share of 'nones' in Congress 0.2%.\n\n\n\nNORTH CAROLINA REPUBLICAN SUES FOR HOUSE SEAT\n\nCharlotte Observer: The Republican in the nation's last undecided congressional race asked a North Carolina court Thursday to require that he be declared the winner because the now-defunct state elections board didn't act. A lawsuit by GOP candidate Mark Harris claims the disbanded elections board had been declared unconstitutional, so its investigation into alleged ballot fraud by an operative hired by the Republican's campaign was invalid. The elections board was dissolved Friday by state judges who in October declared its makeup unconstitutional but had allowed investigations to continue. A revamped board doesn't officially come into existence until Jan. 31. … The investigation is continuing, however, with Harris being interviewed Thursday as all other U.S. House winners were sworn into office in Washington. Democratic leaders in the U.S. House have said they won't allow Harris to take office because of the ongoing investigation. The U.S. Constitution makes the House the judge and final arbiter of its members' election contests.\n\n\n\nMcCrory may challenge Tillis - [Raleigh] News&Observer: Former North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory on Wednesday ruled out running in the 9th Congressional District — but not for governor in 2020 or the U.S. Senate in 2022. Speaking on his morning talk show on WBT radio, the Charlotte Republican said he'll make that decision later this year. 'I'm going to do a thorough assessment about running for governor (in 2020) or Senate in 2022, but I'm not ready to make either decision,' McCrory said. Charlotte's longest-serving mayor did say he's ruled out running if there's a special election in the 9th Congressional District. The election in November of Republican Mark Harris has been clouded by allegations of election fraud involving absentee ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties.

The first time most people meet Schiavo, they've just come out of a coronary procedure and he's explaining that after the catheters are pulled out of their femoral artery, he's going to apply pressure to their groin for 20 to 40 minutes to aid in clotting. Awkward! Or it would be, if it was anyone else but Schiavo, a gregarious, emotional, wisecracking guy who is all South Philly… He's won awards, had money donated in his name, and gets stopped all the time by former patients who want to buy him drinks or dinner. 'I'm holding someone's groin for 20 minutes, they tend to remember me and nobody else,' Schiavo said.

The media went out of its way in 2020 to paint sometimes-violent protests across the nation as mostly peaceful, but finally came around on Wednesday to the notion that mayhem and anarchy is always unacceptable – all it took was Trump supporters causing the chaos to spark a swift change of heart.\n\nIt's not hard to find prominent voices on the left who are suddenly finding lawlessness inexcusable, after suggesting it was excusable if it forwarded their agenda. They used words like 'rebellion' to glamourize unrest, Media Research Center executive editor Tim Graham told Fox News.\n\nDC POLICE SAY 4 DEAD, 52 ARRESTED AFTER CHAOS AT CAPITOL\n\nWashington, D.C., police said late Wednesday that the security breach at the U.S. Capitol resulted in four deaths – including a woman who had been shot – and at least 52 arrests. Robert J. Contee III, the city's top cop, said two pipe bombs were recovered earlier – one located outside the Republican National Committee and one outside the Democratic National Committee. Police said they also found a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on the Capitol grounds. At least six firearms were recovered, in addition to the three recovered last night, as well as, a stun gun, authorities said.\n\nThe tragic scene has been widely condemned by just about anyone with a public platform – a stark difference to how last summer's protests over police brutality were reported.\n\nLast year MSNBC anchor Ali Velshi, who was reporting live from Minneapolis following the death of George Floyd, told viewers that the situation was not generally speaking unruly – while standing in front of a burning building.\n\nABC News was criticized in July for describing a California protest that featured demonstrators setting fire to a courthouse, vandalizing a police station, and shooting fireworks at police officers, as peaceful. CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell said mostly peaceful protests would cost $1 billion to $2 billion in claims as a result of damage from looting and arson, and CNN's Omar Jimenez was famously reporting live in front of a raging fire amid Kenosha, Wis., chaos and the chyron at the bottom of the screen read, FIERY BUT MOSTLY PEACEFUL PROTESTS AFTER POLICE SHOOTING.\n\nPROTESTERS DESCEND ON NATION'S STATE CAPITALS AS CHAOS UNFOLDS IN DC\n\nCNN's Chris Cuomo even asked viewers, Please, show me where it says that protesters are supposed to be polite and peaceful. But the CNN host felt differently on Wednesday. Protestors use speech. Angry. Not peaceful often ... outraged, cursing ... and that is protected. Sedition is not. Criminality is not. These were mobs that trashed the capitol and got light treatment for it. This is where we are. And it is ugly, Cuomo tweeted.\n\nCuomo, who was criticized on social media as old clips were unearthed, defended himself by saying false equivalency bs is killing us.\n\nGraham believes the chaos that played out on live television on Wednesday was so serious that it's no time for double standards from the press, who should have condemned violence all along.\n\nIt's time for standards, and respecting the home of our Congress is the lowest standard for American civilization. We should insist that trashing an Apple store is inexcusable. Trashing our Capitol is even worse, Graham said.\n\nHowever, DePauw University professor Jeffrey McCall – who is typically an outspoken critic of the mainstream media – doesn't think the comparison of the events is apples to apples.\n\nClearly, coverage of the Capitol-storming had to be characterized as it was, an unacceptable and dangerous event. It is difficult to fully compare the social unrest of last summer to the Washington chaos of yesterday. Last summer's events were sparked by different circumstances and were more socially, culturally based. Yesterday's chaos was sparked by more specific political motivations, McCall told Fox News.\n\nOne example of the changing narratives is Vox reporter German Lopez, who published a 2016 story amid national police brutality demonstrations headlined, Riots are destructive, dangerous and scary – but can lead to serious social reforms.\n\nSAN DIEGO WOMAN ID'D AS PERSON SHOT DEAD INSIDE CAPITOL\n\nAt the time, many on the right condemned the sometimes-violent demonstrations, but Lopez argued that riots aren't solely random acts of violence or people taking advantage of dire circumstances to steal and destroy property but instead are a serious attempt at forcing change after years of neglect by politicians, media and the general public.\n\nFast forward to 2021 and the very same Vox reporter penned a story headlined, Every person who forced their way into the Capitol should be arrested, indicating that Lopez has evolved on the issue.\n\nGrabien Media founder Tom Elliott put together a montage of media members endorsing political violence from Antifa that further illustrates the hypocrisy.\n\nConservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News that violence is always wrong but the mainstream media spent months telling people that [it] was a legitimate political tool until that narrative became inconvenient.\n\nThey whitewashed the violence, they encouraged it and now they feign outrage when folks who they politically disagree with act in the exact same way, Barron said.\n\nCornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson agrees that we've seen a dramatic shift in rhetoric coming from the left.\n\nThroughout the summer and fall, the mainstream liberal media either downplayed or justified widespread rioting and looting, and physical street intimidation, by Antifa and BLM activists. While the storming of the Capitol rightly deserves condemnation, we can't lose sight of the media's role in breaking the norm of peaceful protest, Jacobson told Fox News.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMcCall said the mainstream media often tried to put the Black Lives Matter-led protests in a context that at times overlooked the magnitude of the actual violence that was occurring.\n\nYesterday's coverage, understandably, provided no such nuance. Storming the Capitol is not acceptable under any circumstances. However, burning police stations and attacking courthouses is not acceptable either, as was witnessed last summer, and some media outlets underplayed the significance of those dangerous situations.\n\nFox News' David Aaro contributed to this report.
Gulf Arab leaders signed a declaration Tuesday in Saudi Arabia to mark a new page in relations following the kingdom's decision to end a 3 1/2-year embargo of Qatar, easing a rift that deeply divided regional U.S. security allies and frayed social ties across the interconnected Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe Saudi decision to open its airspace and borders to Qatar was the first major step toward ending the diplomatic crisis that began in 2017, just as the Trump administration was raising pressure on Iran. The Saudi move was announced Monday night, on the eve of the gathering of Gulf Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia's ancient desert city of Al-Ula.\n\nJARED KUSHNER BROKERS DEAL ENDING SAUDI ARABIA'S FIGHT WITH QATAR\n\nIt was unclear what, if any, significant concessions Qatar had made before the summit. Still, an immediate shift in tone was palpable as one of Qatar's Al Jazeera Arabic news Twitter accounts shared photos of the Riyadh and Abu Dhabi skylines on Tuesday following years of critical coverage.\n\nThe diplomatic breakthrough followed a final push by the outgoing Trump administration and Kuwait to mediate the dispute. It also came as Saudi Arabia seeks to unify Arab ranks ahead of the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden, which is expected to take a firmer stand toward the kingdom and re-engage with Iran.\n\nDania Thafer, executive director of Gulf International Forum, said Saudi Arabia is concerned about whether Biden will draw down the U.S. military presence in the Persian Gulf that had expanded under President Donald Trump and enter back into nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\nBEHIND THE FINAL TRUMP TEAM PUSH FOR SAUDI ARABIA TO 'NORMALIZE' TIES WITH ISRAEL\n\nIf that is the case, then the (Arab) states need to respond with a regional solution to security. And I think resolving the Gulf crisis is one step forward towards that direction, she said.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who embraced Qatar's emir upon his arrival at the summit, said the region needed to unite and face challenges posed by Iran's proxies and its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.\n\nHe said the declaration signed by Gulf leaders and Egypt emphasizes Arab and Gulf solidarity and stability, and reinforces the continuity of friendship and brotherhood between our countries.\n\nThe four countries that jointly boycotted Qatar — Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Bahrain — were hoping their embargo and media blitz would pressure it to end its close relations with Turkey and Iran. Egypt and the UAE view the support by Qatar and Turkey of Islamist groups like the Muslim Brotherhood as a security threat. Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are primarily concerned about Qatar's ties with Iran.\n\nThe boycott failed to change Doha's stance, however, instead buoying its young ruler domestically as patriotic fervor swept through Qatar in support of his resolve. It also pushed Qatar closer to Turkey and Iran, which rushed to support the ultra-wealthy Gulf state as it faced medical and food supply shortages in the first days of the embargo.\n\nWhile the Saudi decision to end its embargo marks a milestone toward resolving the dispute, the path toward reconciliation is far from guaranteed. The rift between Abu Dhabi and Doha has been deepest, with the UAE and Qatar at sharp ideological odds.\n\nThe UAE's Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, tweeted late Monday that his country was keen to restore Gulf unity but cautioned: We have more work to do.\n\nThe conflict in Libya remains a contentious issue, with Egypt and the UAE supporting military commander Khalifa Hifter, who launched a 2019 assault on a Tripoli-based bloc backed by Turkey and Qatar.\n\nThafer said the issues that sparked the row haven't been eliminated.\n\nThe core tensions are still lingering, and that leaves a major question mark on how will they move forward, she said. The summit and the declaration signed in Al-Ula to support Gulf unity were confidence-building mechanisms more than they were a full reconciliation.\n\nThe presence of Qatar's Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani at the summit marked the first time he's attended the Gulf Cooperation Council meeting in Saudi Arabia since the boycott began. He sent an envoy to the past two summits there.\n\nMITCHELL BARD: SAUDI ARABIA'S ANTI-SEMITISM IS BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZING RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL\n\nThis year, Egypt's foreign minister also attended the meeting of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, which comprises Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar. The meeting was chaired by the Saudi crown prince rather than his father, King Salman.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar's finance minister arrived to Cairo Tuesday for the opening of a luxury hotel on the Nile, developed by Qatar's Diar. It is the first visit to Egypt by a senior Qatari official since the crisis began. Officials at Cairo's airport said the Qatari minister flew directly from Doha through Saudi airspace.\n\nThis year's GCC summit is the first since Washington brokered normalization deals between Israel and the UAE, Bahrain, Sudan and Morocco in rapid succession, marking a major shift in regional alliances.\n\nTrump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner, who spearheaded those deals, was at the summit for the signing of the Gulf declaration.\n\nThe dispute had pitted regional U.S. allies against one another at a time when the Trump administration was working to pressure Iran. It also separated families who had intermarried with Qataris and ended years of visa-free travel for Qataris in parts of the Gulf.\n\nThafer said the dispute was seen as low-hanging fruit that the Trump administration felt it had the leverage to try to resolve quickly.\n\nSaudi Arabia's decision to end the embargo not only underscored the kingdom's assertion of its heavyweight position among Arab states, but also its regional leadership, which has been challenged at times by the UAE's unilateral and politically shrewd moves.\n\nQatar's only land border with Saudi Arabia, which it relied on for the import of dairy products, construction materials and other goods, has been mostly closed since June 2017.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe boycotting countries made a list of demands on Qatar that year, including that it shutter its flagship Al-Jazeera news network and terminate Turkish military presence in Qatar, which is also home to a major U.S. military base. Qatar rejected the demands and has denied support of extremists.
In a move President Trump said will reduce car prices but will also anger environmental groups, the administration is revoking California's authority to set strict fuel economy standards.\n\nTrump announced the move Wednesday, saying the decision was made in order to produce far less expensive cars for the consumer, while making cars safer at the same time.\n\nTRUMP SAYS CALIFORNIA CITIES 'DESTROY THEMSELVES' WITH HOMELESSNESS\n\nThis will lead to more production because of this pricing and safety advantage, and also due to the fact that older, highly polluting cars, will be replaced by new, extremely environmentally friendly cars, Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.\n\nCalifornia's authority to set its own emissions standards tougher than the federal government's goes back to a waiver issued by Congress during passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970. The state has long pushed automakers to adopt more fuel-efficient passenger vehicles that emit less pollution. A dozen states and the District of Columbia also follow California's fuel economy standards.\n\nThe Trump administration decision revokes that waiver, touching off what is sure to be another high-profile legal fight with the Golden State.\n\nIn anticipation of the move, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said Tuesday that the administration's action will hurt both U.S. automakers and American families. He said California would fight the administration in federal court.\n\nYou have no basis and no authority to pull this waiver, Becerra, a Democrat, said in a statement, referring to Trump. We're ready to fight for a future that you seem unable to comprehend.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom said the White House has abdicated its responsibility to the rest of the world on cutting emissions and fighting global warming.\n\nThe president, though, claimed there would be very little difference in emissions between the federal and California's standard, but said cars will be far safer and much less expensive. He also predicted that a new national standard for fuel economy will result in more cars being produced by the U.S. and more jobs.\n\nThe move comes after the Justice Department recently opened an antitrust investigation into a deal between California and four automakers for tougher pollution and related mileage requirements than those sought by Trump.\n\nTrump also has sought to relax Obama-era federal mileage standards nationwide, weakening a key effort by his Democratic predecessor to slow climate change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe embrace federalism and the role of the states, but federalism does not mean that one state can dictate standards for the nation, EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler told the National Automobile Dealers Association Tuesday, adding that higher fuel economy standards would hurt consumers by increasing the average sticker price of new cars and requiring automakers to produce more electric vehicles.\n\nEnvironmentalists condemned the Trump administration's move, which comes as gasoline prices have crept higher following a weekend drone attack that hobbled Saudi Arabian oil output.\n\nEveryone wins when we adopt strong clean car standards as our public policy, said Fred Krupp, president of Environmental Defense Fund. Strong clean car standards give us healthier air to breathe, help protect us from the urgent threat of climate change and save Americans hundreds of dollars a year in gas expenses.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
SAN ANTONIO -- Surrounded by supporters, former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro announced his run for presidency on Saturday, becoming the third major declared Democratic candidate for 2020.\n\nWe're going to make sure the promise of America is available to everyone in this 21st century, he told the crowd.\n\nThe Stanford University and Harvard Law School graduate made the announcement in his hometown, where he served as mayor from 2009-2014. His term ended when former President Barack Obama tapped him to become HUD Secretary.\n\nTULSI GABBARD, HAWAII DEMOCRAT, SAYS SHE WILL RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020\n\nStill, Castro touted his experience in the country's seventh largest city as a testament of his leadership abilities and why he should make history as the country's first Latino president.\n\nHe outlined climate change and universal healthcare as some of his main priorities.\n\nI'm running for President because it's time for new leadership and to make sure opportunities I had are available to every American, he said.\n\nCastro, who made stops in Iowa and Las Vegas days before his announcement, now joins what could be a crowded Democratic field. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts launched an exploratory committee on Dec. 31. Former Vice President Joe Biden, California Senator Kamala Harris, and former El Paso Congressman Beto O'Rourke, whose profile has increased after narrowly losing to Senator Ted Cruz in November, have also been identified as potential candidates.\n\nRep. John Delaney of Maryland is already running for president, and Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard said in an interview Friday that she has decided to run for the White House.\n\nGROWING NUMBER OF 2020 DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'\n\nIf he wins, Castro would not only be the first Latino president. At only 44 years old, he would be one of the youngest Americans to hold the seat.\n\nHowever, critics say the long list of hopefuls could easily outshine the Texas native.\n\nPeople here in San Antonio know him obviously…but, if you get out of Texas, and you ask an ordinary citizen on the street, and you say, Julian Castro, they'll probably say, who? said Johnny Arredondo, a member of the Republican Club of Bexar County.\n\nJulian Castro has made history by becoming one of the biggest lightweights to ever run for president, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement. He was a weak mayor who couldn't even handle being HUD secretary. This is obviously just another desperate attempt to become someone else's running mate.\n\nWhile Castro was well known in Texas politics, he was launched into the national spotlight when he delivered the 2012 Democratic National Convention keynote speech. After ending his term as HUD secretary, Castro was floated as a potential vice presidential candidate for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton but was passed over for Virgina Senator Tim Kaine.\n\nSince then, Castro's time in the national spotlight has waned, which is why Texas A & M University San Antonio political science professor, Andrew Sanders, says Castro's early announcement is a good move.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN BARNSTORMS IOWA AMID 2020 PUSH, SAYS SHE WANTS TO 'RETURN POLITICS TO THE PEOPLE'\n\nHe's been out of the limelight for a while now. His experience in government is somewhat limited compared to some of the other names that are likely to appear in the field. So, it's probably a wise move for him to get his name out there this point, said Sanders.\n\nYet, Castro's supporters believe the three-term mayor has what it takes to clinch the country's highest public office.\n\nHe is the epitome of the American dream...Julian is as driven a human being as there is, and he wants to win. And, at every stage in his life, he's been a winner. And, he'll do what it takes to win the election, said political strategist, Christian Archer, who led Castro's successful run for mayor.\n\nCastro highlighted the preservation of public housing, investments in new affordable housing, and efforts to make the rental market more affordable as accomplishments during his time as HUD Secretary.\n\nAs mayor, Castro passed Pre-K 4 SA, an elite pre-K program, which has become a signature resume line for the candidate.\n\nOthers, however, have slammed Castro's actions as being too extreme.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nVoters outside of San Antonio and Texas need to be aware that Castro left the city deep in debt, with a bloated bureaucracy…Julian Castro can be described as a Hispanic version of Obama, said George Rodriguez, Bexar County Republican Party spokesman.\n\nArcher acknowledges that Castro's campaign will be met with challenges, but he has high hopes.\n\nI think he's got a long way to go. But, then there's this next generation of leaders, And, I think if people take a moment and listen to Julian Castro, what he's done in the past, but more importantly what his vision is for the future, I think he will catch fire, said Archer.
The newly rebooted XFL isn't supposed to kick off until 2020, but speculation over whether young college football stars could possibly enter the NFL rival ramped up Tuesday.\n\nAn XFL spokesman asserted to Pro Football Talk that the league will not follow the NFL's draft eligibility rules, which state a player must have been out of high school for at least three years and used up their eligibility prior to the start of the following college football season. Underclassmen need the approval to enter the draft early.\n\nThe XFL's player eligibility guidelines are in development, the spokesman told the football-centric website. The XFL is not restricted by the rules that exist in other professional football leagues.\n\nXFL APPEARS TO BE ANGLING FOR SHOWDOWN WITH NFL, PHOTO SHOWS\n\nXFL commissioner Oliver Luck also addressed the league's eligibility rules in December on the Sports Business Radio Road Show. Luck said the league would have to make a careful decision and didn't exactly rule strict eligibility rules.\n\nNor would I rule out taking a player who played a year of college football and let's say isn't eligible academically, which happens. Or a player who is two years out of college, and is transferring, and would have to sit out a year. A lot of guys don't want to.... We are in that position to be able to take players who wouldn't be eligible to play in the NFL.\n\nBut that's an option that we have and we're going to look at it long and hard. There are a lot of very good college players after a year or two who may not want to play that third year of college football, may need to earn a little money, support the family. That's not uncommon as well.\n\nTREVOR LAWRENCE'S HYPE BUILDS AFTER LEADING CLEMSON TO NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP\n\nCuriosity over young college players' eligibility came into question after Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence became the first true freshman quarterback to lead his team to a national championship in 33 years. Several people appeared to clamor for the NFL to change its draft rules so Lawrence could enter.\n\nThe 19-year-old stud quarterback still has two years of eligibility remaining.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, with the emergence of the XFL, Lawrence could opt to leave the Tigers after the 2019 season and join the XFL for the start of the 2020 season. A high-profile quarterback would draw significant interest to the upstart league, which is not only competing against the NFL but trying to bounce back from a disastrous one and done season in 2001.\n\nThe Alliance of American Football, which will start its inaugural season a week after the Super Bowl, will use the same rules as the NFL does in regards to eligibility, Pro Football Talk reported.

A group of Republican senators led by Ted Cruz are still discussing which states, if any, they will object to during the Jan. 6 certification of the presidential election results, with sources telling Fox News that no conclusions have been reached yet.\n\nCruz, R-Texas, and the group — which includes Republican Sens. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee; Mike Braun of Indiana; Steve Daines of Montana; Bill Hagerty of Tennessee; Ron Johnson of Wisconsin; John Kennedy of Louisiana; James Lankford of Oklahoma; Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming; Roger Marshall of Kansas, and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama — said over the weekend they would object to the certification unless there was an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission.\n\nHOUSE REPUBLICANS PRESSURE SENATE GOP TO OBJECT TO AT LEAST 3 STATES IN JAN. 6 CERTIFICATION OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS\n\nBut as of Monday, a source familiar told Fox News that discussions are ongoing. Another source told Fox News that the senators have been engaged in numerous phone calls and conference calls, but said that no conclusions had been reached.\n\nRepublicans in the House of Representatives have begun putting pressure on Republicans in the upper chamber of Congress to object to election results in at least three states in an effort to impact the outcome of the presidential race – which was called, in November, in favor of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nHouse Republican sources told Fox News Sunday that there is a growing concern that the Republican senators will not object to enough states to make a difference in the outcome of the 2020 presidential election, which the Electoral College has decided in favor of Biden.\n\nTwo House Republican officials told Fox News that more than 100 GOP House members will object to the election results in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\nIf the Republican senators don't object to enough states, the entire effort on Jan. 6 is worthless, a House Republican official told Fox News. To have any chance of impacting the outcome of the 2020 election, the Republican senators must join Republican House members in objecting at least three states and ideally all six states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\nIf Republican senators only object to one state, Joe Biden will undoubtedly secure enough electoral votes to become president, the official continued, adding that the pressure really is on the Republican senators like Ted Cruz to join House Republicans here.\n\nIf they don't, it will be a great disappointment to the president, their constituents, and ensure a Joe Biden victory, the official said.\n\nLast month, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., became the first Republican senator to commit to objecting to the election results, and specifically said he would do so in at least one state – Pennsylvania.\n\nThe group led by Cruz has yet to explicitly commit to objecting to any specific state, and instead called for an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed, the group led by Cruz said over the weekend.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, the senators intend to vote against certification.\n\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on Jan. 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, they said in the statement.\n\nMeanwhile, two sources told Fox News that Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., separately, may object to at least one state during the joint session, but it is unclear, at this point, which state, if any, that may be.\n\nGOP SENATORS, LED BY CRUZ, TO OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION, DEMAND EMERGENCY AUDIT\n\nPaul's office did not immediately respond to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nThe issue of Electoral College certification, though, is not being whipped by Senate Republican leadership, meaning they are not driving the Republican conference in a certain direction. As previously reported, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has referred to this as a vote of conscience.\n\nMeanwhile, a bipartisan group of senators on Sunday said efforts to object to the Electoral College results this week by Republicans only will undermine confidence in the 2020 election.\n\nThe 2020 election is over. All challenges through recounts and appeals have been exhausted, said a statement by Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Bill Cassidy, R-La.; Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Angus King, I-Maine; Mitt Romney, R-Utah; Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill.\n\nAt this point, further attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results, they continued.

Progressive and Democratic lawmakers slammed the Kenosha County district attorney's decision on Tuesday not to file criminal charges against Rusten Sheskey, a White police officer who shot 29-year-old Black man Jacob Blake in the back seven times while responding to a domestic disturbance call in August.\n\nIt is my decision now that no Kenosha law enforcement officer will be charged with any criminal offense based on the facts and laws, Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley told reporters in a news conference Tuesday.\n\nGraveley noted the decision was based on evidence that was not captured on the widely shared cellphone footage showing the Aug. 23 shooting.\n\nIn addition to Sheskey, Graveley said that no charges would be filed against Jacob Blake or two other officers present at the scene, Brittany Meronek and Vincent Arenas.\n\nNO KENOSHA OFFICERS TO FACE CHARGES IN JACOB BLAKE SHOOTING, PROSECUTORS SAY\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass, said that the hypocrisy of the decision is maddening\n\nWe must legislate justice and accountability-for Jacob Blake and so many others.\n\nWhen will this stop? Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., tweeted. You can't reform a system that is centered on oppression and anti-Blackness.\n\nAnd in another post she wrote: 7 bullets in his back in front of his family and kids, still paralyzed from the waist down. Nothing.\n\nRep. Mondaire Jones, D-N.Y., said after thousands took the streets to demand that #BlackLivesMatter in 2020, we begin 2021 with a shameful reminder that our criminal legal system was not designed for people who look like Jacob Blake and me.\n\nRep. Mark Pocan, a Wisconsin Democrat, also issued a statement on the ruling, calling the decision a complete failure by the justice system.\n\nJacob Blake was shot at by Kenosha police 7 times in front of his children — this officer should have been charged, Pocan wrote. Jacob Blake & his family deserve justice.\n\nDemocratic Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers said that Wisconsin and the rest of the United States have witnessed a movement demanding justice, equity, and peace for Black lives and that the state and nation has failed to deliver on these promises.\n\nJacob Blake's life has forever been changed and his kids witnessed violence no kid should ever see, experienced trauma no kid should ever endure, all while the world watched, Evers said. And yet, when presented the opportunity to rise to this moment and this movement and take action to provide meaningful, commonsense reform to enhance accountability and promote transparency in policing in our state, elected officials took no action.\n\nEvers added that the ruling is further evidence that we must work each in earnest towards a more just, more fair and more equitable state and country, and to combat the racism experienced by Black Wisconsinites.\n\nI hope for peace and justice for Jacob, his family, and the entire Kenosha community. I reaffirm my commitment to action to build a more just, more equitable state for every Wisconsinite, he concluded. And I ask those who will exercise their right to assemble tonight and in the days ahead to please do so peacefully and safely.\n\nKYLE RITTENHOUSE'S MOM SAYS TEEN GUNMAN WAS 'HELPING PEOPLE' IN KENOSHA\n\nBlake's attorney, Ben Crump, said in a statement on Twitter that they are immensely disappointed and feel this decision failed not only Jacob and his family but the community that protested and demanded justice.\n\nThis isn't the news we hoped for, but our work is not done and hope is not lost. We must broaden the fight for justice on behalf of Jacob Blake and the countless other Black victims of racial injustice and police brutality, Crump continued. We will continue to press forward with our own investigation and fight for systemic change in policing and transparency at all levels. We urge Americans to continue to raise their voices and demand change in peaceful and positive ways during this emotional time.\n\nMeanwhile, Jacob Blake Sr. said he was not surprised by Tuesday's announcement.\n\nWe must abolish the right for policemen to be seen on a higher plane than citizens of the United States, he said from Chicago while surrounded by supporters, including Rev.

President Trump is closing the year by increasing his already transformative impact on the federal judiciary, with 13 of his district court nominees receiving confirmation this month.\n\nThat brings Trump's total to 102 federal judges confirmed in 2019. Over the course of his administration, that total jumps to 187, including 50 to circuit courts of appeal and two Supreme Court justices.\n\nON CUSP OF IMPEACHMENT, TRUMP ENDS YEAR WITH SPREE OF ACCOMPLISHMENTS\n\nIn terms of quality and quantity, we are going to be just about No. 1 by the time we finish -- No. 1 of any president, any administration, Trump said in early November, noting that George Washington may have technically appointed more judges. At the time, he was celebrating his 150th federal judge.\n\nThe 9th Circuit in particular, which Trump has railed against as a big thorn in our side in the past due to its liberal bent, has seen a dramatic change in its makeup over the past three years, with 10 of its 29 active seats now being held by Trump appointees, and nearly half being held by appointees of Republican administrations.\n\nMuch of this is thanks to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has helped push nominees through the Senate, even while combatting House Democrats as they impeach the president.\n\nMy motto for the remainder of this Congress is 'leave no vacancy behind,' McConnell told Hugh Hewitt in a Wednesday radio interview.\n\nTRUMP NEARS NEW MILESTONE WITH JUDICIAL APPOINTMENTS\n\nThe relentless pace means that more than a quarter of all federal appeals court judges were nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Republican-controlled Senate. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats are doing everything we can to slow down the judicial train, but they changed the rules,″ referring to McConnell reducing the amount of debate time for a nominee from 30 hours to just two.\n\nWhile all eyes were understandably on impeachment, Mitch McConnell's conveyor belt churned out a shocking number of judges this week in what remains the most underrated story of the Trump era,″ said Christopher Kang, chief counsel at liberal advocacy group Demand Justice.\n\nSchumer blasted Trump's picks, telling The Associated Press that they are are just so bad for the average American in so many ways, due to their hard right stance. McConnell, however, said that judges who follow a strict interpretation of the law instead of taking an activist approach are good for everyone.\n\nIt is not one party or the other that benefits when our federal courts consist of men and women who understand that a judge's job is to follow the law, not to make the law,″ he said on the Senate floor last week. The entire country benefits from that. Our constitutional system benefits from that.\n\nCarrie Severino, policy director for the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, described Trump's selections as the kind of judge America wants, claiming that the ability to select judges for lifetime positions is a significant part of why Trump was elected in 2016.\n\nAs Trump faces impeachment and a reelection bid in 2020, the impact of his judicial selections will be felt long after his presidency ends, regardless of whether he serves one term or two.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, wrote in a Fox News opinion piece last month that Trump's achievement in this area was historic, referencing Texans confirmed to the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, as well as Supreme Court Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.\n\nFew legacies will be longer lasting than this judicial one, he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Despite this week's controversy swirling around the personal lives of some of its creators, Green Book remains among the year's best films, and worth seeing for its essential message.\n\nLast Sunday the film took several awards at the Golden Globes, including three wins for best supporting actor, best screenplay, and best motion picture, musical or comedy.\n\nThe film, which takes its name from The Negro Motorist Green Book, a guide by postal worker Victor Hugo Green to advise fellow African-Americans on how to travel safely in the segregated South, has received mixed reviews from American critics, some of whom feel it oversimplifies or glosses over racial issues. But clearly the international press, which comprises the Hollywood Foreign Press Association and chooses who wins the Golden Globes, sees the film as something special.\n\n'GREEN BOOK' WRITER, PRODUCER NICK VALLELONGA APOLOGIZES FOR 9/11 TWEET\n\nGreen Book tells the story of a real-life friendship between Tony Lip Vallelonga, a white, Italian-American bouncer from Brooklyn, played by Viggo Mortensen, and Dr. Don Shirley, a brilliant black jazz musician, played by Mahershala Ali, as they traverse the racially segregated American South in the early '60's.\n\nThere's an old adage: A stranger comes a while, and sees a mile, meaning that sometimes people can't clearly see for themselves, or possible solutions to their problems, while a stranger who comes with fresh eyes can see at a glance.\n\nCould it be that some Americans are missing something foreign critics – who are perhaps not so immersed as some Americans in identity politics – can see more clearly?\n\nNamely: as we hunker down in our respective tribes, too often we neglect to connect as human beings.\n\nAmerica in 2019 is a place of political correctness, of marches and banners, of hundreds of thousands assembled to push back against hate – and few real conversations that involve deeply listening to anyone on the other side of complex issues.\n\nInstead, we flatter ourselves that we are politically engaged by inciting social media scraps with people we don't actually speak with, and whose hands we will never clasp.\n\nDoes America in 2019 remain in some ways a voluntarily segregated country?\n\nAccording to a 2015 study by Pew Research Center, only one in 10 American adults said they have a lot in common with those who do not share their own racial background.\n\nNow, there's a difference between acquaintanceship and authentic friendship; saying hello to an African-American barista at Starbucks or waving to a Jewish neighbor doesn't automatically inoculate you from being prejudiced. But real friendship can help overcome prejudice.\n\nDoes America in 2019 remain in some ways a voluntarily segregated country?\n\nIn an early scene in Green Book, Vallelonga's character is shown as so racist he throws away two glasses because they'd been used by black workers making repairs to his kitchen.\n\nBy the end of the film (spoiler alert), after he and Shirley have confronted challenges, shared secrets, and leaned on one another in various ways, he welcomes his friend to break bread with his family.\n\nThis Christmas scene and many developments leading up to it illustrate the difference between acquaintanceship and friendship. With the former, prejudice can more easily be hidden. But when you share life struggles, when you confide in each other and break bread together, you become friends.\n\nBecause true friendship requires respect, and the recognition of each other as equals, it is the antithesis of prejudice.\n\nSome critics have pointed out that Green Book, which was co-written by the real-life Vallelonga's son Nick, is told more from the white character's point of view. Others criticize the film as a feel-good trifle that does nothing to challenge societal inequities that promote racism and division.\n\nExperts in the field of race say that, while we should be cautious about the potential for oversimplification, Green Book has value as an opportunity to open dialogue.\n\nWe can get caught up in the controversy about whether the film is an account of the white man's view of the friendship, which it is, and whether the story would have been different had Shirley told it, which it would have, said Dr. Henry Louis Taylor, Jr., professor of history and urban and regional planning at SUNY Buffalo, who specializes in the black experience in the U.S. But that doesn't matter as much as the larger question, 'What is the place of individual friendship within the process of social change?'\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFriendship makes empathy possible, so it can be a gateway to understanding each other, and a film like this can illustrate this truth, said Thembi Dube, a Manhattan financial analyst who was born in Durban, South Africa and whose late father, Dr. Fred Dube, a professor of psychology and expert on racism, fought apartheid. The men in this story grew to be friends and commonalities emerged. That basis in personal respect made the knowing, and the growing, possible.\n\nFull disclosure: Thembi Dube is my friend, we hold different political views, and an exercise in deep listening and respectful conversation inspired this column.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE ON 'GREEN BOOK'
While the nation awaited the results of Georgia's two U.S. Senate races Tuesday night, Rep. Chris Pappas, D-N.H., put forward a list of Democratic goals that could potentially be accomplished if their party has control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nIf Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock win their races against incumbent Republican Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Democrats and Republicans would each hold 50 seats in the Senate, with Democrats holding the tie-breaker vote with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. This, plus a House majority and a Democratic White House would give the party the potential to check a number of items off their agenda.\n\nGEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIAL WHO SLAMMED TRUMP'S VOTER FRAUD CLAIMS SAYS HE'LL VOTE FOR GOP SENATE CANDIDATES\n\nFlipping the Senate would be huge to get votes on popular bills blocked by Mitch McConnell, Pappas tweeted. He went on to list several items including $2,000 stimulus checks, infrastructure, action related to climate change, the DREAM Act, and voting rights. America needs this, he added.\n\nSEN. RON JOHNSON VOWS TO INVESTIGATE 2020 ELECTION RESULTS IF GOP KEEPS SENATE MAJORITY\n\nPappas blamed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., for standing in the way of efforts to achieve these goals, but if Republicans lose their majority he would no longer have the power he currently wields.\n\nDemocrats have called for passing new voting rights legislation since the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidated portions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 dealing with federal oversight of certain jurisdictions. The House passed a bill in 2019 that would have restored what the Supreme Court eliminated, but the Senate did not bring it to a vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMost recently, McConnell blocked a vote on $2,000 stimulus checks to Americans even though President Trump urged lawmakers to make them a reality. McConnell and other Republicans had already agreed to $600 payments and believed that a more targeted approach to assisting Americans during the coronavirus pandemic and ensuing shutdowns was preferable to sending money to everyone, including those who did not suffer losses.
LeBron James might be in the market for his own WNBA team.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers star tweeted early Wednesday morning that he was interested in putting together an ownership group to purchase the Atlanta Dream from Republican senator and co-owner of the team Kelly Loeffler shortly after she was projected to lose her seat to Democrat Raphael Warnock in the Georgia Senate runoff on Tuesday.\n\nBECKY HAMMON TAKING OVER AS COACH FOR SPURS 'WASN'T A BIG DEAL' FOR GREGG POPOVICH\n\nLoeffler purchased the team along with Atlanta businesswoman Mary Brock in 2011, but according to ESPN, she is not involved with the team's daily operations and stepped down from her seat on the WNBA board of governors in October 2019.\n\nIt's not clear how serious James' offer is to take over ownership but it would likely be supported by the franchise and others in the league who have criticized Loeffler's response to the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThe NBA and the WNBA devoted their seasons over the summer to shining a spotlight on the movement and in July, Loeffler publicly spoke out against the league's decision.\n\nI adamantly oppose the Black Lives Matter political movement, which has advocated for the defunding of police, called for the removal of Jesus from churches and the disruption of the nuclear family structure, harbored anti-Semitic views, and promoted violence and destruction across the country, she said at the time, according to USA Today.\n\nShe also told ESPN in an interview in July that the movement did not align with the message.\n\nThe statement 'Black lives matter' is very different than the organization Black Lives Matter, she said. I think we all agree the life of every African American is important.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLoeffler has not indicated what she plans to do with her share of the team but the players have made it clear that they wouldn't mind a change in ownership.\n\nIn August, they wore shirts supporting her opponent. Forward Elizabeth Williams told The New York Times that the team felt as if Loeffler was using them for political gain.\n\nWhen we realized what our owner was doing and how she was kind of using us and the Black Lives Matter movement for her political gain, we felt like we didn't want to feel kind of lost as the pawns in this.
Quentin Grimes scored 20 of his 22 points in the second half as No. 11 Houston rallied for a 70-63 win over Wichita State on Wednesday night.\n\nAfter shooting 1 of 6 from the field in the first half, Grimes was 5 of 11 in the second half, including 4 of 6 on 3-pointers. He also had nine rebounds.\n\nWe knew in the first half that we came out with a lack of energy, Grimes said. I knew in the second half that I needed to assert myself and be in attack mode at all times to make sure to get us going and to make sure we went out there in the second half and got the win.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nJustin Gorham added 14 points and 10 rebounds, and DeJon Jarreau finished with 13 points, 10 rebounds and five assists for Houston (9-1, 4-1 American Athletic Conference). Marcus Sasser scored 12 for the Cougars, who shot 38% overall, 46% in the second half.\n\nThat's two straight games we've been really good offensively in the second half, Houston coach Kelvin Sampson said. We scored 45 in the second half. ... A lot of our problems in the first half had a lot to do with Wichita State. Give them some credit. Their kids really fought and played hard. Our program has a reputation. We're going to get everybody's best shot.\n\nTyson Etienne had 25 points and eight rebounds, and Dexter Dennis scored 18 points for the Shockers (6-3, 2-1), whose five-game winning streak ended.\n\nWe just couldn't put it together for 40 minutes and defend in the second half, Wichita State interim coach Isaac Brown said. To give up 45 points in the second half, that's not good basketball.\n\nThe Shockers shot 34%, including 8 of 26 on 3-pointers.\n\nI think our offense affected our defense, Brown said. There's going to be nights where you can't make shots.\n\nAfter the Shockers opened up a 35-25 lead on two free throws by Dennis with 18:44 remaining, Houston responded with a 16-0 run to take a six-point lead on two free throws by Grimes with 13 minutes left. Grimes had seven points during the surge.\n\nThe Shockers got as close as 48-44 on a 3-pointer by Dennis with 8:44 remaining, but the Cougars pulled away with a 12-2 run to open up a 14-point lead on consecutive 3-pointers by Grimes with 5:44 left.\n\nOur defense was so good in the second half, Sampson said. We were really, really good, and we guarded them. Second half was good at both ends. The first half, they were more aggressive than we were.\n\nWichita State led 31-25 at the half behind eight points from Etienne.\n\nBIG PICTURE\n\nWichita State: The Shockers were able to open up the double-digit lead because they took care of the ball, committing three turnovers in the first half, but the Shockers committed four turnovers during Houston's decisive run and finished with 11.\n\nHouston: The Cougars won their sixth straight against Wichita State. Houston owned a 26-16 advantage in points in the paint and committed 10 turnovers, which the Shockers turned into 16 points.\n\nHE SAID IT\n\nWe always play good defense. That's why we're ranked in the top 10 defensive teams in the nation. We just don't always shoot it good. It may change; it may not. I don't know. Our goal is not to be great statistically; our goal is to win. We have to find ways to win. — Sampson.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nWichita State: Hosts Cincinnati on Sunday.\n\nHouston: Hosts Tulane on Saturday.
To someone who loves this country, it is almost inconceivable that Georgia voters have elected to send Raphael Warnock to the United States Senate. Democrat Warnock, a Black preacher who has thundered from the pulpit that America must repent for its worship of whiteness, has edged out Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler to win one of two Senate seats up for grabs in run-off elections. The other race, between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican incumbent Sen. David Perdue, is as yet too close to call.\n\nThe politics of envy and grievance – of class warfare and racial hostilities -- have won out over messages of hope, prosperity and opportunity for all. How could this happen?\n\nSimply put, Republicans did not turn out in the numbers needed to beat an energized Democrat campaign. A campaign that was funded by massive contributions from liberals across the nation, spurred by dreams of a progressive future; a future driven by the prospect that taking control of the senate would allow them, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said, to change the world.\n\nThe liberal media will be quick to blame President Trump, and indeed he bears some responsibility. Though he made two trips to the Peach State to stump for the GOP candidates, and just the night before the vote held an energizing rally for thousands of supporters, he also muddied the waters with ongoing charges of election fraud and by picking fights with Georgia officials.\n\n5 TAKEAWAYS FROM GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nWeeks ago angry Trump backers in Georgia began a #BoycottTheVote campaign; local polling done in late December showed Out of 691 registered voters polled in the survey of 800 Georgians, 78 said they were not likely to vote. Of those 78, the split broke 32% Republican to 25% Democrat. Those disaffected Republicans were somehow convinced that not voting in the senate races would punish those who had stolen the presidential race from Donald Trump in November.\n\nInstead, that voter boycott will punish the nation.\n\nAlso, in the run-up to the election, the release of a phone call in which Trump exhorted Georgia Secretary of State to find 11,780 votes to give him the state likely turned off a number of Republican voters fed up with our mercurial president. Exit polls indicate that 63% of self-described moderates voted for Warnock, whose agenda does not promise moderation.\n\nWARNOCK PROJECTED TO DEFEAT LOEFFLER IN GEORGIA RUNOFF\n\nThe contest became a referendum on President Trump, whipping up the same anger that drove President-elect Joe Biden to win on November 3. This did not have to happen.\n\nThe race in Georgia should have been a referendum on the Democrats' agenda. Voters should have chosen between GOP policies that have built our country up, creating jobs and opportunities, versus Democrat policies that aim to punish successful Americans. Policies that protect traditional rights and freedoms versus those that allow a censorious mob to decide what Americans can or cannot say. Policies that aim to make all neighborhoods safe, including those populated largely by minorities, versus attempts to defund the police and let criminals out of jail.\n\nHOUSE DEM POSTS LEGISLATIVE WISH LIST WHILE AWAITING GEORGIA SENATE RESULTS\n\nDemocrats appealed to the 32% of the electorate that is Black in Georgia, running on righting the purported racism that has in their view held back progress for that segment of the nation. Exit polls show 92% of Blacks voted for Warnock, pastor of the storied Atlanta church once co-pastored alongside his father by Martin Luther King, Jr.\n\nThose voters shrugged off allegations of domestic abuse made by Warnock's wife and a history of lauding the controversial Black minister Rev. Jeremiah Wright, whose infamous God Damn America sermon rattled the first campaign of President Obama, who attended Wright's church.\n\nInstead, they warmed to Warnock's alarms about police brutality and promises of criminal justice reform. Warnock hewed closely to the platform of President-elect Joe Biden, with vague promises about investing in infrastructure, investing in climate and in education; if voters wonder where the money will come from to fund these initiatives, a visit to his campaign website will not satisfy their curiosity. There is, understandably, no mention of taxes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn reviewing the Georgia election, critics will rightly award the liberal media a starring role. The press acted as apologists for both Rafael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, instead of reporters.\n\nFor example, after an ad from Kelly Loeffler highlighted Warnock's domestic abuse issues, a fact-check from a CBS affiliate ran with a story titled Warnock's character questioned in dredged up bodycam of dispute with ex-wife. The term dredged up suggests that the footage of the dispute with his ex-wife was from the distant past, and that resurfacing it was somehow underhanded. Not so, on either count. The video is from March, and the confrontation involved the police.\n\nOther news outfits explained Warnock's endorsement of Jeremiah Wright and other disturbing messages, which the Democrat senator-elect calls truth-telling. An admiring piece in the New York Times, for instance, notes that Loeffler's campaign used his sermons to try and paint him as a 'radical' — and their claims have often been labeled by fact checkers as misleading. That, even as the Times acknowledges that Warnock has written that white churches had been active and complicit participants in slavery, segregation and other manifestations of white supremacy.\n\nGeorgia's Senate runoff contests were viewed by left and right as critical to the future direction of the country. Republicans see Democrat control of the senate possibly leading to fundamental and damaging changes in our nation. Given the chance, Democrats may push to change the Electoral College, pack the Supreme Court, allow Puerto Rico and Washington D.C. to become states and other measures that would guarantee one-party rule and pave a progressive pathway to the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGeorgia voters have made a terrible choice. If Jon Ossoff beats David Perdue, handing control of the Senate to New York Democrat Chuck Schumer and, consequently, all three branches of our government to Democrats, the damage will be complete.\n\nAs for President Trump, his reputation and his extraordinary support among Republicans, as well as his chances of running in 2024, have been dealt a serious blow.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LIZ PEEK
What a difference a week makes: In the span of seven days, with bookend visits to Iowa and New Hampshire, Elizabeth Warren established herself as the early front runner for the Democratic nomination in 2020.\n\nAn early announcement and early visits to the first two primary states has left everyone else considering a run in her rear view mirror for now. Warren's successful visits have established the benchmark by which every other candidate will be measured. And the bar is high. In the metrics that matter – money, message, organization, crowds, and performance – it's hard to imagine a better week for her.\n\nBut, what makes Warren a formidable candidate is her message. You can draw a straight line from her childhood in a home struggling financially due to her father's illness, her mother going to work for the first time in a minimum wage job at the age of 50 to save their home, and the influence that's had on Warren both personally and professionally.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN IN NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR EARLY PRESIDENTIAL PITCH\n\nWarren uses her family's struggles to discuss what working families confront today. Warren's mother's minimum wage job could save her family home from foreclosure. Not today. Why? Warren points to the way the rules are written in Washington that benefit the rich and powerful and not working families. One set of rules for the rich and one set for everyone else.\n\nWarren's response is the need for systemic change to reform both government and politics to place more power in the hands of the people – not the powerful. She acknowledges that change is hard but that it's a fight that must be waged and can be won because she's done it her whole life.\n\nBorn and raised in Oklahoma, this daughter of a custodian became a teacher, a lawyer, a professor, she established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and then was elected a U.S. Senator. Warren's life is her track record. And she believes everyone deserves the chance she's had to do the same.\n\nDream big and fight hard to make our country work for everyone. That's Warren's message. It's the same message she delivered about the Great Recession in 2008, running for the Senate in 2012 and re-election in 2018. It was the same message in Iowa last week and when I saw her in New Hampshire Saturday. Throughout her speech in the New Hampshire city of Manchester, you could hear people agreeing with her as she spoke and giving her a standing ovation when she finished – 600 people who are just starting to look for a candidate to support.\n\nIn many ways Warren's message sounds like Donald Trump or Bernie Sanders in 2016. The difference is Warren has actually worked to make life better and more fair for working families – unlike Trump and Sanders.\n\nTrump said during his campaign he would make life better for working families, but his actions have instead made life much better for the one percent thanks to massive tax cuts that have exploded the deficit and reduced the revenues for the federal government. Fewer regulations for corporations and more tariffs have made life much tougher for working families who work more, make less, and pay more for food, goods, appliances, and automobiles (thanks to the Trump tariffs).\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSanders, like Trump, has talked a good game but never managed to get anything done in his congressional career that helped working families, or anyone for that matter. While Warren doesn't mention either one by name in her speeches – and there is a real chance that neither one of them will run in 2020 – the contrast couldn't be more clear.\n\nNo one has prepared more to run for president in 2020 than Warren. It shows in every measure that matters big and small. While January 2019 is too early to say who will take the oath of president of the United States in January 2021, it would be a mistake to underestimate Elizabeth Warren. She is a formidable candidate with the drive, organization, resources, and message to run the distance. And she's off to a great start.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM MARY ANNE MARSH
WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday dismissed a last-gasp lawsuit led by a House Republican that aimed to give Vice President Mike Pence the power to overturn the results of the presidential election won by Joe Biden when Congress formally counts the Electoral College votes next week.\n\nPence, as president of the Senate, will oversee the session Wednesday and declare the winner of the White House race. The Electoral College this month cemented Biden's 306-232 victory, and multiple legal efforts by President Donald Trump's campaign to challenge the results have failed.\n\nThe suit named Pence, who has a largely ceremonial role in next week's proceedings, as the defendant and asked the court to throw out the 1887 law that spells out how Congress handles the vote counting. It asserted that the vice president may exercise the exclusive authority and sole discretion in determining which electoral votes to count for a given State.\n\nPENCE, HOUSE SEEK TO DISMISS GOHMERT-GOP SUIT AIMED AT OVERTURNING ELECTION\n\nIn dismissing the lawsuit filed by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, and a group of Republican electors from Arizona, Texas U.S. District Judge Jeremy Kernodle, a Trump appointee, wrote that the plaintiffs allege an injury that is not fairly traceable to Pence, and is unlikely to be redressed by the requested relief.\n\nThe Justice Department represented Pence in a case that aimed to find a way to keep his boss, President Donald Trump, in power. In a court filing in Texas on Thursday, the department said the plaintiffs have sued the wrong defendant — if, in fact, any of those suing actually have a judicially cognizable claim.\n\nThe department said, in effect, that the suit objects to long-standing procedures laid out in law, not any actions that Vice President Pence has taken, so he should not be the target of the suit.\n\nA suit to establish that the Vice President has discretion over the count, filed against the Vice President, is a walking legal contradiction, the department argued.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump, the first president to lose a reelection bid in almost 30 years, has attributed his defeat to widespread voter fraud. But a range of nonpartisan election officials and Republicans has confirmed there was no fraud in the November contest that would change the results of the election. That includes former Attorney General William Barr, who said he saw no reason to appoint a special counsel to look into the president's claims about the 2020 election. He resigned from his post last week.\n\nTrump and his allies have filed roughly 50 lawsuits challenging election results, and nearly all have been dismissed or dropped. He's also lost twice at the Supreme Court.
You should just kill yourself because you're so fat.\n\nThat was my life at 13 years old -- right before one of my classmates began punching me and hitting me with a chair because I didn't meet society's expectations of what my waist size should be.\n\nObesity is something I have struggled with my entire life. It has caused me more pain and heartache than I knew was possible.\n\nREAD MORE FROM HARRY KAZIANIS HERE\n\nGrowing up, I had very few friends and was constantly bullied because of my weight. And as I moved into adulthood my weight kept climbing upward, reaching 265 pounds -- and I am only 5-foot-6.\n\nThe statistics tell me I am not alone. Being overweight is a challenge that one in three Americans struggle with.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat struggle for me was always toughest this time of year, with the headlines filled with tips on how to complete what always seems like an impossible task: a New Year's resolution of trying to lose weight.\n\nThe good news is that you don't need to let another year pass by, disappointed that you didn't drop those extra pounds. There is a path forward to achieving not only a healthier relationship with food but also defeating obesity.\n\nI am proof that you can do it: I was able to lose nearly 80 pounds in 2018, fulfilling my New Year's pledge of trying to live a healthier lifestyle while conquering my obesity problem.\n\nMy journey began last spring -- quite unintentionally -- when I decided it was time to find a primary care physician. I was starting to suffer from the serious side effects of being overweight. My knees and joints were starting to hurt, I was suffering from sleep apnea and just simple tasks like walking were becoming difficult.\n\nI also faced another obstacle unique to my occupation: a Washington culture of colleagues and associates who love to do business over lunch -- and I was never the guy to pick a salad.\n\nWhen I explained this during my first appointment with a D.C.-based physician, I hit the jackpot: one of his specializations was weight loss. He spent an hour quizzing me on what I ate daily, how I ate, when I ate and my overall relationship with food.\n\nAnd then it hit me. Just as we reached the end, I realized something about myself that made me feel ashamed. Food had stopped being food for me. It had become some sort of emotional crutch.\n\nI knew where the conversation was going, so I just figured I would save the doctor the time. I have a problem, I said. When I am stressed, tired, angry, upset or just generally need comfort, I want food.\n\nThe doctor looked at me and smiled ever so slightly. Yes, you have all of the classic signs of food addiction.\n\nWhether it was intentional or not, the physician's question-and-answer session made me see the problem for myself, slowly revealing why I reached the weight I had.\n\nThe numbers the doctor revealed were shocking. For example: I was consuming 2,000 calories a day in coffee creamer alone! My average daily caloric intake topped out on average at over 6,000! And worst of all, most of my eating was tied to times of the day or week when I was stressed out, looking for some sort of comfort or escape.\n\nI literally felt like I had been sucker punched. I put my head down for a moment, deeply disappointed in myself, feeling almost powerless. I wanted to cry. I wanted to scream. I wanted to run -- all at the same time.\n\nBut I also knew, deep down, that there was a way out, that saying this all out loud and admitting my problem was the first step. I knew finding a solution and sticking with it wouldn't be easy, but I knew I had no choice but to try.\n\nHere is where things got even harder, as I had a bigger motivation to lose weight. My wife suffers from kidney failure, and she will most likely need a transplant in the next few years. And while I am not a match to give her one of my kidneys directly, there are swap programs where I could donate my kidney to someone's spouse or family member who would then give their matching kidney to my wife. But if I am overweight, I would not be eligible -- endangering her life.\n\nThat wasn't going to happen. While I can't guarantee how I tackled my weight will work for everyone -- and I am certainly not a licensed medical professional -- I can share my approach that helped me drop from a waist size of 42 down to a 33.\n\nThe foundation of my weight loss was accepting a basic concept: food is not for pleasure or to escape your problems -- it's fuel. Nothing more.\n\nThat was hard for me to accept at first, especially as I started looking at the environment around me. I felt set up to fail right from the start, considering the countless fast-food restaurants, the easily accessible high-calorie drinks at Starbucks, or just the generally unhealthy but easily accessible food that surrounds us.\n\nI also faced another obstacle unique to my occupation: a Washington culture of colleagues and associates who love to do business over lunch -- and I was never the guy to pick a salad.\n\nThinking all of this through when I started this journey in early May, I knew the secret to my success would be making smart food choices consistently -- and this has been my secret weapon. To this day, when I sit down to eat a meal, I think clearly and carefully about the choices before me.\n\nI can honestly say it is this simple task that has been the biggest reason for my success: consistently making a series of good choices all day that leads to days, weeks, months – and I hope years – of what will end up being a sustained healthy weight and lifestyle.\n\nIn making those smart food choices I had to say goodbye to many of those foods we all love. That meant no more ice cream, soda, candy, anything with high amounts of sugar, pizza, fast-food, heavy creamers in coffee. I scaled back the amount of bread I ate and limited myself to smaller portion sizes during breakfast, lunch and dinner. Just doing that in the first two weeks I lost almost 10 pounds!\n\nREAD MORE ABOUT WEIGHT LOSS ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nFrom there, I made sure I ate three balanced meals, usually at the same times every day, creating a consistent routine that I pledged to stick to.\n\nFor breakfast I have a coffee (fat-free creamer and no-calorie sweetener) with a breakfast bar. Lunch is usually a salad (low-calorie dressing and not in excess) or small sandwich with no mayo and I only eat about three-fourths of the bread (wheat bread, and making sure I avoid high-carb wraps). Dinner usually consists of 6-8 ounces of meat, mixed vegetables or greens, and either some rice or potato and sometimes a small side salad.\n\nI don't count calories, but I do look at the calorie counts on menus, helping me eat in a common-sense sort of way -- an awareness I never had before. When I begin to feel the smallest inkling of being full, I know it's time to stop. A small dessert is OK, maybe a bite-size cookie or a cup of hot chocolate -- but never in excess and never more than a few bites and only occasionally.\n\nNow, I want to be honest: have I slipped up? Maybe eaten in excess from time to time, or snuck a donut or Hershey bar? Sure. But I don't beat myself up over it, I don't consider myself a failure. I think about why I made that bad choice and do my best not to make it again. And, over time, because I did not obsess over those little hiccups, most days the choices I make are good ones -- and they have paid off.\n\nI can't say that the way I lost weight will work for everyone. But taking a long, hard look at what you eat and how you eat and focusing on making the best possible choices when you head to the grocery store or head out to a restaurant can make a big difference.\n\nThere are no secrets here. From that simple starting point, you can change your health for the better and lose those extra pounds. If it worked for me, it can work for anyone.

We'll ask our Sunday panel about the\n\nlast-ditch effort to overturn the results.\n\n\n\nAll, right now, on FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBAIER (on camera): And hello again and happy New Year from FOX News, today\n\nin Atlanta. We are live from Georgia International Plaza for the battle for\n\nthe Senate.\n\n\n\nTwo runoff races two days from now that will determine the balance of power\n\nin Washington. If both Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, win,\n\ntheir party will control the House, the Senate, and the White House. If\n\neither Republican Kelly Loeffler or David Perdue is reelected, Mitch\n\nMcConnell would retain control and be able to block much of the Biden\n\nadministration's agenda. A record 3 million Georgians have already cast\n\ntheir votes in these crucial races.\n\n\n\nMeantime, President Trump continues to cast doubt on the legitimacy of\n\nGeorgia's election system after losing the state to Joe Biden. In a moment,\n\nwe'll speak with one of the Republican candidates, incumbent Senator Kelly\n\nLoeffler.\n\n\n\nBut first, to Peter Doocy in Savannah with the closing arguments on the\n\ncampaign trail -- Peter.\n\n\n\nPETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Bret, early voting data shows\n\nRepublicans will need a strong showing north of Atlanta, so that's where\n\nPresident Trump is going tomorrow and Democrats are going to try to run up\n\nthe score in Atlanta, so that's where Joe Biden is going, but first, a\n\nvisit by Kamala Harris here in Savannah.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: But see, now Georgia has the opportunity to define the next\n\nchapter in American history.\n\n\n\nDOOCY (voice-over): Republican candidates agree, but for different\n\nreasons.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: We're going to show America that Georgia is a red state, we're\n\ngoing to stop socialism and we're going to save this country.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: In one runoff, Republican Kelly Loeffler faces Democrat Raphael\n\nWarnock.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Dangerous, radical Raphael Warnock has not answered for\n\ninvestigations into child abuse, domestic abuse.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Warnock argues recent allegations are irrelevant.\n\n\n\nWARNOCK: Kelly Loeffler doesn't have a case to make for why she should be\n\nsitting in that seat.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: And the other runoff, the Republican David Perdue, is quarantining\n\nafter her close contact with a COVID-19-infected staffer but still accusing\n\nDemocrat Jon Ossoff of hiding transactions with a business linked to China.\n\n\n\nPERDUE: This is a ripening scandal, as we now know. He -- he is involved\n\nwith the communist Chinese party during his primary.\n\n\n\nDOOCY: Ossoff claims David Perdue is the corrupt one.\n\n\n\nOSSOFF: We have two United States senators who, when they learned about\n\nthe threat that COVID-19 posed to their own constituents, their first call\n\nwas to their broker.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDOOCY (on camera): Campaigns are trying hard to stick with people that\n\nthey come across. For example, yesterday at a campus launch, organizers\n\nsent volunteers away with this chant. Door knock for Warnock, vote your\n\nOss-off -- Bret.\n\n\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. Peter Doocy reporting from Savannah -- Peter, thanks.\n\n\n\nJoining me here now, Senator Kelly Loeffler.\n\n\n\nGood morning, Senator. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\nSEN. KELLY LOEFFLER (R-GA): Good morning. Great to be with you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We should point out. We invited your opponent, Raphael Warnock, on\n\nas well. He declined.\n\n\n\nThank you for being here.\n\n\n\nIt's a little cold for Atlanta.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's okay, it's going to warm up.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, that's right.\n\n\n\nSenator, you've been all over the state since November 3rd. And, you -- we\n\nare now two days from this runoff. As we mentioned, more than 3 million\n\nGeorgians have already voted.\n\n\n\nWhere did you and your team see this race right now?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Bret, Georgians are fired up. They are ready to get\n\nout and vote on Tuesday because they know the future of the country is on\n\nthe ballot here in Georgia. It's a choice. It's a stark contrast between\n\nthe freedoms, our way of life here in Georgia, or socialism, government\n\ncontrol.\n\n\n\nWe know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going\n\nto take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is\n\nnot just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run\n\nhealth care. But he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of\n\nchange.\n\n\n\nRadical liberal Raphael Warnock is my opponent. He is someone that would\n\nfundamentally change this country. His values are out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: We are going to talk about that in a minute.\n\n\n\nAre you worried about Republican turnout because of the current ongoing\n\nchallenge to the election?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, Republicans, Democrats, everyone, they need to know\n\nthat we can trust this process that we are working hard to make sure that\n\nthis is a fair, trusted election. We have 8,000 poll watchers.\n\n\n\nBut from what I've seen as I've crisscrossed the state nonstop over the\n\nlast nine weeks, Georgians are fired up to vote and we've seen that in\n\nearly voting. Three million votes shattering records for previous runoffs\n\nand we know that on Tuesday, just two days away here, we are going to see a\n\nrecord turnout for this runoff election and I'm confident that we will win\n\nif our voters turnout.\n\n\n\nBAIER: This weekend, Senator Ted Cruz campaigned for you. He and ten other\n\nRepublican senators and senators-elect say they will join Senator Josh\n\nHawley in a vote against certifying Electoral College votes if there isn't\n\nan audit of disputed states votes, including this one. Now, you are not on\n\nthat list.\n\n\n\nWhy not?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I've said from the start, everything is on the table here,\n\nand I'm seriously looking at that. We have to make sure that Georgia and\n\nall of Americans trust our voting process. But my number one objective\n\nright now has to be winning on January 5th so that we can get to the bottom\n\nof what happened in these elections.\n\n\n\nWe know that Democrats will never get to the bottom of it. That's what\n\nwe're fighting here for, and I'm continuing to fight for this president.\n\nHe's fought for us and so we're going to stay on top of that.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So, the president says this election was stolen. In fact, he\n\ntweeted this weekend that because of how the process was done here in\n\nGeorgia, the election, including the Senate run, was, quote, illegal and\n\ninvalid.\n\n\n\nDo you agree with that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, the president has been very consistent. He came down\n\nto Georgia in December and said you have to get out and vote for David\n\nPerdue and Kelly Loeffler. You have to exercise your right to vote.\n\n\n\nHe's coming back here tomorrow night, to Dalton, Georgia, and he's going to\n\ntell voters the same thing, you have to get out and vote, Georgia, because\n\nthis is too important. The country is on the line. They are counting on us.\n\n\n\nWe won't get a second chance. If we lose this election, we could lose the\n\nfuture of the country because we know Chuck Schumer wants to abolish the\n\nfilibuster, get rid of the Electoral College, have D.C. statehood, raise\n\nour taxes, and the list goes on.\n\n\n\nGeorgians -- that's out of step with Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But I guess -- and I know you're focused on January 5th, but\n\nJanuary 6th, you have to make that decision. And so, today, can you say\n\nwhether you will certify the Electoral College votes or not, maybe\n\nspecifically from Georgia?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, I'm looking very, very closely at it, and I've been one of\n\nthe first to say, everything is on the table. I'm fighting for this\n\npresident because he's fought for us. He's our president and we are going\n\nto keep making sure that this is a fair election and I'm looking very\n\nclosely at it. But again, none of it matters if I can't win on January 5th.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right. Well, some of your other Republican colleagues have called\n\nthese overturned election efforts bad for your party, bad for the country.\n\nSenators Romney, Toomey have talked out about it. Senator Toomey releasing\n\na statement about the senator's efforts, Senators Cruz and Hawley.\n\n\n\nThey failed to acknowledge that these allegations have been adjudicated in\n\ncourtrooms across America and were found to be unsupported by evidence. I\n\nacknowledge that this past election, like all elections, had\n\nirregularities, but the evidence is overwhelming that Joe Biden won this\n\nelection.\n\n\n\nIs he right?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, we have every right to take these votes in a way\n\nthat we believe reflects our constituency and our state, and that's what\n\nI'm going to do. I'm going to speak for the people of Georgia.\n\n\n\nBut the worst thing for a party is if David Perdue and I don't win on\n\nTuesday. We have to win because we have to be able to get to that next\n\nstep, to be able to vote our conscience and what is right on January 6th,\n\nand then we have to be able to pursue holding people accountable for how\n\nthese elections were handled.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But have you seen evidence, enough evidence of fraud to overturn\n\nany state's election, as a senator and what you've seen so far?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, certainly, here in Georgia, we have upwards of 200 open\n\ninvestigations. We're in the courts right now. We have heard and seen too\n\nmuch. We need to get to the bottom of it.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: And, Senator, you know there have been 60-plus court cases that\n\nhave been -- gone before judges, some of them Trump-appointed judges, where\n\nthey haven't found that evidence.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, these cases haven't been heard. They deserve to be heard.\n\nWe need to make sure that we get to the bottom of this because the\n\nintegrity of voting is at the core of our democracy. We have to protect\n\nthat. We have to have people who are willing to fight for it and defend it,\n\nand that's what I'm looking at right now.\n\n\n\nThis is a big decision for the 6th, but I have to stay laser focused on the\n\n5th because if we don't win the 5fth, we will lose the country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Let's talk about this race, specifically our opponent. On the\n\ncampaign trail when he's pressed about anything that he's -- you know\n\nyou're charging him with, he comes back with pretty much the same attack on\n\nyou. It's very consistent. Take a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nRAPHALE WARNOCK (D), GEORGIA SENATE CANDIDATE: When she heard about the\n\ncoronavirus pandemic, she got busy making sure that she protected her own\n\nwealth. She is the wealthiest member of Congress. She dumped $3 million\n\nworth of stock, meanwhile telling you there was nothing to worry about.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, so your response to that? The direct charge that he says\n\nover and over again on the trail?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, this is a political attack that has been completely\n\ndebunked. It's a left-wing media attack, totally debunked and it's a lie.\n\nThe mainstream media continued to carry it and now they've been embarrassed\n\nbecause it's completely debunked.\n\n\n\nBAIER: So it didn't happen?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Absolutely not, and I've proven that over and over. And, look,\n\nthis is a distraction. This is -- the Democrats don't want to answer for\n\ntheir radical policies to change America.\n\n\n\nThe radical agenda of Raphael Warnock and his own -- his own facts are that\n\nhe's been involved in a child abuse investigation that he obstructed. He\n\nwas arrested for obstructing it. He's been involved in a domestic abuse. He\n\nwon't answer those questions.\n\n\n\nThat's what the mainstream media has refused to focus on. That's why I'm\n\nhaving to raise those types of questions and why has he refused to denounce\n\nMarxism and socialism? He refused to do that in our debate. He's attacked\n\nour police officers, calling them gangsters, thugs, and bullies.\n\n\n\nHe said that you can't serve God and the military. He's praised Fidel\n\nCastro, Karl Marx. And Georgians need to know who he is, because he is out\n\nof step with Georgia's values.\n\n\n\nBAIER: A lot of people look at this race and think President Trump may\n\nhave put you in Senator Perdue in a box first when he threatened to not\n\nsign the COVID stimulus and government funding and then he signed it. Then\n\nby after that demanding or calling for additional direct payments, which he\n\nthen supported, and then by vetoing the national defense bill, which you\n\noriginally supported and voted for.\n\n\n\nWhy didn't you vote on the veto override Friday in the Senate?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I stood with the president 100 percent of the time.\n\nHe's putting America first. He's fought for our men and women in the\n\nmilitary. He restored our strength in our Department of Defense and our\n\nnational security.\n\n\n\nBut, look, I have to be out across the state campaigning to make sure that\n\nGeorgians turn out and vote on January 5th because none of this will matter\n\nif we don't win on the 5th.\n\n\n\nLook, Chuck Schumer has said is going to defund our military by 25 percent.\n\nRaphael Warnock, Jon Ossoff, they would be rubber-stamps for defunding the\n\nmilitary, the police, raising taxes, ushering in government-run health\n\ncare, weakening our Second Amendment rights, opposing or religious freedom.\n\n\n\nThat's all on the ballot here in Georgia, January 5th. That's what I'm\n\nfighting for, is to preserve the future of our country.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Understanding the campaigning is important, if you're saying how\n\nimportant this election is on January 5th, but obviously, Georgia is a big\n\ndefense state, current and former military here, defense business here.\n\n\n\nHow would you have voted had you voted on that veto override?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I voted to support the NDAA. The bill that came out\n\nof conference was very different from what we've been promised. So, I don't\n\nknow. I was here in Georgia working across the state and I will continue to\n\nstand with our men and women in the military.\n\n\n\nRaphael Warnock will not stand for our military. He's attacked them. He\n\nsaid you can't serve God and serve in the military.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Right, but you would have sustained the veto, the president's veto\n\non the NDAA?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Look, what's at stake here is our military and our freedoms.\n\nThose are what's on the ballot right now.\n\n\n\nI'm the daughter and granddaughter of veterans. We're the fifth largest\n\nstate for veterans and active-duty military here in Georgia. I have fought\n\nfor our military and made sure that we get the funding we need and we are\n\ngoing to continue to do that.\n\n\n\nBut if we don't win on January 5th, our military will be defunded and\n\nworse.\n\n\n\nBAIER: I won't belabor it but that's not a yes or no whether you would\n\nsustain the veto or not.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: That's right.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK, you're not answering that.\n\n\n\nListen, Senator Joe Manchin, Democrat from West Virginia, has said voters\n\nin this runoff should not be scared that Chuck Schumer will get unlimited\n\npower because Manchin, according to him and maybe others, will not vote to\n\nkill the filibuster.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to Senator Manchin and others who are saying that?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, we know what Chuck Schumer said. He's going to take\n\nGeorgia and change America. He's told us exactly what he's going to do.\n\nHe's going to make D.C. a state, would have to go Democrat senators, it\n\nwould be impossible for Republicans to win the majority again, he would\n\nabolish the filibuster and the Electoral College. He'd structurally change\n\nthis country, pack the Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nMy opponent, radical liberal Raphael Warnock, refused to answer questions\n\nabout court packing because we know that he would pack the court with\n\nliberal justices. So it would overturn the Constitution and the rule of\n\nlaw. It would eliminate our religious freedom, free speech, everything\n\nthat's under attack right now by the left.\n\n\n\nSo we know what's at stake here in Georgia. If we lose this election, we\n\nwon't get a second chance.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senator, as a senator, you deal with a lot of different things.\n\nThis is an issue that's today. Today is the one-year anniversary of the\n\nU.S. killing Iran's most powerful general, the head of Iran's militias\n\ninside Iraq. It appears according to intelligence that Iran proxy forces\n\nare preparing to carry out more attacks on Americans.\n\n\n\nWhat should the response be if that happens?\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Well, look, I have stood with this president, the decisions he's\n\nmade to keep America safe, have done that. He's led peace deals for the\n\nfirst time in decades. He stood with Israel, stood against the dangerous\n\nJCPOA, the Iran deal, that shipped pallets of cash to Iran.\n\n\n\nSo we have to continue to be tough, secure our national defense. That's our\n\nfocus and Americans have seen that. We have been kept safe, thanks to this\n\npresident, and I'll continue to support his actions there.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And again, the president in North Georgia tomorrow.\n\n\n\nSenator, you'll be campaigning and we will be her covering it. Thank you\n\nvery much for your time.\n\n\n\nLOEFFLER: Thank you, Bret.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, we will have complete coverage Tuesday night.\n\n\n\nUp next, we'll bring in the Sunday panel to discuss what's at stake in\n\nthese runoffs.\n\n\n\nPlus, as we mentioned, a growing number of Trump allies signing on to\n\ncontest the election results -- as FOX News Sunday continues from the\n\nGeorgia International Plaza in downtown Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JOSH HAWLEY (R-MO): You've got 74 million people that feel that, A,\n\nmany of them feel they've been disenfranchised, they feel they've not been\n\nheard, and January 6th is the only opportunity that I've got to speak up\n\nfor my constituents in this process.\n\n\n\nSEN. CHRIS VAN HOLLEN (D-MD): This is just grossly responsible by Senator\n\nHawley, going and undermining even more about public confidence in our\n\ndemocratic process.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Republican Senator Josh Hawley on his plans to object to\n\ncertification of the Electoral College votes for Joe Biden on Wednesday and\n\nthen Democrat Senator Chris Van Hollen's slamming those plans.\n\n\n\nIt's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason\n\nChaffetz. Catherine Lucey, who covers the White House for The Wall Street\n\nJournal, and FOX News political analyst Juan Williams.\n\n\n\nJason, let me start with you. This is the joint statement from these GOP\n\nsenators and senators-elect. It says Congress should immediately point and\n\nelectoral commission with full investigatory and fact-finding authority to\n\nconduct an emergency ten-day audit of the election returns in the disputed\n\nstates. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission\n\n'his findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a\n\nchange in their vote if needed.\n\n\n\nYour thoughts on this move?\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Look, if they're going to ask\n\nCongress whether or not they're going to certify the results, there's no\n\nreason why members can't go out and express their own personal views on it.\n\nThat's the way we do it in this country. We have these types of debates and\n\nI think there are a lot of people in both the Senate and in the House who\n\nare concerned about it.\n\n\n\nNow, I think it's a futile attempt. I don't think it's going to pass, but I\n\ndon't think we should be afraid of the debate in the discussion, because\n\nthere are anomalies and there are things that need to be investigated and\n\nlooked at. And I have respect what these senators and members in the House\n\nare doing.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Juan, you know, you heard Senator Loeffler not really answer\n\nwhat side she'll be on as far as that vote comes down. But obviously,\n\nAttorney General Bill Barr before he left his position said he did not see\n\nenough widespread fraud to overturn any vote in any state. But the pressure\n\nis still on Trump allies.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Look, let's just take the\n\nvarnish off this, Bret. This is an effort to overturn an election and as\n\nsuch, it is doing tremendous damage to democracy. Senator Pat Toomey, the\n\nRepublican of Pennsylvania, said the essence of democracy is the people\n\nchoosing their leaders and this is an effort to undermine the people's\n\nright to choose their leadership, and they elected Joe Biden.\n\n\n\nThis is, to me, and effort that really comes down -- you know, it's\n\nshocking. You know, Jason Chaffetz says let's put the evidence out there.\n\nWhy not let people express their opinions and investigate? Well, as you\n\npointed out in your interview with Senator Loeffler, 60 courts, more than\n\n90 judges, many of them Trump-appointed judges, have looked at this and\n\nfound that there is no basis for, in fact, challenging any of these\n\nelection results no matter what small anomalies or irregularities might\n\nhave existed.\n\n\n\nNothing that would change the results of the election, but it does\n\nundermine the incoming Biden administration and it does do damage to the\n\ncredibility of our democracy. This is very serious business. If the\n\nDemocrats were doing this, the Republicans would yell treason.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Catherine, thoughts on this and the politics of this?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, Bret. I think you're\n\nabsolutely right that for a lot of senators, this really has -- and House\n\nmembers -- this has become a political moment as much as anything else.\n\nWhat we are hearing from sources on the Hill is that a lot of these members\n\nare feeling tremendous pressure from their districts, from their\n\nconstituents, from local elected officials that they need to be, you know,\n\ntaking a stand and defending the president and we know the president has\n\nbeen very vocal about his frustration with the outcome, about wanting\n\npeople to challenge it publicly, his frustration with the outcomes in the\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\nAnd so, they are feeling like they need to -- and this is -- this is sort\n\nof turning into a litmus test for your defense for the president and you're\n\nseeing people make calculations around their midterm elections if they are\n\nup then and well as people who are looking ahead to potential runs in 2024\n\nand how this might play for them then.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, you said it's going to be futile and, you know, the votes\n\neventually, they could have a long debate on the floor, but January 6th\n\neventually is going to lead to inauguration on January 20th. As it's\n\nwritten right now, the president doesn't seem to be tweeting that.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Well, again, I do believe it's futile. I don't think it will go\n\nthere, but I think the nation, having a debate -- because there are\n\nmillions of people who do not believe that the process ultimately was fair\n\nand honorable in the way it was discharged, and so why can't they express\n\nthat? Why can't we have that debate in this country?\n\n\n\nI don't like the idea that they want to just shut down the debate and say,\n\nyou know, just go exactly the way you're supposed to go. It's okay for us\n\nas a nation for a few hours to have this debate. Ultimately I don't think\n\nit will pass.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well -- here's what Senators Romney and Toomey and others are\n\nsaying and you just heard it from Juan, is that the way to debate this is\n\nin court and the Trump campaign tried in more than 60 courts to do this and\n\nthe substance of it even in front of Trump judges never lead to any one\n\njudge saying there was enough evidence to overturn that state's votes.\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: But there is a reason why -- this question goes before Congress\n\nand that's part of the -- this is what's amazing about the United States of\n\nAmerica. It's what separates him from all the other nations on the Earth.\n\nThey actually posed this question to Congress.\n\n\n\nAnd so, each member gets to vote how they want to vote and if they want to\n\nobject, they can object. That's how we do things in this country. It's not\n\njust the courts that decide this. Congress has a role in this as well.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right. So, Juan, for Trump supporter's who say, listen, we do\n\nthink that there is something fishy here, how politically are Republicans\n\ngoing to keep all of them ahead of this Georgia runoff on the 5th and to\n\ncome out and vote and what they consider really a crucial moment for the\n\nparty?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: I guess it's just got to be loyalty to President Trump at this\n\njuncture and it's ironic that the president over the weekend as you\n\nmentioned earlier has said he considers this election illegal and invalid.\n\n\n\nWell, if that's the case, why bother to vote? Why support, you know, sort\n\nof an extra-legal corrupt exercise? Why would anybody go out and vote? I\n\ndon't get it.\n\n\n\nBut he's going there tomorrow to campaign and I guess you just have to say\n\nas we heard in your interview with Senator Loeffler, she is just loyal to\n\nPresident Trump. She doesn't have her own agenda. She didn't lay out any\n\nagenda with regard to any issue. Back and forth with regard to the stimulus\n\nspending, not willing to answer with regard to supporting the president's\n\nveto of the defense appropriation, which was overridden by her fellow\n\nRepublicans.\n\n\n\nSo, it's just about Trump at this juncture and I think that when we look at\n\nthe effort that's going to take place in the Senate, again, it's about\n\nRepublicans who are early entries into the 2024 GOP primary. I don't think\n\nthose people are loyal to Trump, obviously, because they are preparing to\n\nchallenge him in 2024, but they are making a play for the base that you're\n\ntalking about, Bret, and saying to that base I'll buy into the conspiracy\n\ntheories, I'll support your doubts and your cynicism about American\n\npolitics when it doesn't go our way.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yeah, Senators Loeffler and Perdue are hoping the president can\n\ntake those supporters across the finish line for the 5th.\n\n\n\nPanel, stand by if you would. We'll see a little bit later in the show.\n\n\n\nComing up, we talked to Hakeem Jeffries with the Democratic caucus about\n\nwhat the next Congress will look like and Speaker Pelosi's chances.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Coming up, debate over increased stimulus checks makes for strange\n\nbedfellows.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT): Trump is right in saying that's not enough. We\n\nneed to go to $2,000. I didn't say he was visionary. He's right on this\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: We'll ask Democratic Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries where the relief\n\nchecks stand next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBRET BAIER, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: We're back now in Atlanta.\n\n\n\nThis afternoon in Washington, the 117th Congress gets sworn in and\n\nlawmakers in the House will elect their new speaker. Nancy Pelosi, who has\n\nserved 17 years as the Democrat's leader, is running unopposed, but her\n\npath to victory is a narrow one.\n\n\n\nJoining us now from D.C., one of the top Democrats in the house, Hakeem\n\nJeffries.\n\n\n\nCongressman, welcome back to FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\n\n\nREP. HAKEEM JEFFRIES (D-NY) Good morning. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Happy New Year to you.\n\n\n\nWhat do you say to voters here in Georgia who say, listen, we think divided\n\ngovernment works better. And, frankly, they say they're scared of a senator\n\n-- Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, your party controlling all the\n\nHouse, Senate, and the White House, and progressives having control of the\n\nlegislative agenda? What do you say to those voters?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, those very same Georgia voters saw fit to elect Joe Biden\n\nis the next president of the United States of America, believing that he\n\nhas the heart and the experience and the compassion and the empathy to\n\naddress the challenges that are facing everyday Americans.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden will be the leader of the Democratic Party. More importantly, as\n\nthe next president of the United States, Joe Biden, as he has indicated, is\n\ngoing to be the president for all Americans, both those who voted for him\n\nand those who didn't.\n\n\n\nAnd here in the House, we look forward to working closely with him, as well\n\nas Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans to get things done on behalf of\n\nthe American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: As I mentioned at the top, Speaker Pelosi is running unopposed for\n\nthat speakership, but how many votes in the House do you think Nancy Pelosi\n\nwill lose?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the United States\n\nHouse of Representatives and I look forward to placing her name into\n\nnomination as part of my responsibilities as chair of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. There is incredible enthusiasm for Speaker Pelosi because she's\n\ndone the work and she's been an historic, legendary legislative leader\n\nthrough incredibly turbulent times. We've been through a lot of trials and\n\ntribulations as Americans. Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, has\n\nhelped to guide us through that and we look forward to her continuing in\n\nthat capacity.\n\n\n\nBAIER: You said Joe Biden is going to be the leader of the party, but how\n\ndoes Nancy Pelosi control the left part of your caucus, the progressives,\n\nand steer legislation through the House with a much more narrow path\n\nbecause of the votes that you have?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, we are a very big family in terms of the House Democratic\n\nCaucus. We are a diverse family. We're an enthusiastic family. We believe\n\nin the House that our charge is to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the\n\naspirations, the passions of the American people that's consistent with the\n\nUnited States Constitution. And Speaker Pelosi understands that a big tent\n\napproach to getting things done on behalf of the American people is\n\nincredibly important.\n\n\n\nWe've taken that approach, not just internally, but externally over the\n\nlast several years. We've worked closely with President Trump on issues\n\nlike criminal justice reform, with the passage of the historic First Step\n\nAct. We worked closely with President Trump with respect to the United\n\nStates Mexico Canada trade agreement, which was an historic trade agreement\n\nthat protected good paying American jobs. We worked closely with President\n\nTrump to end the practice of surprise billing on behalf of the American\n\npeople and we continue to stand with President Trump, for instance, as he\n\npushes for $2,000 direct stimulus payments.\n\n\n\nAnd so we're always going to govern, not in a partisan way, but in a\n\npractical way that gets things done on behalf of the American people. That\n\napplies to the House Democratic Caucus. That applies to the House. That\n\napplies to the Senate. That applies to the presidency, whether it's a\n\nRepublican or a Democrat.\n\n\n\nBAIER: It's interesting that you point out all of the things that you --\n\nthe House worked with President Trump. There is also a new rules package\n\nfor the new Congress and in it Democrats widen their subpoena and\n\ninvestigative powers, essentially forecasting that this is going to lead to\n\n-- there's also a rules change about gender-neutral terms, he or she\n\nwould become member or delegate or resident commissioner. Father\n\nand mother would become parent, while brother and sister would\n\nbecome sibling.\n\n\n\nAre these the things that are the priority going after the Trump\n\nadministration in investigations and changing the way people talk about\n\ngender-neutral terms?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the top priority of House Democrats is going to be to crush\n\nthe virus, continue to provide direct assistance to everyday Americans who\n\nare struggling and ultimately supercharge our economy for the good of\n\neveryone. I know that will be a priority of President Biden in his first\n\n100 days. That will continue to be our focus.\n\n\n\nThis is a once in a century pandemic. It requires a once in a century\n\ncontinuing, comprehensive and compassionate congressional response. And so\n\nthat's going to be our focus as we move forward. That has been our focus\n\nover the last year, and that continues until we can put this deadly\n\npandemic behind us.\n\n\n\nBAIER: OK. Then why expand the subpoena investigative powers?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Well, the House is a separate and co-equal branch of government\n\nat the end of the day. We don't work for any president, whether that's a\n\nDemocrat or a Republican, whether it's Donald Trump or Joe Biden. And we\n\nhave a constitutional responsibility to serve as a check and balance on any\n\nexecutive branch.\n\n\n\nI wouldn't interpret any change in rules as an effort to look backward with\n\nrespect to Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\n\nWhen we felt it was the right thing to do, consistent with our\n\nconstitutional responsibilities to hold this president accountable, we took\n\nthat step. But as we move forward, I think our concern is going to be\n\nfocused on kitchen table, pocketbook issues, dealing with the health care\n\nchallenges of the American people, making sure that we can bring good\n\npaying jobs, prosperity in every single zip code I think should be our\n\nguiding principle. And, of course, working closely with Joe Biden and\n\nKamala Harris to build back better for the people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: And then the rule about changing -- imposing more gender-neutral\n\nlanguage, I guess critics would say that this is not the message from the\n\nelection. Democrats lost a number of seats that they were thinking they\n\nwere going to win. Traditionally, you know, there would be critics that say\n\nthey're -- Democrats are too focused on political correctness and that this\n\nis an example of that. How would you respond to that?\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: This is just an example of making sure that we are as inclusive\n\nas possible. You know, the framers of the Constitution envisioned the House\n\nat the institution that was the closest to the people and, in their words,\n\nthat would reflect the passions of the American people. It's the reason why\n\nwe have two-year terms as opposed to four years of the presidency, six\n\nyears in the Senate, life tenure for the Supreme Court. And so I think that\n\nthe rules should reflect our values as an institution that is the most\n\ninclusive as possible, that reflects the gorgeous mosaic in every possible\n\nway of the American people.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Speaker Pelosi, you mentioned the stimulus checks and the direct\n\npayment. She has characterized direct payments to Americans different ways,\n\nbeginning with the direct payments from the Trump tax cuts, then the\n\nnegotiated stimulus deal that she negotiated at first and then this new\n\neffort to get more direct payments.\n\n\n\nTake a listen.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): In terms of the bonus that corporate America\n\nreceived versus the crumbs that they are giving to workers to kind of put\n\nthe schmooze on is so pathetic.\n\n\n\nI would like them to have been bigger, but they are significant and they\n\nwill be going out soon.\n\n\n\nWho is holding up that distribution to the American people? Mitch McConnell\n\nand the Senate Republicans.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, there's a lot to digest there. The $1,000 direct\n\npayment was crumbs. $600 was significant. And then the $2,000 was being\n\nheld up by the Senate. But she negotiated with Secretary Mnuchin and\n\nSenator McConnell for that original stimulus deal.\n\n\n\nSo people looking at that scratch their heads.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: The most important thing that Speaker Pelosi indicated is that\n\nMitch McConnell is holding up direct payment checks that are more robust to\n\nthe American people. We agree with President Trump. Republicans in the\n\nHouse of Representatives agree that we should increase those direct\n\npayments to $2,000 per American because the American people are hurting in\n\na tremendous way.\n\n\n\nNow, when it comes to the tax cuts from 2017, we all, on the Democratic\n\nside, had a big problem with that because we went into $2 trillion worth of\n\ndebt for tax cuts were 83 percent of the benefits went to the wealthiest 1\n\npercent, to the wealthy, the well-off and the well-connected. That was not\n\ngood public policy in my humble opinion.\n\n\n\nI think, at the current moment, what we need to do is make sure that we're\n\nproviding relief to middle-class Americans, to those who aspire to be part\n\nof the middle class, to working families, to the poor and the sick and the\n\nafflicted, those who have been impacted the most by this pandemic. That's\n\nwhat we're trying to do. And we're asking Mitch McConnell to join the\n\nAmerican people, join President Trump, join House Democrats and many House\n\nRepublicans in getting this done.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Congressman, thank you for your time. Thanks for joining us on this\n\nholiday weekend. Happy New Year.\n\n\n\nJEFFRIES: Thank you. Happy New Year, again, to you and your viewers.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Up next, we'll discuss how the incoming Congress will work with the\n\nBiden administration when the panel returns as we count down to the\n\ncritical Georgia runoffs from Atlanta.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nSEN. JIM INHOFE (R-OK): People are talking about the Democrats and\n\nRepublicans don't do things together. This has been an example of what can\n\nhappen in government.\n\n\n\nSEN. JACK REED (D-RI): We provide for the support of our service men and\n\nwomen and their families. Think about them and their families and you'll\n\nappreciate, I think, more of what they do every day.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Senate Armed Services Chair James Inhofe and Ranking Member Jack\n\nReed on the New Year's Day override of President Trump's veto of the\n\ndefense spending bill.\n\n\n\nAnd we're back with our panel.\n\n\n\nCatherine, that veto override was a moment of bipartisanship. We heard\n\nSenator Loeffler not really answer that question, what she would do about\n\nthat vote. Neither Loeffler or Perdue voted for that veto override.\n\n\n\nAs you look to Georgia, how significant is that, or is it more about\n\ncontrol of the U.S. Senate and how that plays here?\n\n\n\nCATHERINE LUCEY, THE WALL STREET JOURNAL: Yes, it was interesting, Bret,\n\nhow senator Loeffler was very careful to avoid that question. She,\n\nobviously, is focused on the runoff and the fact that they need President\n\nTrump to come and help them get voters out for Election Day. Republicans\n\nknow that they're at a deficit in early voting and they really need a huge\n\nturnout for Election Day.\n\n\n\nI think a thing to think about also with that override is obviously it was\n\na notable moment in President Trump's tenure. It's the first time we've\n\nseen that. And it does speak to the fact that even as, you know, a lot of\n\nsenators are lining up to support his efforts to, you know, contest the\n\nelection results and are, you know, a growing number are looking to do\n\nthat, that there are still moments in which his party is prepared to buck\n\nhim. And this -- obviously, this is a long-standing, you know, bipartisan\n\npiece of legislation. They take a lot of pride in. They're very concerned\n\nabout support for the military and this was one of those moments.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Jason, depending on how Tuesday comes out here and control of the\n\nSenate, either way we're going to see Washington operate differently after\n\nJanuary 20th.\n\n\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, FORMER CONGRESSMAN (R-UT) AND FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes,\n\nthe margins are so razor-thin, both in the Senate -- you have one or two\n\nsenators going one direction or another. That changes the equation. And\n\neven in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi has the run of her life\n\nto run the gauntlet today. I don't know that she can actually get there,\n\nbut she probably will. History shows that she pulls that off. But every\n\nsingle vote is going to come down to four or five people to sway that and\n\nreally be in a power position to try to negotiate something else.\n\n\n\nI think Washington's going to have a very difficult time moving legislation\n\nif the Senate goes to the Republicans' hands. That's the best conservative\n\nmove we can have is to elect the two Republican senators in Georgia.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Does that suggest, Jason, that if you were still in Congress, that\n\nthere would be -- you would try to make an effort to work with moderates to\n\nget legislation through if you're dealing with the Biden administration? I\n\nmean is -- is that what we're going to see, a kind of a rise of the\n\nmoderates?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: If there were any moderates left. I think most of the moderates\n\nactually lost. I think the progressive far radical left side of the party\n\nhas taken that over. I think the AOCs, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the\n\nsquad, and more left-leaning members have really got Nancy Pelosi over the\n\nbarrel. I think you're going to see the House of Representatives, under\n\nNancy Pelosi, further to the left than we've ever seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Juan, paint the picture of the two different results of Tuesday and\n\nhow Washington operates if the Republicans hold on and win one of the two\n\nand McConnell stays Senate majority leader or if Democrats pick up two and\n\nits Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer.\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think that Mitch\n\nMcConnell is a shrewd tactician, Bret, and his goal will be to block much\n\nof what Joe Biden and the Democrats, especially as they paint it, you know,\n\nthese radical Democrats want to do. So if -- if McConnell maintains hold of\n\nthe gavel as the Senate majority leader, look for that. I think he may have\n\nto make some concessions, as you were suggesting, dealing with moderates\n\nbecause his margins are smaller.\n\n\n\nOn the House side, I think that's also the case.\n\n\n\nNow, you know, Nancy Pelosi, we were talking earlier about whether or not\n\nshe'll be the next speaker. I think the only question today is whether or\n\nnot enough Democrats are able to come in a day early to vote for her. But\n\nshe has proven to be very tough, able to go toe-to-toe with McConnell, even\n\nwith Trump, and I think hold that caucus together, which also will be a\n\nvery slim Democratic majority, much as McConnell will have a slimmer\n\nRepublican majority in the Senate.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes, Catherine, I mean that's a key point. In the House it's going\n\nto be tight for any -- really any piece of legislation. Four members\n\nshifting could change the dynamic for the majority.\n\n\n\nLUCEY: That's right. It's very tight. And I think a look to, as we move\n\nforward is, you know, for the president-elect, Joe Biden really ran on the\n\nidea that he's someone who understands The Hill, he can work there, he has\n\nrelationships, you know, on both sides of the aisle. He and Pelosi go back\n\na very long way.\n\n\n\nBut he's also laid out an ambitious agenda of things he would like to do,\n\nyou know, around climate change, around immigration, around tax cuts -- you\n\nknow, taxes. So how he's going to do that with these narrow majorities and\n\nparticularly if they do not win back the majority in the Senate, it remains\n\nto be seen.\n\n\n\nBAIER: Yes,\n\n\n\nAnd, finally, Jason, what do you think Tuesday comes down to here?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: Turn out. I don't think there's anybody that's undecided. I think\n\nRepublicans have given a mixed message. Hey, the system is corrupt, but get\n\nout and vote. Donald Trump has got to deliver on Monday night. Republicans\n\nhave to show up. If Republicans show up, I think they will win and the --\n\nthe wildcard in all this are the libertarians. One hundred thousand\n\nlibertarians in the presidential election, which direction do they go? Do\n\nthey show up and vote? Voter turnout is everything.\n\n\n\nBAIER: But does the disaffected election challenge voter not show up\n\nbecause they're angry?\n\n\n\nCHAFFETZ: I think that's the big threat. I think that's the mixed message.\n\nI think that's been the unfortunate part of the message coming out. You've\n\neven had key Trump supporter is going out there and saying don't vote. But\n\nthat's the exact opposite of what needs to happen. It's one of the big\n\nconcerns. It has been a mixed message, but people need to get out and vote.\n\nEvery vote will count. It's going to be a razor-thin margin one way or the\n\nother.\n\n\n\nBAIER: All right, panel, thank you. We'll cover it all. We'll see you next\n\nSunday.\n\n\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. Alan Alda played a wise guy on the\n\nTV series M*A*S*H. Now he's sharing some wisdom in a fascinating second\n\nact.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBAIER: Well, he brought laughter to generations as Hawkeye Pierce on the TV\n\nclassic M*A*S*H. Now he's bringing his lifelong passions for science and\n\ncommunication to his hit podcast.\n\n\n\nHere's Chris Wallace with his Power Player of the Week.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nALAN ALDA, ACTOR AND PODCASTER: What we really need now, more effective\n\ncommunication, not only about COVID, but we need to communicate with each\n\nother better about the things we value.\n\n\n\nI have no idea what I'm doing, I'm just a TV doctor.\n\n\n\nI like to think of you as (ph) people.\n\n\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR (voice over): Alan Alda has been\n\ncommunicating brilliantly for 84 years now.\n\n\n\nALDA: Please, please, you're too kind.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: As Hawkeye Pierce on the legendary TV show M*A*S*H, he gave\n\nvoice to a generation questioning authority.\n\n\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: I'm not through here.\n\n\n\nALDA: Then we'll disregard the rumor.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Now he's teaching scientists how to share their discoveries with\n\nthe rest of us.\n\n\n\nALDA: I think to a great extent our lives depend on whether or not we\n\nunderstand the science that's being delivered to us and whether we trust\n\nthe people who are talking with us.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: A decade ago he founded the Alda Center for Communicating Science\n\nat Stony Brook University and he found his improv skills as an actor\n\ntranslate to this very different stage.\n\n\n\nALDA: You're not just reciting a lecture at somebody, you're actually\n\ntalking to them. You're -- you're -- you're speaking to them the way you\n\nwould to a -- to a friend.\n\n\n\nI hope you get a chance to listen to my new podcast.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: This passion for communicating also led Alda to start a hit\n\npodcast, now in its ninth season.\n\n\n\nALDA: I have conversations with people who are, many of them, icons in the\n\nculture, but it's all conversation.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): What is the secret to communicating?\n\n\n\nALDA: You know, ironically, I think the secret to good communication is\n\nlistening.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Alda has embraced tech and social media and talks\n\nopenly about how he's now dealing with Parkinson's disease.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): I understand that your staff has a nickname for you.\n\n\n\nALDA: They call me the world's oldest millennial.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Of course for most of us, Alan Alda will always be\n\npart of that unruly gang on M*A*S*H. One hundred and six million people\n\nwatched the 1983 finale, still a record for a scripted show.\n\n\n\nALDA: I look back with amazement, people who we way not born yet when we\n\nwent off the air, are writing to me and telling me that -- how much it\n\nmeans to them.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Almost 50 years later, the bonds among the cast remains strong.\n\n\n\nALDA: There's a kind of funny video that I posted of me showing Mike\n\nFarrell, who I acted with on M*A*S*H, how to download the podcast.\n\n\n\nALDA: There it is. There it is.\n\n\n\nMIKE FARRELL, ACTOR: Alan Alda.\n\n\n\nALDA: And he slowly gets it.\n\n\n\nALDA: Now I'm subscribing to Clear and Vivid.\n\n\n\nFARRELL: I'm subscribed.\n\n\n\nALDA: I'm so excited.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Last year, Alda posted an old video that went viral, of him tap\n\ndancing with his granddaughter.\n\n\n\nWALLACE (on camera): How do you feel about your life these days and what's\n\nyour attitude going forward?\n\n\n\nALDA: I plan to keep figuring out what's -- what's worth doing and having\n\nfun and laughing right up until the last. This just occurred to me, you'll\n\nnever be able to quote my last words because I hope it will be a laugh.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nBAIER: I hope so.\n\n\n\nIn October, Alda launched a spin-off of his popular podcast called Science\n\nClear and Vivid.\n\n\n\nNow a program note.\n\n\n\nBe sure to tune into our coverage of the Georgia election runoffs.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren emphasized her populist platform and highlighted her humble beginnings as she made her first campaign stop in New Hampshire – the state that traditionally holds the first primary of the presidential election season.\n\nThis is our chance to dream big, to fight hard, and to make this an America that works not just for the rich and the powerful but an America that works for everyone, the liberal torchbearer from Massachusetts said to a crowd of several hundred people at Manchester Community College.\n\nWarren, who was re-elected in November to a second term in the Senate, argued that we need to make systemic change in this country, real change.\n\nWarren's visit was her first to the state since launching a presidential exploratory committee nearly two weeks ago.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPresidential candidates from neighboring Massachusetts have a history of winning the first-in-the-nation primary. Think Michael Dukakis in 1988, Paul Tsongas in 1992, John Kerry in 2004, and Mitt Romney in 2012.\n\nBut asked in an interview with Fox News if New Hampshire was a must-win state, Warren wouldn't directly answer.\n\nInstead she said: I know there are a lot of folks who have their thoughts on strategies and how all of this is supposed to work. But I am not a professional politician. My first time ever to be in electoral politics was when I first ran for the Senate exactly one term ago.\n\nAnother progressive firebrand, independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, is seriously mulling a second straight White House bid. Sanders crushed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, launching him into a marathon fight with the eventual nominee.\n\nI've known Bernie since long before I got involved in electoral politics, Warren said when asked how she could compete against Sanders if he launches a campaign. Bernie and I are old friends and we've talked about a lot of the same issues for a long, long, time.\n\nFORMER OBAMA OFFICIAL JULIAN CASTRO FORMS PRESIDENTIAL EXPLORATORY COMMITTEE\n\nWarren's trip to New Hampshire came the day after another progressive lawmaker – Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii – announced her candidacy for president. Other liberal lawmakers – such as Sens. Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon – are also making moves toward running.\n\nBut Warren wasn't worried about the competition, saying I think this is great.\n\nShe later told reporters it's exciting that Democrats have so many ideas and so many people who want to get out and talk about them.\n\nShe touted that I have the biggest anti-corruption proposal since Watergate.\n\nHer proposals include ending lobbying as we know it and putting more power in the hands of unions, more power in the hands of employees, more power in the hands of consumers. We need to attack head on the costs that hard-working families face every day.\n\nAnd taking a shot at Republican President Trump without naming him, she called for making everyone who runs for public federal office put their tax returns online, everyone.\n\nTrump, both as a candidate and as president, has repeatedly refused to release any of his federal income tax returns.\n\nWarren also highlighted her push to build 3.2 million housing units across the country, called for legalizing marijuana, repairing the criminal justice system, and she received one of her biggest applause when she touted I believe in science.\n\nClimate change is real. We have a moral and economic responsibility in this country starting right now, she added.\n\nAnd taking another indirect shot at the President, she argued that we need a strong EPA led by someone who believes in science.\n\nAsked later why she didn't directly mention the president, Warren explained that I think we need to talk about our affirmative version.\n\nBut she added that I'm willing to fight. Everybody knows that.\n\nWarren also spotlighted her working-class upbringing in Oklahoma, saying it was a bumpy path for me. I dropped out of school at 19, got married.\n\nShe explained that for those who think I was born at Harvard (University), in fact I went to the state law school of New Jersey, Rutgers, for $450 a semester.\n\nAsked why she emphasized her early life over her ensuring years at Harvard or in the Senate, Warren said I think people want to know how you started and I was born and raised in Oklahoma. It's a part of my story and always will be.\n\nAfter her event in Manchester, Warren headlined a jam-packed house party in Concord at the home of former New Hampshire Senate president Sylvia Larsen.\n\nWarren's visit to the Granite State came days after a bill in the New Hampshire legislature to change the name of Columbus Day to indigenous people's day received its first committee hearing.\n\nWarren – whose autumn announcement detailing her Native American heritage was panned by many political pundits and conservatives – is a supporter of the name change.\n\nMy view on this is why would we not want to honor indigenous people. These were the people who were here. These were the people who in Massachusetts reached out helped the first settlers to Massachusetts Bay colony and helped them survive those first harsh and rugged years. I'm in favor of honoring. I think that's a good thing for us to do, she told Fox News.
Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling on Monday slammed President Trump for continuing to claim widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election in Georgia, saying that the claims are easily and provably false.\n\nSterling, a Republican, and Georgia's voting system implementation manager, delivered a point-by-point rebuttal to claims made by the president; his attorney, Rudy Giuliani; and others regarding the results of the presidential race in Georgia.\n\nTRUMP LAWYER SLAMS GEORGIA SECRETARY OF STATE FOR 'SECRETLY' RECORDING 'CONFIDENTIAL'\n\nThere was not massive voter fraud in presidential election, Sterling said. There is no shredding of ballots going on. That's not real. That's not happening. This office has been open and transparent. We are continuing investigations.\n\nHe added: We have seen nothing in our investigations of any of these data claims that shows there are nearly enough ballots to change the outcome and the secretary and I, at this podium, have said this since November 3.\n\nThis is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists, Sterling said.\n\nSterling's press conference came just a day after audio of President Trump's call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger was published by the Washington Post.\n\nDuring the call, according to audio obtained by the Washington Post, the president said: All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\n\nTRUMP URGED GEORGIA ELECTION OFFICIALS TO 'FIND' VOTES IN PHONE CALL, INSISTING HE WON\n\nAccording to the Post, Trump later added: So what are we going to do here, folks? I only need 11,000 votes. Fellas, I need 11,000 votes. Give me a break.\n\nGeorgia certified election results show that Trump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden won the state's Nov. 3 election by 11,779 votes.\n\nSterling, during the press conference, addressed the president's call, saying that when he listened to the audio he wanted to scream.\n\nI will admit, when I listened to the audio of [Trump's] phone call ... I wanted to scream, Sterling said. Well, I did scream at the computer, and I screamed in my car, at the radio, talking about this ... because this has been debunked.\n\nAlso on Monday, the president's attorney, Kurt Hilbert, said that he and the legal team are disappointed that the secretary of state and his staff secretly recorded and released a confidential settlement discussion to settle the two pending lawsuits.\n\nWhile they may think that behavior is appropriate, we do not, Hilbert continued. Consequently, we will not be commenting on settlement discussions.\n\nPresident Trump has refused to concede to President-elect Joe Biden, and his campaign has launched a number of legal challenges. The president, himself, has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Biden's victories.\n\nBut while the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press last month that to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\n\nMeanwhile, during the press conference, Sterling said Georgia election officials acknowledge that there is illegal voting in every single election in the history of mankind, because there are human beings involved in the process.\n\nIt's going to happen, it's a question of limiting it and putting as many safeguards in place to make sure it does not happen, Sterling said.\n\nThe press conference comes just a day before Georgia's Tuesday, Jan. 5, Senate runoffs, pitting Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., against Democrat Raphael Warnock and Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., against Democrat Jon Ossoff.\n\nControl of the Senate is in play on Tuesday. If Democrats win both Georgia races, they will bring the body to an effective 50-50 tie, allowing Harris to break ties on votes that fall along party lines.\n\nSterling urged Georgians to turn out and vote Tuesday, and assured that everybody's vote is going to count.\n\nEverybody's vote is going to count. Everybody's vote did count, Sterling said. Everyone has an obligation to turn out and vote tomorrow, whether you're a Democrat or Republican.\n\nHe added: We are specifically asking you and telling you, please turn out and vote tomorrow.
There's a moment in the final scene of The Goonies where rescuers give their jackets to the cold, bewildered kids who've been fighting for pirate treasure inside a water-filled cave.\n\nI invoke it partly because I've eaten so much over the holidays I could easily play Chunk in a reboot. And mostly because 2020 was my first full year as a nationally syndicated talk show host and it's left me feeling just as dumbfounded as The Goonies watching Chester Copperpot's pirate ship sail into the sunset.\n\nBy no means am I complaining – I've dreamt of hosting my own radio show since I was 5 years old. Although I will admit I never once pictured doing so out of a spare bedroom in my house because of a government lockdown.\n\nGREG LAURIE: WHY I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR 2021\n\nThere's an old saying in horse racing that you've gotta be a mudder who can run on a sloppy track in order to win the big races. We were all mudders in 2020. The track got sloppier by the second but if you're reading this it's because you found a way to keep going. You may not have won the race but give yourself credit just for finishing because as years go, 2020 was one of the longest decades ever.\n\nNothing made sense in 2020.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle vacated their royal positions, becoming the first people in history to quit a job in order to spend less time with their family.\n\nJoe Biden became the first guy to win the presidency without really running for it. Sure he'd do a Zoom fundraiser and the occasional six-person rally, but I remain confident there were more Elvis sightings than Biden sightings this fall.\n\nAnd while we're on the topic of rare occurrences, history will show the Times Square New Year's Eve Ball Drop took place without spectators for the first time since 1907. Not that New Yorkers care, we've been watching the Jets drop the ball all year.\n\nForgive that joke, Jets fans. Even if you don't it's fine by me because America was never supposed to have a one size fits all sensibility and we need to stop trying to create one.\n\nThat was my biggest takeaway from talking to thousands of Republican and Democratic callers this year. Our society seems to be suffering from a weapons-grade level of ideological intolerance that's left many people unable to respect opposing viewpoints on any level.\n\nEveryone needs to remember our national motto of E Pluribus Unum – a fancy way of saying there's room for all of us so CHILL OUT.\n\nI'm not sure how we lost our ability to coexist, but if I had to guess, social media and the carefully curated world of the smartphone have given us a staggering sense of self-importance that tells us our opinions are the only ones worth hearing. It almost makes sense in a world where we never stop sharing our hot takes and our hot meals. We no longer keep up with the Kardashians, we are the Kardashians, minus the great work on prison reform.\n\nIt also can't help that Twitter has taught us to hate dissenting views as a form of currency. The Smart Phone Fight Club rewards the snarkiest posts with the highest dosages of digital dopamine, aka likes. All of this non-stop, incentivized conflict has led many people to forget that we all play for the same American team and as the country goes, we go, regardless of how we voted.\n\nWith that in mind, my New Year's proposal is that we bring back cool people. Remember those folks in the '80s, '90s and early aughts who were too busy living their lives to spend all day trying to impose their personal preferences on everyone else? The folks who didn't care what party you were from as long as you were cool at a party?\n\nWe desperately need more of them and seeing as everything else gets a reboot these days, I say we give it a go. Because after watching society cannibalize itself this past year over everything from protests to Peloton ads, it's clear to me we're never going to make progress until people learn to calm down and coexist.\n\nI know that sounds impossible days before a runoff election in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate. I'm also well aware that no one in the history of telling people to calm down has ever gotten them to do so. I'm married 15 years, I get it.\n\nThat being said, none of the issues we're fighting over are going away any time soon no matter who wins Jan. 5. This is a society that still hasn't agreed on whether an Internet dress from 2015 was blue and black or white and gold. I doubt we're going to reach a consensus on health care, climate change or gun rights in the near future.\n\nIn the meantime, everyone needs to remember our national motto of E Pluribus Unum, which means out of many, one. It's a fancy way of saying there's room for all of us so CHILL OUT.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nLet's face it, gang. America has been fighting so much this place is starting to feel as if it could be here today and gone tomorrow, like Hilaria Baldwin's accent.\n\nAll of that changes if we learn to show each other even the slightest modicum of respect in the New Year. I'm not asking you to abandon your core beliefs. I'm asking you to abandon the need to destroy anything in your path that doesn't agree with you and give cool a chance.\n\nI know old habits die hard, and Goonies never say die. If you need help taking the edge off I also know a world-class radio show you can check out. (And once you get done with Brian Kilmeade's show be sure to give mine a try, too.)\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese past 12 months were the most toxic times many of us have ever witnessed. It's natural to want to relitigate the pandemic, the protests or the politics but as the old saying goes, hindsight is 2020.\n\nHappy New Year. Don't be a punk.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JIMMY FAILLA
The Los Angeles Chargers fired head coach Anthony Lynn on Monday after four seasons with the team.\n\nThe Chargers became the sixth team to have a head coach opening. The New York Jets and Jacksonville Jaguars fired their coaches within the last 24 hours while the Atlanta Falcons, Detroit Lions and Houston Texans were all dealing with interim head coaches during the 2020 NFL season.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nLynn became the Chargers' head coach prior to the start of the 2017 season. He was 33-31 in 64 games as the Chargers coach and made one playoff appearance with Los Angeles in that time span.\n\nThis morning I informed Anthony Lynn that we have made the decision to part ways with him as our head coach, team owner Dean Spanos said in a statement. I'm not sure there is another person in this league more respected as a human being than Anthony, and I want to sincerely express my deepest gratitude for his leadership during a time of great change for our organization.\n\nJAGUARS FIRE DOUG MARRONE AFTER MORE THAN 4 SEASONS AS HEAD COACH\n\nHe continued: As we all know, this is a results-driven business and, simply put, the results of the past two years have fallen short of expectations. Moving forward, we will redouble our efforts to both build and maintain a championship-caliber program. We have been innovative in many facets of our organization in recent years, and we need to carry that over to our entire operation. Our fans need to know that the Los Angeles Chargers are committed to consistent, winning football. The search for a new head coach will begin immediately.\n\nLos Angeles was 9-7 in his first season and 12-4 in his second. However, the Chargers finished under .500 his last two seasons. In 2020, Los Angeles finished 7-9. The Chargers were on a four-game winning streak, which some thought may have saved Lynn's job for at least one more season.\n\nThe Chargers' opening is seen as one of the more desirable ones because of the weapons on offense. Justin Herbert set the record for most touchdown passes by a rookie and has solid weapons around him in Austin Ekeler and Keenan Allen.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLos Angeles will likely have to focus on upgrading its defense in the offseason. The team was 23rd in points allowed but 10th in yards allowed.

A New York woman has tested positive for hepatitis B after undergoing surgery at a facility in New Jersey that recently warned more than 3,000 patients that they may have been exposed to HIV and hepatitis as a result of deficiencies in infection control at the center.\n\nThe 58-year-old Brooklyn woman, who asked to remain anonymous for privacy reasons, underwent shoulder surgery at the HealthPlus Surgery Center in August. In December, she was one of the 3,778 patients who received a letter from the Saddlebrook surgery center that urged those who underwent a procedure between January 2018 and Sept. 7, 2018, to get their blood tested, as they may have been exposed to HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAn investigation by the New Jersey Department of Health revealed that during this time period, deficiencies in infection control in both our sterilization/cleaning of instruments and the injection of medications may have exposed patients to bloodborne pathogens (diseases in people's blood), such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Betty McCabe, the administrator at the surgery center, said in an online statement at the time, noting that no illness had been reported then and the risk of infection was low.\n\nBut after receiving the letter, the woman underwent testing and received a positive result for hepatitis B on Jan. 2, one of her attorneys, Marc Held of Held & Hines LLP, told Fox News. She is also being represented by attorneys with Robinson & Yablon P.C.\n\nI am simply at a loss for words, the woman said in a statement to Fox News through Held. Never in a million years did I think that having shoulder surgery would affect my life forever. It was supposed to help change my life in the positive way, not alter my entire future in a negative one.\n\nThe woman claims she was healthy before her procedure and was not previously infected with hepatitis B, which is a liver infection caused by the hepatitis B virus, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Hepatitis B can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness, the health agency said.\n\nKANSAS BOY'S 'CONSTIPATION' WAS ACTUALLY LIVER CANCER, MOM SAYS\n\nThe 58-year-old is also a part of a federal class-action lawsuit that was filed in the Eastern District of New York on Dec. 31. A copy of the complaint reviewed by Fox News alleges, in part, HealthPlus recklessly and negligently failed to follow proper sterile processing procedures and failed to comply with other regulations regarding the dispensing and storage of medication, the sterilization and cleaning of instruments, as well as infection control and planning procedures.\n\nI am simply at a loss for words. Never in a million years did I think that having shoulder surgery would affect my life forever. It was supposed to help change my life in the positive way, not alter my entire future in a negative one. — 58-year-old Brooklyn woman who tested positive for hepatitis B\n\nThe surgery center closed on Sept. 7 and reopened weeks later, on Sept. 28 following the investigation. At that time, new staff was hired and all medical equipment and instruments were properly cleaned and repaired, among other improvements, according to the statement from McCabe.\n\nThe woman also claims in the lawsuit that she was administered medication intravenously and various medical instruments were used upon her before, during and after surgery.\n\nIn response the positive test result, the attorney for HealthPlus, Mark Manigan, said in a statement to Fox News the [New Jersey] DOH will perform a comprehensive analysis to determine if a positive test result relates to a pre-existing condition that may or may not have been previously reported or diagnosed; or if further analysis of potential exposure sources, including HealthPlus, is indicated.\n\nWHAT IS HEPATITIS?\n\nTo our knowledge, no infection has been linked to exposure at HealthPlus and definitive results may be weeks or months away, he added.\n\nThe statement comes after a Dec. 29 press conference where Manigan addressed the state health department's findings.
Chris Rock revealed he can't wait to get the coronavirus vaccine when it becomes available to him.\n\nThe 55-year-old comedian told CBS' Gayle King that he's not really worried about how they are made, just that they work on the public.\n\nLet me put it this way: Do I take Tylenol when I get a headache? Yes, he reasoned. Do I know what's in Tylenol? I don't know what's in Tylenol, Gayle. I just know my headache's gone. Do I know what's in a Big Mac, Gayle? No. I just know it's delicious.\n\nThe Brooklyn native spoke about how he's used the pandemic to really dive deep into therapy and address some issues in his past.\n\nCHRIS ROCK CALLS ON JOE BIDEN TO CREATE 'SUPREME COURT OF SCIENCE' TO HANDLE ANY CRISIS LIKE THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nYou have to tell the truth [in therapy], Rock said. Sometimes I wasn't kind, and sometimes I wasn't listening. Sometimes I was selfish. And ultimately, who do you want to be? On the outside, it looks like I'm this daring person, but, boy, can I play it safe. I need to jump in the pool a little bit.\n\nHe told King he spends about seven hours a week talking to a professional.\n\nPeople get better and people change, Rock explained. Right now, we're going through this thing where we're punishing people for thinking and feeling and saying things 20, 30 years ago. Do you know how easy it would be for me in one of my specials to name a name, or show a picture of someone and say, 'This person called me (expletive)' and ruin someone's life? ... I'm going to hope that what they did to me shames them in some way and they teach their kids better. That's my wish for them.\n\nCHRIS ROCK REVEALS LEARNING DISORDER THAT AFFECTS HOW HE COMMUNICATES\n\nThe divorcee has previously gotten honest about his porn addiction and cheating on his wife in his Netflix comedy special Tamborine.\n\nThe streaming service is releasing an extended version of the Grammy-nominated 2018 special on Jan. 12, which features searing observations on race, fatherhood, and politics.\n\nRock told King about an encounter he had with law enforcement a few years ago, arguing that in some jobs you can't have bad apples.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSome jobs, you have to be totally accountable, he said. You have to have a zero-tolerance for any shenanigans. Most of my dealings with the police are good. But ... a couple of years ago there was a cop who was like, 'What are you driving around here for? You don't live around here, do you?' And I'm looking at him like, 'You don't live around here.'
Dads are no longer getting dumped on.\n\nWhile men increasingly take on the role of primary parents, a September Instagram post of a father changing his son's diaper on the floor of a public restroom suggested the world had not caught up to the modern American family.\n\nINSTAGRAMMER DEFENDS 'SAGGY, WRINKLY' SKIN AFTER GIVING BIRTH\n\nThat's why, as of Jan. 1, all new and renovated buildings with public restrooms in New York are required to have diaper-changing tables in men's and women's bathrooms. The provision was announced in April by Gov. Cuomo.\n\nNew York proudly leads the nation in fighting for the rights of working parents, and by ensuring access to these amenities, we will help ensure all New Yorkers can give their children the care they need at this critical stage of their lives, Cuomo said in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis initiative has been a long time coming. In 2016, 6 percent of fathers stayed at home to care for their families, according to Pew Research data. That's double the amount of stay-at-home dads less than 30 years ago.\n\nAnd it's certainly a loaded subject. During what has been a contentious time in bathroom-related social justice, perhaps this new law will mark a fresh change.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Post.
The University of California San Diego campus has launched a Return to Learn campaign that includes nearly a dozen vending machines placed around campus that offer self-administered COVID-19 test kits.\n\nAdditional machines are planned and administrators hope that in addition to health care provider-administered tests, the one-stop shops help students meet the campus' testing requirements.\n\nThe 10,000 students living on campus are required to be tested at least once a week, with no more than nine days between two tests, and testing is available free to students. They can acquire the test from the vending machine with a simple swipe of a student ID card. They then perform the test and return it to an on-campus lab within 72 hours.\n\nThey're an amazing innovation, simple, effective and impactful, UC San Diego Chancellor Pradeep Khosla told Reuters.\n\nSTATES CAN EXPAND COVID-19 VACCINATIONS TO BROADER GROUPS TO USE SUPPLY, AZAR SAYS\n\nAs part of the university's Return to Learn campaign, employees who have been working remotely will continue to do so through May 31, and there will continue to be a low-density population on campus to provide plenty of space for effective physical distancing.\n\nEmployees and students who report to campus are required to submit a daily self-screening for COVID-19 before arrival. Less than 10% of the Winter 2021 undergraduate courses will be offered in person, and they are only permitted to be conducted in outdoor classrooms. If a class is permitted to be held indoors, occupancy is limited to fewer than 50 students per class, or 25% of classroom capacity.\n\nCHEAP HAIR LICE DRUG MAY CUT RISK OF COVID-19 DEATH BY 80%: STUDY\n\nStudent housing is also remaining at single occupancy, and visitors are not allowed. Should a student test positive, they will be moved to on-campus isolation housing.\n\nThe campus is also conducting wastewater surveillance and testing sewage samples every 24 hours to detect potential outbreaks before they occur, Reuters reported.\n\nA spokesperson told the news outlet that less than 600 students have tested positive for COVID-19 over the last 10 months.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nDue to the dynamic public health situation, UC San Diego will remain flexible, a Return to Learn information release stated. As has been the case since the beginning of this unprecedented challenge, the University's plans may change as the pandemic evolves and health authorities respond. While the California reopening plan is executed and assessed at each phase, UC San Diego will notify campus community members of any changes to their learning and work situations as appropriate. In all decisions, the health and safety of students, employees and local communities will be paramount.
The View erupted with testy moments on Wednesday as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz defended President Trump against the co-hosts during a discussion about the ongoing Senate impeachment trial.\n\nMany of the co-hosts took issue with Dershowitz's answers, including Behar who, at one point, told the Trump impeachment defense attorney that his argument was baloney. Co-host Whoopi Goldberg also cut off Dershowitz off as he attempted to give some historical background on whether impeachment could proceed without actual crimes.\n\nHe was responding to co-host Joy Behar's claim that no other constitutional scholar agreed with him about needing a crime for impeachment. Dershowitz, a renowned legal scholar, has written dozens of books. Behar and Goldberg do not have law degrees, although co-host Sunny Hostin does.\n\nIn 18..., Dershowitz started before Goldberg interrupted him. Ok, wait, wait, wait, Goldberg said. Alan, you know, in 1492 Columbus sailed the seas blue but listen, I need us to move on.\n\nDERSHOWITZ SPARS WITH FORMER LAW STUDENT, CNN ANALYST OVER IMPEACHMENT: 'C'MON ALAN'\n\nDershowitz told her that he wouldn't move on without addressing the history of impeachment. You're not going to get any time because you got four people trying to ask you questions, she responded.\n\nDershowitz proceeded to claim that academics were choosing their position because President Trump was in office. Shortly after the Constitution was enacted, the dean of Columbia Law School said that the weight of authority was in favor of it being a crime, he said.\n\nNow, the academics all say it isn't. Why? Because Donald Trump is being impeached. If Hillary Clinton was being impeached, they'd all be on my side, he said.\n\nBehar responded: That's just baloney, that's just baloney.\n\nAmid cross-talk over needing a crime for impeachment, Goldberg told Dershowitz, I'm moving you on or I'm cutting you off -- one or the other is going to happen.\n\nDERSHOWITZ CALLS OUT HOUSE DEMS IN TRUMP'S SENATE IMPEACHMENT TRIAL AFTER BOLTON SHOCK WAVES\n\nThe co-hosts also tried confronting Dershowitz on his previous statements about impeachment, with Goldberg suggesting he changed his mind because Trump was president. Dershowitz countered by claiming that he actually changed his mind on impeachment about four years ago when he looked into the possibility of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton getting impeached.\n\nAt one point, Goldberg compared Trump to former President Bill Clinton. One president followed the law and did what he was supposed to do. We have a president now who's blocking people from doing stuff, she said, apparently referring to the administration opposing new witnesses.\n\nGoldberg later groaned when Dershowitz referenced former President Abraham Lincoln. You have to go back in history. Impeachment doesn't change since the time of the Constitution, he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhen it was co-host Sunny Hostin's turn, she pressed Dershowitz on the Government Accountability Office's (GAO) report that Trump broke the law by withholding Ukrainian aid. Dershowitz responded by claiming that the GAO didn't have the jurisdiction to claim that Trump engaged in criminal behavior, something he said the agency didn't claim anyway. He also added that the GAO was also wrong, noting that the president had the right to withhold funds as part of his authority to conduct foreign policy.\n\nHostin also seemed to try and trip Dershowitz up, asking him what kind of trial has he seen that doesn't have witnesses or evidence.\n\nMany, many, Dershowitz responded.\n\nCo-host Meghan McCain was less controversial, asking Dershowitz how Democrats could improve their case against Trump. Dershowitz replied that it wasn't his job to help Democrats.
It's probably America's most controversial list. You can be put on it without your knowledge, and getting off it is extremely difficult.\n\nIt's the federal no-fly list, a collection of names of people who are not allowed to board commercial flights into or out of the United States. According to leaked documents obtained by The Intercept, more than 47,000 people were on America's no-fly list as of August 2013. That number reportedly includes 800 Americans, many of whom don't even know they're on it. The government sends no official notification to those on the list; many times, people don't find out until they're denied boarding at the airport.\n\nA number of high-profile lawsuits have claimed the government unjustly added people to the list and blocked their efforts to have their names removed. Last summer, a federal court ruled in favor of 13 people who claimed the government violated their constitutional rights to travel by placing them on the no-fly list. The government was ordered to tell the plaintiffs whether they're on the list, spell out the reasons they are barred from travel, and to give them a chance to challenge the government finding.\n\nThe case was one of the biggest challenges yet to the super-secret government list, but the veil that shrouds the no-fly list still remains.\n\nThere is this black box procedure which operates purely behind the curtains and no one is able to part those curtains and find out what really goes on, airline industry analyst Robert Mann explained to Yahoo Travel.\n\nThe government maintains that the secrecy about the no-fly list is necessary for national security. A potential terrorist can be tipped off that the government is watching him, the logic goes, if he gets a letter saying he's now on a government blacklist.\n\nI think it's like any high security process, says Mann. You don't want to reveal sources and methods because knowledge of those sources and methods permit nefarious individuals to compromise them.\n\nDespite the secrecy, various court cases, news reports and leaked documents have shed some light on the process behind the no-fly list. Here are eight possible ways one can end up on it.\n\n1. Being suspected of direct terrorist activity\n\nThis one may be obvious, but of course known terrorists end up on the no-fly list. The man who tried to bomb a Northwest Airlines flight in 2009 and the man convicted of planting a car bomb in Times Square in 2010 both were on the no-fly list (they were able to board planes anyway). Last year, the Intercept obtained a secret document issued by the National Counterterrorism Center that details how the government puts people on the no-fly list as well as on terrorist databases. It lists people convicted of or arrested for acts of terrorism, bombers, hostage takers, assassins, associates of terror groups, and others. According to the document, federal agencies can nominate someone for a government blacklist if an individual is known or suspected to be or has been knowingly engaged in conduct constituting, in preparation for, in aid of, or related to TERRORISM and/or TERRORIST ACTIVITIES.\n\nAccording to The Guardian, the Justice Department has also said that authorities must have a reasonable suspicion that someone poses a threat before they put them on a watch list. However, civil liberties activists have argued that reasonable suspicion is extremely subjective.\n\n2. Travel to certain countries\n\nFrequent trips to a known trouble spot can raise a red flag. If you travel to certain places, the likelihood is you get more scrutiny, says Mann. If you travel frequently to countries that are known to be involved in terrorism or financial crimes, you do run the risk of having your travels alerted more carefully.\n\n3. Something you said in the past\n\nThere are numerous complaints from non-violent political activists who say they ended up on a no-fly list for something they said. Former Princeton University professor Walter Murphy told The Guardian that in 2007, he was denied a boarding pass in Newark International Airport. He suspects it was because of a high-profile lecture he gave that had been critical of then-President Bush. In 2012, Wade Hicks, the spouse of a Navy lieutenant, claimed he was told he was on a no-fly list. He thinks it was because of comments he made about 9/11.\n\n4. Have a similar name to someone on the no-fly list\n\nThis is a common complaint from those who claim they are on the no-fly list unjustly. If you have a name which is similar in sound or spelling or in phonetical interpretation to someone who probably legitimately should be on the list, you're at risk for finding yourself on the list, says Mann. He cites a friend of his who shares a last name with an Irish Republican Army operative who was active in the 1960s and 1970s. That unfortunate coincidence, says Mann, landed not only his friend on the list but also the man's son — who wasn't even born during this operative's heyday.\n\nIn 2007, 60 Minutes famously brought together a group of people named Robert Johnson who experienced problems flying, likely because a man also named Robert Johnson had been convicted of plotting to bomb a Hindu temple and a movie theatre in Toronto.\n\n5. Not becoming an informant\n\nAccording to a federal lawsuit heard in New York this summer, four Muslims say they were put on the no-fly because they refused to spy for the FBI. The men's names were removed from the list but they sued FBI agents for damages.\n\n6. Clerical error\n\nAccording to a lawsuit detailed in Wired magazine, a Stanford University doctoral student was placed on the no-fly list in 2004. After seven years of federal lawsuits, it was determined she was unjustly put on the list because an FBI agent had checked the wrong box on a form.\n\n7. Law enforcement issues\n\nMann says you may not even have to be suspected of terrorism to get on a no-fly list. In some cases, people have either open warrants or some other characteristic indicating criminal activity and then they find themselves on this list, he says, even when the alleged activity has nothing to do with aviation security. Mann believes that's a sign the no-fly list has morphed beyond an air security tool into an all-out law enforcement tactic. This has mission-creeped into something that is much wider in scope than was originally intended, he says.\n\n8. Controversial Tweets\n\nThe government guidelines published by the Intercept barred agencies from blacklisting people based on information that is unreliable or not credible. But it does point out that social media posts should not automatically be discounted when deciding whether someone belongs on a blacklist. Agencies are instructed to evaluate the credibility of the source, as well as the nature and specificity of the information, and nominate even if that source is uncorroborated.\n\nBut don't worry: chances are your tweet will not land you on a no-fly list. Writing the TSA on Twitter with some negative comments about your experience at such-and-such airport won't do anything other than get you a 'sorry' from the TSA, says Mann. There's so many of those, half the traveling public would be on the darned list.\n\nThe government, either via policy change or court order, has made some changes to the no-fly list that have opened up the process somewhat. But everyone agrees, it's still a slow and secretive process.\n\nMore from Yahoo!

President Trump on Wednesday said he has ordered the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to stop sending money to California to deal with forest fires unless they get their act together.\n\nBillions of dollars are sent to the State of California for Forest fires that, with proper Forest Management, would never happen, he tweeted. Unless they get their act together, which is unlikely, I have ordered FEMA to send no more money. It is a disgraceful situation in lives & money!\n\nNovember's fire in the northern California town of Paradise was the deadliest U.S. wildfire in a century, killing at least 85 people and destroying nearly 14,000 homes.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP ARRIVES IN CALIFORNIA TO SURVEY WILDFIRE DAMAGE AFTER HAMMERING 'POOR' FOREST MANAGEMENT\n\nTrump sparked controversy then when he blamed the wildfires on poor forest management, and threatened to withhold payments to the state.\n\nIn an interview with Fox News Sunday, Trump praised the firefighters but said the big problem we have is management. He said that responders were raking bushes that were totally dry and on fire: That should have been all raked out, you wouldn't have the fires.\n\nCALIFORNIA'S NEW GOVERNOR PROPOSES CAMERAS IN FORESTS AS PART OF $305M BOOST IN FIRE-SAFETY SPENDING\n\nYou need forest management, it has to be, I'm not saying that in a negative way or positive way, I'm just saying the facts, he said.\n\nCalifornia Democrats reacted angrily Wednesday to Trump's decision.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's absolutely shocking for President Trump to suggest he would deny disaster assistance to communities destroyed by wildfire, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, said in a statement. Attacking victims is yet another low for this president.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said in a tweet that Democrats and Republicans should work together to fight climate change, not play politics by threatening to withhold money from survivors of a deadly natural disaster.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
President Ronald Reagan has been dead for nearly 15 years. Today's youth see him as many of us similarly saw Franklin Roosevelt or John F. Kennedy – men who evolved into monuments, their static images staring back at us across time and space.\n\nHistorians and pundits still debate the significance and success of Reagan's presidency. But as the curtain falls on 2018, I'm reminded of what an unlikely meeting with him taught me about setting goals and pursuing dreams at the start of a new year.\n\nI was in the third grade at St. Christopher's School on Long Island when Reagan was inaugurated. On that cold January day in 1981, our teacher, Mrs. Campbell, rolled the black and white television set into our classroom.\n\nREAD MORE FROM PAUL BATURA HERE\n\nWe watched as the actor-turned-politician took the presidential oath at the same time that 52 American hostages were being released from 444 days of captivity in Iran.\n\nGrowing up, I idolized President Reagan. To me, he was (and still is) the gold standard of the presidency – ideologically strong and conservatively resolute, and also a gracious gentleman of good manners and high ideals.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI used to dream of meeting and interviewing President Reagan one day. But why would the world's most powerful man be willing to see me? It was a far-fetched fantasy.\n\nJust after I graduated from college in 1994, President Reagan penned his heartbreaking Alzheimer's announcement. Because of the disease, he said he would be withdrawing from public view. I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset of my life, he poignantly wrote.\n\nGiven the seeming finality of such a statement, I was surprised to receive a letter from my mother one day in November 1997 that contained a newspaper article mentioning that Reagan still met, on occasion, with ordinary Americans.\n\nAt the time, I was in graduate school and very unsure about my future. I had been a budding writer and the kid with the radio dream of hosting my own interview show. Although I had worked at both a radio station and a newspaper, I had yet to seriously pursue anything with gusto.\n\nIn retrospect, I was insecure and unsure of myself. I daydreamed but didn't do much to make the dreams a reality.\n\nIn fact, I remember getting a lump in my throat while watching the movie Rudy, the true story of Rudy Ruettiger, an undersized kid from Illinois who dreamed about playing football for the University of Notre Dame.\n\nThe problem with dreamers, Rudy's high school teacher once scolded him, is they aren't doers.\n\nThat type of cold but candid criticism hit close to home. Reading the article about President Reagan, I made up my mind to fulfill a lifelong dream and request a meeting.\n\nBe bold, the Canadian clergyman Basil King once wrote, and mighty forces will come to your aid.\n\nI received a call from President Reagan's office just two weeks later. When would you like to come and visit and meet with the great man? the person on the line asked.\n\nArriving at his 34th floor office atop the Century City Office Tower in Los Angeles, his assistant prepared me for the meeting. Let him lead, she said. He has good days and bad days.\n\nFortunately, the day of my visit was a good one. President Reagan greeted me warmly and we exchanged pleasantries. He asked me about my school and work and how I liked California.\n\nThe former president then told a humorous story about an interaction with a young boy in the park across the street. Throwing back his shoulders, he laughed heartily and – as if I were an old friend – slapped me on the back.\n\nIt was a surreal 15 minutes. Here I was, an ordinary 25-year-old American citizen, talking with a man who helped change the world. But it only happened because I had the audacity to ask for a meeting in the first place.\n\nThere's a no-nonsense biblical exhortation that we have not because we ask not. In asking, our motives must be good and our desire should be to serve others rather than ourselves.\n\nWhat are your dreams for the coming year? What is your great desire? Is there some audacious, unlikely goal you've wanted to pursue – but hesitate to go after out of fear?\n\nRonald Reagan's legacy grows larger with the passage of time. My mother, who led me to write the letter seeking to meet the former president, has been gone for years.\n\nBut as the new year approaches and hope springs eternal – as it does each January – the memory of that fateful meeting is a reminder that we all need to take a chance in 2019.\n\nWhat did I learn from asking to meet with President Reagan? I learned to ask the question. Chase the dream. Sow the seed and run the risk of rejection.\n\nIn the words of the late William Borden, the millionaire-turned-missionary who gave away his fortune in order share his faith – only to die before his work even began – may you be able to say by this time next year no reserves, no retreat, no regrets.
The NBA is adopting a tougher policy regarding masks, telling teams Monday that players on the active roster will have to wear the face coverings in the bench area until they enter games.\n\nThat memo, obtained by The Associated Press, was released on the same day the Brooklyn Nets ruled All-Star forward Kevin Durant out for Tuesday's game against Utah in accordance with the league's health and safety protocols for dealing with coronavirus.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nAmong the new rules, which take effect Tuesday: players who are dressed for games and eligible to participate must wear a face mask until they enter the game, all players and coaches must wear face masks when outside the team environment if they are around other players and coaches, and players must report the names of any private trainer, therapist, chiropractor or other specialists who they work with outside of the team facility.\n\nIt's the latest update to a plan the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association are continuing to evaluate, especially lately given the continued uptick in cases following the holiday season. If players are working with trainers or therapists away from the team facility, they're also being reminded to wear masks and take all possible precautions.\n\nMeanwhile, a person with knowledge of the situation said Durant will have to complete a seven-day quarantine, which would also rule him out of three additional games — at home against Philadelphia on Thursday, at Memphis on Friday and home again to play Oklahoma City on Sunday. The person spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity Monday because the Nets did not disclose that publicly.\n\nDurant, who had coronavirus in May, tested negative in recent days, the person told AP. That would indicate Durant was exposed to someone who has tested positive for coronavirus, based on the protocols the NBA and NBPA are using.\n\nESPN and The Athletic first reported Durant would be entering quarantine and missing games. Durant is averaging 28.2 points over six games for the Nets, who are off to a 3-4 start.\n\nRegarding the updated mask rules, a player who comes out of a game is not required — but strongly recommended, the league said — to put on a mask after returning to the bench area. The rules reset at halftime; players who aren't in the game to start the third quarter need to wear masks until going into the game.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInactive players have been required to wear masks for the duration of the game, and that rule remains unchanged. Coaches are also mandated to wear masks while on the sideline, another rule that remains in place.\n\nThe league also told teams Monday it has increased the maximum travel party size by one. It's now 46 people, the change being made so teams can add a staffer tasked with handling contact tracing requirements during road trips.
Nicolás Maduro was set to extend his grip on power Tuesday as the ruling socialist party prepared to assume the leadership of Venezuela's congress, the last institution in the country it didn't already control.\n\nMaduro's allies swept legislative elections last month boycotted by the opposition and denounced as a sham by the U.S., the European Union and several other foreign governments. While the vote was marred by anemically low turnout, it nonetheless seemed to relegate into irrelevancy the U.S.-backed opposition led by 37-year-old lawmaker Juan Guaidó.\n\nExactly a year ago, Guaidó, in a blue suit and tie, tried to scale a spiked iron fence to get past a group of riot police blocking him from attending the parliament's inaugural session, which according to the constitution must be held every year on Jan. 5.\n\nVENEZUELA'S MADURO CLAIMS SWEEP OF BOYCOTTED ELECTION\n\nA far cry from that electric display of defiance, Guaidó was expected to meet via Zoom with a cohort of opposition leaders for their own virtual parliamentary session.\n\nLast month, anti-Maduro lawmakers, several dozen of them from exile, also gathered online to extend their mandate stemming from a landslide victory in 2015 for another 12 months, operating through an adjunct committee normally reserved for legislative recesses.\n\nSupreme Court justices loyal to Maduro immediately struck down the law as invalid. But that hasn't stopped the Trump administration from doubling down in its support of Guaidó.\n\nThe national parliament will not be detained until there are free elections in Venezuela, Guaidó said on Twitter recently.\n\nWhile Guaido's bravery hasn't wavered, the opposition's political fortunes have tanked as Venezuelans own hopes for change have collapsed. Recent opinion polls show support for Guaidó having fallen by more than half since he first rose to challenge Maduro two years ago.\n\nDAUGHTER OF CITGO 6 EXECUTIVE JAILED IN VENEZUELA CALLS ON TRUMP TO BRING 'POLITICAL PRISONERS' HOME\n\nMeanwhile, Maduro has managed to retain a solid grip on power and the military, the traditional arbiter of political disputes.\n\nGaby Arellano, a lawmaker exiled in Colombia, said that many in the opposition underestimated Maduro, thinking he stood no chance in a doomsday economic environment marked by hyperinflation, miles-long lines for gasoline and pulverized wages measured adding up to a few pennies per month.\n\nBut he's managed to outmaneuver his foes through a mix of repression and co-optation exacerbated by the opposition's own missteps, Arellano said. She expects a new round of repression now that Maduro has seized congress. On Tuesday, Guaidó blasted on Twitter photos of what he said were security forces surrounding his apartment building in Caracas. The AP was unable to confirm the reports.\n\nReflecting that lack of unity, a few lawmakers still inside Venezuela -- including Guaidó's former deputy as National Assembly vice president -- signaled they would no longer lay claim to their seats.\n\nWe're at the start of what looks like a very dark, new phase, said Arellano.\n\nWith Maduro easily boxing out the opposition, his biggest threat may come from within his own coalition.\n\nOPPOSITION LEADERS LAUNCH UNPRECEDENTED PARTNERSHIP TO FUNNEL FUNDS, BYPASSING MADURO CONTROLS\n\nTo reward loyal allies and paper over tensions between hardline ideologues and moderates within the Bolivarian revolution, the makeup of the legislature was expanded by 100 seats. He also leaned on high-profile candidates, including First Lady Cilia Flores, in an ultimately futile attempt to boost turnout, which in the end was 30% — less than half of what it was in the 2015 election, which gave control of congress to the opposition.\n\nThe new congress will be headed by Maduro's former chief of staff, Jorge Rodriguez, who in the past led internationally-sponsored talks with the opposition as well as met with envoys from the Trump administration. Socialist party boss Diosdado Cabello, who is widely seen as the second most-powerful man in Venezuela, will lead the socialist party bloc.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMaduro, in announcing the leadership structure on Monday, called on the new congress to seek out dialogue with the opposition as well as focus on urgent economic measures.\n\nVenezuela has its eyes placed on the new National Assembly, said Maduro, who was expected to attend Tuesday's inaugural session after years of steadfastly avoiding sessions overseen by the opposition.
President Trump on Tuesday said he and Vice President Mike Pence are in total agreement that the vice president has the power to act and block the certification of the 2020 presidential election results on Wednesday.\n\nThe president's comments came after The New York Times on Tuesday reported that Pence, during a conversation with Trump, told him that he had no power to block the certification of the election results during the joint session of Congress on Wednesday.\n\nTRUMP SLAMS MCCONNELL, THUNE, CORNYN AS 'WEAK,' 'INEFFECTIVE' RINOS AHEAD OF ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION\n\nThe New York Times report regarding comments Vice President Pence supposedly made to me today is fake news. He never said that, Trump said in a statement Tuesday night. The Vice President and I are in total agreement that the Vice President has the power to act.\n\nThe president said that the election was corrupt in contested states, and in particular it was not in accordance with the Constitution in that they made large scale changes to election rules and regulations as dictated by local judges and politicians, not by state legislators.\n\nThis means that it was illegal, Trump said.\n\nTrump went on to say that Pence has several options under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTRUMP PUTS PRESSURE ON PENCE AHEAD OF ELECTION SHOWDOWN IN CONGRESS\n\nHe can decertify the results or send them back to the states for change and certification, Trump said. He can also decertify the illegal and corrupt results and send them to the House of Representatives for the one vote for one state tabulation.\n\nA spokesman for Pence declined to comment.\n\nVice President Mike Pence will preside over the joint session on Wednesday, but he is expected to play a mostly ceremonial role.\n\nOn Tuesday morning, the president insisted that Pence has the power to overturn the election results.\n\nThe Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors, the president tweeted on Tuesday morning.\n\nAnd Monday night, at an election eve rally in Georgia for the two GOP senators running in the state's twin U.S. Senate runoff contests, Trump told the large crowd of supporters, I hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you.\n\nI hope that our great vice president – our great vice president, comes through for us. He's a great guy. Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him as much, Trump emphasized.\n\nBut White House officials told Fox News on Tuesday that Pence will follow the law, saying that Pence is taking a very diligent and studious approach to his job tomorrow.\n\nHe has consulted at length with staff. He has gone through the Electoral Count Act several times, an official said. He has read legal opinions, met with the Senate parliamentarian and consulted with outside experts on the subject matter.\n\nBut those officials add that the vice president will follow the law. He will act tomorrow with fidelity to the law and the Constitution.\n\nMeanwhile, more than a dozen Senate Republicans have said they will object to the certification of the presidential election results in at least one state, and more than 100 House Republican members said they plan to object to results in Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Georgia.\n\nBut Republicans, like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., Sens. John Thune of South Dakota, John Cornyn of Texas, Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Tim Scott of South Carolina, among others, have committed to voting to certify the election results.\n\nTrump has repeatedly charged for two months that the presidential election was rigged and has claimed that there was massive voter fraud in a handful of battleground states where Biden narrowly edged the president, to score a 306-232 Electoral College victory over the GOP incumbent.\n\nCRUZ-LED GROUP TO OBJECT TO CERTIFICATION OF ELECTION RESULTS IN AT LEAST 1 STATE, PUSH ELECTORAL COMMISSION\n\nThe Trump campaign has launched a number of legal challenges, while Trump himself has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Joe Biden's victories.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told the Associated Press last month that to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\n\nMeanwhile, on the sidelines of the joint-session of Congress, the president is expected to speak at a pro-Trump rally in Washington, D.C.\n\nI will be speaking at the SAVE AMERICA RALLY tomorrow on the Ellipse at 11AM Eastern. Arrive early—doors open at 7AM Eastern. BIG CROWDS! Trump tweeted Tuesday night.\n\nThe president, last month, promised a wild protest in the nation's capital on Jan. 6, while reiterating his claims that it was statistically impossible to have lost the 2020 Election.\n\nAlso Tuesday night, the president tweeted that Washington is being inundated with people who don't want to see an election victory stolen by emboldened Radical Left Democrats.\n\nOur Country has had enough, they won't take it anymore! We hear you (and love you) from the Oval Office, Trump tweeted. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\n\nFox News' John Roberts and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.
Congress hasn't been allowed to wear hats on the House floor since 1837, but the newly Democratic-controlled House voted to change that to accommodate lawmakers who wear religious headwear.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rules Committee Chairman Jim McGovern, D-Mass., proposed the changes last month and it passed Thursday 234-197. The changes allow one of the first female Muslim members of Congress, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who also co-authored the proposal, to wear her headscarf.\n\nNEW CONGRESS HAS FEW CHRISTIANS, MORE RELIGIOUS DIVERSITY\n\nThe new rule reads: During the session of the House, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not wear nonreligious headdress or a hat or remain by the Clerk's desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots, the rule change reads.\n\nOmar celebrated the change Friday on Twitter, calling it a move to make Congress more inclusive for all with an apparent swipe at the Trump administration.\n\nI thank my colleagues for welcoming me, and I look forward to the day we lift the Muslim ban separating families all over the U.S. from their loved ones, she wrote.\n\nFlorida Rep. Frederica Wilson, known for her wide collection of hats, tried to get the rule evoked in 2010, calling it sexist, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nIt dates back to when men wore hats and we know that men don't wear hats indoors, but women wear hats indoors, Wilson said. Hats are what I wear. People get excited when they see the hats. Once you get accustomed to it, it's just me. Some people wear wigs, or high heel shoes or big earrings or pins. This is just me.\n\nWhile her efforts were unsuccessful, a spokesman for then-House Speaker John Boehner told PolitiFact: The rule regarding hats has never been interpreted to apply to religious headcoverings.\n\nFIRST DAY OF 116TH CONGRESS BEGINS WITH PRAYER, ENDS WITH A PROFANITY\n\nNathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union Advocacy Center, which represents the interests of Orthodox Jews, said no Jewish House member had made the ban an issue in the past.\n\nBut there have been special House sessions when Jewish men wore head coverings — including when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed Congress, and Israeli officials wore kippahs or kippot in Hebrew.\n\nThe Orthodox Union has long supported laws and policies that foster the accommodation of religious practices in the workplace, Diament told the Washington Post. Religious practices — such as wearing religious garb, whether a kippot or a hijab, should be accommodated in all workplaces — including in the halls of Congress,
As Hollywood wrestles with what to do about the upcoming Oscars telecast following the Kevin Hart controversy, one writer thinks he knows the perfect host: veteran actor James Woods.\n\nIn a Saturday op-ed piece for the New York Post, media writer Jon Levine argues that Woods, 71, could draw millions of new and old viewers to the annual Hollywood gala during an era when award shows of all kinds are facing declining ratings and accusations of anti-conservative bias.\n\nWoods, a Trump-loving conservative, has gained a following in recent years by bashing critics of the president and liberals in general on Twitter. He currently has 1.9 million followers.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYes, there would be 'outrage,' Levine writes. Hollywood's Jacobins of propriety would express their horror. Screenshots of trollish old tweets (and there have been many) would make the rounds. Words like 'racist' and 'sexist' would fly a mile a minute. But those costs would be a pittance compared to the millions of new viewers he'd bring in (along with the old viewers who'd be excited to see something different for a change).\n\nLevine cites the current climate of political correctness, noting that comic legends like Joan Rivers, Don Rickles and even Jerry Seinfeld would not escape today's censors.\n\nSo, in that spirit, why not go full bore with James Woods? Embracing the offensive and learning to laugh at ourselves should be things that bring us together, he writes.\n\nThe Oscars were sent into crisis mode in December when comedian Hart was selected to host the 91st Academy Awards, scheduled for Feb. 24. Within 24 hours, several of Hart's years-old tweets and jokes, which some had deemed anti-gay, had resurfaced.\n\nLGBTQ groups immediately called for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to rescind Hart's hosting invite.\n\nIn one of the tweets, Hart wrote: Yo if my son comes home & try's 2 play with my daughters doll house I'm going 2 break it over his head & say n my voice 'stop that's gay.\n\nWoods has also come under fire for several tweets and was even temporarily locked out of Twitter for a satirical meme encouraging men not to vote in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nIn 2017, he likened a child to a serial killer in what many called a transphobic tweet.\n\nThis is sweet. Wait until this poor kid grows up, realizes what you've done, and stuffs both of you dismembered into a freezer in the garage, he tweeted.\n\nHe also used the social media platform to help a veteran contemplating suicide. The actor offered to talk with the veteran privately.\n\nAndrew, don't feel embarrassed that you reached out in the darkness. Nobody thinks you're foolish for that. You know every one of us reaching out to you right now has some depression, too. I'll say it. I do, Woods wrote. I'm following you now, so you can DM me. We can talk privately. Or we can talk openly right here. Lot of people worried about you right now.\n\nSo think about this. A lot of vets, I understand, have come to where you are tonight. If you could just push this decision off tonight, at least, maybe you would also inspire another vet to seek help. You could save another man, too. By waiting to do this.\n\nAmid the outcry over his selection as Oscars host, Hart, 39, apologized to the LGBTQ community and stepped down from the hosting gig. He is now evaluating retaking the job after Ellen DeGeneres told him she reached out to the Academy on his behalf and they said they wanted him to host.\n\nI called the Academy today because I really want you to host the Oscars, DeGeneres told Hart in her talk show that aired Friday. We want him to host, whatever we can do, we'd be thrilled, DeGeneres said the Academy told her. The Academy is saying what can we do to make this happen.\n\nELLEN DEGENERES CATCHING HEAT AFTER DEFENDING KEVIN HART IN INTERVIEW\n\nHart told DeGeneres he was still angry about how the tweets were brought up less than a day after he was given the hosting job.\n\nThis is stuff I have addressed. I'm not going to pay it any mind because when you feed into that stuff you only add more fuel to the fire, Hart said. You have put a lot of things on my mind. Leaving here, I'm promising you I'm evaluating this conversation … Let me assess, just sit in the space and really think.\n\nOr the Academy could take a cue from writer Levine and give the opportunity to someone like Woods.
Most Democrats identify as liberals for the first time, according to an analysis released Tuesday -- marking the latest sign of a leftward shift of the Democratic Party as it lurches to the fringes on issues such as Medicare-for-all, amnesty for illegal immigrants and a Green New Deal.\n\nAccording to the Gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of Democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. That was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. In 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. Among Americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in Gallup's first poll in 1992.\n\nThe study is the latest evidence of a party that is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate -- particularly on health care, economics and immigration.\n\nSOCIALISM RISING: DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION, AS PARTY LURCHES LEFT\n\nOn Tuesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city -- including illegal immigrants.\n\nWhile the federal government works to gut health care for millions of Americans, New York City is leading the way by guaranteeing that every New Yorker has access to quality, comprehensive access to care, regardless of immigration status or their ability to pay, he said in a statement.\n\nDe Blasio's announcement came after California's new Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting ObamaCare. Medi-Cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, up from 19, according to Newsom's new agenda.\n\nThose left-wing voices presenting once-fringe ideas are also growing louder in Washington, particularly among the new intake of members in the House who have been bolder in embracing left-wing policy proposals and terms like Democratic Socialism.\n\nA New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., one of the new members in the House and a rising Democratic star, has pushed universal health care as well as a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive Green New Deal that she said would be a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy.\n\nA draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.\n\nIf that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. Its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.\n\nSo far a number of House members, as well as top 2020 prospects, have offered their support to the proposal.\n\nIt is therefore no surprise that Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the term Democratic socialism. Another new House member Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America. In the Senate, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called himself a Democratic socialist and ran a vigorous 2016 primary challenge to ultimate nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe mood in Congress has extended to voters, in particular young people and Democrats, who polls have shown are warming to socialism over capitalism.\n\nAMERICANS WARMING TO SOCIALISM OVER CAPITALISM, POLLS SHOW\n\nA Gallup poll in August showed that 51 percent of 18-29 year-olds back socialism, compared with 47 percent who back capitalism. Meanwhile, 57 percent of Democrats say they hold a positive view of socialism, compared with just 47 percent who support capitalism.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News reached out to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Majority Whip James Clyburn and the Democratic National Committee to ask if they thought socialism was a good thing for America. They did not respond.\n\nFox News' Alex Pappas and Maxim Lott contributed to this report.
CNN political commentator Nina Turner said President Trump whines like a baby and declared that Republicans should change the president's diapers during an appearance on CNN Tonight with Don Lemon on Thursday.\n\nI mean the president, he's a whiner, he whines like a baby. He's a liar and he's a whiner. And I think what needs to happen is the Republicans got to go over there and change the president's diapers, Turner said.\n\nThat's what this is coming down to, so that he can cut it out, so the grown folks, the big girls and the big boys can go around, sit around the table and do what is necessary for this government, she said. The whining and the lying must stop.\n\nLemon responded, That's quite a mental picture.\n\nCNN'S BRIAN STELTER PONDERS CENSORING TRUMP WITH A '10 MINUTE DELAY' DURING LIVE EVENTS\n\nThe conversation came about when Lemon hosted a panel discussion about President Trump's Thursday impromptu press briefing, when he was criticized for not taking questions.\n\nLemon called Trump's appearance in the briefing room a stunt that didn't work.\n\nCNN was particularly fired up on Thursday evening, as the network also featured political commentator Rick Wilson mocking Trump supporters as a 10-toothed base, while CNN's Brian Stelter floated an idea of using a 10 minute delay whenever President Trump speaks, in order for the network to pick and choose what is aired.\n\nNewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck said the outrage that Trump over Trump's briefing on Thursday is the latest situation where the administration is damned if they do and damned if they don't, while taking particular exception to Stelter's idea of censoring Trump's message.\n\nSomehow, you have outlets slowly backing away from wanting to carry or talk about briefings and pool sprays after demanding more access almost since day one and it's nonsense, Houck told Fox News. This shows that some in the press want to do all they can to control the message as they face off against a President who's eager to push back. Needless to say, they're not handling it well.
Amid the bombardment of images of what took place at the U.S. Capitol Wednesday, too little time has been spent thinking about why it happened. Anyone who is trying to understand the significance of what's going on ought to watch video of the last moments of Ashli Babbitt, the woman who was shot and killed in the chaos.\n\nFootage, which can easily be found online, shows Babbitt standing in a hallway right off the House floor with an American flag tied around her neck. The scene around her is chaotic. People are bumping into each other, yelling, trying to get through the door into the chamber. Suddenly, with no warning, there is gunfire. You hear a shot and Babbitt falls. People in the hallway scream. The camera closes in on her face. Babbitt looks stunned. She's staring straight ahead. You can see that she knows she's about to die, which she did.\n\nSo what can we learn from this? It's not enough to call it a tragedy. Imagine for a second that Babbitt was your daughter. The last time you spoke to her, she was heading to Washington for a political rally. Now, she's dead. You'll never talk to her again. That's what we're watching, and we may be watching a lot more of it in the coming days.\n\nPolitical violence begets political violence. That is an iron law. We have to be against that, no matter who commits the violence or under what pretext, no matter how many self-interested demagogues assure us the violence is justified or necessary. We have a duty to oppose all of this, not simply because political violence kills other people's children, but because in the end it doesn't work.\n\nTOM COTTON SAYS CAPITOL VIOLENCE MUST BE MET WITH 'FULL FORCE OF THE LAW'\n\nNo good person will live a happier life because Ashli Babbitt was killed in a hallway of the Capitol today. So our only option, as a practical matter, is to fix what is causing this in the first place.\n\nYou may have nothing in common with the people on the other side of the country (increasingly, you probably don't), but you're stuck with them. The idea that groups of Americans will somehow break off into separate peaceful nations of like-minded citizens is a fantasy. The two hemispheres of this country are inseparably intertwined, like conjoined twins. Neither can leave without killing the other. As horrifying as this moment is, we have no option but to make it better, to gut it out.\n\nThe second thing to consider, and it's related to the first, is why Ashli Babbitt went to the rally in the first place. She bore no resemblance to the angry children we have seen wrecking our cities in recent months -- pasty, entitled nihilists dressed in black, setting fires and spray painting slogans on statues. She looked pretty much like everyone else.\n\nSo why was she there? We ought to think about that. If you want to fix it, you have to think about that.\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH RIPS 'RECKLESS BEHAVIOR OF SOME POLITICAL LEADERS'\n\nThe only reason this country is rich and successful is because for hundreds of years, we have enjoyed a stable political system. The only reason that system is stable is because it's a democracy, responsive to voters.\n\nDemocracy is a pressure relief valve. As long as people sincerely believe they can change things by voting, they stay calm. They don't burst into the House chamber. They talk and they organize and they vote. But the opposite is also true if people begin to believe that their democracy is fraudulent, that voting is a charade, that the system is rigged and it's run in secret by a small group of powerful, dishonest people who are acting in their own interests. Then, God knows what could happen.\n\nActually, we do know what could happen, because it's happening right now. It's happened in countless other countries over countless centuries. And the cycle is always the same because human nature never changes.\n\nListen to us! scream the population.\n\nREP. VICKY HARTZLER: I'M A HOUSE MEMBER CAUGHT UP IN SCARY CAPITOL ATTACK BY OWN CITIZENS\n\nShut up and do what you're told, say their leaders.\n\nIn the face of dissent, the first instinct of illegitimate leadership is to crack down on the population, but crackdowns never make it better. They always make the country more volatile and more dangerous. The people in charge rarely understand that. They don't care to learn or listen, because all of this conversation is a referendum on them and their leadership. So they clamp down harder.\n\nThis is the Romanov program, and it ends badly every single time. But that doesn't mean they won't try it again. Of course they will, because it's their nature. It's how we got here in the first place.\n\nMillions of Americans sincerely believe the last election was fake. You can dismiss them as crazy. You can call them conspiracy theorists. You can kick them off Twitter. But that won't change their minds. Rather than trying to change their minds, to convince them and reassure them that the system is real and that democracy works -- which you would do if you cared about the country or the people who live here -- our new leaders will try to silence them.\n\nWhat happened Wednesday will be used by the people taking power to justify stripping you of the rights you were born with as an American: Your right to speak without being censored, your right to assemble, to not be spied upon, to make a living, and to defend your family.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThese are the most basic and ancient freedoms that we have. They're why we live here in the first place. They're why we're proud to be Americans. They're what make us different, and they're all now in peril.\n\nWhen thousands of your countrymen storm the Capitol building, you don't have to like it. We don't. You can be horrified by the violence, and we are.\n\nBut if you don't bother to pause and learn a single thing from your citizens storming your Capitol building, then you're a fool, you lack wisdom and self-awareness, and you have no place running a country. We got to this sad, chaotic day for a reason.\n\nThis article is adapted from Tucker Carlson's opening commentary on the Jan. 6, 2021 edition of Tucker Carlson Tonight.
The federal government will remain partially shuttered as the new 116th Congress begins work Thursday – but history will be made as many of the new members are sworn in.\n\nFollowing the midterm elections, Democrats regained control of the U.S. House – setting up Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to take back the speaker's gavel. Pelosi was the first woman ever to serve as House speaker when she was first tapped for the job in 2007.\n\nHere's a look at five things to watch as Congress comes back to work.\n\nNancy Pelosi set to reclaim speaker title\n\nCalifornia Rep. Nancy Pelosi is expected to get her old job as House speaker back as the new Congress convenes Thursday. Pelosi made history as the first woman elected speaker of the House in 2007 – and she will be the first lawmaker to regain the gavel in more than a half-century.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi, 78, faced early opposition from some in her own party who called for a fresh generation of guidance. But one-by-one, Pelosi managed to win over several skeptics through promising lead positions on their legislative priorities or special panels. She also struck a deal with Democrats by vowing to serve no more than four years in the leadership position.\n\nTRUMP VERSUS DEMOCRATS: A LOOK AT WHICH LAWMAKERS ARE SET TO BATTLE THE PRESIDENT IN 2019\n\nIn accepting the gavel, Pelosi will give a nod to the new era of divided government with a pledge to reach across the aisle in this chamber and across the divisions in this great nation, according to excerpts of her prepared remarks.\n\nGovernment shutdown continues\n\nAs the new Congress convenes, the partial government shutdown continues in its 13th day – with no end in sight in the showdown between Trump and lawmakers over funding for a border wall.\n\nThe Democrat-controlled House plans to vote on a pair of bills to reopen the government, which includes a plan to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion allotted for border security. Other departments affected by the partial shutdown would be funded for the remainder of the fiscal year until the end of September.\n\nLINDSEY GRAHAM: TRUMP CAVING ON BORDER SECURITY 'PROBABLY THE END OF HIS PRESIDENCY'\n\nBut neither the White House nor the Republican-controlled Senate is likely to budge and support a bill that doesn't allocate for the $5 billion for a border wall that Trump demanded.\n\nBoth parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people – this is the first and most important duty of government, Trump tweeted Wednesday night. I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.\n\nHistory made with incoming lawmakers\n\nThe new Congress will make history for seating a record number of women and becoming the most racially and ethnically diverse. Additionally, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, is the youngest woman elected to Congress at 29 years old.\n\nMichigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar will become the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. Tlaib will take her oath on a 1734 English translation Quran that belonged to former President Thomas Jefferson.\n\nWOMEN POISED TO MAKE HISTORY WITH 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS\n\nAnd Sharice Davids of Kansas along with Deb Haaland of New Mexico will be the first Native American women to serve in Congress. Davids, an activist and lawyer, will also set a record as the first LGBT Native American elected to the House.\n\nIn all, 127 women — 106 Democrats 21 Republicans — will serve in the 116th Congress, holding nearly 24 percent of all seats, according to the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University.\n\nPush for Green New Deal and other progressive policies\n\nTwo self-described Democratic Socialists will officially join Congress Thursday (Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez) as big-government policies – such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for all – are on the agenda for some party members.\n\nIt's unclear when and if any of these programs will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years and reflects a shift in the party itself.\n\nWhile echoing the language of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Green New Deal aims to combat both climate change and income inequality. It's pushed by progressive lawmakers including Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.\n\nSOCIALISM RISING: DEMS TAKE HOUSE PUSHING MASSIVE GOVERNMENT EXPANSION, AS PARTY LURCHES LEFT\n\nA draft proposal, which calls for a select committee to be formed to create an official plan, calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture while dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources as well. It also demands a job guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one.\n\nSingle-payer proposals, like Medicare for all, would rely on the government to control the health care system. It's been championed by more progressive Democrats, and more than half of House Democrats in the new Congress have supported plans to open Medicare to any American, regardless of age, according to The New York Times.\n\nCalifornia Democrat aims to impeach Trump\n\nRep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., plans to hit the ground running as Democrats take control of the House Thursday – by introducing articles of impeachment against Trump, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nHe is accusing the president of obstructing justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey, the newspaper reported.\n\nEvery day, Donald Trump shows that leaving the White House would be good for our country, Sherman, 64, said.\n\nINSIDE NANCY PELOSI'S BATTLE FOR HOUSE SPEAKER\n\nThis isn't the first time Sherman has introduced articles of impeachment against Trump. But when he did so in 2017, Republicans controlled the House.\n\nPelosi isn't ruling out impeachment proceedings entirely. Ahead of the new Congress convening, she told NBC News she wants to see what comes from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.\n\nWe shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason, she said.\n\nFox News' Lukas Mikelionis, Adam Shaw and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is one of the rising stars of the new Democrat-led Congress and the left's latest media darling. Millions were captivated by her surprising 2018 primary victory over long-time liberal House member Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., and her achievement of becoming, at age 29, the youngest woman ever elected to Congress.\n\nBut make no mistake about it: Despite receiving widespread positive attention from many in the press, Ocasio-Cortez's radical left-wing policy proposals and her socialist ideology present a significant threat to America's economy and its longstanding commitment to individual liberty. Ocasio-Cortez doesn't simply want to tweak our existing system, she wants to complete Barack Obama's goal of fundamentally transforming the United States of America.\n\nAt the foundation of all of Ocasio-Cortez's reforms is her commitment to socialism, an economic system that in its most utopian form aims to eliminate nearly all private property and puts the collective—which, in a democratic society, is simply the majority of voters—in charge of every aspect of life, including the education of your children, the extent of your rights to practice your religion, and your most important health care decisions.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM JUSTIN HASKINS\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA doesn't merely want to create new government-run social programs, it desires, in the words of a member of DSA and the editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin, to in the long run … end capitalism. On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.\n\nDSA remains a fringe political organization in most of the country, but it was an integral part of helping its most famous member, Ocasio-Cortez, get elected in New York.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOcasio-Cortez's commitment to enacting democratic socialism is evident in many of her policy proposals, especially her plan for a Green New Deal. According to a draft resolution produced by Ocasio-Cortez to create a House climate change committee, the Green New Deal would eliminate nearly all fossil fuels in the United States by 2030 and instead force consumers to buy 100 percent of their power from renewable energy sources like wind and solar, which cost as much as five times more than existing fossil-fuel-power generation, and to purchase electric cars.\n\nEven more disturbing, Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal includes upgrading every residential and industrial building for state-of-the-art energy efficiency, comfort and safety, a plan that would cost trillions of dollars and give government access to every household in America.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), the largest socialist organization in the United States. DSA doesn't merely want to create new government-run social programs, it desires, in the words of a member of DSA and the editor of the socialist magazine Jacobin, to in the long run … end capitalism. On its website, DSA blames, in part, the globalization of capital for racism, sexism, homophobia, and environmental degradation.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's commitment to socialism isn't limited to energy and environment-related issues, either. She has also called for the passage of Medicare for All, legislation proposed by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., that would put the government in charge of the entire health care industry—at a cost of $32 trillion, according to estimates from the Mercatus Center. And she has proposed creating multiple other trillion-dollar government programs, like a federal jobs guarantee that would pay anyone who wants a government job a living wage and other basic income programs, which are designed to pay lower-income and non-working people money, even if they are able-bodied and could work.\n\nOcasio-Cortez backs creating a radical government-funded program that would make public colleges tuition-free and cancel the $1.5 trillion in outstanding student loan debt, and she pledged during her campaign to support strict gun-control measures and plans to make housing a human right.\n\nHow does Ocasio-Cortez plan to pay for these massive programs? In a 60 Minutes interview with Anderson Cooper that will air on Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez suggested that some of her plans could be paid for by raising taxes on the wealthy to rates as high as 70 percent. But even that huge tax increase wouldn't be nearly enough to pay for her numerous policy proposals, which is why Ocasio-Cortez has suggested the United States create a system of new publicly-owned banks that the government could use to run up the national debt. She has also called for printing money to pay for her socialist reforms.\n\nOcasio-Cortez wants to impose her radical, socialist vision on every single American citizen, a fact most of those in the mainstream media who have spent the past several months fawning over her refuse to tell the public. We must stand against these assaults on capitalism and our personal freedoms, or else the next generation of Americans won't have access to the same liberties millions of our forefathers sacrificed for. For those of us who support free markets and personal liberty, losing this ideological battle is not an option.
Sen. Bernie Sanders apologized Thursday following multiple reports of women who were sexually harassed or assaulted by one of his staffers during his 2016 presidential bid. Earlier Thursday, reports surfaced that a top aide was accused of sexually assaulting a female subordinate.\n\nTo the women in that campaign who were harassed or mistreated I apologize. Our standards and safeguards were inadequate, Sanders said in a statement posted to social media.\n\nHe thanked the women who did come forward with complaints of sexual misconduct and ensured that his 2018 Senate re-election campaign had established some of the strongest sexual harassment policies in the country.\n\nRobert Becker, the former Iowa state director for Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, allegedly made several inappropriate comments to a younger, female subordinates before he forcibly kissed her while at a bar with other staffers following the Democratic National Convention, Politico reported earlier Thursday.\n\nThe anonymous staffer, who is in her 20s, and other witnesses told Politico Becker said he wanted to have sex with her while at the Philadelphia bar. Later, he grabbed her wrists and head, forcibly kissed her and put his tongue in her mouth, she and other witnesses alleged.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS SAYS HE'LL 'PROBABLY RUN' IN 2020 IF HE'S THE 'BEST CANDIDATE TO BEAT' TRUMP\n\nThe woman did not report the incident at the time since the campaign was finished but has come forward now as Becker has been involved with potential 2020 groundwork.\n\nIt just really sucks because no one ever held him accountable, and he kept pushing and pushing and seeing how much he could get away with, the woman said. This can't happen in 2020. You can't run for president of the United States unless you acknowledge that every campaign demands a safe work environment for every employee and volunteer.\n\nBERNIE SANDERS UNDER SIEGE AT CRITICAL 2020 MOMENT: 'THE PROBLEM HAS TO BE DEALT WITH'\n\nBecker, who is now 50, dismissed the accusations, saying they are at odds with my recollection of a late evening filled with many hugs and kisses and tears and conversations about what's next.\n\nNo charges have been filed.\n\nHillary Clinton officially secured the Democratic presidential nomination over Sanders at the convention.\n\nOther former aides accused Becker of using social media to determine potential female hires' attractiveness, according to Politico. Becker, however, said he was just tasked with reviewing potentially questionable or damaging social media posts of potential hires.\n\nBecker traveled to South Carolina – the first-in-the-South primary state – in December for meetings with former Sanders campaign staffers, CNBC previously reported. But Jeff Weaver, who ran Sanders' 2016 campaign, stressed then that Becker was not doing so in an official capacity as he doesn't work for the campaign because there is no campaign.\n\nAmid speculation that Sanders could seek the White House again, the progressive senator has faced fallout as broader sexual harassment complaints stemming from the 2016 bid have come to light in recent weeks.\n\nMore than two dozen former staffers recently sent a letter to Sanders and his aides, seeking a meeting regarding the sexual violence and harassment on the 2016 campaign ahead of another bid for the presidency. Additionally, numerous women have complained they were paid less than men and forced into inappropriate and uncomfortable situations, according to The New York Times. A former Sanders delegate called the culture an entire wave of rotten sexual harassment that seemingly was never dealt with.\n\nSanders said he was unaware of the alleged behavior happening during his campaign because he was a little busy running for president. But he also apologized to any woman who felt that she was not treated appropriately, adding that if he does decide to run again he would do better.\n\nThursday, he said the country needs a cultural revolution in order to change workplace attitudes and behavior.\n\nI intend in every way to be actively involved in that process, Sanders said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe harassment controversy isn't entirely new. Allegations of sexism briefly surfaced during Sanders' 2016 bid as some of his young, white male supporters who went online to aggressively attack Clinton and her followers were pejoratively labeled Bernie Bros; however, the stories didn't seriously impact his bid for the Democratic nomination.\n\nSanders commanded the left flank of the party in 2016 as he crushed Clinton in the New Hampshire primary – propelling him into a marathon battle with the former secretary of state up until the party convention. But that might not necessarily be the case again in 2020 as progressive Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren has launched an exploratory committee and has traveled to Iowa.\n\nOther liberal lawmakers, such as Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California, are also considered to be potential 2020 contenders.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace.\n\nShutdown, day 23, the longest halt to government funding in American history, as each side digs in over the border wall.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: What the president is proposing is not the best way to protect our borders.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: The Democrats don't care about the border and they don't care about crime.\n\nWALLACE: Now the president weighs declaring a national emergency and funding the wall.\n\nTRUMP: Congress should do this. If they can't do it, I will declare a national emergency.\n\nWALLACE: We'll get the latest on where negotiations stand --\n\nSEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, R-S.C.: I have never been more depressed about moving forward than right now. I just don't see a pathway forward.\n\nWALLACE: -- from Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and we'll ask Democratic Senator Chris Coons if his party is willing to make a deal. Senators Graham and Coons only on FOX News Sunday.\n\nThen, The New York Times reports the FBI investigated whether President Trump was working for the Russians. We'll ask our Sunday panel what the bombshell revelation means for the Mueller investigation.\n\nAll, right now, on Fox News Sunday.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And hello again from Fox News in Washington.\n\nThe government shutdown is now in week four, the longest in U.S. history, a record no one here in Washington can be proud of. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers face their first payday Friday without getting paid. Talks to reopen nine federal departments have broken down and lawmakers are out of town until tomorrow afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, the president has gone back and forth on whether to declare a national emergency at the border.\n\nLet's get the latest now from Kevin Corke live at the White House -- Kevin.\n\nKEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, from the White House to the southern border, a more measured tone from administration officials this week about the need for enhanced border security, a lot less talk about a wall and more about the exploding humanitarian crisis.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nTRUMP: We are here today to address the humanitarian and security crisis on our southern border. This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul.\n\nKIRSTJEN NIELSEN, DHS SECRETARY: This is a severe humanitarian and security crisis.\n\nCORKE: On Twitter, Mr. Trump insisted that Democrats come back from their vacations and get back to work: I'm in the White House ready to sign. A sharp elbowed reference to the thousands of Democratic lawmakers who trotted to Puerto Rico for a retreat, where they hope to strategize ways to help the dead mired U.S. territory and even planned to see a special performance of the hit Broadway show Hamilton.\n\nThis is as The New York Times reported that the FBI allegedly looked into whether or not the president was secretly working on behalf of Russia during and following the 2016 campaign, a suggestion that drew a scathing rebuke from the president's attorney John Dowd who wrote The New York Times story is an unwitting disclosure and verification of the utter corruption of their oaths by Comey and his colleagues to undermine the free election of the president of the United States.\n\nJEANINE PIRRO, HOST: Are you know or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President ?\n\nTRUMP: I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked. I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCORKE: Quite a week here in Washington. By the way, Chris, the White House has asked the Army Corps of Engineers to look into additional possible ways to help fund border security, including an examination of the 2018 February emergency supplemental. They say that would actually draw funds from disaster relief. We'll see if that happens -- Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from a snowy White House -- Kevin, thank you.\n\nJoining us now from South Carolina, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who after meeting with the president Friday urged him to use his executive powers to build a wall.\n\nSenator, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n\nGRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: This week, you first tried to arrange a compromise, a border wall funding in return for some protection for the Dreamers. The White House said no.\n\nGRAHAM: No.\n\nWALLACE: Now, you are telling the president, urging the president to use his executive powers to fund the wall and the president on Friday said not so fast.\n\nQuestion, what is the president's strategy?\n\nGRAHAM: I just talked to them about 30 minutes ago. He says let's make a deal. They did not turn down wall for the bridge, that's not that story line. I tried to see if we could open up the government for limited period of time to negotiate a deal and the president says, let's make a deal, then open up the government.\n\nNancy Pelosi says, even if you open up the government, I wouldn't fund a wall. So, that's why I'm depressed. You know, there's not much talk about what she said. She's telling the president, even if you open up the government, I'm not going to do a deal on the wall. And that's a nonstarter for the president.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I don't mean in any way to cast aspersions on the president or Nancy Pelosi, but do you know one of the definitions of insanity is to keep doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result.\n\nGRAHAM: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: What's going to go on? President says make a deal, the Democrats say not funding for the wall. Not saying it's right or wrong --\n\nGRAHAM: Right.\n\nWALLACE: -- but what happens?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, I think it just plays out. What bothers me so much is that your next guests, Chris Coons, a great guy. We could sit down to make a deal with him wall, plus DACA, wall plus TPS. Every Democrat that I've worked with for about ten years now has agreed to funding for barriers/walls on Obama's watch, on Bush's watch, and all of a sudden, it's a bad thing on Trump's watch.\n\nIt really does perplex me how you expect this to end when you tell the president of the United States, you get $1 for a wall when in the past Democrats have appropriated billions for the wall. What are we supposed to do? Just give in? He's not going to give in.\n\nWALLACE: He's not going to give in.\n\nHe said in a tweet, I believe it was yesterday, that he has a plan. What's the plan?\n\nGRAHAM: The plan is to do a deal. He is willing, in my view, to do wall plus. Funding for the wall that we desperately need that's been done in the past. See if we can do a deal around the TPS recipients who are going to lose their legal status.\n\nWALLACE: Those are temporary protected status.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Let me just state, temporary protected status.\n\nGRAHAM: Right.\n\nWALLACE: People who came in from disasters.\n\nGRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nYes, there are about 400,000. They are going to lose their legal status soon. He's willing to extend that. The DACA recipients, they are all tied up in court but I think he would give them work permits for three years, one-time renewable if you could get wall funding.\n\nI don't want to speak for the president. I don't want to lock him in, but I'm confident what I just described with a few other things would be a deal acceptable to the White House. And a lot of Democrats -- and I'm just so frustrated -- we can't get in a room and hammer it out.\n\nWALLACE: Now, some White House officials it's been reported are now talking about well, maybe the president will be using his State of the Union speech to make this case.\n\nGRAHAM: Right.\n\nWALLACE: That's 16 days from now. Some White House officials are talking about this extending into February.\n\nHow much damage does that two of this government shutdown goes on for weeks, even into next month?\n\nGRAHAM: Less damage than if we don't fix a broken immigration system. You've got to bad choices here. Continue to stalemate and see parts of the government shutdown, it will be inconvenient and it can create problems. Into the federal workforce, I'm sorry you caught up in this mess. But the real damage is people coming across the border, selling drugs, killing Americans, that needs to come to an end. So, the real damage is a broken border compared to a partial shutdown.\n\nThe president is not going to give in. No wall, no deal, but he's ready to deal. And your next guest I am sure would provide funding for a barrier where it made sense if he could get something for it.\n\nWALLACE: You have been one of the loudest voices among Republicans urging the president to declare a national emergency. I have two questions.\n\nGRAHAM: Right.\n\nWALLACE: One, why doesn't he just go ahead and do that? He seems to think that's a way out of this.\n\nSecondly, there are a lot of your GOP colleagues who say that would be a terrible precedent because someday, there's going to be a Democratic president and they're going to say, well, you know what, it's a national emergency, so let's fund climate change. It's going to be a national emergency, so let's fund income inequality.\n\nGRAHAM: Let's start with the president. I ask him, Mr. President if you want to go down the emergency path, I stand with you. He said just 30 minutes ago, that's my last option. I think the legislative route is the best way to go, let's make a deal, but I will do it if I have to.\n\nSo, we have found, in the past, presidents declared emergencies for different things. I am going to support him. Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we are almost there, I would urge them to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.\n\nBut I think the legislative path is just about shut off because Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the House, said, even if you open up the government, I will give you $1 for the wall. As long as that's the case, we are never going to get a legislative package no matter what the Senate does.\n\nWALLACE: I want to just pursue this emergency option one more time because in 2014, President Obama used his executive powers to try and protect 5 million immigrants, and here's what you said at the time.\n\nGRAHAM: Right.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nGRAHAM: This is wrong, it's a responsible and will do damage to our efforts to fix a broken immigration system. This is a tremendous presidential overreach.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: So, why was that an overreach for President Obama then but not for President Trump now?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, what President Obama did, he didn't declare a national emergency about the DACA recipients. He took his power to pardon an individual or a smaller group and applied it to 1.8 million people. Ever president -- not every, a lot of presidents have declared emergencies. After 9/11, we did and they have taken money and powers to deal with a national emergency.\n\nI think there is a crisis at the border. I think it fits the definition of a national emergency. It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option.\n\nHow do you negotiate with the speaker of the House when she tells you even if you open up the government are not going to give you but $1 for the wall? So, until that changes, there's not much left except the national emergency approach.\n\nAnd to my Republican colleagues: Stand behind the president as this is his last option. He ran on this as a centerpiece of his presidency, and it is a crisis. And if you don't see the crisis, you are not looking very hard.\n\nWALLACE: OK, I want to switch subjects. The New York Times now reports that after President Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, that the bureau opened up a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was working on behalf of the Russians. One, did you know about that? Two, what do you think -- I have to say, it's an astonishing idea.\n\nThe FBI, the bureau investigating whether the president was a Russian agent.\n\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, that story came from somebody who leaked it with an agenda. So I'd like to know who leaked it because they have an agenda not very friendly to President Trump and I for one don't trust what I read in The New York Times.\n\nHaving said all that, I'm going to ask the FBI director, was there a counterintelligence investigation opened up regarding the president as being a potential agent of the Russians? I find it astonishing and to me, it tells me a lot about the people running the FBI, McCabe and that crowd. I don't trust them as far as I throw them.\n\nSo, if this really did happen, Congress needs to know about it and what I want to do is make sure how could the FBI do that? What kind of checks and balances are there?\n\nWALLACE: Let me -- you have a lot of clout in asking the FBI questions because you're the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee -- congratulations, Mr. Chairman.\n\nGRAHAM: Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: And your committee is going to begin holding confirmation hearings this week on the president's nomination of William Barr to be the new attorney general. What do you intend to ask him about the special counsel investigation, and whether or not the special counsel is going to be allowed to finish his investigation and issue a full, unedited report to Congress?\n\nGRAHAM: I'm going to ask him, do you see any reason to fire Mr. Mueller based on what you know now for cause? Do you trust Mr. Mueller to be fair to the president of a country? Will you make sure he can finish his job? If you get the report, will you be as transparent as possible?\n\nI've asked him those questions, and I'm very comfortable with those answers. So, I think you'd be a great attorney general, great job by the president to pick Mr. Barr. I see no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians, but that would be up to Mr. Mueller to make his report to attorney general and he soon will I hope.\n\nWALLACE: Another question for the new chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nJustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg this week after cancer surgery, for the first time, astonishingly, in her quarter-century on the court, missed oral arguments. Now, we all wish her a speedy recovery, the doctors say that she is cancer-free. But there are reports for the White House has begun reviewing a possible short list of candidates to replace her.\n\nAs the chair of the committee that would vote on a replacement, have you given any thought how you'd prevent this from becoming a political circus?\n\nGRAHAM: Well, number one, I wish her well and hope she recovers and continues to serve for many years. But here's what will happen if there's a vacancy, no matter from the liberal wing of the court, there'd be a lot of pushback from the left.\n\nBut my Democratic colleagues felt when they were in charge, we should confirm judges by majority vote. They changed the rules to accommodate President Obama. They tried to stack the court. They never thought Clinton would lose.\n\nSo, what you're going to have is Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer's desire to stack the court on their Democratic watch has come back to haunt them.\n\nIf there is an opening, whether it's Ginsburg or anybody else, I will urge the president to nominate a qualified conservative and hopefully those people will get through, that person will get through and I expect it to be along party lines.\n\nAnd this is what happens when you change the rules. This has come back to bite them. I predicted it would, and we'll see.\n\nI hope Justice Ginsburg serves for a long time, but there's an opening on this court, I'm going to be hell-bent to put a conservative to replace whoever steps down for whatever reason.\n\nWALLACE: And just, finally, and I got about 30 seconds left, if you got Donald Trump -- and again, this is if -- you have Donald Trump replacing a liberal icon like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, isn't that a formula for -- I mean, doesn't that make the Kavanaugh hearings look like a tea party?\n\nGRAHAM: They should have thought of that before they changed the rules. They try to destroy conservative judges. I voted for Sotomayor and Kagan understanding what I was getting. So this decision by Reid and Schumer may come back to haunt them, but I am dead set on making sure it is a conservative nominee.\n\nAnd elections have consequences. The rules of the Senate were changed not by me, by them, and we had to do it on the Supreme Court because they would not give us any votes to nominate anybody and Kavanaugh was a fine man, they tried to destroy him. All this is going to come back to haunt them one day.\n\nWALLACE: Yes, let me just really quickly explained that when the Democrats with the majority, Majority Leader Harry Reid changed it for judicial nominees short of the Supreme Court and for cabinet appointees.\n\nGRAHAM: Right.\n\nWALLACE: It went from the 60-vote margin to 51, and then the Republicans did it for the Supreme Court.\n\nSenator Graham, thank you. Thanks for your time.\n\nGRAHAM: Can I just say one last thing?\n\nWALLACE: Yes, sir.\n\nGRAHAM: One last thing. We don't need -- we don't need one Democrat to replace a liberal justice. And the reason that's the case is because of what Harry Reid did. What he set in motion. Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: Always good to speak with you, sir.\n\nOK. I guess you think it was OK to speak with us.\n\nUp next, Democrats challenge the president to reopen the government and discuss border security measures both sides can agree on. Democratic Senator Chris Coons joins us next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: These days, Donald Trump is facing the toughest set of challenges of his presidency -- the government shutdown, the new Democratic majority in the House and the special counsel's Russia probe that appears to be close to wrapping up.\n\nJoining us now from Delaware, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.\n\nSenator, welcome back to FOX News Sunday.\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D), DELAWARE: Thanks, Chris. Good morning.\n\nWALLACE: House Speaker Pelosi says that the border wall is immoral and that she won't give -- I guess she will give $1 to pay for it. Do you agree with her?\n\nCOONS: Well, I agree with the advice that Lindsey Graham just gave to President Trump, which is that he should reopen the government and we should spend several weeks negotiating over what we can all agree on.\n\nI personally don't think that a border wall is in and of itself immoral. What I think the speaker may have been referring to is some of the immoral immigration policies of the Trump administration, forcibly separating children from parents at the border and detaining children in cage-like facilities. The humanitarian crisis I think may have been what she was referring to.\n\nThe larger point here, Chris, is that we don't have a fundamental disagreement between Democrats who refuse to invest in border security and want open borders and a president who is determined to protect our country. Far from it. All of us have voted for more investment in border security, several times. And the compromise that we worked out before the end of last year, which passed the Senate unanimously, it will give the president another $1.3 billion for border security on top of the $1.3 billion from last year that hasn't been fully spent yet.\n\nI do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer.\n\nWALLACE: So, let's -- you're exactly right. I -- you have voted for a border barrier in the past and I've been looking at your records, so let's put it up on the screen. In 2013, as part of comprehensive immigration reform, you supported $46 billion for border security, including 350 miles of new fencing. In 2018, last year, you and most Senate Democrats approved $25 billion for border security, including physical barriers.\n\nSo here's the question: I understand the idea that you don't want a 2,000- mile wall, but you have supported, and a lot of Democrats, including Pelosi, including Schumer, have supported a border that includes hundreds of miles of fencing. So why not make a deal, a deal that right now without opening the government, why not make a deal that Lindsey Graham was talking about, some money for border barriers, fencing, wall, whatever you want to call it, in return for some concessions on Dreamers and on TPS immigrants?\n\nCOONS: Chris, it would be great. If we could reach a resolution to our country's broken immigration system and find a path forward, we all agree to invest in border security, in new technologies and approaches that would actually make us safer.\n\nOne of the challenges of negotiating with President Trump, as Lindsey Graham knows better than anyone else, is I feel like I've signed up for the Trump of the day club. I don't know what position we're going to get on a negotiation from day one to day two. It was Senator Graham who famously talked about Tuesday Trump and Thursday Trump when he and Senator Durbin brought a comprehensive resolution, a bill, to President Trump last year, he embraced on Tuesday and then walked away and announced it on Thursday.\n\nI will remind you why we are in this situation in the first place. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell put a bill on the floor that was adopted unanimously by the Senate at the end of last year that would have kept the government open and supported 1.3 billion in border security. The president reversed position the next day and rejected something he told Mitch McConnell he would sign.\n\nWhy is Mitch McConnell completely absent from these negotiations? It's because he doesn't really know what the president will accept.\n\nWALLACE: But --\n\nCOONS: I don't expect the president to capitulate. I do expect them to compromise.\n\nWe are clearly not going to build a border wall funded by Mexico but we should negotiate.\n\nWALLACE: Forgive me -- but, Congressman (ph), the question is will Nancy Pelosi compromise? The Republican say, and you heard what Lindsey Graham just said, she's unwilling to give any money for the wall.\n\nI understand the issue with President Trump and he certainly has reversed course a few times. What I'm asking you now, and this is -- we are in week four of the shutdown, so the situation has become dire.\n\nCOONS: Right.\n\nWALLACE: Are you, are the Democrats willing to make a compromise that includes money for a border wall fencing -- a border barrier I will call it -- in return for some concessions from the president on people in this country illegally?\n\nCOONS: I think the president should test that by making it clear what concessions and what compromise he's willing to put forward. Look, Chris, you know me, I work with Republicans regularly. I've been on the phone with a half-dozen Democratic and Republican senators in recent weeks and several different efforts by Republican senators to negotiate a compromise, got cold water thrown in them the next day by the president publicly, even one effort that was being led by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: I mean, because I want to move on --\n\nCOONS: So, compromise and while the government is shut down, I will remind you we got 41,000 federal law enforcement officers out there today being forced to work without pay. We've got farmers all over the country not getting the relief payments for the impact on the soybean industry due to tariff war.\n\nWALLACE: Sir, I understand all that, I'm just asking you if he agrees to a compromise that includes other things that the Democrats want, will the Democrats give way and include money for the border barrier? Yes or no?\n\nCOONS: Democrats will invest in border security. I'm not going to sit here on your show and negotiate on behalf of Speaker Pelosi, but I'll tell you that what Lindsey Graham himself just told the president is a great place to start here.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCOONS: Reopen the government, stop harming our country and our economy and let's make our best efforts because we all agree we need to invest more in border security.\n\nThe only crisis here is one that's been created by the president's abrupt change in position at the end of last year in the last days of a Republican-controlled Congress.\n\nWALLACE: OK, I want to move on just because I've got so many other questions to ask you.\n\nCOONS: Sure.\n\nWALLACE: What you think about the report in The New York Times that in 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether or not the president of the United States was a Russian agent?\n\nCOONS: Well, that was a concerning, even alarming report and it suggests to me that the Mueller investigation needs to continue to its logical conclusion. I'm grateful for the partnership of Senator Graham, now the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in reintroducing our bipartisan bill with Senators Tillis and Booker to protect the Mueller investigation, and I think that report by The New York Times may well suggest what it was that helped start this investigation in the first place.\n\nI will also say this, Chris -- I was very concerned by President Trump's steadfast and public refusal to embrace the conclusion of our own intelligence community that Vladimir Putin's Russia had interfered in our 2016 election. There's been a confusing and at times even alarming tendency on the part of President Trump to complement President Putin and to do things like his abrupt announcement of a withdrawal from Syria that led his own secretary of defense to resign, that has led many of us to question his closeness to and his affinity for President Putin.\n\nBut I do think what we can all agree on is that the Mueller investigation should reach its conclusion --\n\nWALLACE: All right.\n\nCOONS: -- should deliver a report publicly, and that will be the topic of the Barr nomination hearings this coming Tuesday.\n\nWALLACE: Let me -- I got these two more questions and I got two minutes. So, let's try and squeeze them in.\n\nYou're also a member --\n\nCOONS: Sure.\n\nWALLACE: -- of the judiciary committee which is going to hold the confirmation hearings --\n\nCOONS: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: -- on Bill Barr as the next attorney general. What does he need to say to persuade you, to assure you that he is going to let the Mueller investigation go to its conclusion and be reported to Congress? And is there anyway that that you can vote to confirm Bill Barr?\n\nCOONS: I'm keeping an open mind. We had a very constructive meeting this past week. I did ask him a number of questions right along those lines and will ask them again in the public confirmation hearing. I would need a firm commitment that he would not allow any interference in the Mueller investigation, he will allow it to reach its conclusion and he will release the report to the public.\n\nI also asked him about seeking an ethics opinion from the Department of Justice about whether he should recuse himself given some of the opinions he's expressed both in a memo that he sent unsolicited, challenging the obstruction of justice basis for some of Robert Mueller's investigation. He didn't make that commitment. He said it would depend on the facts at the time.\n\nI will re-ask that question this coming week. I have some other concerns about his views on criminal justice and civil rights. But the Mueller investigation, the rule of law, his willingness to defend the appropriate independence of the Department of Justice will be critical to my vote.\n\nWALLACE: And briefly, sir, I want to pick up on the conversation I was having with Senator Graham, given Justice Ginsburg's recent illness, the fact that she is going to be turning 86 in March, it's only understandable that there would be some discussion about the possibility of replacing her at some point.\n\nHave you given any thought given how -- and I know you were concerned about how ugly the Kavanaugh hearing is, how you avoid a repeat, particularly if it comes to the situation of Donald Trump replacing a woman who has become a liberal icon?\n\nCOONS: Well, frankly, I think the confirmation of Justice Gorsuch was conducted in a completely sort of measured and appropriate way in terms of its beginning, middle and end. What made the confirmation hearings of Justice Kavanaugh so difficult and ultimately so divisive was that there were credible allegations of sexual assault and we entered sort of a second phase of the hearing.\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nCOONS: I have talked with Republican colleagues about finding a way that we have a clearer process for welcoming and vetting and making part of the confirmation process any such allegations so they don't arise at the last moment. I think there was a great deal of consternation over the timing of those allegations and then how seriously they were taken and investigated - - or not.\n\nWALLACE: Senator Coons, thank you. Thanks for joining us today. Please come back, sir.\n\nCOONS: Thank you, Chris. Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss how and when the government shutdown will finally end.\n\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about President Trump's threat to declare a national emergency? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, the shutdown standoff drags on.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Dealing with these people is ridiculous. I don't know if they know how to make a deal.\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., MINORITY LEADER: This is ridiculous and it's cruel and it needs to end now.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel whether the president will declare a national emergency to fund his border wall, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: I haven't done it yet. I may do it. If this doesn't work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.\n\nI have the absolute right to do it, but I'm not going to do it so fast because this is something Congress should do.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump changing course in a day on whether he is about to declare a national emergency and build a border wall on his own.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\n\nGOP strategist Karl Rove, columnist for The Hill, Juan Williams, former Democratic Congresswoman Jane Harman, director of the Woodrow Wilson Center, and Josh Holmes, Senator Mitch McConnell's former chief of staff.\n\nWell, Karl, let's start with the new wrinkle this week, can the president declare a national emergency to build the wall, should he declare a national emergency to build the wall?\n\nKARL ROVE, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. Well, look, I'm not a lawyer and I didn't stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night, so I'm not the expert on this. But I have been paying careful attention to people who are. David French (ph) in The National Review had, I thought, a particularly penetrating article on this. He pointed out that the sections of the law in which the president would have to rely, say the president can declare an emergency that, quote, requires the use of armed force, he can do military construction projects that are necessary to support that use of armed force. That seems to me to not apply in this situation.\n\nThe other statute that would be used says that the president can declare an emergency that terminates projects, quote, not essential to national defense and apply those monies to, quote, construct or assist in the construction, maintenance or repair of -- of (INAUDIBLE).\n\nWALLACE: I just asked you what time it is, I don't want to know how the watch is made. What -- what's the answer?\n\nROVE: Bottom line is, I think the authority to do so is -- is --\n\nWALLACE: Should he do it?\n\nROVE: Well, he may -- he -- maybe he should do it in order to get us out of the boxed canyon, because if he does do it, it will go to court and quickly, I think, the courts will say, you don't have the authority in this instance.\n\nI mean the administration in 2017 and 2018 has said, on the record, no terrorist organization has sent people to the United States through Mexico. So hard to declare it a national security emergency.\n\nWALLACE: All right.\n\nJANE HARMAN, DIRECTOR, WOODROW WILSON CENTER: Right.\n\nWALLACE: We asked you for questions for the panel and on the president's thought about declaring a national emergency we got this tweet from Greg Engle. By declaring a national emergency, will this open the door for future -- future presidents to do the same over topics such as climate change, health care, or even gun control laws because of mass shootings? Is this really a national emergency or just fulfilling a campaign pledge?\n\nCongresswoman Harman, how do you answer Greg?\n\nHARMAN: It's not a national emergency. It is fulfilling a campaign pledge. The wall is a primal scream. In your conversation with -- your very good conversation just before with Lindsey Graham and Chris Coons, both of them made clear that there are ways that Congress can make a deal. That's the right answer. And I'm going to get in a fight with Josh because I think that Mitch McConnell, his old boss, who is a dealmaker and wrote an autobiography called Playing the Long Ball, is bunting here and he could, if he chose to, rouse a veto proof majority in the Senate to pass what the Senate passed in the last Senate, which is the collection of CRs and then just leave one, that would be the Department of Homeland Security bill, with a shorter time frame to negotiate, have Lindsay and, as far as I'm concerned, Chris negotiate this and they will come up with the list of things they just suggested on TV, which maybe Trump will sign on whatever day they actually come up with it.\n\nWALLACE: I love the fact that this is a fight between President Trump and Nancy Pelosi. And poor Senator McConnell, you're probably sitting out there with your lovely wife, Elaine Chao, watching this and suddenly he gets dragged into this fight.\n\nHARMAN: Well, he is.\n\nWALLACE: Well, wait, wait, let me -- let me -- as the shutdown drags into its fourth week, both sides are digging in harder than ever. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.\n\nPELOSI: It was a petulant president of the United States, a person who would say, I'll keep the government shutdown for week -- a month or years unless I get my way.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Josh, we have seen how government shutdowns play out. We've all been here for them. Usually they go on a week, maybe a week and a half, and at some point the public seems to turn against one side. That site generally blinks and they make a deal. One, why isn't it happening this time and, two, how long is this going to go on?\n\nJOSH HOLMES, FOUNDER, CAVALRY: Well, first let me respond to my good friend Jane's criticism. His book is named to The Long Game, which, unfortunately, is not the end of the untruths or misunderstands that we had about Mitch McConnell's role here.\n\nHARMAN: It's long, though.\n\nHOLMES: He basically played a role for eight years as minority leader in the Senate were Democrats control the Senate.\n\nWALLACE: All right, let's go -- let's move on. I don't want to talk about Mitch McConnell. I want to talk about the shutdown.\n\nHOLMES: Well, it's -- I think this is important to know because at that point he had an obligation to do a deal with an administration that didn't see eye to eye with his conference. That is precisely the role that Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi find themselves in at this particular juncture. And instead of understanding how it is that they get from a to b and open up the government, Nancy Pelosi's telling the president she would only give him a dollar to open up -- open up the government and fund the wall. That's ridiculous.\n\nThis is not a particularly difficult thing to bridge here. We're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy in a $4 trillion budget. This is not difficult. If this is -- if this is as difficult as it gets from here in this Congress, we're all going to be in good shape.\n\nWALLACE: So what are you saying, the deal should be some money for the wall, something between $1 billion and $5 billion in return for some concessions on people in this country illegally, like dreamers and the temporary protected status refugees?\n\nHOLMES: Yes, I think it's obvious, right? I mean if you're talking about a $4 billion discrepancy, there's got to be a way to get -- come to the middle of it. Certainly if you were in the Democratic Party right now, there are concessions that you're interested in accomplishing, right? And if that is the case, you ought to wonder down to the speaker's office and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer's office and give them a piece of your mind.\n\nWALLACE: So, Juan, why doesn't Speaker Pelosi, why don't the Democrats, make a deal?\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think it's pretty clear right now, if you look at the polls this morning, that the president and Republicans are being blamed overwhelmingly for shutting down the government. And as Chris Coons pointed out to you this morning, Chris, Mitch McConnell and the Republicans had a unanimous support, Republicans and Democrats, for a bill that would have opened the government, kept the government open and then allowed for negotiations going forward. It's the president who has made it a point to say, I'm shutting down this government over the wall.\n\nWALLACE: OK, but, wait a minute, but there are real people affected, right?\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: Eight hundred thousand people who aren't getting paid. People who are depending on services, on going to the airport today. I don't know what is going to happen with TSA or --\n\nWILLIAMS: Right.\n\nWALLACE: The flight controllers or whatever.\n\nI understand all of that. And there's a lot of bad faith on both sides. Why not make a deal?\n\nWILLIAMS: Well, I think you have a situation here, just in pure political terms, where, one, it's only a shrinking Republican base that backs the president and you don't want to reward bullying, and that's what this comes down to. Secondly --\n\nWALLACE: So they're going to demand the president surrender?\n\nWILLIAMS: No, not surrender. See, I don't think it's a matter of capitulation or surrender. I think it's a matter of saying to the president, let's be honest about this. You had two years of Republican majorities, didn't get done. You had the Senate majority leader say let's negotiate. You refused. So it's bad behavior.\n\nAnd I might add here, remember that on the southern border eight congressional districts, including one Republican, none of them, including the Republican, voted for this wall, Chris. So the politics of this are very clear, its Trump, not the Republicans.\n\nROVE: That's simply not accurate. Look, last year --\n\nWALLACE: But let me just -- no, let me ask -- I don't want to go do history.\n\nHow does this get resolved?\n\nROVE: It gets resolved by adults showing up at this discussion. We have people on both sides who could find a way to get this done.\n\nJosh is right, we're talking about $4 billion. That is one-tenth of 1 percent of the federal budget. Out of every $100 spent by the federal government, we're talking about if you gave them $4 billion for the wall, it would be $0.10 out of every --\n\nWILLIAMS: This is in the weeds, Karl.\n\nROVE: Let me -- let me finish.\n\nWILLIAMS: Karl, let me just say this to you.\n\nROVE: Let me finish. Let me finish.\n\nWILLIAMS: Didn't he say Mexico was going to pay for this?\n\nROVE: Let me finish.\n\nWILLIAMS: Not the American taxpayer.\n\nROVE: OK, fine, we can stay stuck --\n\nHARMAN: Totally. Fully.\n\nROVE: WE can stay stuck in this and we can argue about Nancy Pelosi saying it's an immoral wall, which she voted for the wall last year and did not declare when -- when Barack Obama wrote -- built 133 miles of wall that that was immoral.\n\nHARMAN: Right.\n\nWILLIAMS: No, that was fencing. It was fencing and barriers, not wall.\n\nROVE: Oh, no, no, it was wall. It was wall.\n\nWILLIAMS: But it doesn't matter. This --\n\nROVE: Look, here's the bottom line --\n\nWILLIAMS: He said Mexico will pay for this this.\n\nROVE: OK, you can -- you can say stuck yesterday.\n\nWILLIAMS: OK.\n\nROVE: I think the American people are saying a pox on both your houses.\n\nHARMAN: Yes, well, and 800,000 of them are out of work because of it.\n\nROVE: Take a look -- let me finish. Let me finish. Let me finish. Let me finish.\n\nThe Economist -- The Economist poll said --\n\nWALLACE: Quickly.\n\nROVE: Asked the question in an interesting way, who do you blame a lot for this? Do you blame the Democrats in Congress a lot, 46 percent blame them a lot. Do you are blame the Republicans in Congress, 46 percent blame Republicans. And 59 percent --\n\nWALLACE: Well, and there's a new poll, an ABC/Washington Post poll that says 53 percent for the president and Republicans try -- anyway.\n\nROVE: Well, but it's only --\n\nWALLACE: May I just say one thing because we -- we -- we need to move onto the next segment. What I'm really happy about is that we were able to reach agreement at this table --\n\nROVE: Exactly.\n\nWALLACE: Which indicates that the shutdown's going to go on a long time.\n\nROVE: At least three of us can. At least three of us can.\n\nWALLACE: All right, panel, we have to take a break here.\n\nHARMAN: (INAUDIBLE).\n\nWALLACE: When we come back, we'll discuss that shocking report. The FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into whether President Trump was working for the Kremlin.\n\nPlus, is the White House already preparing its Supreme Court short list in case Justice Ginsburg steps down from the court? All that, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Was going to fire Comey. I -- there's no good time to do it, by the way. I said to myself, I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story. It's an excuse by the Democrats for having lost an election that they should have won.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump in May of 2017 mentioning the Russia investigation as a reason he fired FBI Director James Comey. The New York Times now reports that was one of the reasons the FBI launched a counterintelligence probe into the president.\n\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\n\nWell, Karl, we have been in uncharted territory for much of the Trump presidency, but this has got to be the topper. The FBI -- the FBI launching a counterintelligence investigation into whether the president of the United States is a Russian agent.\n\nYour thoughts?\n\nROVE: Yes, well, this happened in the aftermath of the firing of Comey. This was leaked to The New York Times, which says something about the culture inside the FBI. The only good news out of this is in all likelihood, since Comey was fired in a very short period of time, less than two weeks later, Mueller is appointed. This was probably immediately subsumed by Mueller -- the Mueller investigation and has been, I suspect, handled in an entirely appropriate way.\n\nBut it says something that the FBI would react to the firing of Comey this way and that somebody -- somebody who was then near the top of the FBI, leaked this to The New York Times. Shame on them.\n\nWALLACE: President Trump, not surprisingly, went on a Twitter storm about this story yesterday.\n\nHere's just one of his tweets. Wow, just learned in a failing New York Times that the corrupt leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me for no reason and with no proof after I fired lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze.\n\nOne sentence, incidentally. Pretty impressive.\n\nJuan, you have to assume, if they had found evidence in the last year and a half that the president was a Russian agent, they would have intervened.\n\nWILLIAMS: No, I think it was, as Karl said, all went to the Mueller pro. And --\n\nWALLACE: But if they found that the president --\n\nWILLIAMS: They're an investigative agency, right?\n\nWALLACE: I understand, but if the White House -- if the FBI found evidence that the president was an ongoing Manchurian candidate, an agent for the Russians, you don't think that that -- they -- they'd just sit on that and --\n\nHARMAN: No.\n\nWILLIAMS: I think it's up to Mueller. It's up to Mueller to say this is, one, provable and part of my ultimate report. You do not want to act in a way that would invite charges of politicizing an investigation. And this is unprecedented. The FBI, as you said, going into a counterintelligence investigation on the premise that the president may be a pawn, a Manchurian candidate, for the Russians. But what we can say, and I -- it's contrary to what the president said in his tweet there that when you have Mueller having so many guilty pleas, so much smoke coming. Michael Cohen is not going to testify before Congress. I think there's -- there's -- there's fire wherever there's so much smoke. And right now we have smoke billowing from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. There something going on.\n\nBut I don't think it's the case that, oh, therefore if they had found something right away it would have led to immediate charges against this president.\n\nWALLACE: Josh?\n\nHOLMES: Well, I think if you cut away from the sort of conspiracy and all the invective that this New York Times article actually injects into our public discourse, what we've learned here is the mind-set of the FBI at the time. We learned nothing about the fact pattern that the president of the United States engaged in. In fact, we've known all of this for months.\n\nWhat we now know is that the -- the FBI formalized what McCabe, Strzok, Lisa Page and all others have been doing for a matter of months before that point of view. They believed in their core of core that the president of the United States was a foreign agent and they were going to conduct investigations come hell or high water. This provided a perfect excuse for them to do so.\n\nWALLACE: I want to go quickly to this and then move on.\n\nHARMAN: OK. No. And I think that what you said, Chris, is right. This is a counterintelligence investigation, not a criminal investigation. And if they have had real evidence that the president was a Manchurian candidate, I think they would have intervene right then. I mean we can't have that go on -- an unprecedented whatever I -- collusion, cooperation, arrangement with one of our most important, strategic competitors, Russia.\n\nSo we'll learn soon from Mueller what's going on here.\n\nI do want to agree with Karl -- agree with Karl and deplore the leak of information like this.\n\nROVE: And I -- and I agree with your finding about this.\n\nThis is sort of like this --\n\nWALLACE: OK, no, no, this, no, we need shouting. OK, I want to move on.\n\nThere --\n\nROVE: This came out of a GI Joe movie. Yes.\n\nWALLACE: There were new questions this week about Justice Ginsburg after it turned out that she has missed arguments, a lot of us didn't know this, for the first time in her quarter century on the court.\n\nHere's what she said in 2017 about how long she will continue as a justice.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJUSTICE RUTH BADER GINSBURG, SUPREME COURT: As long as I can do the job full -- full steam, I will do it.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Josh, you know, a lot of us deplored, whatever side you were on, the Kavanaugh hearing and how ugly that was and how the Senate seemed to break down over it.\n\nI got to say, if you have Donald Trump replacing the notorious RBG, that's a perfect political storm, isn't it?\n\nHOLMES: Yes. I mean let me say at the outset, I think everybody hopes that Justice Ginsburg recovers fully.\n\nWALLACE: Of course.\n\nHOLMES: But -- but you're right --\n\nWALLACE: And there's every sign that she is.\n\nHOLMES: Yes. I think, given what we saw with the Kavanaugh hearings and everything else, you can -- you can say what you will, but this will be the first time that there is a seat that actually changes from a liberal held seat to a conservative held seat. And -- and if you think the Kavanaugh hearings was divisive, wait until you get a load of this. I mean this will be the -- the granddaddy of them all in terms of Supreme Court battles.\n\nI think -- I was encouraged by what I heard from Chris Coons earlier in your interview, that he was working alongside Republicans to try to find a process -- which, of course, I believe is the biggest problem with the Kavanaugh hearings, the process that was held closed until the last minute and try to jump into a -- make the whole thing a political dynamic, which, of course, ruined --\n\nWALLACE: What you're saying is the fact that suddenly Christine Blasey Ford and all of that stuff came out at the last -- at the 11th hour.\n\nHOLMES: It was designed to create a political circus and sabotage two people's lives in the process. That is absolutely the wrong way to go and I'm encouraged that it -- what we're hearing from a Senate Judiciary Committee that we're going to try to reform some of that.\n\nWALLACE: Congresswoman Harman, this is a delicate subject. I understand it as I ask the question. Was it foolish for Ruth Bader Ginsburg not to step down in the middle of President Obama's term?\n\nHARMAN: No, it wasn't foolish. I -- she may look frail, but she's -- she's an iron maiden. She is a -- I knew her first when she was a litigator in the '70s and she's always been a petite woman whose voice sometimes wobbles, but her mind is strong and it's her call. And she wears that diva t-shirt in the gym at the -- at the Supreme Court and she's a trailblazer for women. I mean -- and she'll know when it's time. She's not going to hang on if she can't function fully in the job.\n\nAnd the only thing she's missing right now are oral arguments. She's participating by phone in the decision about what cases to take. And hopefully she will fully recover soon. Her doctors say she's on course and she's cancer free.\n\nWALLACE: All right.\n\nAll right, we have time -- I want to get into one last subject.\n\nSecretary of State Pompeo is on a tour of the Middle East this week. In Cairo, he went after Barack Obama's Mideast policy. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Karl, he was talking there specifically about the president and -- and firing back at the policies of the president you worked for, Bush 43. But where are we on Syria right now? Because the president said we're going to get out right away. Then John Bolton, the national security advisor, said, well, it depends on what happens with the Kurds and ISIS. Now we hear the Pentagon is pulling equipment out. Do you know where we are?\n\nROVE: No. And we have a disconnect between I -- what I thought was an excellent speech by Pompeo. He opens up by saying, America is a force for good in the Middle East. Repudiates the Obama era doctrines. But there is a disconnect between that and pulling us out of Syria.\n\nMy hope is, is that our withdraw from Syria, I assume that the president's going to fulfill it, is done in an orderly fashion. But let's recognize our withdrawal empowers Russia, it empowers Iran, it empowers the Syrians. And the ultimate result of it may be Iranian-supported militias on the northern border of Israel, which is anathema to our interests and our allies.\n\nWALLACE: Well, it -- we've got less than a minute left.\n\nCongresswoman, I mean this was such a sore point when the president said we're going to pull out that James Mattis, the defense secretary, quit over it. Now they seem to be reshuffling it. Do you understand what the policy is?\n\nHARMAN: No, and I don't think there's one person in the Trump administration who agrees with the policy. Understand that Bret McGurk, who was the special advisor dealing with the ISIS coalition --\n\nWALLACE: The coalition.\n\nHARMAN: Also retired early in protest. So that's two.\n\nBut I've been looking around, and -- and Karl is exactly right on who it exposes, but in addition to that, there could be a Turk massacre of the Kurds who fought side-by-side with us, not only in Syria but in Iraq and Israel is totally vulnerable because of this on its northern border.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Well, one more subject to be continued.\n\nThank you, all, panel. See you next Sunday.\n\nUp next, we'll be back with a final word.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Stay tuned to this station and Fox News Channel for the latest on the continuing government shutdown.\n\nAnd that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next Fox News Sunday.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

A 40-year-old English teacher from the U.K. who was bitten by a tick in his ear while volunteering in Nepal two years ago said he still has trouble with his memory and coordination after the infection left him suffering from hallucinations and brain swelling.\n\nKeith Poultney, who said he didn't realize he had been bitten by the tick during his 2017 trip until a few days after developing discomfort in his ear, initially wasn't concerned about his illness while in Nepal because others in his group had developed colds or the flu, according to The Sun.\n\nThey treated me with antibiotics, but what they didn't know was that the type of infection I had developed was resistant, he said of his treatment in Nepal. I flew home as planned, but the flight, a 12-hour flight via the Middle East, was the worst experience of my life.\n\nHe said at one point his temperature reached 104.9 and he developed severe head pain. He was rushed to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, where he was eventually diagnosed with encephalitis and a rickettsial typhus infection, which is typically transmitted by fleas, ticks, mites and lice and in some cases can be fatal.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), immediate treatment should be started in a patient with a suspected case of rickettsioses before confirmation is complete due to the rapid progression of the infection.\n\nTransmission is most common during outdoor activities in the spring or summer months when ticks and fleas are most active, with a 5-14 day incubation period for most rickettsial diseases, meaning symptoms often don't start until after the trip as ended. The most common rickettsial diseases found in travelers are in the spotted fever or typhus groups.\n\nI felt different in myself, Poultney, who is still dealing with fatigue, told The Sun. I had real problems with my balance and was unable to walk in a straight line. I physically felt as though I was impaired or drunk. I could not gauge space or distance and would often walk into door frames or knock things such as drinks over.\n\nKANSAS BOY'S 'CONSTIPATION' WAS ACTUALLY SYMPTOM OF LIVER CANCER, MOM SAYS\n\nNearly two years after his diagnosis and treatment, Poultney said he still has issues with his memory, and has started working with Headway, an organization that provides support to brain injury patients.\n\nWithout Headway's help, I know my recovery would have been slower and more frustrating, he told The Sun. They were there to pick me up from a very low point in my life. I know my brain has been altered and that will most likely never change. But I also know that I shouldn't try to deal with this on my own.
A pair of wins for Democrats in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff elections would ensure an all-out assault on our freedoms, our economy and our Constitution, Laura Ingraham told viewers Monday night.\n\nWith control of the U.S. Senate hanging in the balance, The Ingraham Angle host warned would-be Georgia GOP voters that this is no time to sit on the sidelines or to stay home and complain and moan about how unfair everything is or how lame Republican state officials are.\n\nSet it all aside and keep your eye on resisting the rise of the rabid socialists who will run you over while they'll enrich Wall Street and China, Ingraham added.\n\nEveryone needs to get out and vote, she continued. Not just you go out and vote, you need to get like 10 other people to go to the polls with you tomorrow. Vote like your life depends on it because it does.\n\nIngraham acknowledged that while many Republicans in Georgia are feeling frustrated with the outcome of the November presidential election, we can't allow the frustration of this moment and the fury that so many of us have with what all went down in November to rip apart the movement that the president said [Monday] ... will come roaring back in 2022 if we play our cards right.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe host argued that while no president has ever fought harder for American workers, American manufacturing, the American tradition ... than Donald Trump, the policies of President-elect Joe Biden have to be resisted every step of the way.\n\nOn China, on immigration, on climate change, on these obscene and abusive rolling lockdowns that do not work, on the coming immunity certificates, Ingraham said. And, you know they're coming on reparations, new taxes, even forced gun buybacks. Yes, they're planning those. The Democrats want it all.
Former White House communications director Alyssa Farah is pleading to supporters of her former boss to accept the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nAmid violence taking place on Capitol Hill, Farah--who left the White House in December as President Trump's legal team continued to challenge the Electoral College victory of President-elect Biden in several swing states--took to Twitter and urged Trump voters to face what she suggested is a harsh reality for them.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: PROTESTERS STORM CAPITOL, HALTING ELECTORAL VOTE CERTIFICATION\n\nDear MAGA- I am one of you. Before I worked for @realDonaldTrump, I worked for @MarkMeadows & @Jim_Jordan & the @freedomcaucus. I marched in the 2010 Tea Party rallies. I campaigned w/ Trump & voted for him. But I need you to hear me: the Election was NOT stolen. We lost, Farah began her Twitter thread.\n\nWhile she acknowledged that there were cases of fraud that should be investigated, Farah stressed that the legitimate margins of victory for Biden are far too wide to change the outcome. You need to know that.\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: TRUMP 'INCITED' CAPITOL HILL VIOLENCE, NEEDS TO URGE HIS SUPPORTERS TO 'GO HOME'\n\nI'm proud of many policy accomplishments the Trump Admin had. But we must accept these results, Farah continued. It's time to regroup, organize, & campaign for political leaders we believe in, and let our democracy work. It is NOT and NEVER will be a time for violence. If you believe in America first, you believe in our Constitution, the rule of law, & our first principles.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier in the day, President Trump attended a rally where he reiterated to his thousands of supporters that the election was stolen. Meanwhile, the contentious certification of President-elect Biden's victory was halted after a pro-Trump mob stormed Capitol Hill, causing lawmakers to go into lockdown.
In recent years, the Super Bowl has become just as important for the prop bets gamblers can place as the game itself. But with President Donald Trump set to make an appearance on Fox's pre-game coverage and the 2020 election just 10 months away, prop bets this year have gone up a notch.\n\nIn what has become an annual tradition, Trump will pre-tape an interview to be aired with Fox News' Sean Hannity. Last year, Trump spoke with CBS's Margaret Brennan, but skipped the interview with NBC in 2018, after the White House and NBC, which had the telecast, could not come to an agreement.\n\nTrump is expected to have an even bigger impact on the Super Bowl than in previous years, due to purchasing $10 million worth of advertising during the game. Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg is also purchasing $10 million worth of advertising during the game, Fox Business previously reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL SUPER BOWL LIV COVERAGE\n\nA record 26 million Americans are expected to bet $6.8 billion on Super Bowl LIV, as more states legalize online gambling and the public becomes comfortable with it, according to newly released data from the American Gaming Association. Much of that will be spent on prop bets, which have become increasingly bizarre in recent years.\n\nWith the matchup between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers expected to be a tight one (most oddsmakers are favoring Kansas City by just 1.5 points), offshore bookmaker BookMaker.eu has compiled a list of some Trump-related prop bets for the game.\n\n(Editor's note: Odds as of Jan. 23)\n\nWill President Trump congratulate the winning team on Twitter?\n\nYes 1/4\n\nNo 3/1\n\nWill President Trump predict a winner before kickoff?\n\nYes 7/1\n\nNo 1/14\n\nWill President Trump tweet during the game?\n\nYes 6/5\n\nNo 2/3\n\nWill Donald Trump's commercial say Super Bowl?\n\nYes 6/1\n\nNo 1/10\n\nWill Michael Bloomberg's commercial say Climate Change?\n\nYes 2/1\n\nNo 2/3\n\nWill Michael Bloomberg's commercial say Impeach?\n\nYes 4/1\n\nNo 1/5\n\nFox Corp. is the parent company of Fox News and FOX Business.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM
This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday, February 16, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.\n\nAttorney General William Barr takes an unusual public swipe at President Trump over his criticism of the Justice Department.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me.\n\nWALLACE: The attorney general, who's been a close ally of Mr. Trump, says he won't be bullied, while the president says he has the right to intervene even in cases like the one involving his long-time advisor, Roger Stone.\n\nNow, House Democrats have Barr squarely in their sights.\n\nSEN. ELIZABETH WARREN (D-MA), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Remember, the attorney general can be impeached.\n\nWALLACE: We'll discuss the fallout with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway. It's a FOX News Sunday exclusive.\n\nThen, there are two new front runners in the Democratic race.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS (I-VT), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: We're getting the establishment just a little bit nervous.\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I ask you to join us in taking a stand for a better tomorrow.\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask Mayor Pete Buttigieg about his pitch to voters in Nevada, South Carolina, and the Super Tuesday states.\n\nPlus, we'll ask our Sunday panel about Michael Bloomberg's rise in the polls, and accusations of sexism in the workplace.\n\nAnd our Power Player of the Week, a fixture of the late '90s alt rock scene goes classical.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: And it's about un-formalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people.\n\nWALLACE: All, right now, on FOX News Sunday.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.\n\nEver since William Barr became attorney general, critics have complained he acts more like the president's personal lawyer than the nation's top law enforcement officer. But this week, Barr said Mr. Trump's comments and tweets about criminal cases make it impossible for him to do his job.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors dropped a tough sentencing recommendation for a long time Trump advisor Roger Stone, but decided not to pursue criminal charges against a favorite Trump target, former FBI official Andrew McCabe.\n\nIn a moment, we'll speak with counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nBut first, let's bring in Mark Meredith, reporting from the president's retreat at Mar-a-Lago with the latest -- Mark.\n\nMARK MEREDITH, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, the White House as the president still has confidence and faith in his attorney general even has multiple congressional Democrats are calling for Bill Barr to resign, amid multiple controversies facing his department.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBARR: I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.\n\nMEREDITH: Attorney General Bill Barr is raising eyebrows for selecting an outside prosecutor to review the case against former national security advisor Michael Flynn.\n\nIn 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, recently asked to withdraw that plea and is still awaiting sentencing. Meantime, the Justice Department says it's no longer pursuing a case against former FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe.\n\nANDREW MCCABE, FORMER FBI DEPUTY DIRECTOR: It is an absolute disgrace that they took two years before they finally drew the obvious conclusion.\n\nMEREDITH: President Trump repeatedly criticized McCabe over his role in the Russia probe and tweeted Saturday that McCabe, quote, authorized media links to advance personal interest.\n\nLast week, the president praised the Justice Department for changing the way it's handling the case against former Trump associate Roger Stone. Stone was convicted in November on multiple counts of lying to Congress. Prosecutors plan to ask for a 7 to 9-year sentence, but senior Justice officials overruled their recommendation and planned to push for a shorter sentence.\n\nBARR: I have not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.\n\nMEREDITH: Democrats don't buy it and are calling for Barr to step down.\n\nWARREN: Everything that Bill Barr is about right now is just about loyalty to Donald Trump. And we just can't have that. He should not be the attorney general.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nMEREDITH: Barr will be forced to explain some of his decisions. He's expected to head up to the House Judiciary Committee for a hearing at the end of March -- Chris.\n\nWALLACE: Mark Meredith reporting from Mar-a-Lago -- Mark, thank you.\n\nAnd joining us now, counselor to the president, Kellyanne Conway.\n\nWelcome back to FOX News Sunday.\n\nKELLYANNE CONWAY, COUNSELOR TO THE PRESIDENT: Good morning.\n\nWALLACE: What does the president think of the decision to drop the criminal investigation of former FBI official Andrew McCabe? Does he think that McCabe should be prosecuted?\n\nCONWAY: Well, the president recognizes, as many people do, that it feels like there's a two -- two-tiered criminal justice system. If your President Trump or people associated with him, this prosecution would have gone one way.\n\nFor you're someone like Andy McCabe, who wasn't just a garden-variety FBI agent just starting out, he was the number two and for a while the acting director of the whole FBI after Comey was fired. No one, including Andy McCabe, his FBI counsel, Lisa Page, familiar name, has denied that he lied, and he didn't lie once, he lied multiple times.\n\nWhat did he lie about? Well, on about October -- at the end of October, 2016, he authorized a leak to Devin Bartlett, then a reporter at The Wall Street Journal. And the leak was about the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails.\n\nSo he authorizes the leak and then he lies about even knowing about the leak, then he is able to correct that on tape in and on the record, under oath interview in July --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCONWAY: This is important -- July 2017, and lies again.\n\nAnd so, this is somebody -- he will still be a serial liar whether he's prosecuted or not --\n\nWALLACE: Well, here, let's get to the bottom line, does the president think --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: -- does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened and he should be prosecuted?\n\nCONWAY: The president appreciates the fact that this Department of Justice and Attorney General Barr works on any number of issues at this White House that doesn't get any kind of coverage. Sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar --\n\nWALLACE: Please answer my question.\n\nCONWAY: -- trafficking drugs, humans and guns, for example. Any number of issues you work on with the Department of Justice, this is small potatoes. But people see it from what it is.\n\nWALLACE: The McCabe case is small potatoes?\n\nCONWAY: He is small potatoes. He will always be seen as a serial liar and a leaker, as will those who covered for him.\n\nAnd what we're most concerned about is making sure that the 35,000 rank- and-file FBI men and women who bravely do their job every day with integrity and fidelity and bravery don't -- aren't being put in that same big toxic stew with those, including Andy McCabe, who are at the top levels of the FBI in 2016 trying to prevent Donald Trump from being president.\n\nWALLACE: Simple question. Does the president think the McCabe case should be reopened?\n\nCONWAY: The president thinks that Andy McCabe should have been punished because he lied and he lied several times to the investigators and many people feel the same way.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCONWAY: I'm not going to spend a lot more of my life on Andy McCabe.\n\nWALLACE: OK, and I'm not going to spend anymore of this interview on that.\n\nAttorney General Barr said this week the president has never asked him to do anything in a criminal case. But Mr. Trump tweeted: This doesn't mean that I do not have as president the legal right to do so. I do. But I have so far chosen not to.\n\nWhat does the president think is his legal authority to intervene in criminal cases and to order who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted?\n\nCONWAY: He didn't say he's ordering who should be prosecuted and who should not be prosecuted. Article II --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: I didn't say he didn't. I'm saying, what does he think is his authority?\n\nCONWAY: Article II provides our president, yes, ladies and gentlemen, including President Trump vast powers. And the president is making a point, and the Attorney General Bill Barr is backing him up on this, that he has not interfered in any criminal case.\n\nI know people who are trying to bully Bill Barr out of his job, like Elizabeth Warren. Her campaign is dwindling. She is practically disappearing as a viable candidate, so she's got to pick on Bill Barr.\n\nHe's not going to be bullied by people like Elizabeth Warren. Steve Cohen, the congressman who put a bucket of chicken (INAUDIBLE) didn't show up to the State of the Union.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: What does he think is his authority to get involved in criminal cases under Article II?\n\nCONWAY: The president could weigh in, but you see how the president weighs in. The president weighs into the whole world.\n\nHe didn't have a conversation with Bill Barr about the Roger Stone case. He had a conversation with the whole world. He put it, as he is want to do, on his Twitter feed, on social media. And he expresses himself, cuts at the middlemen -- I know the middlemen don't like that -- in the democratization of information where he tells everybody what he thinks it and a number of issues, including the Stone case.\n\nWALLACE: But Bill Barr -- wait a minute -- Bill Barr says that that kind of conversation, even if it's to the whole world, not getting on the phone with Bill Barr undercuts his authority and makes it impossible for him, Bill Barr, to do his job.\n\nListen to what Barr said in that interview with ABC. Here he is.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: If he were to say, you know, go investigate somebody because -- and you sense it's because they're political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Since Watergate, presidents have generally, perhaps not always, but generally stayed away from involvement in criminal investigations.\n\nWill Mr. Trump, going forward, respect Barr's request for him to stop commenting on current cases, whether it's -- whether it's in terms of on the air, you know, public statements, or tweets?\n\nCONWAY: Well, a couple things, very different to pick up the phone and ask your attorney general to do something in a criminal case, the president hasn't done that. He had -- he says he hasn't done it, Bill Barr said he hasn't done it, he hasn't done it.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: But Barr said the tweets are making it impossible to do his job.\n\nCONWAY: But no -- and let me say something. It's not correct to say that presidents have not interfered. Bill Clinton pardoned a relative. He pardoned someone who refused to testify against him, that's involving yourself in criminal matters --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Wait, pardoning is different. Wait. It's different, it's after the criminal process has been completed and clearly the --\n\nCONWAY: President Obama spoke up in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore. President George Herbert Walker Bush, Bush 41, I think commented on the case in L.A., probably the Rodney King case.\n\nSo, it's not -- it's disingenuous to say that people -- presidents don't comment on criminal matters.\n\nWhat is most important here -- two things, one is the president of the United States has not asked or directed his attorney general privately to do anything in any criminal matter including Roger Stone. Number two, he works hand and glove with the attorney general, as we all are privileged to do on a number of matters that affect this country. I --\n\nWALLACE: Policy is different than criminal cases. Policy is different than criminal cases.\n\nCONWAY: No policy -- well, the attorney general and Department of Justice cover a lot of territory in this country, Chris --\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCONWAY: -- and we work very well with them.\n\nAgain, let me repeat, drug trafficking, human trafficking, gun trafficking, sanctuary cities, Texas versus Azar, eldercare now we do (ph), elder fraud we're doing.\n\nI just went to something about law enforcement, a new commission they have. Our law enforcement feel more deeply respected and better resourced because of Donald Trump and Bill Barr.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Can you and I talk about Michael -- can we talk about Michael Bloomberg?\n\nCONWAY: Sure.\n\nWALLACE: There's been a war of --\n\nCONWAY: Speaking of purity\n\nWALLACE: There's been a war of words over the past week certainly between the president and former New York City --\n\nCONWAY: But the war of words is between Michael Bloomberg and the African- American community.\n\nWALLACE: Well --\n\nCONWAY: The way he feels about people is so demeaning. The policy may have been stop-and-frisk, but the philosophy was to castigate and denigrate people of color and it's a disgrace.\n\nWALLACE: You were -- you've anticipated where we're going to go because one of the statements back and forth had to do with these comments that Michael Bloomberg made about stop and frisk in 2015. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP, FEBRUARY 5, 2015)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG, FORMER NEW YORK CITY MAYOR: The way you should get the guns out of the kids' hands is to throw them up against the wall and frisk them.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: The president tweeted right after that came out: Wow, Bloomberg is a total racist, and he expanded on that in a radio interview with Geraldo Rivera.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You couldn't go to your house. They were stopping you every day. What Bloomberg did to black -- to the black community was a disgrace.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: But, Kellyanne, candidate Donald Trump supported what Bloomberg did with stop-and-frisk. Here he is in the first debate in 2016 with Hillary Clinton.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: It was continued on by Mayor Bloomberg, and it was terminated by a current mayor. But stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: So why was stop-and-frisk tremendous then, and it's racist now?\n\nCONWAY: Well, he is -- the president is toying with everybody by saying, oh, had he said something like that, had you unearthed a videotape like that of him, everybody would say racist, racist.\n\nBut look at all the people who were saying, you know what, I think Michael Bloomberg learned his lesson, he's apologized, that was so long ago. Chris, it was a few years ago as mayor of New York. And it wasn't just stop-and- frisk. He said redlining -- canceling redlining started the financial crisis.\n\nThe African-American community weren't the perpetrators of that financial crisis, many of them were the victims. What is he talking about?\n\nThis billionaire who's made his life's wealth in the financial services industry is now saying that and, look, this is not -- it's not that Michael Bloomberg was burning a bra or burning the flag at Woodstock when he was a teenager. He said these several years ago, a few short years ago as mayor of New York and it's the way he said it.\n\nHe said, you can basically Xerox the description of male minorities between the ages of 16 and 25, and hand it over to the cops.\n\nThat is somebody who looks at people beneath him differently and we can't have that. And I -- I cannot -- I literally this week -- I got pretty big shock absorbers, my friend, I cannot believe all the prominent African- Americans I've seen publicly say, I think we can support Bloomberg because after all, he's electable, he's the one who can beat Donald Trump.\n\nElectability was the calling card for Hillary Clinton four years ago, for Joe Biden this entire year. Electability means nothing if the person looks at a large constituency of your electorate, let alone this country that -- wait, look what he said about women. I mean, all this coming out, women and lawsuits --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Let me ask about women, because there's a long story in The Washington Post today.\n\nCONWAY: Read it.\n\nWALLACE: I did read it.\n\nCONWAY: I did too\n\nWALLACE: OK. About Bloomberg's history of sexist comments, about women who work for him at his company.\n\nCan -- will President Trump, if it's a Bloomberg-Trump race, will he be able to make an issue of that given President Trump's own long history of sexist comments?\n\nCONWAY: It should be an issue here and now, today. You don't have to wait for an election to be offended by the fact that Michael Bloomberg, according to other Bloomberg employees, said to a woman who announced she was pregnant, she's been congratulated by her coworkers, says, aren't you going to kill it?\n\nThis is a woman who relied upon her employment, relied upon Michael Bloomberg for employment, and one would imagine her maternity benefits as she found out the good news. The comments he's made about women -- I mean, The Washington Post had to bleep out some of the actual words.\n\nThe comments he's made about women in lawsuits, that is all fair game. And it's fair game because we want to know the person behind the half a billion dollars worth of ads --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: But is it fair game for President Trump when he's made sexist comments too?\n\nCONWAY: Oh, please. First of all, I've been working by his side for four years. He's the best boss I've ever had.\n\nWALLACE: There are plenty women who would say the same thing about Michael Bloomberg.\n\nCONWAY: Let them come forward.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Is this any worse -- is this any worse than the Access Hollywood tapes?\n\nCONWAY: It's far worse. Oh, my goodness, it's far worse. And, by the way, that was fully litigated. That happened in October 7th. He won a month a later. And --\n\nWALLACE: That doesn't mean -- that doesn't mean it's not an issue.\n\nNo, here's -- if you're going to do that -- you know what? I'll take that on any time. I'll take a leave of absence from the White House and talk all day long about that stuff.\n\nLet me tell you something: the way Michael Bloomberg treated employees, female employees who were under his wing, who were relying on him for their -- for their livelihood, for their health benefits, for their 401(k)s, to have created that kind of culture, that unsafe workplace, to feel that you're being harassed because of your gender, that is problematic, and I think you're going to hear more of it.\n\nThe other thing is, I don't understand how the Democratic Party is going to sit back and take it. Is it really worth it to this Democratic Party in the age of the #metoo movement, Black Lives Matter, you had the first African- American president, you have completely squeezed out and spat out the candidates of color this time, Cory Booker. Julian Castro, Kamala Harris, they are out of the race. You're left -- you're left with a bunch of white people, old white people at that with the exception of your next guest, Mayor Buttigieg, and you're going to go backwards because Michael Bloomberg will spend money and will take and will consult Donald Trump?\n\nThat's why the Bernie voters are not going to take that. I predict. He'll keep winning contests. He's like President Trump in that he's got a committed base of loyal voters who aren't going to go elsewhere.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: All right. Thank you very much.\n\nCONWAY: Voters care about what affects them --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: We'll pass your comments later to the Democratic candidates, I'm sure they'll be happy to hear them.\n\nCONWAY: Voters talk about what offends them, but they vote on what affects them. And they have a big decision to make. If you want -- if you want to elevate somebody who has treated people that are less than him, people of color and women, that's a big decision to make. It's a serious consequence in 2020 when our country has such great progress. This president has --\n\nWALLACE: OK, we're done. Timeout.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCONWAY: -- African-Americans out of jobs (ph) and now out of prison --\n\nWALLACE: All right. Kellyanne Conway, thank you. Always good to talk with you.\n\nCONWAY: You got it. Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: Wish (ph) you could be talking to the commercial.\n\nCONWAY: I'll be back.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the new tension between President Trump and his attorney general.\n\nPlus, what would you like us the panel about Democrats' calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice? Just go to Facebook or Twitter, @FoxNewsSunday, and we may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARR: I cannot do my job here at the department with constant background commentary that undercuts me.\n\nMCCABE: We are seeing things happen every day in this country that many of us never, ever thought we'd see here -- the pursuit of political enemies and the use of the criminal justice system.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Attorney General Barr and former FBI official Andrew McCabe finding one thing they can agree on as both complain about President Trump weighing in on Justice Department investigations.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group.\n\nGuy Benson of FOX News Radio; Charles Lane from The Washington Post; former DNC chair, Donna Brazile; and former Trump National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton.\n\nMichael, let me start with you. You now have the attorney general calling on the president to stop commenting on criminal cases.\n\nShould the president listen to Bill Barr, will he listen to Bill Barr?\n\nMICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, look, I think he should listen to Bill Barr. The president obviously has confidence in Bill Barr. He appointed him.\n\nHe has said over the weekend that, you know, he was asked, does this mean there's a rift? Would seem that he had a rift with his prior attorney general and he said, no. So, I think he should listen.\n\nBut I think this controversy is still overblown in a sense that if the president were really intervening, we know what the president thinks. The president thinks Andrew McCabe probably should have been charged and he thinks Roger Stone is getting railroaded. If he were really intervening, the charges against Roger Stone would have been dropped and Andrew McCabe would be facing charges or maybe have already been tried by now.\n\nSo, I take Bill Barr's word when he says that the president has never intervened, but that, you know, he finds the comments unhelpful.\n\nSo, you know, back off a little with the tweets and the comments and take the advice of your attorney general, sure. But the fact of the matter is I think that the president is right in the opinions that he expresses and he's right to be concerned about unequal justice.\n\nWALLACE: Good luck with getting him to back off on the tweets.\n\nWe asked you for questions for the panel and on this issue of Democratic calls to investigate political interference at the Department of Justice, we got this on Facebook from Mark Davis.\n\nHow can you interfere in an organization you oversee? It's rhetorical. You can't.\n\nChuck, as I discussed with Kellyanne, under Article Two, the president has tremendous powers to oversee the Justice Department and specifically criminal investigations. So how do you answer Mark?\n\nCHUCK LANE, THE WASHINGTON POST: It's a fair question. There is a paradox built into our constitutional order.\n\nThe president is the head of the executive branch and furthermore has the power to pardon, which sort of implies the power to pick and choose who gets prosecuted and put into prison. And that's why since Watergate, we have developed a strong norm, along with a lot of procedural protections, that try to distance presidential political self-interest from the operation of the Justice Department. And broadly speaking, notwithstanding the examples Kellyanne mentioned, that had been respected.\n\nHere we have a president who doesn't really I think even know about it, and flouts it through social media, broadcasting his desire to see this or that person benefited by justice, somebody else should go to jail, and that, as Bill Barr said is totally threatening to that norm.\n\nBut he does it because the base loves it. I'm not even sure he really wants these threats and orders carried out, but the base loves it and that is why he will keep doing it.\n\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, Democrats are now calling for an investigation of Attorney General Barr. Or even more. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWARREN: What the attorney general has done, we should all be calling for the resignation of the attorney general. If he won't resign, remember, the attorney general can be impeached.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Donna, haven't Democrats learned their lesson? Move on from impeachment and investigations?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FORMER DNC CHAIR: Has President Trump learned in any lesson over the last couple of months? He's on a retribution tour. He's on a revenge tour.\n\nWhen career professionals walk out of their job, we all should take notice. What happened?\n\nWhen the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, the largest U.S. attorney office, is removed and then a replacement is putting in, and then the sentencing charges are either meddled with -- yes, there needs to be a comprehensive investigation as to what is happening.\n\nI want to mention something, Kellyanne talked about George Herbert Walker Bush in the Rodney King case, as well as Barack Obama in the Freddie --\n\nWALLACE: Gray case.\n\nBRAZILE: -- Gray case.\n\nIn both instances, the communities erupted because they were concerned about overzealous policing and what happened in those cases. That's what they got involved.\n\nThey didn't get in -- they didn't try to tip the scales of justice. They were trying to calm the community after, you know, two very horrific things occurred. So, we shouldn't put the two together.\n\nBut the president's -- what he's doing with his tweets, he's revealing what's going on in the Justice Department. And I think the House should get to the bottom of it.\n\nWALLACE: Guy, first of all, your reaction to Donna, but also, how do you see this playing out? Do you think this is a real rift between the president and his attorney general? Or is it a bit of theater as some people have suggested, where Barr is saying this because he needs to shore up his position at the Justice Department and there's kind of an inside agreement, tacit agreement between the White House and Justice?\n\nGUY BENSON, FOX NEWS RADIO: Well, first, I would just say to Donna, it's a fair point that she makes about the two examples that she gave. I would also note, that President Obama did make public comments about the Hillary Clinton emails investigation, which was a far cry from Rodney King, right? So there has been some precedent for presidents weighing in.\n\nOn this broader issue of Barr and the Democratic reaction, I think your question was good. Have the Democrats learned their lesson? We have people talking about impeachment of Bill Barr, which I think is ludicrous.\n\nWe have heard over and over again from Democrats, people on the left saying, why won't anyone stand up to President Trump? Why won't any of his people stand up to President Trump? Then Bill Barr does that with a brush back pitch that I think was needed and was correct, and people immediately jumped to the conclusion, well, it's fake, it's theater, it's not real.\n\nI'm not sure I would call it a rift, but between Bill Barr saying what he said on ABC News, and then his Justice Department declining to prosecute Andrew McCabe, an outcome that I think it's very clear the president wants, to Michael's point -- I think it's been about few days for the narrative that Bill Barr is just a hatchet man for President Trump who will do his bidding.\n\nWALLACE: So what to expect? Do you -- I mean, going forward you expect the president to stay out of these cases?\n\nBENSON: No.\n\nWALLACE: No?\n\nBENSON: No, he'll tweet. There's a chance that he'll tweet a little bit less. I think that Mitch McConnell sat in the studio, the Senate majority leader, just a few days ago and urge the president to take the advice of his attorney general. I hope the president does it, even if he just calibrates it slightly differently.\n\nWhat will be interesting is if Trump dials it up and continues to do this even more aggressively, what does Barr do then? Having lay down a marker on this point?\n\nWALLACE: All right. Panel, we have to take a break here.\n\nBut up next, one of the Democratic front runners, Pete Buttigieg, joins us to discuss the upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, and whether he can build on his early momentum straight through Super Tuesday.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, Bernie Sanders' win in New Hampshire put new pressure on Democrats fighting to be the moderate candidate in the race for the White House.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBUTTIGIEG: A fresh outlook is what makes new beginnings possible. It is how we build a new majority.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask Pete Buttigieg how he plans to stand out in the crowded center.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: The Democratic race for the White House is gearing up with the votes in Iowa and New Hampshire starting to winnow the field of candidates and establish new frontrunners, but upcoming contest in Nevada and South Carolina, much more diverse states, could reshuffle the race again.\n\nJoining us now from Las Vegas, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nMayor, let's start with the numbers from the two states which are going to be holding contests over the next few weeks, put them up on the screen. In Nevada, you're in fifth place with 10 percent support. In South Carolina, you're also in fifth place with 7.5 percent support. You're trailing Tom Steyer in both states.\n\nHow important is it for you to do well, much better than those numbers, in both of those states to show that you can get support in states with a big minority voting bloc?\n\nPETE BUTTIGIEG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: Well, it's very important for us to do well, and we're on the ground working to earn those good results here in Nevada and we'll be campaigning hard for every vote in South Carolina as well.\n\nWe've see how fluid it is. Of course I don't have billions of dollars of my own money to pour into the airwaves. But what we do have is a vision that as we've demonstrated in New Hampshire and Iowa, can bring people together in a commitment, as we come to more racially diverse states to speak to the concerns of voters who are here.\n\nHere in Nevada, for example, we've got over 100 organizers on the ground, volunteers as we speak getting ready to go out and talk to fellow Nevadans in a state that looks to the future and in a state where I'm encountering a lot of workers concerned about how these political decisions are going to affect them. Whether it's workers who are concerned about health care and how to preserve the health care choice that is so important to them, people concerned about immigration reform and wanting to know that we're seriously going to get something done. And a lot of people looking to the future worried about climate.\n\nThis is a state that is in many ways reflective of the future of America and I'm really excited to be on the ground here working to earn that support in the week that remains.\n\nWALLACE: How damaging, if you don't show strong support among Latinos in Nevada, African-Americans in South Carolina -- because that question of whether or not you can get support from those minorities, of course, is the big knock on your campaign?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I'll leave it to pundits due to the political analysis.\n\nWhat I will say is, of course it is extremely important to earn support from voters across the board. And when you look at the way that Latino voters here in Nevada know that they are under siege in this administration, talking to black voters who are sick and tired of the economic disempowerment among the injustices of systemic racism and looking for a president who can actually bring change to Washington and, more than anything, looking for a nominee who can defeat Donald Trump. We are ready to go out and have that conversation.\n\nYou know, this, more than anything else, I think for so many voters and certainly a lot of voters that -- of color that I talked to across the Latino, the black in the AEPi (ph) communities is about making sure that we get this right.\n\nYou know, the Senate demonstrated that it's not going to hold this president accountable. It is up to us in 2020. It is our only shot. And as we see this president, as he's demonstrated, interfering in criminal prosecutions, growing more and more emboldened, so much is on the line. We dare not get this wrong. And that means nominating a candidate who can challenge this president on his own terms and put together a big enough winning coalition that we can have some coattails too and make gains in the Senate.\n\nWALLACE: I want to talk about how this race is beginning to shape up because after Tuesday it is beginning to shape up.\n\nIn New Hampshire, the so-called moderate candidates won more than 50 percent of the vote of voters in that state, but -- which was double what Bernie Sanders got, but he won in New Hampshire because he had that left lane, the more liberal lane, all to himself while the so-called more moderate lane was kind of clogged up by you and -- and Biden and Klobuchar, all of whom split up the votes.\n\nHow concerned are you that the -- that the moderate lane, if you will, is getting so crowded that you could be leaving the -- the road to the nomination open to Bernie Sanders?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I think that's what voters right now are in the process of settling. Look, there are a lot of different candidacies with a lot of different visions. But the vision of my candidacy is that we're going to have to bring change to Washington, that we can't confront the most disruptive president in modern times by falling back on the same playbook, just as we also can't do it by telling people that their only options are between a revolution or the status quo.\n\nWe've been able to demonstrate our ability to get diehard Democrats, yes, but also independents and even some Republicans to cross over a support my vision and what our campaign stands for. And I believe that's going to serve us well here in Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.\n\nWALLACE: And then, despite -- if you're able to winnow your way through all of those folks, that on Super Tuesday you face another centrist candidate in Mayor Mike Bloomberg. And over really the last week, week and a half, there have been a series of stories about his comments on stop and frisk and redlining and, as I discussed with Kellyanne Conway, a big story in The Washington Post today about a long history of him king sexist, profane comments to women who work for his company and some of whom said that it created a hostile workplace.\n\nHow troubled are you by these allegations and this evidence of alleged sexism and racism?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I think he's going to have to answer for that and speak to it.\n\nLook, this is a time where voters are looking for a president who can lead us out of the days when it was just commonplace, or accepted to have these kinds of sexist and discriminatory attitudes. And, you know, right now, this is our chance to do something different.\n\nObviously, there is no comparison to this president and the way that he has treated and talked about women and people of color and continues to do so to this day. But we, in our party, hold ourselves to the highest standard. And it is going to be critical for us to have a nominee who cannot authentically lead and who can show growth on these challenges.\n\nLook, some of these are issues that our country's about to face are among the most intractable we've ever had, but you've got to arrive at those -- at those challenges with -- with the ability to explain your record and with an ability to explain how you're going to raise the bar at a time when we are finally asking a lot more from our elected leaders.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let me follow up on that because Kellyanne Conway was, I think, trolling Democrats and saying, boy, this part that talks about all of these principles in the Me Too era, are they going to nominate somebody like Michael Bloomberg with his record of things he's done, for instance, towards women in the workplace, just because they think he can beat Donald Trump? What would that say about what the Democratic Party really stands for?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: For a representative of this White House to speak about misogyny, to speak about sexism, to speak about racism is comical. And, you're right, I think it amounts to trolling.\n\nLook, the American people are not going to be fooled by anybody from the Trump White House when it comes to these issues. So I'll leave it to my competitors in this race to speak for themselves, but one thing we can all agree on is that we can do a lot better than this president.\n\nAnd, you know, one of the reasons why I'm seeing a lot of folks from the Republican Party or formally from the Republican Party ready to cross over is that they can no longer look their children in the eye and explain the behavior of the current president of the United States.\n\nWALLACE: Mayor, you have been very open about the fact that you're gay. And it hasn't been much of an issue in this campaign until now. This week, two conservative supporters of President Trump, Rush Limbaugh and Sebastian Gorka, talked about it on their shows.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUSH LIMBAUGH, CONSERVATIVE COMMENTATOR: A gay guy, 37 years old, loves kissing his husband on debate stages. Can you see Trump have fun with that?\n\nSEBASTIAN GORKA, FORMER DEPUTY ASSISTANT TO THE PRESIDENT: Why is a homosexual man lecturing us about the sanctity of life in the womb? Just a little curious there. Strange.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Mayor, what's your reaction to those comments?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, I am in a faithful, loving, committed marriage. I'm -- I'm proud of my marriage. And I'm proud of my husband. And I'm not going to be lectured on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh or anybody who supports Donald J. Trump as the moral as well as political leader of the United States.\n\nAmerica has moved on and we should have politics of belonging that welcomes everybody. That's what the American people are for. And I am saddened for what the Republican Party has become if they embrace that kind of homophobic rhetoric.\n\nWALLACE: And how big an issue do you think this would be in a general election? Clearly they think it would be an issue. The idea that -- that you would need -- and you have reached out to social conservatives, many of whose votes you'd need -- but who might have concerns about your sexual orientation?\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Well, here's my generational -- or general election experience on this. You know, I came out during a general election in south Bend. And this was at a time when Mike Pence was the governor of Indiana. And we didn't know what would happen.\n\nI'll tell you what happened, I got re-elected with 80 percent of the vote in my generally Democratic, but socially conservative community. More than I had the first time that I ran for office.\n\nThis election isn't about any of us candidates. It is about voters' lives. And we're the ones trying to get voters a raise. We're the ones trying to make sure that there is paid family leave, working to end endless war, serious about climate change --\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Actually prepared to do something on gun violence.\n\nAnd when it comes to LGBTQ issues, this is, I think, the most important thing is not the treatment of candidates, it's what's happening to individuals and families across the country from brave service members who have their careers threatened --\n\nWALLACE: Right.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: By this president, two kids experiencing bullying right now in this climate. We can do better and you don't have to be a diehard Democrat to know that we can do better when it comes to inclusion and equality in this country.\n\nWALLACE: Mayor, thank you. Thanks for joining us. We'll be watching developments next week out of Nevada.\n\nGood to have you.\n\nBUTTIGIEG: Thanks. Good to be with you.\n\nWALLACE: When we come back, as former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg rises in the polls, troubling comments from his past are resurfacing. The Sunday panel will tackle that, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHAEL BLOOMBERG (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He sees our poll numbers and I think it's fair to say he is scared because he knows I have the record and the resources to defeat him.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Mike Bloomberg reacting to President Trump's barrage of attacks this week, but the former New York City mayor also facing incoming about his long record in public life.\n\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\n\nDonna, as we've been saying, Mayor Bloomberg rising in the polls, news stories coming out, old tapes coming out about his record on race and, as we've said several times, a -- a big story, a takeout in The Washington Post today about his -- and you can see it there, about his long history of sexist comments going back decades at his company and women saying that they believed he created a hostile workplace.\n\nHow damaging to his campaign?\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Extremely.\n\nLook, I think there are many people in the Democratic Party who are looking at Mr. Bloomberg because he has the resources to take on President Trump. But the question in my judgment is his record. I mean, I am uncomfortable with his policies in New York. I understand he's apologized. I get that. I'm for forgiveness. But I am extremely dismayed at the information I read over the weekend about his sexist -- the sexist work environment.\n\nYou know, it's one thing to have this so-called top law enforcement policy of stop and frisk. It was ruled unconstitutional. And it has taken him years to say I'm sorry about that. He has the -- he has the resources, but I'm -- I am very uncomfortable with -- with his record. Very comfortable.\n\nWALLACE: Guy, you could tell that Kellyanne Conway was thoroughly enjoying the predicament, not just for Bloomberg, but for the Democratic Party.\n\nCan they nominate -- will they perhaps nominate someone who's got Bloomberg's record? And we should point out, it's a mixed record because there's a lot of things he did in New York, crime did go down. He's given tremendous amounts of money on a lot of issues that Democrats like, climate change, a lot of women's groups. Can, in the Me Too era, the Democratic Party nominate somebody, though, with this downside?\n\nGUY BENSON, TOWNHALL.COM: No, it could be a gut check moment coming up for the Democratic Party, right? Here is a New York billionaire with potential vulnerabilities on race and sexism, right, which sounds familiar if you're a Democrat, and Mike Bloomberg is the human embodiment of money in politics. All right, this is a party that at least pretends to abhor the influence of money in politics and here's someone who is doing the closest thing you can do to buying a nomination. That combination, is that going to sit well with the Democratic electric? Are they willing to swallow hard and go for it because they think that he's got the money and maybe the moderation relatively to beat President Trump? That's a decision they're going to have to make, but there are no shortage of ironies here.\n\nWALLACE: Then there is -- I guess you have to call him the former frontrunner now, Joe Biden, who took it drubbing in Iowa, an even worse drubbing in New Hampshire and is now counting on the votes of minorities, Latinos, African-Americans in South Carolina and Nevada, to -- to rescue him.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN (D), PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: I've said many times, you can't be the Democratic nominee and you can't win a general election as a Democrat unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Chuck, how much trouble is Biden in with the performance in those other states? Even his one-time overwhelming lead in South Carolina is now beginning to slip away.\n\nCHARLES LANE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, obviously, he's in a lot of trouble. And let's be candid here, a lot of people foresaw this kind of downward spiral if Biden was unable to up his game on the campaign trail and present as a more dynamic candidate. And he, so far, has not delivered.\n\nSouth Carolina, with its large base of African-American voters is and was his firewall and it will be tested now in a way that is vital to the future of his candidacy.\n\nYou know, he is not that strong among Latino voters. It's Bernie Sanders who seems to be polling among Latino voters in Nevada, which only heightens the importance of South Carolina. If Biden goes down and we're left with this sort of spread of several candidates, none of whom with a clear majority, then you could be looking at somebody -- or the primary season ending with no one having a majority and then things get really complicated.\n\nWALLACE: No, they get really great because you're talking about a brokered convention, which all of us have been looking towards for our entire political lives.\n\nBut, you know, let me pick up with you, Michael, on the point I was making with Mayor Buttigieg. You've got Bernie Sanders over here on the left and with Elizabeth Warren starting to fade, seeming to have a pretty clear shot in his path. And, meanwhile, you've got this center lane all clogged up with Buttigieg and Klobuchar and Biden and Bloomberg about to get into it.\n\nHow well is this setting up for Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee?\n\nMICHAEL ANTON, FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL SPOKESMAN: Well, the fundamental problem the Democrats have is they have a big gap between enthusiasm and electability. So it seems like all the energy on the basis is for Bernie or for somebody on the left side of the party, but then you have an establishment and a leadership in the party who really worries that going that far to the left just guarantees a Trump re-election and we need some more moderate person to play nationwide, but they can't settle on who that more moderate person is.\n\nSo that lane remains clogged up. I think it's -- it's amazing to me that a -- a mayor of a town of 100,000 is actually in the top two in the Democratic nomination. Keep in mind that no mayor of New York City, population 8 million, the capital of the world, has gone on to higher office, of any higher office, since 1840. Not 1940, but 1840. So that sort of tells against Mike Bloomberg, but it shows that there is still a hunger from at least -- I don't think amongst the voters necessarily so much, but for part of the party to just -- we just need some kind of moderate voice in there. And even if it's the mayor of a small town, you know, we'll take it because they think Bernie's a disaster.\n\nWALLACE: Donna?\n\nBRAZILE: Well, the race is far from over. And I know everyone is focused on the four states that ultimately help us to winnow the field.\n\nThe field has been whittled. And I think what we're left with now is not just left versus right, we're trying to make sure that we elect someone who will give us the kind of country that we deserve, not someone like Donald Trump. And, therefore, it is clogged. It is clogged.\n\nBut I do believe that we are going to see a clarifying moment that occurs over the next two weeks. And by the time we get to super Tuesday -- I've been to four of the Super Tuesday states. Let me just tell you, Michael Bloomberg is dominating the airwaves. But you're right, I don't know where the energy is on the ground for Michael Bloomberg, but he is dominating the airwaves.\n\nAt the end of the day, Chris, we're going to have a nominee by the end of March.\n\nWALLACE: By the end of March?\n\nBRAZILE: Yes.\n\nWALLACE: No -- no brokered convention?\n\nBRAZILE: Sixty -- 60 percent of the delegates. We're going to have a clear shot at figuring out where the last two or three candidates will be. Yes, we're going to have a nominee.\n\nWALLACE: And -- and in 30 seconds, is Bernie Sanders a suicide pact?\n\nBRAZILE: Bernie Sanders is a strong, viable candidate with a lot of support out there.\n\nWALLACE: So you think you could legitimately beat Donald Trump?\n\nBRAZILE: I'm not there yet because I -- I'm not sure he's going to be the nominee.\n\nWALLACE: No, but I'm not asking you that. I'm asking you --\n\nBRAZILE: Don't try to get me in trouble on a Sunday (ph).\n\nWALLACE: That's my job.\n\nBRAZILE: I should be a mess right now.\n\nWALLACE: Thank you, panel. See you Sunday.\n\nUp next, our Power Player of the Week. He is known for merging punk with piano. Now he's trying to bring a new union between classical and pop.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: It's a constant test for symphony orchestra's, how to bring in fresh ideas and fans without alienating the diehards. Well now the guy who brought piano to the punk scene is taking on that challenge. He's our Power Player of the Week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nBEN FOLDS, MUSICIAN AND AUTHOR: Because there seems to be a hierarchy, which you would think exists where the symphony is the great thing and the -- the -- the rockers of the dumb ones. But it's not that simple and each have something to offer the other.\n\nWALLACE (voice over): Ben Folds is all about breaking down barriers. Musical barriers between pop and classical.\n\nAs artistic adviser to the National Symphony Orchestra in Washington, his late night sold out declassified concerts are the platform for his special mix.\n\nFOLDS: It's about unformalizing the symphony orchestra in a way that doesn't intimidate people. People go to the symphony and they think, oh, how do I dress? They don't even know. So, you know, we make it informal in a way for them to feel comfortable to be there.\n\nThe next artist that you're about to hear, I just discovered her on YouTube.\n\nWALLACE: He took us backstage as he oversaw his classical pop matchup. Folds admits it can be an uneasy balance.\n\nFOLDS: Orchestral musicians are demoralized by loud music that covers up what they normally do. They're having to do a dumbed down version of it. The rock band goes out thinking, wow, that wasn't loud enough, didn't feel it.\n\nWALLACE: Declassified as a means of de-confliction, and it's working.\n\nFOLDS: We've sold out every show we've -- we've done here. People have walked away with a Spotify playlist of classical music, which we can see that they are listening to.\n\nWALLACE: He's been blending genres since the '90s, when he started Ben Folds Five, which hit the charts with the ballad Brick.\n\nFOLDS: She's a brick and I'm drowning slowly.\n\nWALLACE (on camera): No guitar?\n\nFOLDS: No guitar. No. In an -- in an era that was all about the guitar. That was the grunge era.\n\nWALLACE: You called it punk rock for sissies.\n\nFOLDS: Yes, maybe nerds would have been a little better word.\n\nI realized that everyone could relate to piano music, but it just wasn't cool at the moment.\n\nWALLACE: Walk us through, when you're sitting at a piano, how you come up with an idea.\n\nFOLDS: I don't know. You know, like I'm -- if I was going to say, hello, Chris Wallace, you know, then I find it. So it would be, hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today. You know, like then I would -- I would find it on the piano.\n\nWALLACE: That's the Chris Wallace song?\n\nFOLDS: That's the Chris Wallace song.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let -- let me hear that again.\n\nFOLDS: Here's the happy version. Hello, Chris Wallace, how are you today? We make it minor and it becomes sad because he has more work to do.\n\nYou know, I just -- you find it.\n\nWALLACE: I love that.\n\nWALLACE: (voice over): Folds shares his creative process in this memoir. The title refers to a childhood dream where he spread joy by catching lightning bugs for others.\n\nFOLDS: As an artist, what I do is I capture the thing that I see, the thing that interests me. My job is putting that idea in a bottle, which I've taken my whole life to do, and to share that with other people.\n\nWALLACE: He's still sharing his lightning bugs and spreading joy.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: Folds is also an advocate for music education. His next project is a show with The Mister Rogers Foundation, writing songs with kids.\n\nAnd that's it for today. Have a great week and we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2020 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

The United Nations plans to replace an envoy who was expelled from Somalia after questioning the arrest of a political candidate with an extremist history, the world body said Friday.\n\nThe announcement came after three days of diplomatic back-and-forth over Somalia's expulsion of Nicholas Haysom, a longtime U.N. official who has also served as envoy to Afghanistan and South Sudan.\n\nU.N. spokesman Farhan Haq said Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has full confidence in Haysom, deeply regrets Somalia's decision and spoke twice about it with Somali President Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed. The world body also argues that its personnel can't be kicked out under the diplomatic doctrine that Somalia invoked.\n\nNevertheless, the secretary-general plans to appoint a new representative for Somalia, Haq said.\n\nIt's crucial that the U.N. mission on the ground is able to go about its work, he explained. That work includes electoral support and other functions.\n\nSomalia's U.N. mission didn't immediately respond to an inquiry about the developments.\n\nThe Horn of Africa nation announced Tuesday it was ordering Haysom to leave, saying he overreached and meddled in the country's internal matters.\n\nIn a letter to Somali officials, Haysom had raised concerns about the legal basis for the arrest of Mukhtar Robow, a former deputy leader of the deadly al-Shabab Islamic extremist group who defected and then ran for a regional presidency.\n\nRobow was a leading candidate, and the election was days away, when he was arrested last month. Somali officials said he hadn't completed a defection process and had failed to renounce extremist ideology, among other allegations against him.\n\nDeadly protests followed his arrest.\n\nHaysom didn't immediately respond to an inquiry Friday, and he didn't directly address his ouster while briefing the U.N. Security Council Thursday on overall developments in Somalia.\n\nHe did, however, say that the violent fallout from Robow's arrest does not bode well for upcoming elections and that Robow's case could discourage other extremist group defectors from abandoning violence to pursue political change.\n\nMeanwhile, Somali Ambassador Abukar Dahir Osman admonished the council that the U.N. and its representatives have an obligation to respect their mandate and to not interfere in our internal affairs.\n\nSomalia appreciates the U.N.'s help but distinguishes between the institutions that we are part of and individuals' conduct that has a detrimental effect on our fragile nation, he said.\n\nAfter three decades of civil war, extremist attacks and famine, Somalia established a functioning transitional government in 2012 and has since been working to rebuild stability.\n\nOther countries have, at times, booted U.N. officials. Guatemala, for instance, announced in 2017 it was expelling the head of a U.N.-sponsored commission investigating alleged corruption in the Central American country.\n\nAfter leaving for a work trip to the United States, he hasn't been allowed to return to Guatemala.\n\nGuterres has rejected Guatemala's request to name a new chief for the commission.
Blanca Blanco said she was nervous about attending the 2019 Golden Globes on Sunday after sparking backlash last year for her infamous red dress.\n\nI did feel anxiety about showing up at the Golden Globes but at the same time, I attended because making a positive outcome in a stressful situation is stronger than the alternative, the actress told Fox News exclusively. I will not allow fear interfere with my decision-making as I don't want to develop unhealthy habits — instead I faced and accepted the fear and will continue to grow.\n\nI am a strong believer that when life throws you lemons that you make lemonade, added the 37-year-old. Life is so fragile one needs to keep focus and move forward. I felt honored to be part of the Golden Globes again this year and happy to support the outstanding and talented women and the many actresses that I admire in this great business.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBlanco attended this year's show wearing a hot pink shoulder-baring gown by Christophe Gillarme alongside her boyfriend, actor John Savage. The appearance comes after Blanco told Fox News she witnessed their home burn live on television after the couple was forced to flee from the Woolsey Fire that had ravaged Southern California in November 2018.\n\nBlanco recently told The Hollywood Reporter she received death threats and tons of hate mail after wearing a bright red gown with a thigh-high slit and a plunging neckline during the 2018 ceremony while Hollywood's biggest stars chose to step out in black outfits to keep the spotlight on the sexual harassment and assault scandals plaguing the film industry.\n\nI've always done my own thing, but I didn't think it would be a big deal for me to wear a red dress to the Golden Globes last year, she admitted to the publication. From what I had heard, only the nominees were going to wear black, and I thought it would be silly for me to show up in black.\n\nAtria Couture made my dress, she added. I wanted to stand strong and I felt so honored to be there, but what happened after I walked the red carpet was crazy. Photos of me went viral, I became a trending topic on Twitter and I got death threats and tons of hate mail.\n\nBlanco said she had no idea she would get slammed for wearing red instead of black.\n\nI support [Time's Up] — it had nothing to do with not supporting the cause, she explained. It was incredible to see all the courageous women come forward over the past year. I take responsibility for wearing color while everyone else wore black.\n\nStill, Blanco said the bold fashion move only boosted her career. In fact, she still owns the infamous dress.\n\nSome good things happened, she said. My social media following tripled, and my IMDb profile was ranked in the top 30 for several weeks. I was able to stay busy all year, and I did some films and magazine photo shoots.\n\nAt the time of the controversy, Blanco told Fox News she didn't mind skipping the suggested dress code.\n\nI love red, she explained. Wearing red does not mean I am against the movement. I applaud and stand by the courageous actresses that continue to break the cycle of abuse through their actions and fashion style choices. It is one of many factors leading women to a safer place because of their status. I am excited about the Time's Up movement; true change is long overdue.\n\nThe California-born talent said she was aware her latest style choice could garner criticism among women who felt she should be taking a public stand against sexual abuse in Hollywood.\n\nIt hurts my feelings, but I guess it's part of being in our industry, said Blanco. We have people who appreciate you and others that don't. The designer Atria Couture did an amazing job with my dress and I appreciate them for dressing me.\n\nShe added, Shaming is part of the problem.\n\nBlanco wasn't the only one to skip wearing black during the 2018 televised ceremony. Actress Barbara Meier also ignored the evening's dress code and opted for a sheer floral gown.\n\nThe black ensembles worn by the stars coincided with the launch of the Time's Up group, which created a legal defense fund for both women and men who believe they've been discriminated against or harassed in the workplace.\n\nMore than 300 members of the entertainment business signed a letter of solidarity, resulting in a coalition aiming to combat harassment in the workplace across all industries.\n\nAt the time, Time's Up also backed the movement for women to wear black at the Golden Globes in solidarity with those who have been sexually harassed.
In a reversal of a years-long decline in support for the U.S.-Cuba trade embargo among South Florida Cuban-Americans, a new poll shows more now agree with the restrictive policy that was eased by the Obama administration, but remains in place.\n\nThe poll, conducted by Florida International University, was evenly split between the 45 percent who said the U.S. should keep the embargo, the 44 who want it to end, and the 11 percent who said they were unsure.\n\nThat's almost a 10-point change from the poll that roughly two years ago found 54 percent wanted the U.S. to end the embargo - and showed more optimism about the prospect of improved U.S.-Cuba relations.\n\nAn overwhelming 80 percent of the 1,001 Cuban-American respondents viewed the embargo as a failure, which has not wrung enough democratic reforms from the Cuban government. But the change in the amount who support the embargo seemed to reflect a frustration with the lack of progress in Cuba since the sanctions were eased in recent years.\n\nPresident Barack Obama announced a restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2014, and loosened travel and trade restrictions. In 2016, Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Cuba since Calvin Coolidge, in 1928.\n\nYounger Cuban-Americans, including those from the second and third generations, expressed the most opposition to the embargo. Cuban Americans who came to the U.S. after 1995 also viewed the embargo more negatively than others.\n\nBut it was among older Cuban-Americans that support for the embargo jumped more than 10 points – from 57 to 68 percent - in the latest poll. And more than half of Cuban-Americans who are registered voters agree with maintaining the embargo.\n\nAt the same time, 63 percent said they supported Obama's decision to open diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n\nThe mood of the community has changed in the last two years,'' said Guillermo Grenier, the principal investigator on the project, and chairman of the Department of Global and Sociocultural Studies in the Steven J. Green School of International and Public Affairs, the primary sponsor of the poll. We see a community divided on the issue of the embargo, while still willing to maintain and even expand business relationships established as a result of the Obama initiatives.\n\nCuban-Americans continue to welcome and support many of the changes in U.S. policy since December 2014, such as travel, the maintenance or expansion of limited economic relations and the willingness to allow U.S. citizens to invest in Cuban businesses, the poll authors wrote. Yet, there is a retrenchment of old, less conciliatory positions by the old, less conciliatory segments of the community.\n\nThe embargo long has been described as symbolic by both its supporters and critics, who view it as a solitary move in a world that keeps diplomatic and economic ties with Cuba.\n\nThe new poll results explain why many Cuban Americans support the embargo, even as they concede it has not pushed real change in Cuba.\n\nDulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights, told Fox News: The survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression. The reaction among these Cuban Americans is a natural one toward the Cuban regime's intolerance and inflexibility.\n\nCuba each year urges the U.N. General Assembly to pass a resolution critical of the embargo, a text that normally obtains majority backing. According to Cuba, the U.S. embargo has cost the island more than $800 billion since it was was implemented in 1962.\n\nSucceeding U.S. presidential administrations and many members of Congress have said the embargo will not be lifted until Cuba moves toward more democratic reforms, like legitimate elections and freedom of expression. During his presidential campaign, and as president, Donald Trump said Obama's decision to ease trade and travel restrictions essentially played into the hands of a regime that had made virtually no concessions in return.\n\nCuban government officials typically deny the existence of political prisoners, saying instead that counter-revolutionary activities, or trying to incite others against the regime, is a crime.\n\nObama earned praise by moving forward with normalizing relations, particularly among those who said it was time to turn the page in U.S.-Cuba relations. But others said Obama gave away too much, and got back little or nothing in return. And not only did Obama's actions not benefit the U.S., the critics said, they did nothing to help the Cuban people.\n\nThe survey results reflect the rejection of the Cuban regime and its policies and practices. There is a collective weariness that has festered over time after so much frustration and oppression — Dulce Canal, spokeswoman for the Madrid-based Cuban Observers of Human Rights\n\nCuba's new president, Miguel Diaz-Canel, who took over last year from Raul Castro, who in turn succeeded his brother Fidel 2008, was the hand-picked successor of Cuba's leadership. And while some significant changes did take place under Raul Castro, including more access to the Internet by critics of the government, and the chance for Cubans to run their own businesses.\n\nTravel outside the island became less restrictive, and some of the government's most vocal critics, including Guillermo Farinas and Yoani Sanchez, were allowed to travel abroad – where they firmly assailed the island's political leaders in speeches and media interviews -- and return to Cuba. Many of those moves did not occur under Fidel Castro's leadership.\n\nBut much has not changed. Political opposition is discouraged and often punished, with threats of job loss and imprisonment. Dissidents still report incidents of beatings and arrests for participating in peaceful marches or expressing opposition.\n\nIf the polling is an accurate portrait, likely an 'exasperation factor' contributed to the increase in those supporting the 'embargo,' said John S. Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, Inc., in New York. From December, 2014 through November, 2016, there was an expectation, perhaps more of a rational hope, that the Obama administration changes to the bilateral commercial, economic and political relationship with the Republic of Cuba would continue through [a Hillary] Clinton administration. That was faulty thinking because of the outcome of the election.\n\nThere was also an expectation, and, again, rational hope, that changes taking place in the Republic of Cuba would continue but, more importantly, would increase in velocity, Kavulich said to Fox News. The transition from the Castro administration to the Diaz-Canel administration would bring a new dynamic.\n\nBut the result has been a continuing struggle by the government of the Republic of Cuba in determining the definition of success and the level of success permitted for a citizen, he said. Finally, there has been a disappointment by individuals of Cuban descent who reside in Florida with the abject lack of Obama Administration initiatives permitted to be implemented by the government of the Republic of Cuba.\n\n?
Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican who ran for Congress four times, is expected to be sworn in Sunday -- even as a challenge to her razor-thin, six-vote victory looms.\n\nHer journey to the House of Representatives has been longer and tougher than probably anyone else's in the 2021 freshman class, so her swearing-in -- albeit provisional -- is especially meaningful.\n\nIOWA HOUSE SEAT FLIPPED BY REPUBLICAN IN JEOPARDY?\n\nIt has been a tumultuous, arduous journey to get here, Miller-Meeks said in a recent interview with Fox News.\n\nIt is very humbling, she said. And you realize that when you tell people that you're going to fight for them, that they know it comes from a place in your heart that is deep, that's personal, and ... you have that resolve.\n\nASHLEY HINSON, FORMER TV NEWS ANCHOR, IS LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS — NOT TO 'LAUNCH FIREBOMBS' IN CONGRESS\n\nMiller-Meeks and Rep.-elect Ashley Hinson will become the first two GOP women to represent Iowa in the House, following in the footsteps of Sen. Joni Ernst, who became the first female senator from Iowa.\n\nMiller-Meeks, 65, is a physician and Army veteran who is moving up from a seat in the state senate. She ran as a pro-life and pro-Second Amendment Republican who would be a government watchdog on spending and fight for common-sense solutions to lower health care costs.\n\nShe supports increasing health savings accounts, tort reform, allowing the purchase of insurance over state lines, price transparency and altering what is considered an essential benefit on insurance coverage.\n\nShe first ran for Congress in 2008 to fight against socialized medicine. She lost by 18 points to incumbent Democratic Rep. Dave Loebsack. Undeterred, she ran against Loebsack again in 2010 and 2014 -- improving her vote share each time but still falling short.\n\nShe decided to not give up, hoping to set a good example for her two children.\n\nFor me, part of this was role-modeling for my children how to respond to loss, how to respond to grief, to failure, and how you pick yourself back up and conduct yourself, Miller-Meeks said. And then I felt I have something to give.\n\nWhen Loebsack announced his retirement, Miller-Meeks got in the ring a fourth time -- this time with a solid chance to claim a rare open seat for Republicans. She had more political experience this time around after winning a state senate seat in 2018.\n\nShe faced Democrat Rita Hart, a former teacher and fellow state senator, in the closely watched toss-up race. On election night, Miller-Meeks held a 282-vote lead. As more absentee and provisional ballots were counted, Miller-Meeks' lead shrunk to 47 votes.\n\nREP.-ELECT MADISON CAWTHORN, 25, WANTS TO CREATE 'NEW REPUBLICAN PARTY' THAT INSPIRES YOUNG PEOPLE\n\nA recount of the southeast Iowa district then found that Miller-Meeks had won by merely six votes. Iowa officially certified Miller-Meeks the winner with the narrowest margin of a congressional victory since a four-vote win in 1984.\n\nInstead of challenging the results in court, Hart is contesting the election with the House in a formal petition. Her campaign has identified 22 voters in the 2nd District who voted legally, but whose ballots were not included in the final tally. Hart is asking the House to launch a review of the election and count these legal voters -- which would make her the winner.\n\nSome of the 22 voters were shocked to learn their ballots were not included in the final count for minor issues with their outer envelopes. They held a virtual press conference this week demanding that their ballots count.\n\nIowans deserve to know that they will be represented by the candidate who received the most votes in this race, Hart said in a statement. A review of the uncounted ballots in this election proves that I am that candidate.\n\nTEXAS REP.-ELECT BETH VAN DUYNE SAYS OBAMACARE WAS ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIES' OF HISTORY\n\nEven though House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she'll seat Miller-Meeks in the new Congress on Sunday, her office said the swearing-in is provisional and could change depending on the outcome of the pending election challenge. It would take a vote of the full House to seat Hart instead.\n\nMiller-Meeks has faced setbacks before.\n\nShe was born the fourth of eight children in a family that relocated a lot because of her father's service in the Air Force.\n\nMiller-Meeks was the serious child who picked up reading at the age of 3 and enjoyed math and science. Because both her parents worked, the responsibilities of cooking, cleaning and doing laundry fell on the children.\n\nHer life took a scary turn at 15. Her family was living in Ohio, where her father was stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton. One day, her brother was cooking bacon and the grease caught on fire. Miller-Meeks tried to put out the fire but the grease splattered everywhere and the kitchen went up in flames -- burning her and her brother.\n\nShe said she was hospitalized for 5 to 6 weeks recovering from painful burns on her arms and legs.\n\nBeing a little petite, it was a lot of my surface mass, said Miller-Meeks, who is just under 5 feet tall.\n\nHer physical therapist showed such kindness and support that Miller-Meeks had an epiphany: She wanted to help people, too. She decided to become a doctor.\n\nHer parents, however, tried to temper her enthusiasm by being realistic, which Miller-Meeks took as being dismissive. So when her father was reassigned to Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas, Miller-Meeks left home at 16 and set out to prove herself.\n\nILLINOIS REP.-ELECT MARIE NEWMAN REJECTS SOCIALISM TAG; TELLS GOP TO 'GET OVER IT'\n\nShe got a studio apartment, starting working as a waitress and then enrolled in junior college in San Antonio even though she never officially graduated high school, she said. At 18, she enlisted in the Army and retired from the Army Reserves 24 years later as a lieutenant colonel.\n\nAlong the way, she completed nursing school and medical school, met her husband, Curt Meeks, and had two children. She relocated to Iowa for her residency in ophthalmology and started a private practice in Ottumwa, where she helped patients suffering from eye problems like cataracts, glaucoma and macular degeneration to restore their vision.\n\nMiller-Meeks served as director of Iowa's Department of Public Health under former Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad from 2011 to January 2014.\n\nDespite her success, she never wanted to forget her hard-fought upbringing.\n\nIt's why my name is hyphenated, Miller-Meeks said. I was the first in my family ever to go to college. The first to get a master's degree, the only one ever to go to medical school -- and it was important for me to be able to acknowledge my roots.\n\nMiller-Meeks leaned into her health care leadership and her doctor bio during the coronavirus pandemic, talking about the need for making health care affordable and lowering prescription drug prices. Despite her medical background, she does opposes lockdowns to control the spread of the virus and said schools and businesses instead should find ways to reopen safely. The shutdown consequences of suicide, depression and poverty are too great, she said.\n\nI think the biggest thing to tell people about the pandemic is that it's life versus life, Miller-Meeks said. There is this false narrative that it's life versus the economy, but it is life versus life.\n\nAfter her narrow victory, Miller-Meeks talked of the tenacity it took to keep going despite losing congressional races in 2008, 2010 and 2014.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI had a background of resiliency and grit and tenacity in just my life story, which was, I think, very appealing to people, she said. People had a sense that I really would go to Washington, D.C. and to Congress to fight for them.\n\nMiller-Meeks added: If nothing else, I hope my story inspires people to be willing to take a risk and to trust in their own talents and to not let failure define who they are and what they become.
The House Democratic Squad celebrated the anticipated Senate victories in Georgia and laid out their agenda for the Democratic-led Senate.\n\nWe got Georgia y'all! We got the Senate! Down goes Mitch!, tweeted Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., in reference to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell poised to lose power.\n\nBowman, a new addition to the progressive Squad, posted a video of him dancing in his car. He said having control of the White House and both bodies of Congress means bringing humanity and love into governance.\n\n5 TAKEAWAYS FROM GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nThat starts with the Green New Deal, Medicare for All, fully funding our schools, and more, he tweeted.\n\nThe Squad has been adamant on delivering more cash assistance of at least $2,000 per person for coronavirus relief, but that effort died in the GOP-led Senate. Now, they have re-upped their calls for bigger checks.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said it's time for progressives to push for retroactive coronavirus relief, student loan cancellation, climate justice, voting rights and ending the death penalty.\n\nDemocrat Raphael Warnock is the projected winner over Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., and Jon Ossoff is beating former Sen. David Perdue in a pair of Georgia runoffs Tuesday that will determine control of the Senate. The Ossoff race had not yet been called.\n\nWARNOCK PROJECTED TO DEFEAT LOEFFLER IN GEORGIA RUNOFF\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., who had previously tussled with Loeffler on Twitter, celebrated the senator's defeat. Omar said now it's time for transformative change.\n\nThis is our shot, we can go big or go home, Omar tweeted.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., credited the success in Georgia to grassroots movements for Black lives and to abolish Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and more.\n\nHOUSE DEM POSTS LEGISLATIVE WISH LIST WHILE AWAITING GEORGIA SENATE RESULTS\n\nIt's time we deliver for them, Pressley tweeted.
A growing number of Democrats considering a presidential bid have signaled support for the sweeping Green New Deal pushed by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other liberal lawmakers, underscoring how the 2020 field is being pulled further left by the influential progressive wing.\n\nAn analysis by Fox News shows at least eight potential Democratic candidates have voiced support for or touted aspects of the proposal, which amounts to a drastic overhaul of the U.S. economy and government benefit system.\n\nRep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., 37, who says he is looking at a 2020 presidential run, told Fox News he was excited to support the proposal and be a part of the process.\n\nWhen it comes to climate change, we need to advance policies that don't ask Americans to choose between their jobs and clean air and water, Swalwell told Fox News this week. We can do that by greening the grid with investments in renewable energy and a wage and skills guarantee for any displaced worker.\n\nOCASIO-CORTEZ FLOATS 70 PERCENT TAX ON RICH\n\nHe added: It's time to go big on this issue with bold solutions. I welcome a Green New Deal and am excited to offer additional ideas to create meaningful jobs and address the crisis of climate change.\n\nHigher-profile potential candidates ranging from Sen. Elizabeth Warren to Sen. Cory Booker also have voiced support.\n\nFox News reached out to nearly two-dozen Democrats seen as potential 2020 candidates to ask about their position on the Green New Deal. Some voiced support for the plan or pointed Fox News to prior statements of support, though most did not respond to the requests for comment or declined to comment -- leaving open the possibility that more potential candidates could lend their support in the coming weeks.\n\nThe expansive Green New Deal proposal has floated in Democratic circles for years but was given new life by the Sunrise Movement and liberal lawmakers like Ocasio-Cortez. The package would focus on income inequality and climate change, combining ideas incorporated in former President Franklin D. Roosevelt's signature New Deal, and modern ideas like renewable energy and resource efficiency.\n\nA draft text of the plan has circulated around Congress and laid out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. The proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.\n\nAnd it includes a host of other liberal wish-list items like: a job-guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one; a just transition for workers affected by climate change; basic income programs; universal health care and more.\n\nThe proposal already has garnered support from dozens of House Democrats, though it's unclear how far Democratic leadership in the chamber is willing to take the idea. But at least as a political talking point, it's beginning to take off in the field of hopefuls eyeing a challenge to President Trump.\n\nSen. Booker, D-N.J., issued his endorsement for the proposal last month. When reached by Fox News, a spokesperson for Booker pointed to his December tweet on the matter.\n\nWe must take bold action on climate change & create a green economy that benefits all Americans. Thank you to @sunrisemvmt & activists for your inspiring work. Excited to support a #GreenNewDeal, Booker tweeted on Dec. 14.\n\nSen. Warren, D-Mass., who has already launched an exploratory committee for a 2020 run, supports the idea of a Green New Deal to ambitiously tackle our climate crisis, economic inequality, and racial injustice, a Warren aide told Axios earlier this month.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has been on the leading edge in Congress pushing for universal health care and free college education, also offered his support for the plan, along with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii.\n\nSen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., endorsed the proposal last month and said he would introduce his own version of a Green New Deal in 2019.\n\nWe absolutely have to make sure this is part of the conversation going into 2020, Merkley told The Washington Post last month. Mother Nature is sending this message, and the youth have double down on the message.\n\nFormer Obama administration Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro, poised to make a 2020 announcement this weekend, will reportedly support the proposal, telling NBC News that we should do that, when asked about the plan.\n\nAnd Democratic darling Beto O'Rourke, who was narrowly defeated by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, in the midterm elections, is apparently supportive of the concept.\n\nBeto is supportive of the concept and how it invests in green jobs, and is looking forward to engaging more on the issue as it continues to develop, an O'Rourke spokesman said in a statement to the Huffington Post.\n\nMOST DEMOCRATS IDENTIFY AS LIBERALS FOR FIRST TIME, UNDERSCORING LEFTWARD TILT OF PARTY\n\nOther 2020 prospects, like Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., and Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, have weighed in, but not yet offered official positions on the plan.\n\nHarris' staff reportedly has been in touch with the organizers behind the Green New Deal. Brown reportedly said he did not know enough about the details of the plan to take an official position yet, though sounded skeptical.\n\nI've never bought that you play off workers against the environment because what I have seen is good environmental policy means more good jobs, Brown said on the podcast Pod Save America last month.\n\nFormer Rep. John Delaney, D-Md., who was essentially the first 2020 candidate out of the gate, praised the idea without outright endorsing it.\n\nWe need to act on climate change and a Green New Deal, which is broadly defined as combining policies that reduce emissions and help people economically, is a smart approach. I am less interested in slogans and branding than I am in real policies, which is what I'm running on. The details really matter., Delaney said in a statement to Fox News. The best start is the bipartisan one I introduced in Congress with the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act (EICD) - a carbon tax with revenues going back to the American people through a dividend. This plan can result in a 90% reduction in GHG by 2050 by changing behavior, encouraging innovation in new technologies and using market forces to reduce emissions.\n\nMARTIN O'MALLEY URGES BETO O'ROURKE TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT IN 2020\n\nMeanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden has not taken a stance on the issue.

Kirsten Gillibrand, and even Hillary Clinton did not respond to Fox News' request for comment on whether they would support the plan.\n\nFox News' Kaylie Piecuch and Adam Shaw contributed to this report.

President Trump has angered European Union officials by downgrading the E.U. delegation to Washington's diplomatic status -- and not telling them.\n\nThe move by the State Department, reported by Germany's Deutsche Welle, downgraded the E.U.'s Washington delegation from member state to international organization.\n\nWe don't exactly know when they did it, because they conveniently forgot to notify us, an E.U. official told the outlet, which reported that the move initially happened in October or November.\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES TRADE CONCESSIONS FROM EU OFFICIALS ON SOYBEANS, ENERGY, TARIFFS\n\nThe move largely relates to where diplomats are seated at functions such as dinners, receptions and funerals. DW reported that the delegation only realized when officials organizing the state funeral of former President George H.W. Bush confirmed the lowered status -- and Ambassador David O'Sullivan was called up as the last person to pay respects.\n\nThe decision sparked anger from the bloc, with an E.U. legislative group for U.S. relations writing to Congress, blasting the increasingly harmful approach from the White House and accusing the White House of demoting the E.U. ambassador to the bottom of the list.\n\nSPLIT EMERGES IN ITALY'S POPULIST GOVERNMENT OVER ACCEPTING RESCUED MIGRANTS\n\nThe letter, obtained by the Associated Press, complains that the administration has criticized the E.U. as bureaucratic and praised populist and nationalist movements opposed to sitting E.U. governments.\n\nSuch moves play into the hands of rival global powers and can only lead to greater fragmentation rather than much needed increased cooperation, the letter said, warning of threats from China, Russia and Iran.\n\nAn E.U. official told Fox News on Thursday that the status of the E.U. Ambassador was upgraded to the equivalent of a national ambassador in 2016 after E.U. member states committed themselves to a common foreign and security policy, but that decision by the U.S. was recently changed.\n\nWe are in touch with the U.S. administration regarding this episode, the official said.\n\nTrump has embraced a number of populist movements, particularly the effort by Britain to leave the European Union. He has also been critical of leaders, particularly German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who have embraced or encouraged mass migration.\n\nAnd he has made no secret of his disdain for the European Union as a body. He has repeatedly criticized the E.U. for unfair trade practices and has sought to change the trading relationship with the bloc.\n\nHe scored a win in July when he announced alongside European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that E.U. officials had agreed to increase imports of soybeans and liquefied natural gas, as well as agreeing to work toward the goal of zero tariffs and subsidies on non-auto industrial goods -- and to resolve recent tariffs imposed by both sides.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn an interview with CBS News the same month, Trump described the E.U. as a foe.\n\nI think the European Union as a foe what they do to us in trade, he said. You wouldn't think of the European Union, but they're a foe.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
2020 was not easy for many celebrity marriages, and Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's union was certainly no exception.\n\nThe 40-year-old reality star and the hip hop icon, 43, have been married for six years, after tying the knot in an extravagant televised celebration in Italy in 2014.\n\nOver the years, the fashion-forward couple has supported one another's professional endeavors, put on united fronts at awards shows and red carpet events, and of course, have been generous in giving fans a glimpse at their private lives on social media and on the Kardashian family's hit reality show.\n\nBut much like a number of seemingly sturdy celebrity marriages that fell apart in 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic, Kardashian and West's marital troubles loomed. Social media outbursts from West hinted at a divorce between the pair shortly after the rapper announced his 2020 bid for president. The couple appeared to keep it together, however, with Kardashian jumping at the defense for her husband more than once.\n\nHere's a look back at the couple's ups and downs over the last year and what may have contributed to their reported imminent divorce.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN HASN'T OFFICIALLY FILED FOR DIVORCE FROM KANYE WEST BECAUSE OF THEIR KIDS: REPORT\n\nKim Kardashian, Kanye West give a peek at their Calabasas compound\n\nAs 2021 neared, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were reportedly leading separate lives and had been spending a lot of time apart. But back in March 2020, the pair appeared in sync, sharing details about their home life and giving a rare glimpse at their famously minimalist Los Angeles mansion for the cover of Architectural Digest.\n\nThe rapper and his reality-star wife told the magazine that they let their kids run loose within their sprawling home, which features bare-bones furnishings and a beige and white aesthetic. West said it was designed with their family of six in mind.\n\nThe kids ride their scooters down the hallways and jump around on top of the low Axel tables, which they use as a kind of stage, West told the magazine. This house may be a case study, but our vision for it was built around our family.\n\nIn the end, we don't take it too seriously. We're not going to be fanatics, Kardashian agreed.\n\nKim defends Kanye amid Taylor Swift audio leak\n\nAlso in March, Kardashian voiced support for her husband when the full audio of the rapper's infamous four-year-old phone call with Taylor Swift about his controversial song Famous leaked.\n\nSwift used the opportunity to plug her donations to the World Health Organization and Feeding America in the midst of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and encouraged her fans to do the same. She also took aim at the Hollywood couple over the years-long feud.\n\nInstead of answering those who are asking how I feel about the video footage that leaked, proving that I was telling the truth the whole time about *that call* (you know, the one that was illegally recorded, that somebody edited and manipulated in order to frame me and put me, my family, and fans through hell for 4 years)…SWIPE UP to see what really matters, Swift wrote on her Instagram Story Monday in reference to the leaked video.\n\nKardashian fired back, defending herself and West in a series of tweets.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST DIVORCE 'IMMINENT': REPORT\n\n.@taylorswift13 has chosen to reignite an old exchange - that at this point in time feels very self-serving given the suffering millions of real victims are facing right now, Kim began her statement.\n\nTo add, Kanye as an artist has every right to document his musical journey and process, just like she recently did through her documentary, Kardashian wrote. Kanye has documented the making of all of his albums for his personal archive, however has never released any of it for public consumption & the call between the two of them would have remained private or would have gone in the trash had she not lied & forced me to defend him.\n\nKanye announces his 2020 presidential run\n\nWest took center stage on Indepence Day last year when he shocked many with the formal announcement of his decision to run for president of the United States in the 2020 election on Twitter.\n\nWe must now realize the promise of America by trusting God, unifying our vision and building our future, he wrote. I am running for president of the United States! #2020VISION.\n\nAt the time, the mother of four showed her support for West by sharing his tweet on her own Twitter profile with an American flag. Additionally, a source told Us Weekly at the time, Kim has known about his aspirations and has been supportive.\n\nKardashian 'furious' at West over remarks about abortion\n\nDuring his first campaign rally in South Carolina in July, West brought up the possibility of divorcing his wife while claiming they considered aborting their first child, North, 7.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA REACTS TO KIM KARDASHIAN, KANYE WEST SPLIT REPORTS: 'REALLY THOUGHT THEY WERE GOALS'\n\nShe was crying… and for one month and two months and three months, we talked about her not having this child. She had the pills in her hand, West continued (via People magazine).\n\nEven if my wife wants to divorce me after this speech she brought North into the world even when I didn't want to. She stood up and she protected that child. You know who else protected a child? 43 years ago, who do you think protected a child? West said at the rally as he began to sob uncontrollably.\n\nA source told the magazine that Kardashian was furious that he shared something so private. Kardashian later implied it was an episode brought on by his bipolar disorder.\n\nKanye's Twitter rant about divorcing Kim goes viral\n\nWest's fans began to fear for his mental health in late July as he went on a lengthy Twitter rant in which he touched on his marriage to Kim Kardashian, his fears of getting locked up and teased an upcoming album named after his late mother.\n\nIn one tweet, West wrote, Kim was trying to fly to Wyoming with a doctor to lock me up like on the movie Get Out because I cried about saving my daughters life yesterday.\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the Power rapper also claimed that he'd been trying to divorce Kardashian ever since she attended a prison reform event with Meek Mill in 2018.\n\nIn the same rant, he also shaded Kardashian's past Playboy spread and claimed that the reality star's mother, Kris Jenner, was no longer allowed to see his children.\n\nDays later, West issued a public apology to Kardashian. I would like to apologize to my wife Kim for going public with something that was a private matter. I did not cover her like she has covered me.to [sic] Kim I want to say I know I hurt you. Please forgive me. Thank you for always being there for me.\n\nKim breaks silence on Kanye's bipolar disorder\n\nIn response to West's social media outburst, Kardashian spoke up about the Yeezy founder's bipolar disorder for the first time, asking for compassion from the public.\n\nAs many of you know, Kanye has bi-polar disorder. Anyone who has this or has a loved one in their life who does, knows how incredibly complicated and painful it is to understand, Kardashian's statement shared to Instagram began.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN REPORTEDLY 'FURIOUS' AT KANYE WEST: A LOOK BACK AT THEIR RELATIONSHIP\n\nKardashian added she realized that her husband's words can carry particular weight and cause strong opinions and emotions due to his status as a public figure. However, she said she finds him to be a brilliant and complicated person that is simply struggling to deal with his mental illness at times.\n\nHe is a brilliant but complicated person who on top of the pressure of being an artist and a black man, who experienced the painful loss of his mother, and has to deal with the pressure and isolation that is heightened by his bi-polar disorder, she wrote. Those who are close with Kanye know his heart and understand his words some times do not align with his intentions.\n\nTensions rise in Wyoming\n\nThe pair reunited in late July at a local fast-food joint in Cody, Wyo.\n\nHours after Kardashian's arrival broke, photos of the couple show the two appearing to be in an emotional argument while sitting in their car.\n\nIn the pics, Kardashian can be seen crying while she and West are talking to each other. At the time, a source claimed to People that the pair had been discussing divorce for several weeks.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST LEADING 'SEPARATE LIVES' IN MARRIAGE: REPORT\n\nA second insider claimed that both the KKW Beauty founder and the rapper felt the marriage is over.\n\nFamily vacations, Kanye squashes beef with Kris\n\nIn August, social media footage showed evidence that the couple jet-setted to an undisclosed tropical location enjoying some R&R with their kids. West appeared to provide evidence of the family's reunion with a video of himself and daughter, North, 7, busting some moves. Kardashian was noticeably heard laughing in the background.\n\nMeanwhile, West took to Twitter to make it known he had smoothed things over with Kris Jenner.\n\nMy mother in law Kris Jenner ... makes the best music playlist, West, 43, tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN AND KANYE WEST HAVE BEEN CONSIDERING DIVORCE FOR WEEKS: REPORTS\n\nThe appreciative comments about Jenner followed reports he referred to the famed mom-ager as Kris Jong-Un, called her boyfriend Corey Gamble Calmye, said the matriarch is involved in white supremacy because she didn't reply to his texts, and informed her that she couldn't see his kids.\n\nKim recalls assisting Kanye amid coronavirus fight\n\nIn October, more information about the Kardashian-West household came to light. In an interview with Grazia magazine, the prison reform advocate revealed she helped care for West as he fought the novel virus in early 2020 while also caring for their four kids.\n\nKanye had it way at the beginning, when nobody really knew what was going on, recalled Kardashian. It was so scary and unknown. I had my four babies and no one else in the house to help.\n\nThe star said she'd change her husband's sheets and help him get out of bed when he wasn't feeling good as he fought the infection.\n\nKIM KARDASHIAN LAUGHS WITH KANYE WEST IN FAMILY VIDEO FOLLOWING REPORTS OF MARITAL STRUGGLES\n\nIt was a challenge because it was so unknown, she confessed. Changing his sheets with gloves and a face shield was really a scary time.\n\nKanye gifts Kardashian a birthday gift of a lifetime\n\nIn October, the KKW Beauty founder said she received the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime from West for her 40th birthday: a hologram of her late father, Robert Kardashian.\n\nShe recalled on Twitter: For my birthday, Kanye got me the most thoughtful gift of a lifetime. A special surprise from heaven. A hologram of my dad.\n\nThe KKW Beauty mogul also shared a two-minute clip of the hologram. I am so proud of the woman that you've become, Kimberly, and all that you have accomplished, the hologram of the late attorney said in part.\n\nWest reportedly also helped Kardashian celebrate her 40th by attending her birthday extravaganza in the tropics with friends. However, on Tuesday, an insider claimed to Page Six that West attended for only one day.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT NEWSLETTER\n\nHe showed up late and left early, he wouldn't appear in any of their Instagram shots. All he did was bring over the hologram of her father Robert Kardashian, then got out of there as fast as he could, the source explained to Page Six.\n\nKim, Kanye leading 'separate lives'\n\nAs 2020 came to a close, rumors ramped up that the Hollywood couple was on the brink of a split.\n\nA source told People magazine that the two very much live separate lives.\n\nThe insider said Kardashian, who is studying to become a lawyer, has been delving into her work and projects that are important to her. The source said West is doing the same.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKardashian and West began dating in 2012 while the Skims creator was still legally married to Kris Humphries. They became engaged just months after her divorce was finalized.\n\nThey married in May 2014. They share four children: North, 7, Saint, 5, Chicago, 2, and Psalm, 1. The marriage is West's first and Kardashian's third. She was previously married to Damon Thomas from 2000 to 2004 and to basketball pro Humphries from 2011 to 2013, though she filed for divorce after just 72 days of marriage.
As Iran and Venezuela become increasingly isolated and sanctioned by the U.S and much of the international community, the two governments are said to be tightening their bond - with the help of Tehran's proxy group, Hezbollah, in the middle of the action.\n\nTraining between Iran and Venezuela has increased in the past few years as part of a larger plan between the Venezuelan regime, consisting of increasing the number of Hezbollah operatives and their supporters across Latin America, Johan Obdola, President of the Canada-based Global Organization for Intelligence (IOSI) and former counter-narcotics chief in Venezuela, told Fox News. (Hassan) Rouhani and (Nicolas) Maduro have established a very firm and close relationship, which was of course initiated by (Hugo) Chavez.\n\nVenezuela's connections to Iran – and by default its proxy militia, Hezbollah – go back more than a decade. Hezbollah, which translates to The Party of God, is an Iran-backed, Shiite-dominant political and military group that began in Lebanon in 1982, following the Israeli occupation. It was designated a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S State Department in 1997.\n\nBut perhaps most crucially, according to analysts and experts, is that Iran and Hezbollah are said to provide strategic advice to the Venezuelan regime for safe keeping.\n\nIt has been proven that the Venezuelan government has ties to international terrorist groups. Therefore, what it is being requested is that the Venezuelan government be recognized as such; a regime that has brought the Venezuelan State to a failed status, said former political prisoner and mayor of Caracas, Antonio Ledezma. It is a rogue state. This is due to its ties with the drug traffic, due to its engagement in human rights violations, and because of its ties to international terrorism.\n\nThe links between the countries and the terrorist outfit are said to conjoin in an array of ways.\n\nIran and Venezuela at one point even had an agreement to build bicycles. The Iranian government wanted to use Venezuela to make bicycles. A little crazy, Venezuelan opposition leader Julio Borges, who has been living in exile in the Colombian capital of Bogota for the past 10 months, told Fox News in an interview. Hezbollah enjoys a kind of impunity in Venezuela too. They get Venezuelan documents and passports. And they can live and operate freely on the East side of the country.\n\nInvestigations in recent years have also revealed Venezuelan officials have directed schemes to sell passports to foreigners in the Middle East. In 2015 testimony given by an adviser to the Venezuelan embassy in Iraq, Misael Lopez Soto, the government is alleged to have delivered diplomatic documents to terrorists in the Middle East. Embassy employees were also said to have sold visas, passports, identity cards and Venezuelan birth certificates to those in the region who can pay between $5,000 and $15,000.\n\nMoises Rendon, associate director of the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Americas Program, also pointed out to Fox News that links between Iran and Venezuela remain potent and have long been cemented – with the murky mystery of Iran Air flights still unsolved. There was a direct flight daily from Caracas to Tehran. No one really knew what was on those airplanes, Rendon said. There was no transparency.\n\nThe mystery flight that shuttled between Venezuela, Syria, and Iran for three years – which was listed as a commercial route, yet no tickets were available for purchase without government vetting – was abruptly canned in 2010, amid a growing chorus of accusations that it was being used to move spies, terrorist and deadly cargo among the persona non grata nations.\n\nThere has also been close military cooperation among Venezuela, Iran and Hezbollah. Beginning around 2012, Iran's elite counter-terrorism unit, the Quds Force, started ramping up its irregular warfare Latin America training program – often using Hezbollah operatives to train both the Venezuela military and Colombia's FARC rebels. Quds Force-based operatives were also believed to be placed inside Iranian embassies and within religious institutions.\n\nThe Quds Force was especially present within Venezuela's National Guard, providing assistance to the regime for keeping the opposition at bay, according to analysts. The group also targeted youth of Muslim origin for recruitment.\n\nSome intelligence officials now believe recruits in Venezuela first receive indoctrination that can last months, and are sent to undisclosed secondary training camps across the country to receive training specific to urban combat. They are then shipped to primary facilities – sometimes off-shore – for higher -evel training. Dozens of recruits are also sent to Iran, rotating in groups of 10-20 every two to three months, according to Obdola.\n\nIn a video viewed by Fox News, ostensible relatives of Iran's Mohsen Rabbani can be seen sending a message to Venezuelan followers in Spanish, which is alleged to be part of the inter-country training. Rabbani has been accused of being the mastermind behind the 1994 AMIA terrorist attack on the Jewish community in Argentina that killed 85 people.\n\nVenezuela has also long been deemed a facilitator to assist Iran in evading sanctions – with the two countries coordinating to develop an array of business enterprises, financial institutions and religious foundations to launder Iranian money and solicit technology – dating bate to the Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad days.\n\nA crucial pillar of the relationship was to spread anti-American sentiment across Latin America. Yet tensions between Venezuela and neighboring countries like Colombia have long been at odds over Venezuela's suspected sanctions-evading support for Iran, especially through weapons exports and trades between the countries.\n\nA year earlier, U.S. intelligence reports indicated the two governments had established a National Geoscience Database with the intention to survey mineral deposits in Venezuela, prompting alarm it could be the restart of a uranium program. The current status of the program remains unclear.\n\nIran sees Venezuela as a fellow sufferer of the U.S., one intelligence source focused on Iran told Fox News. They know the tradecraft of evading sanctions, so they can pass that information on.\n\nAccording to the source, the capabilities between the two pariah countries comes from synergizing their economies and leveraging one another's skills and assets. Sources also pointed out the tunnels typically used in the region for narco-terrorist purposes are not surprisingly similar in structure to those constructed in the Middle East by Iranian-backed groups, Hamas and Hezbollah.\n\nThe leaders of both countries also share the commonality of continuing to accuse the United States of plotting regime change against them. While sanctions against Iran were reinstated last year after President Trump pulled the U.S out of the JCPOA, better known as the Iran Deal, Venezuela faced an increasing number of sanctions as the country's economy continued to crumble.\n\nAround 2009, Venezuela is also said to have started offering Iran contracts to build low-income housing, even though the tenders coming from within Venezuela's own private sector were half the cost. Iran in 2010 established the Banco Internactional de Desarrollo in Caracas as the first non-governmental bi-national bank in Iran, with its financing deemed to be of mutual benefit to both countries.\n\nBut the U.S Department of Justice last year claimed that some of the money used in the housing scheme went to purchase property in California, in violation of the trade embargo on Iran, according to a criminal indictment in New York federal court. Iranian national Ali Sadr Hashemi Nejad, who also had a passport to the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts, was indicted in March on numerous counts for the alleged violation.\n\nScores of Venezuelan individuals have also been flagged by the U.S. in recent times for having direct terrorist ties. In early 2017, Maduro appointed\n\nto be his Vice President, and thus relegated to the critical role of overseeing the country's Intelligence Service. According to one Venezuelan intel source, Aissami – born to a Lebanese mother and Syrian father – is one of the wealthiest men in the country, and for years has been under investigation by U.S. prosecutors for having close connections to Hezbollah and financing from their drug trafficking.\n\nAissami remained in the second-in-command role until June of 2018, when he was shuffled to the position of Minister of Industries and National Production. But Tareck is the most powerful official of the Venezuelan regime in charge of all the support, financing and expansion of Hezbollah in the Hemisphere, Obdola said.\n\nThere are others said to be involved in the Venezuela-Iran connection. Aissami's brother, Feras El Aissami, is believed to have moved to Uruguay last year, closer to the coveted tri-border area for drug trafficking operations.\n\nThen there is Ghazi Nasr Al-Din, a Lebanese national who became a Venezuelan citizen in 1998. He is wanted by the FBI for questioning regarding his alleged fundraising efforts with Hezbollah contributors. Al-Din, a former Venezuelan diplomat who served in their Syrian embassy, reportedly met with Hezbollah officials in Lebanon to discuss operational issues, beginning around 2006. Al-Din reportedly also sought donations for Hezbollah, and announced the opening of a Hezbollah-sponsored community center and office in Venezuela, according to the FBI. He later moved on to the Venezuelan embassy in Beirut.\n\nSome Venezuelan intelligence experts say relations between the two countries peaked during the reigns of Hugo Chavez and Mahmoud Ahmadinejad – both of who were out of office by 2013. But Iran is said to have affirmed its stronghold in Venezuela in the years since.\n\nVictor Mr. Mijares, a Venezuelan political scientist and assistant professor of political science of Los Andes University, Colombia, said the Iran-Venezuela relationship went through its golden age in the last years of Chavez's life, which ended almost six years ago. According to Mijares, both Chavez and Ahmedinejad shared common geopolitical objectives, and identified the United States as the main enemy.\n\nAfter Chavez's death, the relationship cooled down. But today, Iran remains an important ally of Venezuela in Eurasia and within OPEC, but its ties with China and Russia have been strengthened, and now Turkey is becoming much more important to the Maduro regime, Mijares said. But it is in the interest of the Venezuelan government to disassociate itself from the West and from Latin America, turning Venezuela into a Eurasian enclave in the Americas and thus not be punished by the diplomatic and economic hemispheric mechanisms. Hezbollah is supposed to be an ally in reaching that goal.\n\nIN VENEZUELAN CRISIS, FAMILIES CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO PROPERLY BURY THE DEAD\n\nCOLOMBIA'S PEACE AGREEMENT BLOODIED BY DISTRUST, DRUGS - AND THE VENEZUELAN REGIME\n\nIndeed, other areas of Latin America, outside of Venezuela, have interacted with Hezbollah.\n\nIn December, Deputy U.S Secretary of State John Sullivan cautioned that several Latin American countries are being forced to face regular terror plots at the behest of Hezbollah. U.S authorities consider the tri-border (TBA) region – comprised of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay – as a refuge for transnational crime and terrorist organizations. The area is often characterized as the most important Hezbollah base of operation outside of Lebanon.\n\nSullivan's warning came just weeks after the leading counterterrorism official at the State Department, Nathan Sales, told lawmakers Hezbollah has developed large caches of military equipment and explosives in Bolivia, in addition to sending operatives to Peru.\n\nMeanwhile, Colombian police in 2017 arrested Abdala Rada Ramel in Cartagena, a Lebanese national traveling with Venezuelan identification who was a key coordinator of the drug trafficking from Venezuela, Colombia, via the Caribbean to Africa, according to Obdola. In the Tri-border area, Hezbollah, along with other criminal and terrorist groups move approximately $43 billion a year from drugs, the weapons trade, and human smuggling/prostitution.\n\nForbes last year designated Hezbollah as the world's wealthiest terrorist outfit, with an estimated annual income of $1.1 billion, earned largely by aid funding from Iran, drug manufacture and trade.\n\nThe Venezuelan regime has been providing assistance to Hezbollah since 2005. The assistance started by facilitating Venezuelan IDs, including passports to Hezbollah operatives and later on they started bringing Hezbollah operatives to Venezuela and from there they travel to destination countries in Central and South America, Obdola explained.
Dustin Johnson will have gone 53 days from tapping in for par to win the Masters by five shots to blasting his tee shot down the hill at Kapalua toward the Pacific horizon.\n\nA little rust is inevitable, even with being on Maui for more than a week.\n\nMotivation doesn't appear to be an issue.\n\nMotivation for me, it's not that hard, Johnson said Wednesday at the Sentry Tournament of Champions, where he has won twice. I like being the best. I want to continue the good play and hopefully can have a little bit better year.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nThat would be hard to top.\n\nEven a year shortened by the COVID-19 pandemic — Johnson missed two tournaments when he tested positive — he was so good over the last five months that he ended the year with the biggest margin at No. 1 in the world in six years.\n\nThere's also that green jacket from the Masters that Johnson has worn a few times at home in Florida, once for a corporate outing and another time as a guest on ESPN's College Game Day (he picked Coastal Carolina, his alma mater).\n\nThat was his crowning achievement, a victory so meaningful to him that he couldn't talk while wiping away tears. Johnson has the video of his record victory at Augusta National and still hasn't watched it. Details remain clear, especially as he goes shot-by-shot through the final round.\n\nNo telling how he will react when he sees the emotion in his post-victory interview on the putting green at Augusta.\n\nEveryone that I've talked to or seen, obviously they really liked it and they said it was nice to see that I did show some emotion, just because I try out on the golf course not to try to get too excited or too upset, he said.\n\nTo look back beyond the Masters is equally impressive.\n\nJohnson was runner-up at the PGA Championship, losing a one-shot lead at Harding Park to a closing 64 by Collin Morikawa. He won The Northern Trust by 10 shots. He lost in a playoff at the BMW Championship to a 65-foot birdie putt by Jon Rahm. And he did enough at the Tour Championship to claim the FedEx Cup for the first time.\n\nHe has won or been runner-up in six of his last seven events.\n\nSmall wonder that swing coach Butch Harmon says, When he's playing his best, he's the closest thing to Tiger (Woods) when he's on. The difference is Tiger was on for 20 years.\n\nAdam Scott also made such a reference, noting that it's an unfair comparison because Woods did it for so long. Jason Day once had seven victories in a span of 17 starts. Rory McIlroy had three wins — two of them in majors — and three runner-up finishes in nine starts.\n\nIt's not that easy to do, Scott said. I only can list a couple, and of course then I can think of Tiger doing it for about 12 years. But he played at that kind of Tiger standard for the last five months.\n\nWhat gets Johnson excited — not that he would ever show it — is being on the Plantation Course at Kapalua to start a new year. He has missed it only one time, in 2015 after his only winless year since he joined the PGA Tour in 2008.\n\nJohnson spent much of last week down the coast in Makena to chill out and do a little work. Since then, the routine doesn't change. He can be found at a picnic table on the porch of the Honolua Store before dawn eating breakfast with his brother and caddie, Austin, and his manager.\n\nHe tees off as the sun is climbing and is done playing while breakfast is still being served.\n\nEverything feels pretty similar, Johnson said. Obviously, I'm not quite as sharp as I was probably back at Augusta, but I'm seeing a lot of the same shapes and I feel like I'm doing everything pretty well, even though I haven't practiced a whole lot here lately. But this is a good week. It's OK to be a little bit rusty.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is the largest field he has seen at this tournament with 42 players. Because of the shortened season, anyone who made it to the Tour Championship joined the 26 winners at Kapalua.\n\nThere's something about a new year, especially on Maui, that brings a combination of hope and optimism. That doesn't necessarily apply to Johnson.\n\nI don't have a lot of optimism, he said. I'm not hoping to play well. I expect to play well.
This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday, January 6, 2019. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, HOST: I'm Chris Wallace.\n\nShutdown, day 16, and President Trump is still deadlocked with House Democrats over the border wall.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nSEN. CHUCK SCHUMER, D-N.Y., SENATE MINORITY LEADER: He said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: Absolutely I said that.\n\nI'm very proud of doing what I'm doing.\n\nWALLACE: With Nancy Pelosi back as speaker, we'll discuss the new challenges facing the president in this era of divided government with White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nAnd we'll find out what House Democrats hope to accomplish from congressional leader David Cicilline.\n\nPlus, President Trump takes incoming from both sides.\n\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UT: I haven't decided who I'm going to endorse in 2020. I'm going to wait to see what the alternatives are.\n\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: We are going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about an even tougher road for the president in Washington.\n\nAnd our Power Players of the Week. Two new members of Congress and how they intend to work across the aisle to get things done.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For me, its mission. And when you are serving in the CIA and the military, you wake up everyday and you know what you're doing and why you're doing it, and I think it's no different in Congress.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED MALE: We've got to start socializing together. The polarization, the balkanization has taken us apart.\n\nWALLACE: All right now on Fox News Sunday.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington.\n\nPresident Trump now says the government shutdown could go on for months or even years. With the standoff over the border wall now in its third week, White House officials and congressional staffers met Saturday to work towards a deal, but prospects for a breakthrough remain dim as the new Democratic majority in the House seems determined to stand up to President Trump.\n\nIn a moment, we'll speak with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, but first, let's bring in Kevin Corke live at the White House with the latest on talks between the two sides -- Kevin.\n\nKEVIN CORKE, CORRESPONDENT: Chris, with no end to the shutdown in sight, top White House officials will join the president at Camp David today for a 2019 agenda strategy session, and as you can imagine, at the top of the list, ending the shutdown.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCORKE: From the Situation Room, Rose Garden, briefing and cabinet rooms, and this weekend, the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, President Trump carefully crafted a forward leaning posture during the shutdown this week but for all the crime statistics and letters to Congress imploring lawmakers to fund border security including the wall, an ominous realization has a cast a pall over the nation's capital, with no sign of movement in the negotiations, a partial government shutdown is unlikely to end anytime soon.\n\nSCHUMER: It's very hard to see how progress would be made unless they open up the government.\n\nCORKE: Now, 16 days into the shutdown, it is clear that despite increased face-to-face engagement, cooler heads haven't prevailed. In fact, the president turned up the heat, warning that he would consider using a national emergency to get his wall funding if Democrats won't budge.\n\nTRUMP: Absolutely. We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nCORKE: So, while the president stays here and then heads to Camp David, remaining in Washington will be Vice President Mike Pence. In fact, he will be here conducting yet another working discussion with congressional Democrats who, of course, are here with their staffers hoping to find a way, Chris, to end the shutdown.\n\nWALLACE: Kevin Corke reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thank you.\n\nAnd joining me now here in the studio, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders.\n\nSarah, welcome back to Fox News Sunday.\n\nSARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS, WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY: Great to be with you.\n\nWALLACE: So. What is the latest on the negotiations? Did they make any progress yesterday?\n\nSANDERS: Well, they made some progress yesterday. The fact that they're sitting down at the table is some progress, in and of itself. But, they've got a long way to go. I mean, Democrats set down, the first thing that one of the individuals from the Democrats' side said in the meeting was, we're not here to make an agreement.\n\nSo, this was the beginning of a conversation that still has I think a lot left to be worked out. They're going to meet again later this afternoon, and hopefully, they'll continue to make progress and continue to move the ball down the field.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, Democrats have said over and over again that they support border security, that they support protecting American citizens -- now, it's time to fulfill some of those statements that they've made -- work with the president, let's get this done; let's open the government back up.\n\nWALLACE: Well, of course, the question is -- is the wall the best way to do it? And I'm going to ask you about that in a minute.\n\nBut again, going back to Friday, the president meant what he said, that he is prepared to fight for the wall, to continue the shutdown for months or even years?\n\nSANDERS: Well, I think that's one of the things that people misunderstand. The president's not fighting for the wall; he's fighting for the protection of American citizens.\n\nWe cannot --\n\nWALLACE: But he wants the wall to do that.\n\nSANDERS: Absolutely. He wants the wall and he wants a number of other things. We have a completely broken immigration system. We have national crisis, not just of safety and security, but a humanitarian crisis.\n\nWe have drugs, we have human traffickers, we have terrorists that come across our border and there has to be a stop to that and we want to do -- not just the wall; certainly that's one of the most important factors. We know that it works; we know that in the places that it's been, it's 95 percent effective.\n\nWe want to be effective across the board and that includes the wall and other technology along the --\n\nWALLACE: But you're not answering my question. He meant what he said. He's prepared to continue this fight, this shutdown, for months or even years?\n\nSANDERS: Absolutely, the president means what he says when he says that. But it would be outrageous for Democrats who agree with the president -- that's what's the most outrageous thing to me, and something that frankly is so just incomprehensible -- they agree with the president. They agree that we need border security. They just are unwilling to let this president win.\n\nAnd I think at some point they have to decide that they care more about Americans than fighting the president. And so far, we haven't seen a willingness on their side to fully do that.\n\nWALLACE: But let's talk about caring about Americans, because House Democrats this week passed six bills that would fund eight agencies, unrelated to Homeland Security, unrelated to the wall, that would get them back going right now.\n\nAnd the question is, why not sign that bill, fund those agencies that have nothing to do with the border wall, and not hold those hundreds of thousands of federal workers, and the services they provide, hostage?\n\nSANDERS: We're not holding anybody hostage. The president wants to fund the government; he wants to open the government --\n\nWALLACE: But you could open those eight other agencies.\n\nSANDERS: Chris, we've been having this debate for years. At some point, we have to say, enough is enough. Until we can come together, we can be reasonable, which we have put forth in good faith multiple offers to Democrats to say, let's make a deal. Let's have a discussion; let's get to a place where we agree.\n\nWe have to stop kicking the can down the road and just continuing to say, let's do it again in 30 days. Let's do it in 45 days.\n\nLet's do it now.\n\nWALLACE: No, no, no. But do you -- but I'm not talking about Homeland Security. That -- you can continue to fight about that, if you want, and you shut it down -- but why hold agriculture hostage? Why hold justice hostage? Why hold the Treasury Department hostage?\n\nWhy not fund them? They have nothing to do with a border wall.\n\nSANDERS: The president wants to do this all at once. He knows it's better if they can focus on getting all of these packages done at one time.\n\nWALLACE: Isn't the real reason, because you want the leverage from all the agencies?\n\nSANDERS: It's not just -- it's not that. But you also have to look at the six bills. Those aren't the budget that we submitted, either. There are a lot of discrepancies between what we --\n\nWALLACE: Those have all been approved by Republicans in the Senate.\n\nSANDERS: They have. I'm not saying we oppose those six. I'm just saying, to make it like this is an easy deal; we want to be able to negotiate, but at the same time you can't just keep passing the buck. This is a major point of contention. And let's just sit down and work it out.\n\nWALLACE: OK. But if this shutdown lags on, not months or years, but even in to February, it's going to start to hurt real people.\n\nTake a look at this, Sarah. Federal tax refunds will be delayed. Food stamps for 38 million Americans will be cut. Millions of people will lose rental assistance payments and union leaders say hundreds of TSA workers are already off the job because they can't afford to get to work. President Trump thinks the border wall is worth all of that?\n\nSANDERS: Look, the president certainly doesn't want any of those things to happen. But you know what else he doesn't want to see happen? He never wants to make a phone call like the one he made earlier this week, where he spoke to Officer Singh of California's widow because an illegal immigrant came up off their border and killed him in cold blood. This shouldn't happen in this country, particularly when we have things that we know can help prevent it.\n\nEvery life -- that's what sets America apart from every other country; we value life. That it's what makes us unique. And the day that we stop doing that, even if it's one, 10 or 100,000, that's when we stop being the greatest country on the face of this earth.\n\nNot only people like that, but we also have a massive influx of drugs that come across the southern border. Ninety percent of the heroin that comes into this country comes across through the southern border and 300 Americans are killed from that every single month.\n\nWALLACE: But let's talk --\n\nSANDERS: We have to look at it across the board.\n\nWALLACE: Let's talk about the wall. Because there is no question that there has been a big spike in the number of family units coming across the border.\n\nThe president talks about terrorists potentially coming across the border. And here is Secretary of Homeland Security Nielsen. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nKIRSTJEN NIELSEN, SECRETARY OF HOMELAND SECURITY: The CBP has stopped over 3,000 what we call Special Interest Aliens trying to come into the country in the southern border. Those are aliens who the intel community has identified are of concern.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: But Special Interest Aliens are just people who come from countries that have ever produced a terrorist. They're not terrorists themselves. And the State Department says that there is, quote, their words: no credible evidence of any terrorist coming across the border from Mexico.\n\nSANDERS: We know that roughly, nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists come into our country illegally, and we know that our most vulnerable point of entry is at our southern border.\n\nWALLACE: Wait, wait, wait -- I know the statistic; I didn't know you were going to use it. But I studied up on this.\n\nDo you know where those 4,000 people come -- where they're captured? Airports.\n\nSANDERS: Not always.\n\nWALLACE: At airports.\n\nSANDERS: Certainly a large number --\n\nWALLACE: The State Department says there hasn't been any terrorists that they've found coming across the southern border with Mexico.\n\nSANDERS: It's by air, it's by land and it's by sea. It's all of the above. But one thing that you're forgetting is that the most vulnerable point of entry that we have into this country is our southern border, and we have to protect it.\n\nAnd the more individuals that --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: But they're not coming across the southern border, Sarah. They're coming and they're being stopped at airports.\n\nSANDERS: They're coming a number of ways. They're certainly -- I'm not disagreeing with you that they're coming through airports. I'm saying that they come by air, by land and by sea.\n\nAnd the more and more that our border becomes vulnerable and the less and less that we spend time and money protecting it, the more that we're going to have an influx, not just of terrorists but of human traffickers, drug inflow and people that are coming here to do American citizens harm.\n\nWALLACE: OK. The president now says, and this was a revelation on Friday, that he can go around Congress and build this wall on his own. Take a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: We can call a national emergency, because of the security of our country, absolutely. No, we can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it. But we could call a national emergency and build it very quickly.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: How serious is he about that? Has the White House drafted an emergency order? A resolution that he could, that he could -- that he could announce tomorrow -- we're going to declare a national emergency; we're going to build the wall. Has he set a deadline for when he's going to end talks and simply say, I'm going to go off on my own and do it? And is he really prepared --\n\nSANDERS: That's a lot of questions.\n\nWALLACE: Well, three.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: Is he really prepared -- it's still the same question, which is - - how serious is he? Is he really prepared to go off on his own and use money that was authorized for military construction and build a wall instead?\n\nSANDERS: The president's prepared to do what it takes to protect our borders, to protect the people of this country; he knows that the number one job he has as president and commander-in-chief is to protect its citizens. And if he doesn't take that seriously, whether it's at our southern border or whether it's from terrorists coming from whatever way they come, or any other place that --\n\nWALLACE: And does he really think he has --\n\nSANDERS: -- they can try to do harm to Americans, then he is not going to be the president that he knows himself to be, and he has shown himself to be over the last two years.\n\nWALLACE: And he really, just quickly -- does he really think that he has the authority to build the wall with funds that were appropriated for the military construction without congressional approval?\n\nSANDERS: As we've said for the last several weeks, we're looking and exploring every option available that the president has, whether --\n\nWALLACE: And is that a viable option?\n\nSANDERS: Whatever action he takes will certainly be lawful and we're looking at every option we can. This is something the president takes incredibly seriously, is very passionate about, and is not going to stop until he figures out the best way to make sure we're doing everything we can to make America safer and more secure.\n\nWALLACE: I've got less than a minute left.\n\nPresident Trump is at Camp David today to meet with White House senior officials about his priorities for 2019.\n\nWhat can you tell us about the meeting and about what his agenda is?\n\nSANDERS: We had an incredible first two years under the President Trump. The economy is strong. ISIS has been on the run. The judiciary is being made.\n\nWe have just a number of successes over these first two years. We want to look at how we're going to continue to build on those as we move into 2020.\n\nWALLACE: Top priority?\n\nSANDERS: I think the president's got a lot. Immigration certainly has to be at the forefront. Right now, that's one of the biggest things that we have to get done is securing our border.\n\nBut not just securing the border, but fixing the immigration system as a whole; it's completely broken. The president wants to make sure we look at all of the different things, loopholes we can close, to make that better. Infrastructure, fighting the opioid crisis -- those are going to be things that also not only are the president's big priorities, but things we think we might be able to get Democrats to actually work with us.\n\nThe American people elected them to come here and do more than just fight the president and we hope that they'll fulfill their constituents' hopes for them and do exactly that.\n\nWALLACE: Sarah, thank you.\n\nSANDERS: Thank you.\n\nWALLACE: Thanks for coming in today. Always good to talk to you.\n\nSANDERS: Always great to be here.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, reaction from a top House Democrat - what's their plan to end the shutdown? And what about those calls to impeach the president?\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: House Democrats have an ambitious agenda as they take over the majority from infrastructure to health care, to investigations of the Trump administration. But their first priority is to end the government shutdown.\n\nJoining us now from Rhode Island, one of their new leaders, Congressman David Cicilline, chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee.\n\nCongressman, what's the latest on where negotiations stand? Are your -- is your side willing to compromise with the president on the border wall, or are you, in effect, demanding his surrender?\n\nREP. DAVID CICILLINE, D-R.I.: No, I don't think we are demanding a surrender, but what we're demanding is that the government be reopened. We passed appropriations bill that were passed unanimously by the Senate. They were supported by Republicans. There was an agreement on those bills.\n\nThe president at the last moment changed his mind and that deal fell apart. So, we are trying to isolate the disagreement. So, we passed again the Senate approved version that -- it was the Republican path forward. That passed the House in a bipartisan way with Republicans and Democrats. We sent that to the Senate.\n\nWhat we are saying is open of the government. We'll have a short-term extension so we can resolve this disagreement. But we need to reopen the government and the president has really held this --\n\nWALLACE: I just --\n\nCICILLINE: I'm sorry.\n\nWALLACE: Let me just interrupt for a second, because Speaker Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Schumer have been hinting at this on Friday after the meeting, is that the Democratic view know that there can be no negotiations on the border wall at all until the president agrees to reopen the rest of the government?\n\nCICILLINE: I mean, I think we believe the government must reopen immediately. I mean, it's having real consequences not only to the federal workers, but to the contrary, in terms of food stamps, in terms of tax refunds, in terms of the safety at the airports with the TSA. I mean, there are real consequences to a prolonged shutdown. The president doesn't seem to understand that but it's really impacting small business. It's impacting people's lives.\n\nAnd so, what we are saying is open the government. There's agreement, bipartisan agreement on funding the government. Let's isolate the disagreement, the Department of Homeland Security and continue talking.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Let's talk about the merits of a border wall. Here's what new Speaker Nancy Pelosi says.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI, D-CALIF., SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: We are not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? The wall, in my view, is an immorality. It is, again, a waste of money and opportunity cost to protect the American people. But it is a diversionary tactic on the part of the president.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: I want to ask you a specific question, Congressman, why is a wall immoral? I'm not asking why it's ineffective or why you think the money could be spent better, but the speaker keeps saying the wall is immoral. There's a wall or a fence around the White House. People build walls around their homes.\n\nWhy is a border wall immoral?\n\nCICILLINE: I think what the speaker is saying is that we believe in securing our borders. We have appropriated $1.7 billion over the last two years for border security. The department has spent less than 6 percent. But we are prepared to do more because we need to do more, but we want to do it in a way that's effective.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: If I may just press, why is a wall immoral?\n\nCICILLINE: Well, that's a question the speaker will have to answer, but I think what she means by that is it doesn't reflect our values as a country, that America has been a place that welcomes refugees and immigrants, people who are fleeing violence and war.\n\nBut I think the real point of that, the rest of her sentence is it's not cost-effective. It doesn't achieve the objective. Democrats are committing to securing our borders. We have voted to secure our borders and appropriate significant resources to do it.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCICILLINE: But let's use technology, let's use drones, let's use satellites, let's do cargo inspections, which aren't happening. Let's do things that will actually secure the border.\n\nWALLACE: OK. But let's talk about the effectiveness of it. Brandon Judd is the president of the National Border Patrol Council. He's been a border patrol agent for 21 years. Here's what he says.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRANDON JUDD, NATIONAL BORDER PATROL COUNCIL PRESIDENT: Anywhere that you look where we have built walls, they have worked. They have been an absolute necessity for border patrol agents in securing the border.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Here's a guy who has been on the front lines, on the border for two decades. He says border walls work.\n\nCICILLINE: Well, look, I think there's no question there are places we have walls and fencing and other kind of barriers. I think good border security is going to be a combination of things. But what we've heard of from the president is he wants a big great concrete wall that will be a thousand miles --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nWALLACE: No, no, he's given up on the concrete wall. He is talking about steel fencing out.\n\nCICILLINE: But I think the reality is this is actually a fight the president has created to distract from the real issues that he's facing. The fact is the Republicans were in control of the House, the Senate and the White House for two years.\n\nAnd if this is such an important priority for the president, why didn't he do it at the beginning of the administration? He waited to the lame duck. Why? Because his defense secretary left with a strong rebuke of his foreign policy, his national security advisors sentencing hearing blowup because of the seriousness of the charges. His foundation was closed on for persistent illegalities. The gentleman heading the ISIS effort resigned.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCICILLINE: It was a bad couple of weeks. So what does the president do? He shuts the government down and he's distracted all the attention away from all of those pressing issues to the government shutdown.\n\nWALLACE: But, sir, the fact is, even The Washington Post today said that there is now a crisis at the border. There has been a dramatic spike in the number of family units coming across the southern border.\n\nI want to put up some statistics. In November of 2017, a year plus ago, the border patrol apprehended 7,000 family units at our southwest border. This past November, two months ago, they caught 25,000 family units coming across.\n\nAnd look at these recent incidents were border patrol agents had to fire tear gas at migrants who were trying to climb the fence and who were throwing rocks at the border agents.\n\nI mean, Congressman, the president is not making this up.\n\nCICILLINE: No, the reality is this is a complicated problem. It requires a sophisticated answer and I think the incoming chief of staff for the president and the outgoing chief of staff have both set up border wall doesn't solve this problem.\n\nWe need to have comprehensive immigration reform. We need to have additional personnel. We need to use technology. So we want to secure our border and respond to these challenges but we want to do it in a way that works, a way that will achieve the objective.\n\nAnd so, what we are saying to the president is open up the government. These other departments have nothing to do with this. Do not punish the American people by shutting down government if you don't get your way.\n\nWALLACE: All right. I got --\n\nCICILLINE: And --\n\nWALLACE: Let me just interrupt because I have two minutes left and I want to get to questions in.\n\nCICILLINE: Sure.\n\nWALLACE: The president said on Friday that he has the right, and he's even considering, and you heard it from Sarah Sanders just a moment ago, declaring a national emergency and building a wall in his own without congressional approval using funds that have been appropriated for military construction. If he goes ahead and does that, what will House Democrats like yourself do?\n\nCICILLINE: Well, I don't think the president has that authority. He would have to meet a very high standard. Article One establishes the Congress of the United States and gives us the responsibility of appropriating money.\n\nSo I don't think the president has the authority to do that, and I hope you will continue to try to work with Congress to resolve this disagreement but open the government first. This -- the government will reopen when the Republicans in the Senate and the president come to their senses and recognize that we shouldn't be shutting down the government if they don't get their way.\n\nWALLACE: Finally, I've got less than a minute, finally, freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib -- and I know you were expecting this question -- of Michigan said this on Thursday night.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: When your son looks at you and says, mama, look, you won. Bullies don't win. And I said, baby, they don't, because we're going to go in there and we're going to the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\n\n(CHEERS)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: What do you think of the language and what do you think of the idea of moving right away to impeach President Trump?\n\nCICILLINE: Well, look, Democrats ran on the agenda for the people, to drive down health care costs, drive down the cost of prescription drugs, raise family incomes by rebuilding American.\n\nWALLACE: I got all of that and I got a little time but specifically --\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nCICILLINE: Look, I think we need to move forward on our agenda. At the same time, our caucus is big and diverse and people are bringing their passions and reflecting the strong feelings of their constituents, and there are a number of people who think we should move quickly on impeachment. I'm one of the people who think we have to wait for Mr. Mueller to complete his report so we know all the facts before we take any action.\n\nWALLACE: And really quick, yes or no, do you condemn that language?\n\nCICILLINE: Look -- I'm not going to -- look, it's kind of odd to hear people on the Republican side who have not condemned the president's language in a million of different contexts to suddenly be clutching their pearls over her use of that language. Like, look, this is a private event, she can use whatever language she thinks is appropriate. The fundamental issues Democrats are fighting for the people of this country and we're going to focus on the issues that matter in their lives, and we're going to do our oversight responsibilities in a serious way.\n\nWALLACE: Congressman Cicilline, thank you. Thanks for your time, sir. Please come back.\n\nCICILLINE: I will. Thanks for having me.\n\nWALLACE: Up next, how long will the shutdown drag on? We'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss the deadlock and when most Americans will start feeling the pain.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: Coming up, the shutdown over the border wall tests the new divide in Washington.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Without a wall, you cannot have border security.\n\nPELOSI: We're not doing the wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask our Sunday panel about the political power struggle, next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: The southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster. We've done a great job, but you can't really do the kind of job we have to do unless you have a major powerful barrier.\n\nPELOSI: We recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government. And we made that very clear to the president.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump and House Speaker Pelosi giving no sign of progress in talks to end the partial government shutdown and resolve the fight over funding for a border wall.\n\nAnd it's time now for our Sunday group. Former Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, Mo Elleithee of Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, Marie Harf, co-host of Benson and Harf on Fox News Radio, and Jonah Goldberg of The National Review.\n\nCongressman Chaffetz, there was an interesting development in the last couple of days. A few -- three, as I could them, Senate Republicans who were up for re-election in 2020 are now beginning to break with the president and say, we need to reopen the government. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Susan Collins of Maine, Tom Tillis of North Carolina.\n\nHow do you see this shutdown ending? When do you see this shutdown ending?\n\nJASON CHAFFETZ, CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I wish I could have that magic ball to tell you exactly what it is, and I hope it's sooner rather than later. But I think the Democrats have really put themselves in a tough box because the president is on the side of national security, protecting our border and doing what the federal employees, the Border Patrol, wants to do. They had 60,000 people they apprehended in November coming across the border. And when the Border Patrol goes out and says, we have to have some sort of impediment, something that will slow them down, some sort of wall or barrier, where we've done it in the past it work, that's a compelling argument.\n\nAnd I'm sensitive to Cory Gardner, who's a great member of the United States Senate, but now is the -- Congress always gravitates to deadlines and pressure points. And that's what I think is ultimately going to get this solved is the need, the desire to solve this now rather than continuing to punt it down the road.\n\nWALLACE: Mo, are the Democrats the one who were in a hole and are going to need to get out of it?\n\nMO ELLEITHEE, CONTRIBUTOR: I don't think so. I think most Americans would agree that this is the president's shutdown and that the president is basically holding hundreds of thousands of federal workers hostage over -- over this. And it's not just them. It's the people who contract with the federal government, people who aren't getting paid, people who are worried about paying the bills, people who are worried about paying their rent, people who may get stuck at airports. This is all -- these are the pressure points that are really going to move this.\n\nAnd I think to say that you're going to continue this for years over an argument, an immigration argument that is actually not proven to be effective, that is sort of in -- where there has bene a wall, we have seen breaches time and time again, almost 10,000 breaches among certain sectors of the wall that exist now. Rather than taking that money and investing in actual technologies that would provide real border security, investigating in more Border Patrol agents, that, to me, seems like a better way to go.\n\nTo keep the government shutdown and hurt all these people over kind of a fantasy answer I think is going to come back and hurt the president.\n\nWALLACE: I'll let you answer about the fencing answer. But -- but, I mean, here's the problem it seems to me. If the -- if Nancy Pelosi were to say tomorrow, all right, we're going to give you the money for the wall, she'd be thrown out as speaker. Her -- her House Democratic caucus would not stand for that. If the president were to say, you know what, I give up on the wall, his political base, that 39, 40 percent would turn on him.\n\nWhere does the pressure come and is going to be a surrender by one side to the other? Are they going to sort of lay down the instruments of war? Or is there going to be a compromise that involves something that the president ends up giving to Democrats, whether it's on DACA, the dreamers, people with temporary protected status,, whatever?\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG, CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, so that' -- that's part of the irony here, right, is the fight over this is almost purely symbolic now. It is a, if they win, we lose, zero sum understanding that if Trump gets anything he can claim victory for, Democrats will feel like it's a loss, and vice versa.\n\nThe irony is, is that there are serious public policy compromises that could be found here on DACA. There are serious restriction, like my friend Mark Krikorian (ph), who argued for, you know, things like e-verify that are much more important than a wall. But the problem is --\n\nWALLACE: And, incidentally, e-verify is -- is not --\n\nGOLDBERG: Shut down right now. Yes.\n\nWALLACE: Right. It's shut down as a part of the government shutdown. That's the system that -- that people can use to check as to whether somebody's in the country legally or not.\n\nGOLDBERG: Right. And so I -- to answer the question about the pressure point thing, it seems to me that if you actually end up -- right now it's a lot of posturing from the TSA and their union. But it seems to me that if - - if -- if airports start essentially shutting down and rip people out and the rest of the country start to feel the bite, that is where I think the pressure really starts to build. That moves markets. That's going to cause congressman to start buckling.\n\nRight now overflowing garbage cans on the mall is not exactly -- I drove past it this morning. It's not exactly like a scene from a Mad Max movie out there. But as time goes by, I think those are the pressure points. And you can see a lot of senators get weak in the knees about it.\n\nWALLACE: All right, I'm -- I'm going to ask all of you for a prediction in a moment, but if not for the shutdown, the big political story this week would be the House going back to the Democrats, Nancy Pelosi regaining the speakership after eight years in the minority, in the first speaker to regain the gavel since Sam Rayburn in the 1950s.\n\nHere she was on Thursday.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nPELOSI: I pledge that this Congress will be transparent, bipartisan and unifying, that we will seek to reach across the aisle in this chamber and across divisions across our nation.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Marie, whatever you think of her policies, Nancy Pelosi is clearly a heck of a politician. How effective do you think she'll be dealing with President Trump on this and other issues?\n\nMARIE HARF, ANALYST: Absolutely. And I -- I think I was one of those Democrats that underestimated her ability to win back the speakership with the kind of numbers she got. The fact that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez voted for her in the end is just a symbol of the fact that she was able to win back that speakership in a way that showed her strength and her legislative ability.\n\nThe two things the Democratic House have done now legislatively, they've introduced a bill to -- on voting rights, to get corruption out of Washington, and they've passed bills to reopen the government. So I think they put down a marker this week that they are not here to play. They have an agenda. They're going to push it forward.\n\nShe will have, I think, some challenges bringing together this moderate block of Democrats who re-won the House in places like Michigan. Elissa Slotkin, coming up later on the show, she's one of them. She is a moderate. She is not an abolish ICE Democrat. Combine that with AOC and the liberal wing of the party, going into a presidential election --\n\nWALLACE: AOC, folks --\n\nHARF: That is now how we refer to Alexander Ocasio-Cortez. It's like JFK or LBJ, AOC.\n\nHARF: Exactly. Thank you.\n\nBut I think, you know, if we've seen anything from Nancy Pelosi in the few months since Democrats retook the House, it's that she can bring those members together. And as long as Donald Trump's in the White House, I think she's going to be pretty effective. And she's shown that this week in holding the line.\n\nWALLACE: OK, we got a minute left in this segment and I want to ping-pong back and forth and get your predictions.\n\nOn Friday, as it goes into the 21st day, if it does, the shutdown would be the longest in history, midnight Friday. Will we, a week from today, will the shutdown still be going on? And when it ends, which side is going to be seen as winning?\n\nCHAFFETZ: Still going on and I think the next pressure point is actually the State of the Union at the end of January. I think if -- you will see some --\n\nWALLACE: So that's like January 29th?\n\nCHAFFETZ: Yes. I think it will continue on to -- to go on to that -- to that point.\n\nWALLACE: And who's going to win?\n\nCHAFFETZ: I think the Republicans are going to win. They're on the right side of the argument.\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nCHAFFETZ: Protecting our borders is the right side of the argument.\n\nWALLACE: Mo.\n\nELLEITHEE: I think it goes on probably for at least a couple more weeks. But I think the points that Jonah were making and others were making, when this starts to be felt in people's homes or in their community or in the airports --\n\nWALLACE: And who caves?\n\nELLEITHEE: The president will -- will -- will cave and Democrats will actually find a way to help him cave a little bit less painfully is -- is what's going to be really interesting.\n\nWALLACE: Marie.\n\nHARF: I actually hope that Democrats get something like DACA out of this. I don't want this to keep going on. But, you're right, the more real people that feel this, people that can't pay rent, if it goes on till the State of the Union, I think that's insane. That is crazy.\n\nGOLDBERG: I think it goes past the State of the Union --\n\nHARF: Oh, my God.\n\nGOLDBERG: And I think the living will envy the dead.\n\nNo, I think -- I do think it goes past the State of the Union and they will find a way for everyone to declare a victory.\n\nWALLACE: Well, that's very sensible. And, actually, I do think that's true. I mean it can't be a complete surrender.\n\nGOLDBERG: Right.\n\nHARF: Right.\n\nWALLACE: It has to be the kind of compromise.\n\nAll right, panel, we have to take a break here. When we come back, the living will envy the dead. President Trump takes incoming from both sides. A freshman Democrat makes an obscene call for his impeachment, and a longtime Republican rival arrives in Washington and wastes no time taking a shot.\n\nAnd what would you like to ask the panel about Mitt Romney's criticism of the president? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. MITT ROMNEY, R-UT: I've laid out time and again places where I disagree with the president.\n\nThey are places that relate to the, if you will, forming of national character that I think we can do a better job.\n\nTRUMP: If he fought really hard against President Obama, like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: President Trump responding to a brand-new Senator Mitt Romney, who wrote a controversial article this week saying the president has not risen to the mantle of the office, which understandably got a lot of attention.\n\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\n\nCongressman Chaffetz, you were -- are a former congressman from Utah. What do you make of -- of Mitt Romney, before he is even sworn in, having an op- ed in The Washington Post that -- that basically says this president is living -- not living up to his responsibilities as president, certainly in the image department, and what's the reaction been back home?\n\nCHAFFETZ: Well, this is not the -- candidate Romney didn't -- didn't talk like this. That's not who he was. He accepted his endorsement in October. In a debate he was asked a question and he said he's putting the past behind him. He looks to working forward.\n\nI think it was an unforced error. And he was elected to represent the state of Utah to solve problems. This didn't solve a problem, it created a problem. I think it was an unforced error.\n\nWALLACE: Why do you think he did it?\n\nCHAFFETZ: I think he does believe it. I think it's in his heart. But -- and I don't think that it's going to do anything to actually move the meter and accomplish things. I don't -- I don't know why he would do it before he was sworn in. I think a lot of people are scratching their head.\n\nWALLACE: All right. We asked you for questions for the panel and we got a lot of head scratching and reactions on Romney's criticism of President Trump. Mike Johnson sent this on FaceBook. When is he switching to the Democratic Party, because he obviously is no longer a Republican? And Jean Caragher tweeted this, is he positioning himself to challenge President Trump for the 2020 nomination?\n\nMarie, how do you answer them?\n\nHARF: Well, in response to the first question, I think that's actually a problem the Republican Party has, that they -- that there are some member of the party, President Trump's base, that feels like there's not room in the public discourse for Republicans to criticize President Trump. And if that's the direction the party's going, they will, at some point, no longer be a true national party and they will be the party of the 30 percent Donald Trump base. So I think what will be interesting is what this Senate does as we get the Mueller report, as things get more difficult for the president.\n\nI don't think Mitt Romney's going to challenge Donald Trump in 2020. That's just my instinct. I do think John Kasich might. I think Jeff Flake might. And a lot will depend on the Mueller report. This is the 800-pound gorilla in the room and once we get that, I think you'll see some Republicans make some decisions about that primary.\n\nWALLACE: Then there was, and we talked about this before with Congressman Cicilline, Congresswoman -- freshman Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and her attack this week on the president, her obscene attack, and President Trump's response.\n\nTake a look.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nREP. RASHIDA TLAIB, D-MICH.: We're going to go in there and we're going to impeach the mother (EXPLETIVE DELETED).\n\nTRUMP: I think she dishonored herself and I think she dishonored her family.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nWALLACE: Jonah, this clearly, in the very first week that the House Democrats took over and had done a lot of very careful things in terms of messaging, stepped on their message, the fact that we're talking about it, the fact that cable news has feasted on this. And I think, one, what do you think of that, and, two, the fact that this really indicate how much trouble Nancy Pelosi is going to have controlling some of the firebrands in her party?\n\nGOLDBERG: No, I think that's right. I think there are two issues here. One, the expletive, which she should have apologized for and just moved on. I don't think President Trump has an enormous amount of credibility condemning that kind of language or debasing discourse in any way.\n\nBut then there's the actual -- the policy issue, which is the impeachment issue. And Nancy Pelosi's challenge is to do something that she didn't do very well the last time she was speaker, which is to try to move legislation that divides Republicans, that peels off Republicans. And the one thing that will keep Republicans unified, at least for now, prior to the Mueller report, is all this impeachment stuff. If it just becomes -- if the Democratic Party is the antimatter universe version of what you were talking but with the Republican Party, which I think is a real concern, of just the anti-Trump party, than that will unify the Republicans.\n\nAnd so get -- staying quiet about impeachment is totally in Nancy Pelosi's and the Democrat's long-term interest until there's a reason to actually talk about impeachment.\n\nWALLACE: I mean, in fairness, we heard Congressman Cicilline today say exactly that, and Jerry Nadler, who is the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which is where this issue of impeachment, if it's going to come up, would come up, said the same thing this week.\n\nGOLDBERG: Right.\n\nWALLACE: So --\n\nGOLDBERG: But it's a problem. But that's not with the rank and file want, right? In the same way that the Rank and file of the Republican Party wants it to be an always Trump all Trump party, the rank and file of the Democratic Party wants it to be an always anti-Trump party here.\n\nWALLACE: Well, let me ask Mo about that.\n\nOne, what do you make of Tlaib's statement, plus her refusal afterwards to apologize? And how much of a fever is there in the House Democratic Caucus to move right now and impeach Donald Trump?\n\nELLEITHEE: So, on the comment, I'd -- I'd -- I'd be hard-pressed to disagree with anything Jonah said. The -- I spent a lot of time talking and worrying about the trumpification of politics rite large and that people go to -- that he has now given everyone license to use this kind of language and I think that is wrong and I don't think Democrats can effectively argue against him by acting like him, nor can he criticize Democrats for acting like him. So I wish he wouldn't have used that language.\n\nBut I do think the bigger issue here is the talk of impeachment.\n\nGOLDBERG: Right.\n\nELLEITHEE: And I do think it is premature. I think most members of House Democratic leadership agree with that. Most members of House Democratic leadership understand that the politicization of impeachment, the way Tom Steyer is doing it, the way some members are doing it, is a very dangerous path to go down. There may come a time when this is a very relevant conversation and Bob Mueller will let everyone know when that time is.\n\nBut, until then, Democrats have a policy agenda to push. They've got a presidential policy agenda to stand up to. And they have an election to win. If they want to beat Donald Trump, the best way to do that, and have a mandate behind their own agenda, is to beat him at the ballot box. They've shown they can do that in 2018 and now they've got to do it in 2020. That should be where the energy of people like this remains focused.\n\nWALLACE: We've got about a minute left, Marie.\n\nThere was a very interesting moment on Friday because President Trump came out to the Rose Garden after his meeting with Nancy Pelosi and said, she assured me there's no interest in impeaching me, and she immediately pushed back and said -- or his staff did and said, she never said that, she just said this meeting is about reopening the government, it isn't about impeachment, which to me indicated that she and her people are very sensitive about the fact of not appearing to tamp down or step on -- not that they're pushing it, but they don't want to -- they don't want to stamp -- tamp down on Democrats who want to impeach.\n\nHARF: I think that's right, but they always condition it -- always, always -- in the leadership of the Democratic caucus right now on the Mueller report. That we cannot do this for political reasons, like it appeared with Bill Clinton or like Tom Steyer is doing. So I think they will keep it on the table conditioned on Mueller.\n\nWALLACE: All right. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday.\n\nUp next, our Power Players of the Week. We're going to introduce you to two new members of Congress and ask how they plan to reach across the aisle and end the shutdown.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nWALLACE: With the old guard in Washington not getting much done, we met this week with two new members of the 116 Congress to get their fresh ideas. We sat down with Democrat Elissa Slotkin of Michigan, who served three tours in Iraq with the CIA, and with Republican Mark Green of Tennessee, who was on the special ops team that captured Saddam Hussein. And they are our Power Players of the Week.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWelcome to Fox News Sunday.\n\nREP. MARK GREEN, R-TENN.: We're delighted to be here. Thanks, Chris.\n\nREP. ELISSA SLOTKIN, D-MICH.: Thanks for having us.\n\nWALLACE: You both talk about trying to get things done, trying to compromise, to break the gridlock in Washington. Be specific.\n\nLet me start with you, Congresswoman Slotkin. How?\n\nSLOTKIN: Sure. Well, the perfect example is the government shutdown right now. We have the basis of a deal, right? Both sides are saying they care about border security. They believe in national security. Start having a real negotiation about border security, border forces, more technology at the border, fencing if we needed it in some areas. It doesn't just have to be a wall. That's the essence of a negotiation.\n\nSo I think we can start now if people really care about getting something done.\n\nWALLACE: You're talking about the issues, I guess I'm talking more about attitude. Because it's -- you know, there are problems there and people have known about possible deals, possible solutions for a long time, but it never gets done. Why not?\n\nGREEN: I think what we, as a class, the freshman class, brings, particularly the congresswoman and I, is, you know, a life of service to the country. You know, she's prior military, I'm prior military and we want solutions. And we're just sick and tired of it not happening. And our constituents sent us here to get it done. So we're -- we're rolling up our sleeves and going to -- going to get it done.\n\nWALLACE: Well, I want to pick up on that because Congressman Green was a special operations flight surgeon in Iraq, part of the capture of Saddam Hussein. You served for years in the CIA, then for Presidents Bush 43 and Obama, a Republican and Democrat. What's the one thing that you think you can take from your service in national security and maybe help you here in Washington?\n\nSLOTKIN: I mean, for me, it's mission, right? You have a mission. And when you're serving in the CIA or military, you wake up every day, you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. And I think it's no different in Congress. Some people have treated it as if they don't have a mission, that they're there for themselves, they're show horses, whatever. I think making sure that people remember that they were elected to get something done and passed legislation is the most important thing.\n\nWALLACE: There are a lot of very well-intentioned people in that building behind me and somehow it doesn't get done.\n\nLet's take the shutdown. The wall that the president says has to be a wall or, you know, some version of a wall. You hear Nancy Pelosi say a wall is immoral. How do you compromise from that kind of rhetoric?\n\nGREEN: I think we find, you know, some common ground with what is border security and we get it done. I mean that's really what we have to do. And, you know, the president has looked at this and has said, this is what we need to do and, you know, I'm supporting him in this -- in this effort.\n\nSLOTKIN: I just think it -- literally, life is about negotiations. There is no one who lives their lives just saying I'm going to unilaterally decide what happen. So, negotiate. Get in the room, kick out the cameras and get something done.\n\nWALLACE: Where are you both on Donald Trump?\n\nQuestion for you, Congresswoman Slotkin, are the Democrats, particularly in the House, too anti-Trump?\n\nSLOTKIN: I think the tenor and tone that the president has set is just unbecoming of the country that I love. And, for me, that's critically important. I don't like policy by Twitter, but, to me, just because you're providing a check and balance on the president doesn't mean you don't have a responsibility to legislate and get something affirmative done. If we're only anti-Trump, we are not doing our job.\n\nWALLACE: On the other hand, congressman, you said during the campaign you can't imagine an issue where you would differ with Donald Trump.\n\nGREEN: So far every action he's taken has been spectacular, from cutting taxes that created massive growth at least in our state in Tennessee, to one of the biggest pay raises for our veterans -- our soldiers in -- in ten plus years. You know, I -- I think the actions that he's taken are spectacular and I can't see an area where I would disagree with him at this point.\n\nWALLACE: What about the tone?\n\nGREEN: I think maybe in some cases there are better ways to say things. But, again, I 100 percent support the actions that have been taken.\n\nWALLACE: Over the next two years, and I'll start with you congresswoman, how confident are you that you're going to be able to change Washington instead of Washington changing you?\n\nSLOTKIN: I think the nice thing is, we have over 100 new members in a body of 435 people. Any organization with that many new people, the culture changes. So I'm not saying it's going to be easy, and I've seen it already, you know, that sucking sound of people trying to get you to be very political, you know, salute the party instead of the country. You've got to be strong enough to push back. And that happens when you have people that you can link arms with and say, no, we're not going to do it that way, and I think we have that.\n\nGREEN: I came from a dirt road in a small rural town. My friends are not going to let me go off the rails. Many years in the military. You know, the night stalkers that I went to combat with are going to be on the phone with me saying, Mark, what -- what are you thinking if I -- if I do make the wrong decision or go the wrong way.\n\nTip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan would fight like cats and dogs in the daytime and in the evening they'd go out as Irishmen and have a scotch. And we've got to get back to doing that. And that's how we become friends. Maybe not agreeing, but -- but those relationships I think are what's really missing right now and something that I want to be a part of fixing.\n\nWALLACE: Congresswoman Slotkin, do you like scotch?\n\nSLOTKIN: You know, I'm going to suggest Michigan beer. You might want to try it. But --\n\nGREEN: Tennessee whiskey.\n\nWALLACE: All right. We'll leave it there.\n\nYou see, can't even agree on that.\n\nSLOTKIN: Never.\n\nWALLACE: Congresswoman, congressman, thank you both.\n\nGREEN: Thanks for having us.\n\nWALLACE: Good luck. We'll have you back and see how it goes.\n\nGREEN: Sounds good.\n\nSLOTKIN: Thanks for having us.\n\nGREEN: Thank you.\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\nWALLACE: And we wish the two of them the very best as they continue to serve our country in their new roles.\n\nAnd that's it for today. Have a great week. And we'll see you next FOX NEWS SUNDAY.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2019 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED. Copyright 2019 ASC Services II Media, LLC.

Winter storms have blanketed California's Sierra Nevada in snow, but the drought-prone state is still off to another drier-than-normal start to the crucial wet season, state officials said Thursday.\n\nCalifornia water managers said Thursday the Sierra snowpack is only 67 percent of normal in this winter's first manual measurement. The amount of snow is measured monthly through the winter at more than 260 locations to help water managers plan for how much they can deliver to customers later in the year.\n\nAs snow in the Sierra melts in the spring and summer, it flows into reservoirs for storage and provides drinking and agricultural water for much of California. The snowpack supplies about 30 percent of the state's water needs, according to the Water Resources department.\n\nPrecipitation has bounced up and down as the state continues to recover from a devastating drought that led to tight water restrictions for residents and farmers. Persistent drought has also dried out trees and brush, contributing to severe wildfires.\n\nGov. Jerry Brown declared a formal end to a three-year drought emergency in 2017, but said water conservation efforts must continue.\n\nThe last few years have shown how variable California's climate truly is and what a profound impact climate change has on our water resources, Karla Nemeth, director of the California Department of Water Resources, said in a statement.\n\nMore than 92 percent of California is considered abnormally dry, or in moderate, severe or extreme drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a project of several federal agencies and University of Nebraska-Lincoln. That's up from 56 percent a year ago.\n\nCalifornia typically gets about two-thirds of its annual rainfall between December and March.\n\nA storm is expected to drop snow and rain on much of Northern California, including the Sierra, this weekend and into next week, the National Weather Service said Thursday.\n\nAt Phillips Station, a water measurement site near Lake Tahoe, officials on Thursday measured 25.5 inches (65 centimeters) of snow and a snow water equivalent of 9 inches (23 centimeters) — about 80 percent of average for the early January survey.\n\nWe still have three wet season months ahead of us, so there's time for the snowpack to build and improve before it begins to melt, which usually starts happening around April 1, Michael Anderson, climatologist for the water department, said in a statement.
A Navy submarine commander was disciplined and demoted last summer after admitting to paying for female prostitutes while stationed in the Philippines.\n\nCapt. Travis Zettel lost the confidence to command the attack submarine USS Bremerton and was relieved of duty back in August following the investigation.\n\nThe investigation by the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) was launched following a sailor's tip to the Department of Defense Inspector General's hotline, saying Zettel told him he requested/ordered ten girls to arrive at the hotel, according to documents obtained by the Kitsap Sun.\n\nVERMONT COLONEL FORCED TO RESIGN AFTER FLYING F-16 TO MEET LOVE INTEREST: REPORT\n\nThe sailor later saw the commander with around 10 provocatively dressed females outside the front door of the hotel.\n\nAnother sailor also apparently enjoyed the company of women and was seen with three local females holding onto his arm as he was wandering around and greeting his fellow sailors.\n\nThe incident occurred in March 2018, while being ported in Subic Bay in the Philippines. The criminal investigation began in May.\n\nUS NAVY SHIP SAILS NEAR DISPUTED ISLANDS IN SOUTH CHINA SEA\n\nNCIS agents reportedly confronted Zettel with the allegations. He admitted culpability in the payment of female accompaniment, according to the documents released to the publication.\n\nThe second accused sailor was interviewed, but he did not participate in prostitution. He wasn't disciplined.\n\nZettel became the commander of Bremerton, the Navy's oldest submarine before its recent decommission, in August 2016.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBecoming the 15th commanding officer of the now 35-year-old 'American classic' is a proud moment for me and my family, Zettel said in 2016 after taking control of the sub.\n\nFollowing the investigation, he was reassigned to the staff of Naval Base Kitsap-Bangor-based Submarine Squadron 19, Navy officials told the Kitsap Sun.
Rep. Pat Fallon, a former Notre Dame football player with a big personality, says the future of the Republican Party will be more accessible, likable and inspirational.\n\nThe Texas Republican who openly considered primary-challenging Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, in 2020 says lawmakers who can't personally connect with voters or fire up a crowd will have trouble in the long run.\n\nI just tend to think that moving forward our future is going to be far more populous and far more accessible, Fallon said in a recent interview during congressional orientation while declining to name certain GOP politicians falling short.\n\nI think we're going to be dead as a party if we don't do those things.\n\nFallon, a 52-year-old entrepreneur and a former Texas state lawmaker, said the new group of bold House freshmen is a testament to a change on the horizon for the GOP. Fallon was sworn into Congress on Sunday with the most diverse class of GOP lawmakers yet who won hard-fought races across the country, leaning into their personal stories of defying the odds and standing up for American freedoms.\n\nREP.-ELECT TONY GONZALES HELPS GOP HOLD TEXAS BORDER DISTRICT: 'MY STORY IS THE AMERICAN DREAM'\n\nIt's about having better messengers -- and a better message too – and being likable, Fallon, a husband and father of two, said. I think the greatest virtue in politics and certainly the most underrated one is likability.\n\nFallon said he thrives on retail politicking and talking to voters. He got to the Texas state Senate through a 2018 primary challenge to a longtime incumbent, Craig Estes. Fallon accused the Republican of failing to hold town halls and working for the constituents. He beat the sitting senator in a big upset win during the primary (62% to 23%).\n\nFallon is a storyteller by nature. During an hourlong interview with Fox News, Fallon broke into no fewer than 10 impressions when recalling his journey from Notre Dame football to the halls of Congress. He altered his voice imitating his mother offering him advice, scary Democratic attack ad commercials and even his former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz.\n\nFallon was a member of the famed 1988 Fighting Irish national championship football team. Fallon says his role on the team was very minor, although he talks fondly of the lifelong bonds he made with his brothers. In his Holtz impression, Fallon said the coach knew Notre Dame was going to win if he put Fallon in the game: Of course, I wouldn't put his ass in unless we were up by 30 [points].\n\nREP.-ELECT AUGUST PFLUGER OF TEXAS CALLS BIDEN OIL PLANS 'EXTREMELY ALARMING'\n\nAfter football, Fallon found new physical challenges. In 2015, he completed the World Marathon Challenge where he ran seven marathons in seven days on all seven continents.\n\nFallon also dove headfirst into culture wars as a politician. In the Texas State House, he co-sponsored the Merry Christmas law that said public schools can't censor the use of Merry Christmas or stop children from celebrating the holiday and wearing red or green.\n\nHe caught heat in 2017 for opposing the city of Dallas' decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, blasting cancel culture cowards. He followed up by introducing legislation in the state Senate aimed at protecting our history and preserve certain monuments and memorials.\n\nSimilar Fallon-backed legislation passed the Texas Senate to make it harder to remove monuments, but it did not become law. Lone Star State Democrats slammed the effort as a disgraceful attempt to protect Confederate monuments and to disregard the pain and heartache of Black Americans.\n\nUTAH REP.-ELECT BURGESS OWENS, FORMER NFL PLAYER, COMPARES ANTIFA, BLACK LIVES MATTER TO KU KLUX KLAN\n\nLately, Fallon's taking aim at the Black Lives Matter movement and argues the left has exploited the death of George Floyd, who died May 25, 2020, while in the custody of Minneapolis police.\n\nFallon says all Black lives matter, including the life of David Dorn, a retired police captain who was killed while protecting a St. Louis pawn shop from looters during the Floyd protests on June 2. Both deaths were tragedies, but the left only wants to rally around one because it fits their anti-police narrative, he said.\n\nThere's murals of George Floyd, Fallon said. There are no murals of David Dorn. ... If they were both alive today who would you want to babysit your child?\n\nFallon rejects the notion that he has to sit out these conversations by nature of his skin color.\n\nI also realize that coming from a perspective of a conservative, White middle-aged man, there's a lot of people out there that say your opinion doesn't have as much weight as mine, Fallon said. The Squad is really great at that. 'I'm a woman of color.' Yeah, we're human beings. We should have equal weight. That's what Martin Luther King Jr. talked about.\n\nIn one of his first votes in Congress, Fallon joined all Republicans in voting against the new Democratic rules that strip all gender references from the text in an effort to be more inclusive to people who don't identify as either male or female.\n\nDR. RONNY JACKSON, NEW TEXAS CONGRESSMAN, SAYS JOE BIDEN SHOULD HAVE COGNITIVE TEST LIKE TRUMP DID\n\nFallon is the new representative for Texas's 4th Congressional District, a mostly rural and very red region of northeast Texas.\n\nHe avoided a traditional primary election because local GOP officials were tasked in August with picking who would replace John Ratcliffe on the ballot after President Trump tapped him to be director of National Intelligence. Fallon then easily won in November over his Democratic challenger with 75% of the vote.\n\nFallon is a former Texas state representative and senator who turned his college side hustle of selling T-shirts into his livelihood.\n\nDuring his days at the University of Notre Dame, Fallon started a T-shirt business to make extra money on campus. One week he recalled pulling in $2,000 in pure profit. It was beer money for the most part, Fallon quips, then adding with a smile: I should say spending money.\n\nHe said he had a knack for coming up with catchy designs and recruiting others to sell his shirts by offering triple the money than the competition.\n\nI don't think AOC and the other left-wingers had a business in college. They might not be so left-wing, Fallon said. I had to come up with capital, and then I had to buy the shirts and then I had to design the shirts and then I had to find a market for the shirts.\n\nAfter college, Fallon took those entrepreneurial skills with him to Sheppard Air Force Base in Texas. He said he made $18,500 base pay a year as a second lieutenant and struggled to get by. He started designing and selling shirts to various Air Force units and eventually made more money outside the military as an entrepreneur than inside the Air Force, he said.\n\nFallon served four years in the Air Force. Around that time, he connected with Rudy Ruettiger, the former Notre Dame football player and inspiration for the classic movie Rudy. Ruettiger was out on the speaking circuit and needed tchotchkes to sell at his table where he greets fans after events. Fallon pitched activewear with a Never Quit theme and eventually became his business manager from 1994 to 1996, he said.\n\nTEXAS REP.-ELECT BETH VAN DUYNE SAYS OBAMACARE WAS 'ONE OF THE BIGGEST LIES' OF HISTORY\n\nFallon ultimately launched a military and patriotic-themed clothing company called Virtus Apparel and branched out with businesses called Recon Sportswear and T-shirts Guys. Fallon said he's since stepped away from the day-to-day operations. Federal financial disclosure forms show Fallon listed assets worth between $11 million and $36 million from his business ventures and investments.\n\nHe said his clothing businesses received federal Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans during the coronavirus pandemic that prevented layoffs of any employees.\n\nFallon preaches traditional conservative values of limited government, repealing and replacing Obamacare, securing the border, fighting illegal immigration, low taxes, personal responsibility and promoting American exceptionalism. He said his district is very patriotic and for the most part they just want to be left alone.\n\nThey're really worried, as am I, that our best days may be behind us depending on what we do here before, Fallon said. And they sent me here to fight for the values that made us the greatest country history has ever known.\n\nHis priority in office is customer service and ensuring when constituents need help with navigating the federal government his office resolves their issue.\n\nOur goal is to be the most accessible and responsive member of Congress out of all 435 [members], Fallon said.
More progressive lawmakers have begun vocalizing support for a so-called Green New Deal.\n\nThe Green New Deal is an economic stimulus concept designed to tackle income inequality and climate change. It's modeled after President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal package of public works programs and projects created to help the economy during the Great Depression.\n\nOver time, there have been differing opinions on just what a Green New Deal should tackle – and how it would meet its goals. However, some critics of the plan, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, have thrown some shade at the proposal.\n\nPELOSI THROWS SHADE AS GREEN NEW DEAL UNVEILED: 'GREEN DREAM OR WHATEVER THEY CALL IT'\n\nIt will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive, Pelosi told Politico on Feb. 6. The green dream or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it right?\n\nA day later, Pelosi tweaked her tone, saying she hasn't seen the proposal but knows there's enthusiasm for the Green New Deal, adding it was welcome.\n\nHere's a look at what lawmakers are supporting now, and what some earlier versions of the concept meant.\n\nSeeing green in Congress\n\nProgressive lawmakers are pushing for a sweeping Green New Deal in Congress – even garnering support among a growing number of Democrats considering a 2020 presidential bid.\n\nA draft text of the plan circulating Congress includes a framework aimed at eliminating greenhouse gas emission from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources. The proposal describes this effort as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.\n\nThe proposal also calls for a job-guarantee program offering a living wage job to every person who wants one, a plan to aid workers affected by climate change, universal health care and basic income programs, among other things.\n\nGROWING NUMBER OF 2020 DEMOCRATS SUPPORTING 'GREEN NEW DEAL'\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., has argued a Green New Deal needs to tackle the tax code – which he said is stacked against renewable energy – by eliminating breaks for oil companies. Instead, tax incentives should be made available for clean energy, clean transportation fuel and energy efficiency, he said.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., reignited the call for a Green New Deal during her surge to Congress in the midterm elections. Her plan is a lofty one, calling for the federal government to invest trillions of dollars. In turn, she says, millions of high-wage jobs will be created. She compared her plan to the Marshall Plan, or the European Recovery Plan, where the U.S. gave around $15 billion to help Western Europe recover in the aftermath of World War II.\n\nTo fund a Green New Deal, Ocasio-Cortez has suggested slapping a tax as high as 70 percent on the nation's top earners.\n\nIs green enough?\n\nCritics have pushed back against the proposal, pointing to the price tag – estimated to be about $7 trillion – and global trends. Republicans have also decried the job guarantee included with recent Green New Deal plans, calling it a deeply flawed policy that would be detrimental to small businesses.\n\nThe only 'guarantee' is a badly distorted labor market, the Republican Policy Committee said.\n\nWHO IS ALEXANDRIA OCASIO-CORTEZ? 5 THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE NEW YORK CONGRESSWOMAN\n\nChris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute noted that the U.S. only emits a fraction of the global carbon dioxide emissions – meaning proposals included in the Green New Deal would only go so far in helping the climate without changes in other places, such as China or India.\n\nEarly Green New Deal ideas\n\nJournalist Thomas Friedman floated the idea of a green economic proposal, writing in 2007, I think that living, working, designing, manufacturing and projecting America in a green way can be the basis of a new unifying political movement for the 21st century.\n\nHOW TRUMP IS ROLLING BACK OBAMA'S LEGACY\n\nA redefined, broader and more muscular green ideology is not meant to trump the traditional Republican and Democratic agendas but rather to bridge them when it comes to addressing the three major issues facing every American today: jobs, temperature and terrorism, Freidman said.\n\nObama, too, incorporated a green plan into his $825 billion economic stimulus package which targeted the efficiency of federal buildings and home improvement like added insulation. But his plan was regarded as lackluster and slow to start.\n\nThere was also Solyndra, a solar-panel maker that received $535 million in Energy Department loan guarantees during the Obama administration before it went bankrupt. It repaid only a projected $143 million of that money.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nObama's plan is a classic example of why you don't want the federal government getting involved in industry, Edwards told Fox News.\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman contributed to this report.
This is a rush transcript from Tucker Carlson Tonight, January 3, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nTucker Carlson: As well as in the campaign against ISIS. Though he was little known to the American public, Soleimani was among the most famous living figures in Iran and also among the most powerful. According to some accounts, second only to the supreme leader of that country. The Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge against the U.S. in response to his death. Now whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. But it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs we could be engaged in a conflict, a real conflict, with Iran. From Iran's perspective we're already there. If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our joint chiefs of staff, for example, would you consider it an act of war? You would. So, what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've seen in Syria, it was a pivot point. Neo-cons in Washington understood that immediately. Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qasem Soleimani, tweeted disgraced former national security advisor John Bolton. Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. That of course has been the neo-con objective all along. The president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that regime change and war are not the point at all.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nDonald Trump: We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. We do not seek regime change. However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors must end and it must end now if Americans anywhere are threatened we have all of those targets already fully identified and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nTucker Carlson: According to secretary of state Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, Soleimani was killed to forestall planned attacks on Americans. But as he later conceded, those attacks would've occurred in the Middle East not here in America.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nMike Pompeo: President Trump's decision to remove Qasem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American lives. There's no doubt about that. He was actively plotting in the region to take action, a big action as he described it, that would've put dozens if not hundreds of American lives at risk. And last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent attack that he was working actively was disrupted.\n\nMale Speaker: Was there any imminent threat to the U.S. homeland?\n\nMike Pompeo: These were threats that were located in the region.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nTucker Carlson: Threats in the region. If you don't live in Washington, here's the translation. That would be in hostile middle eastern countries, places where American troops would never be in the first place were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot [spelled phonetically] and John Bolton. But nevermind. No one in Washington is in the mood for big picture questions right now. Questions, the obvious ones, like is Iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit? By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan 19 years -- sad years later, what makes us think there's a quick way out of Iran? And so on. Nobody is thinking like that right now. Instead, chest beaters like Senator Ben Sass of Nebraska are making the usual war-like noises, the ones they always make. This is very simple, Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night, General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans, which is essentially true. Soleimani was certainly a bad guy but does that make killing him very simple? It does not. Nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. Yes, Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans. Nobody mourns his passing. But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. So, does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? Can we start assassinating generals in the People's Liberation Army? Maybe. Maybe Ben Sasse will call for that, too. He's a former consultant and a very tough character. But before we enter into a single new war there's a criterion that ought to be met. Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer and more secure. There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. We can't kill them all. It's not our job. Instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens. Period. That's why we have a government. So, has the killing of Soleimani done that? Maybe. No one in Washington has explained how. Instead, like Ben Sass, they're telling us what an awful person he was. He clearly was. So? That's irrelevant. Meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. We're praying they don't, but they could. How do we know that? Because we've seen it before. We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. In the end we killed him. We invaded an occupied Afghanistan. We toppled Moammar Gaddafi in Libya. We fought ISIS in Syria and then for some reason stuck around. We're still there. We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger, who knows where all else. Many other places. In every single place each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and more expensive than we were promised in the first place. The benefits? Often, they've been non-existent. A lot of lectures about how the people we're killing deserve to die. Certainly, they did. Hope that makes you feel better. What do the American people think about all of this? Not that anyone cares. Well, it's too soon strictly speaking to know. The killing of Soleimani happened just last night. But just five months ago after months of supposed Iranian provocation. American's didn't seem to view Iran as a major concern, not even close. In a Gallop poll taken last August, just 18 percent of Americans said that they backed military force to shut down Iran's nuclear program. Seventy-eight percent said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. So, in a democracy you'd think this would matter but as is so often the case the preferences of actual Americans don't enter the equation at all. They're immaterial. In 2016, Donald Trump ran on a promise of fewer foreign adventures considering the ones we'd embarked upon didn't work very well. He vowed instead to focus on our problems here at home, which are growing. Against the odds he won that election, probably because of that promise, but ever since Washington, including some around the president, have been committed to ignoring the results of that election and its implications. Washington has wanted war with Iran for decades. They've been working toward it. They may have finally gotten it. Douglas Macgregor is a retired U.S. army colonel. He's an author of the fantastic book, Margin of Victory, a frequent guest on this show and he joins us tonight. Colonel, thanks so much for coming on. Where do you think we're likely to go from here?\n\nDouglas Macgregor: Well, I'm told that tomorrow the Iraqi parliament is going to vote overwhelmingly to demand the removal of our forces from Iraq. If that's the case I sincerely hope that President Trump will take advantage of it and get us out. We should've been out of Iraq and Syria a long time ago as the president pointed out, as you have reiterated. We gain nothing by staying in the country whatsoever. If these strikes, the follow-up strikes that we've had this evening, are designed to warn off the Iranians, we're going to leave but don't follow us then that makes some sense militarily. But if we are going to fight the Iraq order to leave and insist that we stay, then we're setting ourselves up for a larger disaster. As for the active killing Soleimani, I think we can say with some certainty that Iran will respond. Probably not in the way that we would. The Iranians are not like us. They do not emote. You've been listening to people emote about how much they hate Soleimani and blame the failure in Iraq on Soleimani. That's nonsense. We failed in Iraq. The generals and the politicians are responsible for the loss of American life and the squandering of our opportunities in Iraq. Soleimani simply took advantage of it and Iran now controls Iraq. And after this airstrike and killing of Soleimani, we've actually forced them together because the people of Iraq may not like the Iranians, but they don't necessarily want their country turned into a battleground between the United States and Iran. So, I hope we'll just leave. That's the key. If we get out, then we're going to have to watch for what the Iranians are likely to do, and we can talk about that if you like.\n\nTucker Carlson: My sense, my strong sense is that the president's preference is to leave, that it's always been that he's sincere when he says he doesn't want regime change and he's not trying to start any wars. He understands that those are not in America's interest and they're not in his interest either politically. I'm wondering, though, if the people around him understand that.\n\nDouglas Macgregor: Look. He walked into a room at Mar-a-Lago with Senators Rubio and Graham, Secretary of State Pompeo, National Security Advisor O'Brien, the Secretary of Defense Esper, and I assume Jared Kushner. You're talking about a room full of neo-cons. You're talking about the people that you've been discussing that have been urging war with Iran forever. They seem to have persuaded him that this airstrike made sense and that we should take the opportunity and do it. And publicly he's said that. I think it was probably unnecessary for the reasons that I've already outlined. This is not going to do anything for us strategically. As far as sending the message is concerned, his deputy has already taken over. The deputy has been with him since '97. This is going to stiffen resolve against us, and it's going to make any attempt to reach any arrangement with Iran virtually impossible. So, from that standpoint, I don't think it made a lot of sense. It's not necessarily helping us and what the president says he wants to achieve in the Persian Gulf with Iran.\n\nTucker Carlson: And quickly and finally, do you think it's likely if the Iraqi parliament issues a demand that Americans leave Iraq tomorrow, that we will?\n\nDouglas MacGregor: Again, I hope so. We have to recognize that Iran is a sovereign state. It has a sovereign government, whether we like it or not. If they tell us to leave, we should get out. Absolutely. No question. And I think President Trump should seize the moment, frankly, and get us out.\n\nTucker Carlson: I think he'd be relieved to do that. In which case, this would all be, I think, a win for our country. Colonel, thanks so much. Douglas Macgregor, great to see you.\n\nDouglas MacGregor: Thank you.\n\nTucker Carlson: Johnny Joey Jones is a veteran of the war in Iraq, he lost his legs to an IED there. Soleimani is believed to have masterminded hundreds of IED attacks during the U.S. occupation of this country, so we thought it'd be interesting to speak to Jones. He joins us tonight. Johnny, thanks so much for coming on. You have a very personal connection to this story of course. We just explained it. So, I'm interested in your reaction to what happened yesterday.\n\nJohnny Joey Jones: Well, I think it's impossible to separate the emotional appeal of killing someone who deserved to die and the overall strategic kind of cautionary tale of what are we going to do next? You know, I wrote for FoxNews.com today that the tactical decision to send troops into Iraq that I was a part of, the troop surge got the al-Qaida out of Al Anbar, but would we do next? What was the strategic goal after that? Same thing, I was a part of a troop surge in Afghanistan when I lost my legs. We got the Taliban out of the poppy fields, away from the opium trade, but what did we do the next day? And that was the problem, and I think a lot of this is that politicians that hold each other accountable, they throw each other under the bus. So, when we change presidents, sometimes we change policy for that purpose -- so that we can be a contrast, not necessarily more right or more wrong. And so, it's not so much that I take issue or really have an opinion over killing this guy yesterday. It's what are we doing next? What is the strategy, not the tactical, what did in this one operation, but what's the overall point here?\n\nTucker Carlson: That, I think, that's always the unasked question. It ought to be the first question posed to our policymakers. What do you think the guys serving there right now are thinking or the ones who are just deployed to Kuwait? What's on their mind now?\n\nTucker Carlson: They're thinking, let's get some. That's what they're trained to do. That's their job. Their job is to be there, be ready and to not question so much why as to how and when. That's their job. But when they go, and they experience war like I've done twice and they come back and maybe they have an injury, maybe they lost buddies. They get 10 years older, 10 years wiser. They pay attention a little bit more to politics. And they say, Why was out there? What was I accomplishing, and what was I told? And how much of it was true? I think President Trump at this very moment is as inclined for military as he is diplomacy. And he's thrown the ball in the court of Iran today with a tweet to say, Listen, you're not going to win a war, but you might win at the negotiating table, because I think that is his end goal. And he may have made it through advisers or through his own wisdom to the point that he understands maybe that's all Iran will respond to. That's our hope. That's our hope today. Is that Iran responds to military force. We really don't have a playbook to see if they will, and it's quite a risk and a gamble. And it's ultimately the gamble of men and women just like myself.\n\nTucker Carlson: Yeah, I think that's right, and thanks for reminding us of that. Johnny thanks for coming on tonight.\n\nJohnny Joey Jones: Absolutely.\n\nTucker Carlson: Absolutely appreciate it.\n\nJohnny Joey Jones: Thank you.\n\nTucker Carlson: Jim Antle is the editor in chief at the American Conservative. He's thought a lot about the political implications of all this. Jim, thanks so much for coming on tonight.\n\nJim Antle: Sure.\n\nTucker Carlson: Where do you think this leaves the president politically?\n\nJim Antle: Well, a lot of it depends on what's going to happen next. I think President Trump --\n\nTucker Carlson: That's right.\n\nJim Antle: -- campaigned on the idea that we were going to shrink our footprint in the Middle East. I think that's what he'd like to do. I think he's trying to balance the fact that he would like to do that with the desire to be tough. The desire to protect American personnel that are still in the region, but he has a lot of advisers who are committed to the things that he ran against. He has a lot of George W. Bush retreads who are giving him advice on what to do with Iraq and with Iran, and the danger is that once you've done some of these things, once you've committed to some of these moves, you're going to draw more troops in rather than drawing down, as I think the president would prefer to do -- that there is no easy exit strategy; that there is no easy way out. So, the hope is that this strike is going to cripple Iran's capacity to be able to threaten our people. We can move on, and if Iraq does, in fact, decide that they don't want us to be there anymore, as was always likely once we put a Shiite government in charge of Iraq, that they were going to be friendlier to Iran than Washington was ever going to prefer, that we use that as a reason to get out, having accomplished everything that we're going to accomplish there. But there's no guarantee that that's going to be the case. And the big risk is that unwittingly, just as Barack Obama thought the Iraq war was a mistake. Donald Trump thought the Iraq war was a mistake, but the people end up doing some of the same mistakes, repeating some of the same mistakes that they campaigned against. What we really want to do is avoid an Iraq-like war with Iran.\n\nTucker Carlson: One group that absolutely does not think the Iraq war was a mistake are most Republican senators.\n\nJim Antle: Right.\n\nTucker Carlson: Who are living in a world that very much resembles 1999, and I'm, and they're part of the reason this happened. They're the group pushing the White House onward toward regime change. I'm wondering how long it will take to get representatives in Washington who represent the views of actual Republican voters. When is that process going to come to fruition? When are we going to get senators who actually agree with Republican voters?\n\nJim Antle: Right or even military veterans who've served in some of these wars who are now telling pollsters that they think that they were a mistake, that they, you know, they believe that they should not have been waged in the first place so that the people who know this combat situation the best don't think our politicians and our bureaucrats and our generals made the best decisions. And so, we do have this huge lag, especially on the Republican side, when we had a situation where the president called for drawdowns in Afghanistan and Syria, and the vast majority of Republican senators voted to rebuke him. And in the case of Syria, we're talking about a war that Congress never voted to authorize in the first place. Well, here we are in Iraq, and we have most Republican senators saying that they don't want Congress to vote on whether we have further strikes against Iran as a result of yesterday's strikes. I think that's a very big mistake, and in a closely fought election, which we might have this year, and with the types of people who are working to undermine and impeach the president on sort of Cold War 2.0 foreign policy assumptions, Republicans are really behind the times, and they're really allowing Democrats to sort of take away some of the issues that helped Trump win in 2016.\n\nTucker Carlson: That's right. It's exactly right. I mean, that's the difference in the parties. When Democratic primary voters want something, their party gives it to them. When Republican voters say they want something, their party gives them the finger and ignores them.\n\nJim Antle: Right.\n\nTucker Carlson: And that's tells you a lot. Jim Antle, great to see tonight. Thank you for that.\n\nJim Antle: Thanks for having me.\n\nTucker Carlson: Well, another war in the Middle East probably would not be in the benefit, to the benefit, of the United States. Instead, it is our real number one foe that would benefit and that is China. What does China think of what's happening between the United States and Iran? That's next.\n\n[commercial break]\n\nTucker Carlson: We don't know where the situation with Iran is going but we can be certain that if it breaks into a full-blown war a few things will be true. It will likely cost much more than they tell you, possibly hundreds of billions of dollars. At the end America's likely to be weaker than it was in the beginning and we know this for certain, our biggest rival will be stronger. Who's our biggest rival? It's not Iran, despite what they tell you in Washington. It is needless to say, China. Well, we're continuing to squander money and blood in Baghdad and many other capitals in that region. China is growing its economy at home even as it expands its reach throughout Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa, even the heartland of the United States. One person who's paying close attention to this, one of the few who cares, is J.D. Vance, the author, of course, of Hillbilly Elegy and we're happy to have him on our show tonight. J.D., thanks so much for coming on. I don't think anybody mourns the death of Soleimani in this country anyway, but I wonder what the Chinese think as they watch this.\n\nJ.D. Vance: Well, I think one thing they're thinking is that just as the past two American presidencies have been bogged down in the Middle East in various ways this conflict risks escalating in a way that makes America focus on the Middle East for yet another few years, maybe another 10 years even as the Chinese grow in military might and economic power. And we know of course that they're planting various infrastructure and economic institutions all over Africa, all over Asia, that their entire economy is growing and flourishing and yet again we risk focusing on this small region of the world that is obviously important but not nearly as important as our biggest geopolitical rival continuing to gain strength and power.\n\nTucker Carlson: Well, that's exactly right. And so now especially that this country's energy independent we were promised for decades once we became energy independent we wouldn't have to focus all of our energy in the Middle East. Now we are and yet our energies are still focused there and we're still ignoring China. Why do you think that is?\n\nJ.D. Vance: Well, I think for a couple of reasons. One, we have an entire generation of American intellectuals frankly on both the left and the right who grew up thinking that the Middle East was just the most important region of the world. And so, one way of thinking about American policy really for the past 20 years, the George W. Bush administration, of course the Barack Obama administration, is that we had these successive wars. We basically had one new war per term, Iraq, and then -- excuse me, Afghanistan, then Iraq, Lebanon and Syria during the Obama terms and that's obviously terrible and I think you could make a good argument that none of those wars has actually been good for America's national interest but viewed from the Chinese perspective it's kept us constantly bogged down in these regions. Of course, the people who predicted that focusing on these regions would be good for America's national interests are still advising presidents, are still advising presidents, are still advising senators and diplomats, and the few people who recognize that China was a major, major threat are still a little bit on the sidelines of the mainstream foreign policy conversation. I think it's a disaster but if you understand sort of the American foreign policy establishment it's not that -- it's not actually surprising to understand why that's happening.\n\nTucker Carlson: I mean, just a macro question to end on. Why is it so hard for our elites to police themselves? If someone is consistently wrong about the big things, why is he still in the same job? If we allowed our heart surgeons to keep working with that kind of track record no one would survive surgeries. So, why do we allow our policymakers to be wrong time and again?\n\nJ.D. Vance: Well, Tucker, I'll give you a cynical answer and then a less cynical answer. I mean, the less cynical answer is basically that a lot of people just aren't very good and very smart at what they do and honestly I actually hope that's the answer because the more cynical answer is that as our country has successfully bungled or sorry successively bungled middle eastern wars and allowed China to rise, there is of course a group of people who've gotten very wealthy off of China's growing power and that's the financial elites who actually run the country who donate to the think tanks of course that produce the policy papers that so many of our politicians rely on and so I do think that one way of recognizing that there's been a massive failure here is that the people who have not been in service of the American national interests are still collecting a paycheck and the people who have gotten it right are still largely on the fringes and I think that's fundamentally a story of incentives and a story of who donors are benefiting from and who donors are paying to effectively issue what is propaganda.\n\nTucker Carlson: I don't think that's cynical. I think unfortunately you're exactly right and thank you for saying so so clearly and out loud. J.D. Vance, great to see you tonight.\n\nJ.D. Vance: Thanks, Tucker.\n\nTucker Carlson: Well, an armed civilian appears to have saved dozens of lives last week at a church in Texas. Really it was a wonderful, inspiring story. But on the left, at least an op-ed in U.S.A. Today argues those people shouldn't have been protected. Huh. We'll tell you what they said and why after the break.\n\n[commercial break]\n\n[music playing]\n\nTucker Carlson: Like most of his party's leaders, departed presidential candidate Julian Castro believed in taking away your Second Amendment rights. But don't worry, he said good guys with guns were a myth like bigfoot.\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nJulian Castro: More guns are not the answer. More guns don't make us safer. This idea that a good guy with a gun is going to stop a bad guy with a gun, it doesn't work that way.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nTucker Carlson: Yeah, that's not true, actually. And we were reminded of that just last week. An armed civilian halted what could have been a massacre in Texas in a church, likely saving many lives. But over at USA Today on the op-ed page, they were distressed. The op-ed said we should be, and we're quoting now, Horrified that so many civilians in that church were carrying guns. Dana Loesch, host of The Dana Show. She joins us tonight to assess this. So, Dana, we should be horrified about a scenario that worked as well as it possibly could. An armed civilian stopped a massacre. What's horrifying about that? What's terrifying about that?\n\nDana Loesch: No, I agree with you, Tucker. And thanks for having me. I find it horrifying that anyone at USA Today would actually find it horrifying to save lives, to defend innocent people, because that's exactly what happened. I was also, and the reason to remind everyone that we have this video to go by, is because sadly, the church was live streaming their service that Sunday morning, as they always do, and it ultimately was captured. But you see in that video, Tucker, there are about five other law-abiding individuals who also draw their weapons, which is probably what would happen at my church. And I'm one of the law-abiding people who carry in my church, and we are encouraged to do so. But five other people also drew their lawfully carried, lawfully owned firearms, and they held. They watched and waited and took in everything that was happening before then, which indicates a level of training and a skillset that shouldn't horrify people. In fact, it should encourage individuals, because we were always told that if there is more than one firearm present in an area such as this, that there's a mass casualty incident or someone armed comes in to do murderous intent, that it would turn into the Wild West. Well, it didn't. It took Jack Harris one shot and six seconds to neutralize this threat. God bless them and God bless Texas.\n\nTucker Carlson: It's just so interesting that you could look at this scenario and say of people who are literally in church on Sunday, you're the most decent, responsible people in our entire society. That it bothers you that they are exercising their Second Amendment rights. I mean, the contempt for those kind of people just baffles me. Don't you want more people like that?\n\nDana Loesch: Well, and it's -- yeah. And it's anti-science. You know, when you talk about Castro and Beto O'Rourke and Michael Bloomberg and all of these other individuals that want to circumvent our Second Amendment rights, when they talk about criminal usage, we can't have a conversation about firearms unless we are also including, Tucker, defensive gun usages. These are individuals who are in lawful possession of their firearms. And these numbers – defensive gun usage is, according to the CDC from Barack Obama when he commissioned this in 2013. It has therefore, it's -- I mean, it's been affirmed many times over, as you know, that they vastly outweigh instances of criminal possession. So, why -- my actual fear is that people find this bad, that there are good people out there who take the time to educate themselves, to learn about their firearm and to train, as we saw all those congregants at the church do just a week or so ago with Jack Harris. And then Jack Harris probably trained some of them as well. Now, that's -- people should want to be able, they should be able to defend themselves. And we should encourage and empower people to do so instead of trying to shame them or smear them or malign their character. I find that disturbing.\n\nTucker Carlson: Meanwhile, they're telling us that we're not allowed to take illegal firearms away from people. Stop and frisk is immoral, but we need to disarm churchgoers? I'm starting to think this isn't really about public safety. Call me cynical.\n\nDana Loesch: Right, right. No, I agree. And by the way, I said Harris earlier, and I have no idea where that came from, Tucker. I mean, Jack Wilson. But this whole situation with legacy media and many other individuals looking down their noses at good people who want to be able to protect themselves. I mean, for crying out loud, let's look at Maryland, for example. Maryland, back in just a couple of years ago, when they passed their National Firearms Act, I think this is 2013, 2014. It was all with the promise that, look, law enforcement is going to take care of you. The state is going to protect you. You don't need your firearms to protect yourselves. And then look what happened. Baltimore's homicide rate, their violent crime rate spiked by 300 percent. It's insane. People want to be able to defend themselves because they know that the state, even though the state promises them that they're going to do this, they never make good on it. In fact, some of the biggest errors that we have seen with previous mass casualty incidents had been because people in government have dropped the ball.\n\nTucker Carlson: Of course, of course. Trust us. You'll be fine. Yeah, okay, no thanks. Dana, great to see you tonight. Thanks so much.\n\nDana Loesch: Good to see you, Tucker. Thank you.\n\nTucker Carlson: So, it turns out disarming you is just one part of the plan to remake your life. Imagine a place where the streets are lined with syringes and human feces, where the police no longer have power and criminals operate with impunity. Where there are literally more drug addicts living on the streets than there are high school students enrolled. There's no need to imagine a place like that. Unfortunately, it already exists. It's called San Francisco. For a century, San Francisco was the crown jewel of the West Coast, the single prettiest place in America's richest state, our Cape Town. Well, today it's become a kind of hellhole that only left-wing leadership could create. And make no mistake, activists want to make certain that your town becomes San Francisco. So, on Monday, this coming at 8:00 p.m. Eastern, we're debuting an exclusive five-part investigation into what exactly has happened to San Francisco, into its collapse. We sent a crew out there for a week. The footage and interviews, they came on with our shocking. Here's a preview. Viewer discretion is advised.\n\n[music playing]\n\n[begin video clip]\n\nFemale Speaker: It's like a minefield because you never know what's coming around the corner.\n\n[end video clip]\n\nTucker Carlson: American Dystopia debuts Monday, 8:00 p.m. Eastern and continues all week. It's important, don't miss it. Well, up next, the Trump administration has allowed individual states to opt out of refugee resettlement, but it turns out virtually every Republican governor is asking for more refugee resettlement. Why is that? We've investigated. Plus, Boeing's outgoing CEO put his company into dire straits. In return, he could be getting 50 million dollars. What does that tell you about the way businesses are run in the modern American economy? We'll tell you just ahead.\n\n[music playing]\n\n[commercial break]\n\nTucker Carlson: Well, if you can remember that far back during President Barack Obama's second term, Republican leaders in the Congress made a big show of opposing the Obama administration's refugee policy. Obama wanted to settle tens of thousands of refugees who had fled Syria's civil war in the United States and at the time 25 Republican governors demanded the right to keep them out. Now, the left accused them of racism, of course, but there were good reasons to take the position they did. For example, properly vetting refugees is really hard. Often, it's impossible. Some of the refugees they pointed out might not even be Syrian. That was true for sure in Europe with the refugees. Some of them might be Islamic extremists. But terrorism was not the only worry they had. America's middle class is in decline. We already have more than 20 million illegal immigrants living here. The last thing many struggling communities need is more low-skilled migrants who may be great people but need a lot, stress the schools and the social programs, while not fully integrating. That's just true. And anyone who lives in a community where it's happened will tell you that it's true. As with illegal immigration the long-term agenda of refugee resettlement is to bring in future democratic voters obviously. So, before she became the most anti-American member of Congress, Ilhan Omar was a refugee. So, at the time the Republican governors got their wish and President Trump won the 2016 election. In 2019 he issued an executive order allowing cities and states to opt out of refugee resettlement. That's the last time we checked in on this story. Here's the amazing part. For some reason no Republican governors are taking advantage of that. Instead, you probably didn't read this in the New York Times but 18 Republican governors have explicitly requested that more refugees be sent to their states. Have their voters demanded this? No. So what's going on here? Ned Ryun is the founder of American Majority and author of Restoring our Republic. He joins us tonight. So, Ned, I don't think there's any evidence that Republican voters in the states have been begging their Republican governors to move more refugees in. So, why are these governors literally asking the federal government to do this?\n\nNed Ryun: This is unreal, Tucker. I mean, again, you pointed out that Trump gave him a strong backstop back in September and said you can opt out of this with his executive order and now you have these 18 Republican governors saying no, we want more. And they're saying well, we're following our hearts. This is, you know, Christian charity in action. I got to say this, Tucker, as a active devout evangelical Christian, refugee resettlement has nothing to do with Christianity and has everything to do with the immoral behavior of these governors and quite frankly a perverse incentive for these government-funded charities that are acting as refugee contractors grifting off the American taxpayer. Michelle Malkin has written about some of this but the U.S. State Department is paying these refugee contractors over $2,100 per refugee of which they get to keep 45 percent and then they're doing this campaign on these governors saying you have to put your Christian charity into action and in an act of cowardice most of these governors from red states are giving in to this. First of all, --\n\nTucker Carlson: Wait. May I ask a question?\n\nNed Ryun: I can't believe the perverse incentive.\n\nTucker Carlson: I don't understand how this works. Well, so people who hate Christianity are demanding that in the name of Christianity Christian governors admit refugees, but the governors aren't actually housing any of the refugees in their own homes or paying any of their own money so how is it Christian virtue to take in other people's money by force and give it away?\n\nNed Ryun: It's fraudulent.\n\nTucker Carlson: I don't remember that part of the gospel.\n\nNed Ryun: I don't either and Christianity to me is obviously living and preaching the gospel of Christ and living a moral life. I find this deeply immoral and I can assure you they're not preaching the gospel of Christ. It's fraudulent behavior, Tucker, using taxpayer dollars.\n\nTucker Carlson: Yes.\n\nNed Ryun: To actually fund this. But the amazing part to me is the immoral behavior of these governors. They have one moral imperative. Their moral imperative is to advance the interest of the citizens of their state to do otherwise is to be immoral.\n\nTucker Carlson: Exactly.\n\nNed Ryun: We have entrusted them with political power and our monies to promote our interests, not the interests of non-citizens. I have to tell you, Tucker, this is idiotic on so many different levels, but this is how red states become blue and how America ceases to be America. You can't continue this behavior. At some point there are consequences. These are red state republican governors doing this and Trump is doing all the right things and they're abandoning him on this.\n\nTucker Carlson: Yes. I really wish we had run their names on the screen. I'm sorry we didn't. I hope you come back. I think we should keep hitting this topic.\n\nNed Ryun: Absolutely.\n\nTucker Carlson: Because it's important. Ned Ryun, great to see you.\n\nNed Ryun: You bet, Tucker.\n\nTucker Carlson: Thank you. For more than 100 years the Boeing company has led international aviation. To this day it's measured by dollar amounts. Boeing remains America's single largest foreign exporter. But now like so many American institutions, Boeing is in trouble. Last year the company's latest generation of 737 airplanes was grounded worldwide following several horrifying crashes. There's still no sign the planes will be allowed back in the air anytime soon. Production is being suspended. In business terms, this is a disaster, both for the company and for the airlines. How did it happen? Well, at least part of the responsibility lies with CEO Dennis Muilenburg who has been in charge at Boeing since 2015. Fittingly, Muilenburg is now being fired, which on the face of it sounds like good news. Someone in corporate America is finally being held accountable for screwing up. But before you celebrate, wait for the fine print. According to recent SEC filings, Muilenburg is walking away with more than $26 million in cash and stock, $26 million. That's his punishment. And by the way, that figure could more than double to over $50 million depending upon the final terms of the settlement. Here's some context for how much money that is. A rank and file employee at Boeing might make $60,000 a year. That's a decent salary in many places. It would take a worker more than 400 years to earn as much as the supposedly disgraced Dennis Muilenburg is getting in his severance package. In other words, for his work presiding over deadly airplane crashes, Muilenburg is walking off with enough money to pay the median income for 420 American households. And if that sounds perverse to you, keep in mind it's no longer unusual. Since 1978 CEO salaries in America's largest corporations have risen by a factor of more than 10. Meanwhile, and this is the critical point, average workers have seen their wages stagnate -- in some cases decline. In 1965, CEOs in this country earned 20 times as much as regular employees. As recently as 1989, they out earned employees just 58 to one. Today, that ratio has risen to 278 to 1. No wonder people are sending money to Bernie Sanders. That's what happens when you abuse the system. You discredit capitalism, and big business has in many cases done exactly that. Now, keep in mind, this isn't happening everywhere on the globe. In Europe, for example, the disparities are much less stark. Airbus CEO Tom Enders made 10 million dollars in 2017. That's a lot, but it was half as much as Boeing's Dennis Muilenburg made, and Airbus planes didn't even crash. This is an ugly trend, but it's actually worse than that. It's dangerous for our country. Why? Well, because when normal people see their lives getting worse while failures like Dennis Muilenburg get rich beyond description, many, not surprisingly, conclude that our system is rotten and not worth keeping, and the polls show that's happening right now. Attitudes are changing fast. Thanks to stories like this one, Americans are warming shockingly to socialism. Six months from now, a socialist could be the Democratic nominee for president. In a few years, this could easily be a socialist country. What would that look like? Well, of course it would be a disaster. Socialism doesn't work. It never has worked, especially not in sprawling, diverse countries like this one. Under a socialist regime, hundreds of millions of Americans would see their lives get dramatically worse, while demagogic morons like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would become vastly more powerful. That's socialism. You think America is stratified and unequal now? Wait till we get a socialist system. It will be so much worse. That's coming, by the way and at high speed. Why? Because mindless Chamber of Commerce libertarianism has allowed greed and stupidity to flourish in corporate boardrooms and unless we rein that immediately, right now, we're going to lose the system that made this country great. As of tonight, America is sending thousands of additional troops to the Middle East, but the Iraqi government may soon say that they are not welcome there. So, what will happen next? We'll tell you as our coverage of the Iran crisis continues.\n\n[commercial break]\n\nTucker Carlson: Thousands of American troops are headed to the Middle East tonight after Iran's promise to retaliate for the death of General Soleimani. But thousands of U.S. forces already deployed in Iraq may soon be ordered out of the country. A lot going on tonight. Foreign affairs correspondent Benjamin Hall is in Jordan for us tonight. He joins us with more. Benjamin?\n\nBenjamin Hall: Yes. Good evening, Tucker. As you point out, the whole region has been on high alert all day, waiting for some kind of retaliation from Iran. But actually, what we heard reports of in the last couple of hours are possible strikes by the U.S. These are unconfirmed, we've heard conflicting reports. But there are suggestions that two cars were hit just north of Baghdad a few hours ago and that they contained more Iranian-backed Shia militias, including a key finance facilitated close to Qasem Soleimani. But of course, it is Qasem Soleimani that everybody is talking about. The head of the Al Quds Force, some people say the second most powerful man in Iran and the man responsible for so many hundreds of U.S. deaths. He was killed leaving Baghdad Airport early this morning, having flown in from Lebanon. A U.S. Reaper drone was waiting to take him out. And alongside him, the man who was in charge of the storming of the U.S. embassy. Five others also killed there. People are saying now that this strike may really severely strain U.S.-Iraqi relations. And in fact, the Iraqi prime minister spoke out earlier today and didn't mince his words. He said he condemned the targeting killing as a violation of the terms which underpin the U.S. troop presence in this country. And he went on to say that he has submitted a formal request for parliament to convene in order to adopt necessary measures to protect Iraq's dignity and sovereignty. He didn't say what those measures would be. But while some people are suggesting they might ask U.S. troops to leave the country, the U.S. is, in fact, sending more troops over. 4,000 to come into the region. They're coming from the Eighty Second Airborne. They're heading to Kuwait. 750 have already come into Baghdad to protect the embassy there. So, somewhat conflicting ideas at the moment. President Trump saying that he does not want war, that they killed Qasem Soleimani to avoid bloodshed because he was planning more attacks on Americans. But at the moment, suddenly heightened, heightened tensions here. Tucker?\n\nTucker Carlson: Sounds that way. Benjamin Hall. We're out of time tonight. We'll be back Monday. Have the best weekend.\n\nContent and Programming Copyright 2020 Fox News Network, LLC. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.

Australia has changed one word in its national anthem to reflect what the prime minister called the spirit of unity and the country's Indigenous population.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison on New Year's Eve announced that the second line of the anthem, Advance Australia Fair, has been changed from For we are young and free to For we are one and free.\n\nThe change took effect Friday.\n\nBOSTON RED SOX LEGEND MANNY RAMIREZ IS BACK IN BASEBALL DOWN UNDER\n\nIt is time to ensure this great unity is reflected more fully in our national anthem, he said, adding that Australia was the most successful multicultural nation on Earth.\n\nWhile Australia as a modern nation may be relatively young, our country's story is ancient, as are the stories of the many First Nations peoples whose stewardship we rightly acknowledge and respect, Morrison said.\n\nIn the spirit of unity, it is only right that we ensure our national anthem reflects this truth and shared appreciation.\n\nMinister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt said in a statement that he had been asked about the change and had given it his support.\n\nWyatt, the first Indigenous Australian elected to the federal Parliament's lower house, said the one-word change was small in nature but significant in purpose.\n\nIt is an acknowledgment that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures date back 65,000 years, he said.\n\nAUSTRALIAN WOMAN WADES THROUGH FLOODWATERS TO RESCUE BEER KEGS DURING EXTREME WEATHER, VIDEO SHOWS\n\nThe change comes less than two months after New South Wales state Premier Gladys Berejiklian expressed support for Indigenous Australians who said the national anthem did not reflect them and their history.\n\nUniversity of New South Wales law professor Megan Davis, a Cobble Cobble woman from the Barrungam nation in southwest Queensland state, criticized the lack of consultation with Indigenous people about the change.\n\nThis is a disappointing way to end 2020 and start 2021.

This is a rush transcript from Fox News Sunday, January 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nCHRIS WALLACE, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: I'm Chris Wallace.\n\n\n\nPresident Trump says Iran appears to be standing down in the wake of his\n\ndecision to take out its top general. And he is offering Tehran both\n\ncarrots and sticks.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: The United States is ready\n\nto embrace peace with all who seek it.\n\n\n\nMIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We believe the sanctions that we impose\n\ntoday further that strategic objective.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But does the president have a strategy that will work?\n\n\n\nTRUMP: As long as I am president of the United States, Iran will never be\n\nallowed to have a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: We'll discuss the state of relations with Iran and the prospects\n\nfor peace with Robert O'Brien, the White House national security advisor,\n\nin his first appearance on FOX News Sunday. Then --\n\n\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Only Congress has the power to declare war and a\n\ncritical question that many raised is whether or not consultation with\n\nCongress is a necessary and constructive thing.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: We'll ask Democratic Senator Chris Coons about that effort in\n\nCongress to limit the president's military actions against Iran. Plus, House Speaker Pelosi announces she'll send the articles of\n\nimpeachment to the Senate this week. We'll ask our Sunday panel what the\n\nimpeachment trial will look like.\n\n\n\nAll, right now, on FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: And hello again from FOX News in Washington. The fallout from President Trump's showdown with Iran continues to be felt\n\nacross the Middle East. Thousands of Iranians protest as Tehran now admits\n\nshooting down that Ukraine airliner. The president tells FOX News the top\n\nIranian general he killed was planning attacks against four U.S. embassies. And Senate Democrats pushed for a vote to limit the president's military\n\npowers while also preparing to deal with the articles of impeachment. The\n\nHouse will send over this week. In a moment, we will discuss the U.S. face-off with national security\n\nadvisor Robert O'Brien. But first, let's bring in Kevin Corke with the\n\nlatest from the White House -- Kevin.\n\n\n\nKEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Chris, calls for change echoing\n\nacross Tehran once again this weekend, those demands however garnered the\n\nattention of a rather prominent observer half a world away.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCORKE: Protests swept over the Iranian capital over the weekend in\n\nresponse to the downing of the Ukrainian airliner that killed everyone on\n\nboard including many Iranian university students who had been studying\n\nabroad. Some of the protesters even calling for the supreme leader to\n\nresign. After days of denial, Tehran acknowledged it launch the missile strike\n\ncalling it a mistake but later claim without evidence that the aircraft\n\nturned towards a sensitive military site. The angry demonstrations were in\n\nsharp contrast to the days of morning following the death of Iranian\n\nGeneral Qassem Soleimani who the president accused of plotting attacks on\n\nseveral U.S. embassies, justifying his removal from the battle field. The president took his concerns directly to the Iranian people tweeting in\n\nFarsi and in English that the government of Iran must allow human rights\n\ngroups to monitor and report facts from the ground, adding that there\n\ncannot be another massacre of peaceful protesters nor an Internet shut\n\ndown. The world is watching. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the Senate is watching and waiting for\n\nSpeaker Pelosi to transmit articles of impeachment. If she does so on\n\nTuesday and Wednesday as many expect, a Senate trial could begin soon. But, first, the California Democrat is expected to select four to ten\n\nmembers of the House to manage the trial period ends\n\n\n\n(END VIDEOTAPE)\n\n\n\nCORKE: Sources tell FOX News, the speaker will likely make her selection\n\nfrom a diverse group of members, among them the Intel Committee Chair Adam\n\nSchiff of California. He, of course, Chris, ran the Trump Ukraine\n\ninvestigation.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Kevin Corke, reporting from the White House -- Kevin, thank you. And joining us now, White House national security adviser, Robert O'Brien. Welcome to FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\nROBERT O'BRIEN, NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER: Good to be with you, Chris.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: After first denying it, Iran now admits that it accidentally shot\n\ndown that Ukraine airliner with 176 people on board. But Iran's foreign\n\nminister says, and we're putting it up: Human error at time of crisis\n\ncaused by U.S. adventurism led to disaster. A couple of questions. What does President Trump think of Iran's effort to\n\nshift the blame for the shoot down of a civilian airliner? And is there\n\nanything the president can do beyond tweets to support the thousands of\n\nprotesters in the streets?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Oh, it's a great question. First of all, our condolences go out\n\nto the families and friends of the folks who were lost on that Ukrainian\n\nAir Flight 752, a tragedy. But the Iranian response is typical. First, they cover it up. And then when\n\nsocial media came out with photos of the missiles, they couldn't cover it\n\nup. Then they said the plane veered towards sensitive military -- sensitive\n\nmilitary area. That turned out not to be true. And now, Zarif, who's one of the great dissemblers in international\n\ndiplomacy, is attempting to shift the blame to the United States. And so,\n\nwe -- we'll reject that. The Ukrainians have to have an international investigation has to be\n\napparent. They have to apologize. They have to pay compensation to the\n\nfamilies, and they need to make sure this never happens again.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: And what can we do to help the protesters this week? Some of whom\n\nare calling for the supreme leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, to step down.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: What's interesting is they're chanting death to the dictator.\n\nAnd when President Trump tweeted yesterday in Farsi, it had 200 times\n\nsupport of the protesters, it had 200,000 likes. I'm told that's the world\n\nrecord for the number of likes in social media for a Farsi language tweet. So, unlike past administrations where there hasn't been support\n\ndemonstrated to the Iranian people, President Trump has made it clear\n\nthroughout his administration that he stands with the people in Iran, not\n\nwith the regime, and we're going to continue to do so.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: There's been quite a debate this week about the president's\n\njustification for taking out Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. He has said,\n\ntop administration officials have said, you have said, that there was an\n\nimminent threat. The president was a little bit more specific about that threat when he sat\n\ndown with Laura Ingraham on Friday. Take a look.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I can reveal that I believe\n\nit would have been four embassies, and I think that probably Baghdad\n\nalready started.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But members of Congress who attended a 75-minute briefing with\n\nthe secretaries of State, Defense, the CIA director, say there was not a\n\nsingle mention during those 75 minutes -- classified briefing, members of\n\nCongress about imminent threats to U.S. Embassies. So why is he saying it on television but that top officials didn't tell\n\nmembers of Congress?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Well, I think something we've been clear on -- I've seen the\n\nintelligence on this, Chris, and it was very strong and -- looking and in\n\nsome ways I would love to release the intelligence and show the American\n\npeople. And I can tell you, they can trust the administration on this.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't want to lose that valuable stream of intelligence\n\nthat will allow us to protect Americans going forward. Going to the briefing Congress -- what we've always said -- well I've said\n\nfrom day one is that there were severe threats to American diplomats, to\n\nAmerican soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and to American facilities in\n\nthe region, Iraq, likely Syria, and potentially other countries that I\n\nwon't name now. So, you know, I think that -- I think what the president\n\nsaid is consistent with what we've been saying since day one --\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But could you explain because there does seem to be a\n\ncontradiction? He's telling Laura Ingraham, our esteemed colleague, but in\n\na 75-minute classified briefing your top national security people never\n\nmentioned this to members of Congress. Why not?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: So I wasn't at the briefing, and I don't know how the Q&A went\n\nback and forth. I mean sometimes it depends on the questions that were\n\nasked or how they were (INAUDIBLE). I don't know. I wasn't there. All I can tell you is we've been clear from\n\nthe start that there were very significant threats to American facilities\n\nin the region and to American military officials -- officers and men and\n\nwomen and also the U.S. diplomats. And I think that's consistent with what\n\nthe president's saying now.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: And would you agree with what the president said that there were\n\nspecific imminent threats to four U.S. embassies?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: I -- look, it's always difficult, even with the exquisite\n\nintelligence that we have to know exactly what the targets are, but it is\n\ncertainly consistent with the intelligence to assume that they would have\n\nhit embassies in at least four countries.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: But again, if we -- we knew there were threats to American\n\nfacilities. Now whether they were bases, embassies -- you know, it's always\n\nhard until the attack happens, but we had very strong intelligence that\n\nthey were looking to kill and maim Americans at U.S. facilities in the\n\nregions. And -- and so I think the president's absolutely right, you know,\n\nwhen he talks about the threats to America that they came from Soleimani,\n\nthey came from the Quds Force and they came from their proxies.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: I want to step back a little bit and talk about the whole\n\nquestion of the administration's strategy for dealing with Iran. The U.S.\n\nimposed still more sanctions on Iran on Friday and the Secretary of State,\n\nSecretary of Treasury said, you have two goals; you want Iran to behave\n\nlike other nations in the world and you want them to stop their nuclear\n\nprogram. But let's look at the record so far, the administration has now imposed\n\nsanctions on more than 1,000 Iranian companies, organizations, and\n\nindividuals. Back in September the Treasury Secretary said basically we\n\nhave cut off all funding to Iran. And instead of caving, Iran is moving\n\nstep-by-step out of the nuclear deal and in recent months they had six\n\nships attack Saudi oil facilities and set fire to the U.S. embassy in\n\nBaghdad. You said this weekend in an interview with Axios that you think Iran is\n\nnow more likely to negotiate but the maximum pressure campaign -- at least\n\nif you look at the last six months, has made Iran less aggressive -- more\n\naggressive rather, not less aggressive.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Look, I think the maximum pressure campaign is working. It's the\n\ndemonstrable that it's working. The Iranian economy is contracted by at\n\nleast 10 percent. I mean, we haven't seen that with a modern economy in\n\nmany, many years. Iran went from producing 3 to 4 million barrels of oil a\n\nday down to 150,000 to 400,000 barrels depending on the day. Iran is being choked off and Iran's going to have no other choice but to\n\ncome to the table. We had to get out of the JCPOA, it was a terrible deal.\n\nIt had a sunset clause and I don't think a lot of people realize that on\n\nthe JCPOA this year, in 2020, Iran would have been permitted to buy\n\nadvanced ballistic missiles, main battle tanks, fast attack jets, a whole\n\nrange of weapons would have been on the shelf of the Iranian --\n\n\n\nWALLACE: I agree with all of that. And you certainly whipped (ph) them,\n\nbut they haven't been less aggressive. They haven't indicated that they're\n\ngoing to come to the table. In fact, they've been more aggressive and\n\nthey're pulling out of the nuclear deal. So, why do you say as you've said this weekend, you think that they're more\n\nlikely to negotiate?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Because Iran is being choked off, and Iran is going to have no\n\nother opportunity. There's no other way for them to get the money they need\n\nto fund the guard, to fund their regime, to fund their malign activities.\n\nAnd you're seeing protests now breaking out across Iran, and we've seen it\n\nnow for several months, people are fed up with this regime. If Iran wants to maintain a modern country, a modern economy, they're going\n\nto have to come to the table and negotiate. I think that's highly likely.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But I remember in September, you were the national security\n\nadviser then, President Trump was at the U.N. I interviewed the Iranian\n\nPresident Rouhani. The president and the French President Macron were\n\ntrying to get him even to get in the phone and talk, and he refused to do\n\nso. I will tell you, he said at that time to me, there was no chance we're\n\ngoing to negotiate unless and until the U.S. lift sanctions.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: What's going to cause them to negotiate is the pressure on their\n\neconomy and when you got students out chanting death to the dictator and\n\nwhen you have thousands of Iranians out protesting the street, that's the\n\nsort of pressure that's going to bring them to the table. And, listen, the president has made it very clear to Iran, we're not\n\ntalking about regime change. We want to see an Iran that forswears nuclear\n\nweapons, that stops taking Americans hostage, that stops supporting proxies\n\nand terrorism in the region, and stops building these ballistic missiles\n\nwhich we saw them launch last week. We can get there. And I think, by the way, Chris, you're going to see more support from our\n\nallies in the coming days and week in Europe as they realize how dangerous\n\nthis Iranian situation is.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: All right. Let's change a little bit. Iraq's prime minister has\n\nsent a message to the United States. I want to put it up on the screen. He's asked the U.S. to send representatives to Iraq to put in place a\n\nmechanism for implementing the parliament's decision, implementing\n\nparliament's decision for the safe withdrawal of forces from Iraq. But Secretary of State Pompeo says that we will continue our mission there. Question, on what ground is the U.S. saying we're going to ignore the\n\nrequest by a sovereign nation to leave?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Well, with respect to the resolution you're talking about, that\n\nwas a nonbinding resolution. So, it seems like they've learned something\n\nfrom our democracy, with nonbinding resolutions.\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Yes, but this is a specific statement by the prime minister.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: This is a nonbinding resolution passed by a Shia only group of\n\nlegislators. The Sunnis boycotted it, the Kurds boycotted it, and --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But the Shia represents a majority. They can control the\n\nparliament.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: It -- yes, we'll see what happens when they have a full vote. But in any event, our goal is to get out of Iraq as well. The president\n\nsaid, we want to be out of the Middle East, and -- and -- but what we need\n\nto do is leave on our terms and we need to leave in a fashion in which\n\nISIS, Daesh, is -- has been fully eliminated. We took care of the physical caliphate, and we're working very hard now to\n\nmop up the rest of ISIS. We saw that with the raid that took out al\n\nBaghdadi. We made tremendous progress there. Well, we will certainly work with the Iraqis. We look forward to doing so.\n\nWe talk with them every day. We talk with our counterparts there. And I think we're going to have -- you know, we're working on a resolution.\n\nWe had a team from NATO here this week. I think you're going to see far\n\nmore NATO involvement in Iraq. So, this will be --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But the belief (ph) that we'll leave on our terms, they're a\n\nsovereign country. If they tell us to leave, you're saying we're still\n\ngoing to leave on our terms?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Look, we'll work with the Iraqis and we look forward to leaving\n\nan Iraq that's safe and that's secure and that's independent. And that's\n\nwhat the Iraqis want as well. And we're going to continue to work with all\n\nour partners in Iraq.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: I'm running out of time. I've got a couple of quick questions. There's a report today that the U.S. is expelling a dozen Saudi servicemen\n\nwho've been training at U.S. military bases, this after that terrible\n\nshooting at Pensacola, do we have indications that more of these Saudi\n\nservicemen had ties to extremism?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Yes, I don't want to say that. I think Secretary Esper has done a\n\ngreat job over at the Pentagon in reviewing the way we vet foreign troops\n\nthat come over and train with Americans. We have a longstanding\n\nrelationship with the Saudis to train their pilots. We work with them both\n\nin Saudi Arabia --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Well, I think we're being very careful. Obviously Pensacola\n\nshowed that there had been errors in the way that we vetted, and I think\n\nout of an abundance of caution Secretary Esper's taking these actions to\n\nprotect our service men and women.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Finally, let's talk about Congress. President Trump says he\n\ndidn't notify the Congressional leaders -- the Gang of Eight, the majority\n\nand minority leaders, the heads of the Intelligence Committees beforehand\n\nabout the attack on Soleimani basically because he didn't trust them. Here he is this week.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: So they want us to call\n\nthem. Now Schiff is a big leaker. You know he leaks to crazy CNN, off the\n\nrecord, they've got the number one terrorist in the world Soleimani, and\n\nthey're going to get him. They're going to take him out in the next 10\n\nminutes.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Ambassador O'Brien, can you point to a single instance when\n\nPresident Trump, your administration, has given sensitive national security\n\ninformation to top congressional leaders about an ongoing military\n\noperation, and they have leaked that to the media?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: I think what President Trump is doing there is something very\n\nconsistent with what President Obama and other leaders did. President Obama\n\ndid not brief the congressional leadership before the sensitive raid on\n\nOsama bin Laden. He did not brief the congressional leadership prior to\n\ntaking out Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen. This is --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: -- he never said it's because I don't trust them to leak.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: This is standard procedure and as soon as Soleimani was taken off\n\nthe battlefield, the Gang of Eight was notified, the intelligence\n\ncommittees and key leaders in Congress were notified. I participated in a\n\nnumber of those calls. And then we had a very long briefing, as you\n\nreferenced at the top of your show, 75 minutes with all the members of\n\nCongress, both House and Senate. So we think we've met our obligations in notifying Congress. And we think\n\nwe're also very consistent with what the Obama administration, the Bush\n\nadministration, the Clinton administration --\n\n\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Specifically, is there reason to believe that if that information\n\nhad been given to Adam Schiff, he would have leaked it?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Look, I think there's always a concern when you have an operation\n\nthat is this sensitive and the lives of our servicemen and women are in\n\ndanger as we go after a leading terrorist, you have to be extraordinarily\n\ncareful with that information no matter who it is.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Finally, as you know, the House has voted to limit the\n\npresident's war powers, the House -- the Senate is working on that. Under\n\nwhat circumstances would the administration feel it had to go to Congress\n\nto get approval for action against Iran?\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: Well, I think that's set out in a number of cases. So, under\n\nArticle Two of the Constitution the president is allowed to exercise\n\nmilitary power to defend the American people and defend our soldiers,\n\nsailors, airmen, and marines. And if it's in the national interest, and the\n\naction doesn't rise to the level of war -- so that's a long and substantial\n\ninvolvement, the president has that Article Two power to take action to\n\nprotect America. And that's what we did here, and that's what we'll continue to do in the\n\nfuture. If that changes and there's a situation where there -- what we\n\nexpect, a conflict that will have a scope and duration that's similar to\n\nwar, certainly, we'd go to Congress, and again I think we're in -- on firm\n\nlegal footing here, very similar to President Obama, President Bush,\n\nPresident Clinton.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Ambassador O'Brien, thank you. Your first time on FOX News\n\nSunday, I hope we didn't scare you off and that you'll come back.\n\n\n\nO'BRIEN: I look forward to it. Thank you, Chris.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Thank you, sir. Up next, Democrats move to rein in President Trump's ability to use\n\nmilitary force against Iran unless he gets approval from Congress. We'll\n\ndiscuss that, plus what to expect from the impeachment trial in the Senate\n\nwith Democrat Chris Coons. That's next.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Democrats in the Senate are looking to drum up bipartisan support\n\nto limit the president's ability to use military force again Iran without\n\ncongressional approval. Joining us now here in Washington, Delaware Senator Chris Coons, a top\n\nDemocrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. And, Senator, welcome back to FOX News Sunday.\n\n\n\nSEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Thanks, Chris. Great to be with you again.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Ever since President Trump took out General Soleimani about a\n\nweek ago, Democrats have been calling it a major escalation and have been\n\nwarning of dire consequences. But after a pretty ineffectual missile strike, Iran's foreign minister,\n\nJavad Zarif, said this, Iran took and concluded proportionate measures in\n\nself-defense. And here's what President Trump said.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Iran appears to be standing\n\ndown, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing\n\nfor the world.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Senator, isn't it possible that President Trump's action,\n\ndecision worked, that it took out one of our worst enemies in the Middle\n\nEast and re-established American deterrence?\n\n\n\nCOONS: Well, it certainly took out one of our worst enemies in the Middle\n\nEast. Let's start there. None of us are going to mourn the passing of\n\nGeneral Qassem Soleimani. The Quds force, which he commanded, was\n\nresponsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans in Iraq and throughout\n\nthe region thousands of civilians. So nobody should be mourning his\n\npassing. But the larger question is, does it make us safer? Did it make our position\n\nin the region more stable? And is there a clear strategy for moving\n\nforward? President Trump ran, in no small part, on ending the forever wars in the\n\nMiddle East, but we've got 15,000 more troops in the Middle East today. And\n\nthe very real prospect, as you were just discussing with the national\n\nsecurity advisor, of our being expelled from Iraq. Soleimani, that's been one of his core goals for 15 years. He may\n\naccomplish our expulsion from Iraq and the creation of a big vacuum there\n\nin his death in a way he couldn't in his life.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: But wouldn't you at least concede that President Trump -- and I\n\nknow there was a lot of concern, oh, my gosh, this is going to get us into\n\na war -- that so far the Iranians have, as the president said, stood down,\n\nsaid we don't want to escalate this situation and maybe it made things\n\nbetter, not worse, maybe?\n\n\n\nCOONS: This is an opening for the president and his whole team to show\n\nthat there is a path towards negotiation and towards reengagement with Iran\n\nabout what a stronger, better, longer Iran nuclear deal might look like.\n\nAnd I hope they'll take it. My concern is that Iran has lots of ways that they can take action against\n\nus, both overt and covert, and I don't think they're done trying to seek\n\nrevenge. The real question in front of us, I think, Chris, is whether or not\n\nPresident Trump and his senior administration officials believe that before\n\ntaking actions that predictably, over months, over a long period of time\n\ncould lead to war with Iran, they have to come to Congress to seek\n\nauthorization.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: All right. We're going to get to that in a moment. I want to talk about one of the other issues out there, the debate over how\n\nimminent the threat was that Soleimani represented and why they had to take\n\nhim out. Here's what Secretary of State Pompeo said on Friday.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nPOMPEO: This was going to happen and American lives were at risk and we\n\nwould have been culpably negligent, as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of\n\nStaff said, we would have been culpably negligent had we not recommended to\n\nthe president that he take this action against Qassem Soleimani. He made\n\nthe right call and America is safer as a result of that.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Is the secretary of state lying?\n\n\n\nCOONS: Well, I won't say that. Frankly, in the classified briefing that\n\nlasted 75 minutes and had virtually the entire Senate there, we got less\n\ndetailed information than President Trump shared with Laura Ingraham. So we were told repeatedly that there was reliable intelligence of an\n\nimminent threat. That's it. There was no more detail than that. There was\n\nno more specifics than what the president's been comfortable sharing on\n\ncable news. So the larger point about the consultation with Congress, working with\n\nCongress on a bipartisan basis to come up with a strategy that will work in\n\nthe Middle East and that gives us some chance of deterring Iran, that's the\n\nbig and the larger question. I'll remind you, President Trump taken some very impulsive, even erratic\n\nmoves in the Middle East recently. His decision to abandon our Kurdish\n\nallies in Syria led to hundreds of ISIS fighters being released, led to a\n\nnumber of our close European partners in the counter-ISIS campaign to be\n\nfrustrated with us. So some skepticism on the part of Congress about whether or not there\n\nreally is a thorough and a deliberate strategy here I think is justified by\n\nrecent action.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: OK, let me pick up on that because you heard me question\n\nAmbassador O'Brien, the national security adviser, about the larger\n\nstrategy. There is no question that as part of the Iran nuclear deal, the deal that\n\nJohn Kerry and Barack Obama negotiated, Iran got back billions of dollars\n\nin frozen assets and that it used those assets to spread terror -- give it\n\nto Hezbollah, Hamas, other bad actors -- around the Middle East. Would you be willing to concede that as part of the president's maximum\n\npressure campaign that at least they turned off the terror money spigot?\n\n\n\nCOONS: There's been a real impact on the Iranian economy and on the\n\nresources available to the terrible Iranian regime as a result of the\n\nmaximum pressure campaign.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: So that's a success?\n\n\n\nCOONS: That's a positive. But here's the negative that's happening at the\n\nsame time -- a real weakening of our alliances and our partnerships. What\n\nmade the Iran deal possible was getting most of the world aligned with the\n\nUnited States in putting sanctions pressure on Iran. That's what got them\n\nto the table. Now, we're in a place where, although President Trump, and I appreciate his\n\nsaying this, is saying, here's a moment for diplomacy. We need NATO more\n\nengaged in the Middle East. We need our partners in Europe. Lots of other\n\nactions and steps he's taken in the last three years have weakened and\n\nstrained those alliances and those partnerships.\n\nThis recent incident of killing Qassem Soleimani has further strained some\n\nof our partnerships with Germany, with France, with the U.K. in the region\n\nand we need them if we're going to build a stronger next Iran deal.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: In this week's classified briefing, the 75 minutes we've been\n\ntalking about, you confronted Secretary of State Pompeo at the end, I\n\ngather, three times.\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\n\nCOONS: Well, I was simply trying to -- to get us to a point of what I\n\nthought would be common agreement, that if there's an instance of imminent\n\nthreat, Article Two, commander-in-chief, the president has the power to act\n\nto protect our troops and our interests overseas. But, if there's an instance, as we now seem to be embarking on, where the\n\npresident's drawn a clear red line, no nuclear weapons for Iran, and\n\nthere's the real risk of months and months of preparation for a military\n\nstrike to prevent that, of course, in that fact pattern you have to come\n\nseek authorization.\n\nThere wasn't a clear commitment to doing that. And I think there has to be.\n\nA democracy, when we go to war, is stronger when the Constitution is\n\nfollowed and the people's representatives authorize that conflict. I think\n\nthat strengthens our resolve as a nation and I think that strengthens our\n\nhand in the world. To ignore Congress, to not even consult with us, let\n\nalone seek authorization, I think weakens us on the world stage.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Finally, Speaker Pelosi will finally send the articles of\n\nimpeachment over to the Senate this week. The Senate's going to begin its\n\ntrial. How confident are you, if not at the beginning, at some point, that you can\n\nget four Republicans to come over and agree with the Democrat to call key\n\nwitnesses?\n\n\n\nCOONS: Well, that's what this is all going to come down to is Majority\n\nLeader McConnell is going to give us as much of a fair trial as four\n\nRepublican senators demand. There's a key difference between trials and\n\ncover-ups. Trials have witnesses. Cover-ups don't. President Trump might have had his reasons for being skeptical of the House\n\nprocess. In a Republican-controlled Senate, I can't think of any reason he\n\nwouldn't want folks like Secretary of State Pompeo or National Security\n\nAdviser John Bolton, who were in the room, who were on the e-mail chains,\n\nwho know what happened to come to the Senate, testify and clear his name.\n\nIf he is exonerated in the Senate by a purely partisan vote, I don't think\n\nhe will have been exonerated at all.\n\nAnd this is only the third time, in our nation's history, that we're going\n\nto have an impeachment trial.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Do you have any commitment from senators, Republican senators,\n\nthat they will vote to call witnesses?\n\n\n\nCOONS: No. At this point there's just conversations, trying to find some\n\nreasonable, bipartisan path forward to insist on a fair trial. I respect that there are Republicans who deeply want President Trump to\n\nhave a fair trial. I think that's what all of us should want. But to have a\n\ntrial where the critical witnesses were blocked by the president from\n\nappearing in front of the House, to have a trial where there's no sworn\n\ntestimony available, is unprecedented. President Clinton, even President Nixon, directed his closest advisers and\n\ncabinet officials to cooperate. And in the Clinton impeachment trial, there\n\nwas sworn testimony that they were debating about how it would be\n\npresented.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: I've got about a minute left.\n\n\n\nCOONS: Yes.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: President Trump says if John Bolton is subpoenaed, and if John\n\nBolton agrees to testify, he won't allow him to discuss their conversations\n\nabout Ukraine. Take a look.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would love everybody to\n\ntestify, but there are things that you can't do from the standpoint of\n\nexecutive privilege. You have to maintain that.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Would any president allow his national security adviser to discuss\n\nthe conversations they had over national security in the Oval Office?\n\n\n\nCOONS: If that national security adviser could clear his name by doing so,\n\nI think most presidents would. The executive privilege doesn't exist to\n\nallow you to cover up a crime. That's what the president's being accused of\n\nhere. I think he should want a former national security adviser to testify\n\ntruthfully in front of the Senate.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: And if he says -- if Bolton -- there are a lot of ifs here.\n\n\n\nCOONS: There's a lot of ifs.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: If Bolton is allowed to testify and the president invokes\n\nexecutive privilege, your response would be what?\n\n\n\nCOONS: You can't invoke executive privilege to cover up a crime. Bolton\n\nshould testify.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Senator Coons, thank you. Thanks for coming in.\n\n\n\nCOONS: Thank you.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: We'll be watching what happens this week both on Iran and the\n\nimpeachment trial.\n\nUp next, we'll bring in our Sunday group to discuss whether the showdown\n\nwith Iran is over or just taking a short pause.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We caught a total monster and\n\nwe took him out. And that should have happened a long time ago. We did it\n\nbecause they were looking to blow up our embassy.\n\n\n\nREP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA): We must avoid war. And the cavalier attitude of\n\nthis administration -- oh I inform you by reading my tweets, no, that's not\n\nthe relationship that our founders had in mind.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Well, President Trump defending his decision to kill Qasem\n\nSoleimani, while House Speaker Pelosi criticizes his handling of the\n\noperation. And it's time now for our Sunday group. Jonah Goldberg, editor in chief of The Dispatch, Fox News political\n\nanalyst Juan Williams, former DNC chair Donna Brazile, and Fox News\n\ncorrespondent Gillian Turner.\n\nJonah, there, I think it's fair to say, has been a lot of hand-wringing\n\nfrom -- about President Trump from Democrats, that he's in the process of\n\ngetting us into a war in the Middle East. But after Iran's, I think it's\n\nfair to say, half-hearted missile salvo and then Iranian officials saying\n\nthat they have concluded their response, is it fair to say at least so far,\n\nso good?\n\n\n\nJONAH GOLDBERG, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely. Look, as you know, I'm a\n\n-- sort of a Trump skeptic, but this seems like an unalloyed -- with the\n\nexception of the shooting down of the Ukrainian plane, this seems like an\n\nunalloyed win for the United States of America. The intended point of this\n\nwasn't to start World War III, as a lot of people screamed. It was, in\n\nfact, to end an escalating cycle where Iran was more and more using its own\n\nforces rather than proxy forces to try to chase us out of the region.\n\nAnd if the trade-off is killing -- is -- is -- is taking Soleimani off the\n\nboard in exchange for some empty barracks, that is an unalloyed win for the\n\nUnited States.\n\nWhat makes it so perplexing is, this guy needed (ph) killing a thousand\n\nways from Sunday. Why the president feels the need to talk about this --\n\nthese embassy attacks as -- when no one else can confirm it, just -- it\n\ngets in the way of what I think is a perfectly solid case on the merits.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Donna, and I think it's fair to say that there are -- the\n\nDemocrats had been a lot of doom saying. Oh, this is going to get us into a\n\nwar. This was a risky escalation. Don't Democrats run a risk here when they\n\nraise concerns about the killing of one of the worst people on earth when\n\nthey immediately rush to the floor of the House and now to the Senate and\n\ndemand war power's limitations, don't they risk running -- looking like\n\nthey're weak on national security?\n\n\n\nDONNA BRAZILE, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Absolutely not. And -- and here's why. First of all, we have heard four, maybe five different conflicting reasons\n\nof the imminent threat that the general appeared to have made towards the\n\nUnited States. No one mourned his death. Not a -- not a Democrat or a\n\nRepublican. He was a wretched human being.\n\nThe problem that Democrats have -- and I think the problem that most\n\nAmericans -- is that, what is the strategy? We knew maximum pressure was to\n\ntry to get Iran back to the table. That didn't work. And now we have a\n\nsituation where the Iraq he prime minister is calling upon the United\n\nStates to begin to figure out the mechanisms to withdraw.\n\nSo, no, I think the Democrats are absolutely right to put a resolution on\n\nthe floor. We know that, you know, since the AUMF was -- was --\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Authorization for the Use of Military Force.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Authorization -- I mean that is as old as my you know what. We\n\nneed a new rationale for starting wars, ending wars or being in the Middle\n\nEast.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: No, wait, wait. I mean George Bush started new wars without\n\ngetting a new AUMF. Barack Obama took out Gaddafi in Libya. He didn't get\n\nan authorization for the use of military force. I mean talk about being as\n\nold as --\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: But -- but -- but Congress had already -- but Congress had already\n\napproved of those measures. Congress did not have --\n\n\n\nWALLACE: They -- they hadn't approve taking out Qaddafi in Libya.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Congress -- they -- they -- Congress had already -- well -- well,\n\nwe can get into Libya. Congress had already authorized that. We need of new resolution, Chris. And -- and what this -- and if Iraq\n\ndecides to expel U.S. forces, at a time ISIS is still, you know, active,\n\nthis would all have been for not. I -- I just think it was still a huge\n\nmistake.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Gillian, there's the bigger question, which -- which Donna raised,\n\nwhich is, does this administration have a strategy for dealing with Iran?\n\nAnd you heard my conversation with the national security advisor, maximum\n\npressure, more sanctions, bring them to the table. But although Treasury\n\nSecretary Mnuchin announced still another round of sanctions on Friday,\n\nthey we about sanctioned out and Iran is not getting less aggressive,\n\nthey're not being more pliable, they're being more aggressive. I mean\n\nthey're -- you know, they -- they've gone after tankers in the Persian\n\nGulf. They went -- went after the Saudi oil facility. They're pulling out\n\nof a nuclear deal. Is -- is there a strategy that's going to work?\n\n\n\nGILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Well, first of all, there was what\n\nprecipitated the last ten days of this crisis. We -- everybody -- I think\n\nit bears a reminder was and Iran-sponsored attack on the U.S. embassy in\n\nBaghdad. It wasn't the killing of Soleimani. That didn't set this chain of\n\nevents -- this particular chain of events in motion. It was the attack on\n\nBaghdad, which, according to many defense analysts, in of itself\n\nconstitutes an act of war. So I think it's -- that bears a reminder for\n\npeople here.\n\nThe strategy for the Trump administration so far with these sanctions has\n\nbeen very successful, widespread consensus that they are working -- a lot\n\nof analyst describing them as crippling on the Iranian economy. But as you\n\nmentioned, Chris, the problem now is we are very rapidly reaching the end\n\nof their utility, as was evidenced on Friday when the Trump administration\n\nannounces this new round of sanctions, which really were not new sanctions,\n\nbut a sort of re-doubling down on industries they've already sanctioned in\n\nthe past.\n\nI will say about the nuclear deal, looking forward, another alarming thing\n\nfor those who want to say mission accomplished and now everything is OK\n\nbetween the U.S. and Iran is our nuclear scientists, America's best nuclear\n\nscientists are now predicting Iran's seven to 11 months away from\n\ndeveloping its own nuclear weapons capability.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: So they're closer to breakout.\n\n\n\nTURNER: They're -- they are closer today and they could be even closer if\n\nthey instead are able to buy components from other countries, from other\n\nnon-state actors, which is still a possibility.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Juan, it was interesting to me this week to see -- and this isn't\n\na new thing but it just continues -- the degree to which President Trump\n\nwants to be the anti-Obama. His reaction, and I think Gillian's right, the\n\nprecipitating cause for taking out Soleimani was the attack of the embassy.\n\nHe said we're -- there's not going to be a Benghazi on my watch. And he\n\ncontinues to attack President Trump's Iran nuclear deal saying that it --\n\nit --\n\n\n\nJUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS POLITICAL ANALYST: President Obama did.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: President Obama, sorry, nuclear deal because of the fact that it\n\nopened the spigot and released billions of dollars to Iran for them to\n\nspread around the Middle East.\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: You know I call this Obama derangement syndrome, Chris. I mean,\n\nto me, from the racist birther lies that he told, to now the lies about\n\nObama gave this money that's now being used to fire missiles at Americans,\n\nthe fact is that money was unfrozen as part of the nuclear deal. That's the\n\nfact. It's nobody giving any -- and it was their money. So it was unfrozen\n\nmoney.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Well, but it was frozen.\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Correct.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: And -- and the point he's making is it gave a maligned regime more\n\nresources.\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: You know what, it was their money and what we got out of it was\n\nthat they agreed to stop development of nuclear weaponry. That's the deal\n\nthat we entered into. It was a containment plan, not appeasement,\n\ncontainment of an enemy, and it was quite effective.\n\nNow we're seeing, as we move forward, we don't have the leverage of that\n\nnuclear deal. The sanctions, as you've point out repeatedly on this show,\n\nhave not had the effect of slowing Iranian aggression. So now we don't have\n\nthe leverage that came from having them in the nuclear deal.\n\nWhat Gillian just said about the range of time that they could develop\n\nnuclear weaponry puts our key ally in the Middle East, Israel, at greater\n\nrisk. We're not in position to fight ISIS at the moment or protect the oil\n\nreserves. All of this at greater risk because of the provocative action\n\nwithout long-term strategy taken by President Trump.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: All right, we're not going to settle this today. we're not going\n\nto settle this in this segment. And we have to take a break here.\n\nBut, when we come back, we're now just three weeks from the Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe latest on the fast-moving Democratic race.\n\nPlus, what would you like to ask the panel about Speaker Pelosi sending\n\nover the articles of impeachment in the next few days, kicking off the\n\ntrial in the Senate? Just go to FaceBook or Twitter at FOX NEWS SUNDAY and\n\nwe may use your question on the air.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I think it's ridiculous. I --\n\nshe should have sent them a long time ago. It -- it just -- it belittles\n\nthe process.\n\nNancy Pelosi will go down as probably the least successful speaker of the\n\nHouse of the history of our nation.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: President Trump reaction to House Speaker Pelosi's announcement\n\nshe'll finally send the articles of impeachment over to the Senate sometime\n\nthis week.\n\nAnd we're back now with the panel.\n\nWell, we asked you for questions for the panel, and on this question of\n\nPelosi's deciding to finally send over the articles of impeachment, we got\n\nthis on Twitter from Mya Voice, which is an interesting name, will the\n\nSenate call relative witnesses with direct knowledge of the president's\n\nactions and conduct a fair trial.\n\nJuan, did Pelosi's delay at least put a focus on this issue of whether or\n\nnot to call witnesses and now you hear that Republican Senator Susan\n\nCollins of Maine is working with a few of her other GOP colleagues on\n\nexactly that issue, whether or not to call witnesses?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, I think that if you were to say, what's the good of the\n\ndelay, you'd say number one is the spotlight on fairness of the trial. A\n\nWashington Post/ABC poll this week had 70 percent, including 64 percent\n\nof Republicans saying, if you don't have documents and witnesses, this is\n\nnothing but a cover-up. That whole focus now, I think, is the result of\n\nPelosi delaying sending over the articles of impeachment.\n\nRemember, on all 15 prior impeachment of federal officials, there have been\n\nwitnesses and documents. Clinton had witnesses. Clinton didn't block other\n\npeople from testifying. But as you point out, the only hope is Susan\n\nCollins, Lisa Murkowski, maybe Mitt Romney, because you only need 51 votes\n\nto change the rules.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Well, you need -- you need one more than those.\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: Yes, but you don't -- but, yes, they have 53 Republican senators.\n\nYou take away a few and suddenly Mitch McConnell, who says he's\n\ncoordinating with the White House Council, will be in a position of having\n\nto accept witnesses.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Gillian, what do you make of former National Security Advisor John\n\nBolton saying, if subpoenaed, he will testify? And we heard earlier\n\nPresident Trump say he would invoke executive privilege. If he did invoke\n\nit, does John Bolton have to live with that or could he just ignore it and\n\nsay what he wanted to say?\n\n\n\nTURNER: Well, this is, to me, one of the more interesting plot lines in the\n\nimpeachment story, John Bolton's willingness and aversion into going along\n\nwith the administration at different points in this process. The president\n\nsaid Friday, essentially, I will block his testimony because -- not just\n\nbecause of executive privilege, but because of national security concerns.\n\nAnd I think for the administration, that's the more powerful line of\n\nargument to get at here. With somebody like a Bolton, unlike with somebody\n\nlike a Mick Mulvaney, or some other folks --\n\nWALLACE: But -- but I don't know if you know the answer to this. If -- if -\n\n- I understand it's an excuse for a witness who wants to take it, but if\n\nBolton wants to testify in the president says, no, executive privilege,\n\ndoes Bolton have to observe that?\n\n\n\nTURNER: Well, unless --\n\n\n\nGOLDBERG: No, I think it's up to Justice Roberts to rule on that.\n\n\n\nTURNER: It's up -- ultimately he'll have to rule on it, which, ironically,\n\nwill give Bolton the outcome he has most desired all along. When he\n\ninitially joined -- filed to join the Charles Kupperman lawsuit, what his\n\nattorney said was, he doesn't want to be the man in the middle that has to\n\nchoose between following guidance from congressional regulators and from\n\nthe commander in chief. So you all in the courts figure this out and let us\n\nknow what you want us to do. This is a way for Bolton to get where he\n\nwanted to be anyway.\n\nA lot of conspiracy theories surrounding why he's agreeing to do this now.\n\nI think it's probably simpler than people imagine. I think it's probably\n\nbecause he's going to get the outcome he wanted. He won't have to make the\n\ndecision.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Meanwhile, the Iowa caucuses are just three weeks from tomorrow.\n\nWe're finally getting there, folks. And the always reliable, often\n\nreliable, I guess nobody's always reliable, new Des Moines Register poll\n\nis out this weekend. It shows Bernie Sanders back in the lead at 20\n\npercent. That's up five points from November with Warren and Buttigieg and\n\nBiden all closely bunched, as you can see, with Buttigieg, who was the\n\nleader in the previous November poll, down nine points.\n\nDonna, given his lead in that poll, given how well he's doing in New\n\nHampshire, given the fact that he is the strong leader in fundraising, is\n\nBernie Sanders now the frontrunner in the Democratic race?\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Oh, you know, two weeks ago someone said is Mayor Pete the\n\nfrontrunner. Four months -- four weeks ago it was Warren.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: I understand that. We've got to cover the news.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Yes. Well -- yes. And, you know what, and he is the frontrunner.\n\nHe's the frontrunner at this hour.\n\nI suspect that over the next couple of days, especially as we prepare for\n\nthe next debate, he's going to come under a lot of scrutiny. Maybe one of\n\nthe second tier candidates will take a aim -- a shot at him. Not literally,\n\nbut in terms of politically.\n\nLook, at the end of the day, Chris, we are in no way close to deciding who\n\nthe nominee is. I see pluses and minuses in -- in the polls for Bernie, but\n\nI also see Joe Biden as still the -- the frontrunner overall in the race.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: OK.\n\nAnd that brings me to Joe Biden, because the other news to me, not just\n\nthat Bernie is doing so well, Biden, in that poll -- I understand it's\n\nwithin the margin of error -- was in fourth place for all of his support\n\nand, yes, he has a lot of support in the African-American community, which\n\nwould come into place once we get to South Carolina.\n\nIf Joe Biden, the former vice president, the punitive frontrunner, finishes\n\nfourth in Iowa, how damaging?\n\n\n\nGOLDBERG: I think it's damaging but it -- unlike a lot of these other\n\ncandidates, it wouldn't be fatal because of the firewall he's got in South\n\nCarolina and in Nevada.\n\nThis is, in a lot of ways, shaping up to me to be really reminiscent of the\n\n2004 Kerry versus Howard Dean dynamic where a large segment of voters were\n\nbasically voting to -- the person they thought most likely to beat George\n\nW. Bush and then another segment, those are the progressive wing, was\n\nvoting their hearts and desires and all the rest. And what's interesting\n\nabout this time around is that the tiebreaker between these two opposing\n\nforces of sort of moderates versus, you know, progressive, is actually the\n\nAfrican-American vote. And that seems decisively to be going for Biden. So\n\nI still think Biden is a -- is better placed than -- than Bernie Sanders\n\nis.\n\n\n\nWALLACE: And let me throw, Juan, another scenario at you, and we've only\n\ngot about a minute left. You could end up with different winners -- there\n\nare four early races, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina -- four\n\ndifferent winners in all of them. Wouldn't that set things up, at least\n\ntheoretically, perfectly, for Michael Bloomberg, who's sitting there on a\n\nhuge war chest, slightly raising -- rising in the polls, for Super Tuesday?\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: You know, it's incredible to me, but it does look like the stars\n\nare aligning for Mike Bloomberg if you're thinking, well, could we go to\n\nthe point where on Super Tuesday it's like 40 percent of the delegates,\n\nthat's when he gets in. His advertising has been overwhelming. He's even\n\nbought a Super Bowl ad. I think you will see it.\n\nAnd, to me, the idea that he bought a minute on the Super Bowl, I think $10\n\nmillion, it's boosted him now to about 6 percent in the polls. He's now\n\ngoing to, you know -- he can't participate because he hasn't raised enough\n\nmoney. He just relies on his own. But he has a chance that I didn't think -\n\n- I really didn't see it, but he does have a chance now better than at any\n\npoint.\n\n\n\nBRAZILE: Juan, he may go up in the polls, but, remember, it's about\n\ndelegates. And unless you get to a 15 percent threshold, not only statewide\n\nbut per congressional district, you get no delegates.\n\n\n\nWILLIAMS: But in an open convention?\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Well, and, I've got to say, you cannot watch TV and not see those\n\nads. Thank you, panel. See you next Sunday. Up next, I'll be back with a big announcement.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nWALLACE: Now for my announcement.\n\nI've been working for much of the past year on a book project. I wanted to\n\nfind a major event almost everyone knows about and dig deep, coming up with\n\nnew revelations and compelling details that will surprise you.\n\nThe result is Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the 116 Days that\n\nChange the World. It's the tale of Harry Truman's sudden rise to the\n\npresidency after the death of FDR and the struggle he faces in making one\n\nof the toughest decisions ever, whether to drop the atomic bomb on\n\nHiroshima and obliterate tens of thousands of people.\n\nBut it's not just Truman. As we countdown the days until the bomb is\n\ndropped, you'll meet the scientists racing to make sure the weapon works,\n\nthe fiercely competitive flight crews vying to be on the final mission.\n\nYou'll meet giants of the 20th century, like Albert Einstein and Robert\n\nOppenheimer, Dwight Eisenhower and George Marshall. And you'll meet 10-\n\nyear-old Adecco Tomora (ph), who survives the blast at ground zero but\n\nloses her mother and now, at age 95, lives in the United States. I think\n\nyou'll find the whole story as fascinating as I did.\n\nPlease go to foxnewssunday.com or Amazon or our special website,\n\ncountdownbook.com, to learn more about Countdown 1945, which will be\n\npublished on June 9th, shortly before the 75th anniversary of Hiroshima.\n\nAnd that's it for today.

A mom who had her leg amputated to fight off cancer just months after giving birth was inspired to get back on her feet by watching her twins take their first steps.\n\nDionne Brown, 26, was diagnosed with cancer in her left knee bone shortly after the birth of her twins Emmett and Cohen.\n\nThe tumor was only spotted after her knee gave way while she was carrying Cohen down the stairs, and doctors looked into the reason while they were checking him over.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe tot was fine, but medics discovered a tumor in his mom's leg, and after five months of treatment she made the tough decision to have her limb amputated.\n\nThe twins took their first steps four months later - inspiring mom-of-four Brown to get back on her feet, using a prosthetic.\n\nAnd she said her adorable kids, Emmett and Cohen, now 18 months, Teigan, 6, and Halie, 4, cheered her on from the sofa.\n\nI wasn't easy seeing the twins able to walk and not myself, Brown said. I have four kids and I wasn't able to do things that I would have otherwise been able to do with them like taking them to the park or cooking for them. I spent a very long time in hospital and was only home a few days a month so I had to leave the children in the care of friends. I was missing everyone especially my twins who were growing up very fast.\n\nWOMAN DONATES KIDNEY TO EX-HUSBAND YEARS AFTER DIVORCE\n\nBrown, from South Molton in North Devon, first noticed pain in her leg in Nov. 2016 while walking her two oldest children to school.\n\nIt just started out of the blue. I could feel the pain which made it very difficult to walk, she said. The pain kept getting worse throughout the weeks that followed. It seemed to happen every time that I walked somewhere.\n\nWorried, Brown went to her doctor and was told that it was down to softened tissue in her knee joints as she was pregnant at the time.\n\nMy GP tried to reassure me that it was nothing to worry about and it was just a symptom of pregnancy, she said. But despite being prescribed Tramadol I could still feel the pain. I felt like a bone was coming out of place and that my knee was giving way.\n\nThe pain got worse and didn't ease up after she gave birth to the twins in April 2017.\n\nImmediately after I returned home, the pain started again but this time it was significantly much worse, she said. I was in so much pain that I was vomiting several times a day. But it then got to a point where I couldn't bear to see my children look at me so I went to my mother's for a few days and left my kids with my partner.\n\nShe was initially misdiagnosed with osteoarthritis, but three months later she accidentally dropped her son when her knee gave way.\n\nI was panicking as I thought that he must have been severely injured so I rushed him to North Devon District Hospital, she said. We arrived and it turned out that he was fine but I explained to the doctors that it was my knee which gave in and caused me to drop Cohen.\n\nFORMER ANCHOR SAYS PRENATAL DEPRESSION MADE HER WISH FOR MISCARRIAGE\n\nAfter 12 more appointments, an X-ray revealed a 4-centimeter tumor in her knee, in August last year.\n\nI actually couldn't process it and take in the news straight away because I was so shocked, she said. But when I did realize, I knew that my whole life was about to change completely. It was absolutely devastating.\n\nBrown had chemotherapy between Sept. 2017 and Jan. 2018, but it didn't work, and doctors offered her the option of amputation.\n\nI could either have an amputation and have a prosthetic leg installed or continue to have rigorous chemotherapy treatment and hoped that my leg would get better over time, she said. However, the doctors told me that I was more likely to walk again if I had a leg amputation.\n\nIt was an extremely life-changing decision as it would determine whether I would walk again, she said.\n\nWhile she was in the hospital she missed her twins' first steps in April this year, but a month later began to get to grips with her prosthetic limb, taking her first solo steps in August.\n\nIt started off with tiny baby steps and over time I slowly developed the confidence to walk longer distances, she said. I developed my confidence slowly to walk longer distances every time. It was hard on the kids though as I had to rely on them to help with the housework and day to day tasks.\n\nI felt guilty that I couldn't look after them properly, she said. The twins took their first steps in April whilst they were with my mum which was amazing to hear. They then visited me in hospital and I noticed both were walking proudly and with confidence - it was truly amazing to see. I did feel slightly annoyed that I missed a vital part of their development but it was nice to see that they were finally walking.\n\nI remember the moment when I could walk independently with the metal leg, I felt great, she said. It was kind of weird though because it wasn't my own leg. My kids were praising me for it and it felt like they were my parents because they were celebrating that I could walk. I am glad that I had an amputation because I may not have walked again if I had still had my leg.
Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer reached the donor threshold to qualify for the next Democratic debate in Iowa, his campaign announced Friday.\n\nAlthough the billionaire and climate activist hit 225,000 unique donors on Friday, he still needs to reach the Democratic National Committee's polling threshold to secure his spot at the Jan. 14 event.\n\nSTEYER BUYS 'KEEP AMERICA GREAT' DOMAIN NAME\n\nToday's achievement is a clear reflection of what we are seeing in the early states — voters are responding to Tom's messages of tackling the climate crisis and building an economy that creates prosperity for all Americans, Steyer's campaign manager Heather Hargreaves said in a statement.\n\nSteyer tweeted about the achievement on Friday while campaigning in Iowa on his People Over Profits tour.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE\n\nYou did it! he wrote. Today our campaign reached the 225,000 donor threshold, a critical step towards qualifying for January's debate in Iowa. Thank you. With your help, we are going to tackle the climate crisis and build an economy that works for ALL Americans.\n\nIn addition to garnering the necessary number of voters, Democratic candidates need to reach 5 percent support in at least four DNC-approved polls, or at least 7 percent support in two single-state polls in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina.\n\nSo far, Steyer is polling at 5 percent in two of the four polls conducted in the early voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. The DNC raised the qualifying thresholds in December in an effort to narrow the large candidate field, Politico reported.\n\nSANDERS, BUTTIGIEG REVEAL MASSIVE FUNDRAISING HAULS IN FOURTH QUARTER\n\nShould he gain traction in the other two polls, Steyer will debate alongside former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg.\n\nSteyer's campaign said the candidate reached 10 percent support among Democratic primary voters in a recent Morning Consult poll conducted in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada between Dec. 23 and 29.\n\nNationally, however, Steyer only has 3 percent support, according to the same poll based on 17,787 survey interviews.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS
The growing socialist wing of the Democratic Party will flex its muscle Thursday with the seating of the new Congress, as more self-described Democratic Socialists join the ranks and dozens of sitting and incoming members – including likely 2020 hopefuls – embrace a massive government expansion that would make FDR look like a penny pincher.\n\nThe party agenda is increasingly embracing big-government policies like Medicare-for-all and guaranteed jobs programs -- as well as an aggressive Green New Deal that would include all this and more as part of a fundamental overhaul to America's economy and specifically its energy sector.\n\nIt's unclear when and if any of them will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years, and reflects a shift in the party itself. A stunning Gallup poll last summer showed Democrats view socialism more positively than capitalism. The term Democratic Socialist was only broadly popularized with the 2016 presidential run of Bernie Sanders, who identifies as one. The enthusiasm behind his bid underscored how ideas that once marinated on the party's fringe were increasingly becoming mainstream.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNow, two more Democratic Socialists will join Sanders in Congress on Thursday -- Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich. Ocasio-Cortez has embraced the mantle, while Tlaib is a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). And while Ocasio-Cortez and Tlaib represent only a sliver of the Democratic Party's new majority in the House, they have attracted outsized media attention and are pushing policies with dozens of supporters.\n\nMedicare-for-all in particular is quickly picking up support. A New York Times analysis found that one-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats have endorsed Medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls. Such proposals would lead to more government involvement in health care, and bring the U.S. a step closer to mostly socialized systems such as the British National Health Service. Their popularity is driven by frustration with the current private insurance system, which remains costly on the individual market despite ObamaCare's goals. And while Medicare-for-all is estimated to cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, advocates argue some of this would replace out-of-pocket expenses already being shouldered by millions of Americans.\n\nBut even more ambitious than Medicare-for-all is what's known as the Green New Deal. While echoing the language of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Green New Deal could be an even more sprawling government and economic overhaul. Championed by groups such as the Sunrise Movement and Justice Democrats, the plan would aim to combat both climate change and income inequality – and has been picked up by lawmakers such as Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nWe are calling for a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy ASAP, Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nA draft text circulated around Congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources.\n\nIf that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the United States and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation.\n\nOn the economic front, it also demands a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism.\n\nIn at least a partial nod to the presumably mammoth cost that overhauling the nation's economy and energy sector would entail, it says that the financing of the Plan would be accomplished by the federal government, using a combination of the Federal Reserve, a new public bank or system of regional and specialized public banks, public venture funds and such other vehicles or structures that the select committee deems appropriate, in order to ensure that interest and other investment returns generated from public investments made in connection with the Plan will be returned to the treasury, reduce taxpayer burden and allow for more investment.\n\nIndeed, the question that has long dogged such proposals is how to pay for it all. But the answer has typically avoided specifics, instead arguing that America has found ways to pay for other gargantuan costs in the past. In a follow-up FAQ, one explainer says the plan would be funded by the same ways we paid for World War II and many other wars.\n\nThe Federal Reserve can extend credit to power these projects and investments, new public banks can be created (as in WWII) to extend credit and a combination of various taxation tools (including taxes on carbon and other emissions and progressive wealth taxes) can be employed, it says.\n\nConservatives warn these ambitious programs, though, would do generational damage to the U.S. economy.\n\nTogether, Ocasio-Cortez's proposals would effectively eliminate fossil fuels from most of society, destroy millions of jobs and trillions of dollars of wealth, require 'upgrading' every home and business in America, create a national federal jobs-guarantee program, impose single-payer health care (costing trillions more), establish a new system of publicly owned banks, run up the national debt by countless trillions of dollars, and move the United States closer than ever to socialism, Justin Haskins, a research fellow at the Heartland Institute, wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. If we don't stop it, it will destroy our economy for a whole generation of Americans.\n\nSome liberal commentators have warmed to the proposals. The New York Times' Paul Krugman said it wasn't clear what the Green New Deal meant, which is what makes it a good slogan.\n\nSuch a sweeping policy would almost certainly be dead on arrival as long as Republicans control at least one chamber of Congress or the White House. Krugman noted the political realities for the left, arguing that Democrats can't enact such a plan this year but they should start preparing now, and be ready to move in two years.\n\nBut regardless of how much progress these proposals might make on the House floor, they're already part of the 2020 conversation. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who has been tipped for a White House bid, said last month that he is excited to support the Green New Deal.\n\nThe Chicago Tribune reported that Sen. Kamala Harris', D-Calif., staff have been in touch with the organizers behind the Green New Deal. Axios reported Wednesday that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who just launched an exploratory committee for a presidential run, supports a Green New Deal.\n\nSenator Warren has been a longtime advocate of aggressively addressing climate change and shifting toward renewables, and supports the idea of a Green New Deal to ambitiously tackle our climate crisis, economic inequality, and racial injustice, an aide told the outlet.\n\nWarren, Harris and Booker have also backed separate Medicare-for-all plans.\n\nIn the House, the Sunrise Movement says that it has more than 40 House members who are backing the Green New Deal, including Reps. Tulsi Gabbard, D-Hawaii, Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Veronica Escobar, D-Texas.\n\nHowever, Democratic leadership has been cautious about adopting such proposals. Roll Call reported that Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., who is set to be the Energy and Commerce Committee chairman, said he supports the idea of Medicare-for-all but doesn't think the votes are there.\n\nEarlier this week, House Democrats formalized proposals for a new committee on climate change, but without the features that proponents of a Green New Deal have sought -- such as the power to subpoena and the authority to vote on legislation and send it directly to the House floor.\n\nA sign of possible tensions within the party was on display in November, when environmental activists took part in a sit-in outside Speaker-designate Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., office, demanding leadership do more to promote the Green New Deal.\n\nJoining the protesters was Ocasio-Cortez, who said: We need to tell her that we've got her back in showing and pursuing the most progressive energy agenda that this country has ever seen.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., hit Iowa this weekend with her brand of left-wing populism as she considers a 2020 presidential run -- calling for a better deal for the middle class and to return politics to the people.\n\nWe need to make structural change, she told a crowd early Saturday in Sioux City, Think big, fight hard.\n\nWarren announced this week that she had launched an exploratory committee to consider whether to jump into what is expected to be a packed 2020 field.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBut in her stump speech in the first-in-the-nation caucus state, Warren barely mentioned Trump, focusing her ire on the status quo in the nation's capital and what she said was a too-tight relationship between Washington and Wall Street.\n\nWashington works great for giant drug companies, but just not for people trying to get their prescriptions filled, she said. Washington works great for giant financial companies like Equifax but not for people whose social security numbers get stolen.\n\nLater she said Washington worked, only if one was armed with an army of lawyers or lobbyists: It is corruption, pure and simple, and it's time to fight back.\n\nWhile some Democrats have pushed to focus on Trump, and impeachment amid the FBI special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, Warren's address indicated she was more interested in dealing with kitchen-table issues such as the economy, minimum wage, health care and education.\n\nTackling head-on costs crushing middle-class families -- health care, education -- those are the investments we need to make as a country, she said, saying rising costs and flat wages had hollowed out the middle class.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN SLAMS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AS 'CORRUPT,' ADMITS AGREEMENT ON SYRIA\n\nWe need to return politics to the people, she said.\n\nWarren also took time to talk about her achievements in the Senate, including the formation of the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) as part of the Dodd-Frank financial reform. She also told the crowd about how she worked with Republicans to get a bill through Congress that resulted in lower prices for hearing aids.\n\nWarren brings more experience in the Senate to the table that some of the other top-tier candidates who are flirting with the idea of getting into the race. But she has also faced criticism from the right and the left for the handling of her claims of Native American ancestry -- particularly her release in October of DNA test results that showed only a trace amount of Native American heritage.\n\nIt was the first question she faced from the audience on Saturday, and one she seemed prepared for as she made it clear that she was not part of any tribe.\n\nI'm not a person of color, I'm not a citizen of a tribe. Tribal citizenship is very different from ancestry. Tribes and only tribes determine tribal citizenship and I respect that difference, she said.\n\nIn her one reference to the current occupant of the White House, she brushed off the criticism she received over the DNA controversy from President Trump.\n\nI can't stop Donald Trump from what he's going to do, I can't stop him from hurling racial insults, I don't have any power to do that, but what I can do is I can be in this fight for all of our families, she said.\n\nOn Friday, she appeared in Council Bluffs and said that America is only working for those on the top and called for top-to-bottom change.\n\nThis is the moment we need to make big structural change in this country, she said.\n\nShe said her motivation came from being grateful for the opportunities she had to become a Harvard law professor and later a senator, after an upbringing in Oklahoma that saw her father become a janitor and her mother support the family on a minimum wage job.\n\nI am grateful to America, down to my toes, she said.
Xander Schauffele already is a footnote in PGA Tour history as the first player to post the lowest score in a stroke-play tournament without getting credit for the win.\n\nHe wouldn't mind being another asterisk at Kapalua.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nNo one has ever gone more than a year without winning and ended the drought at the Sentry Tournament of Champions. Winning is the only way to get to Maui at the start of the year, so Schauffele and 15 other players ordinarily wouldn't be here. Except that 2020 was no ordinary year.\n\nBecause the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the PGA Tour for three months, the winners-only field at Kapalua was expanded to include anyone who made it to the Tour Championship.\n\nI got an asterisk for winning the Tour Championship that counted in certain things and not in others, Schauffele said. I'm all about entering weird categories, I guess. This is what I do.\n\nSchauffele finished at 15-under 265 at the Tour Championship, the lowest score by three shots. But the FedEx Cup finale now has a staggered start based on the standings, and top seed Dustin Johnson (who started at 10-under par) was crowned the champion. Schauffele only received first-place world ranking points, but no trophy.\n\nPart of him believes he earned his spot at Kapalua. And part of him is just happy to be here.\n\nIt's called the Tournament of Champions. I'm fortunate and lucky to be here, he said. You should win to be here. It's a bonus for winning. I always want to be here and we'll do everything in our power to be here.\n\nThe 42-man field is the largest in tournament history by adding players who reached the FedEx Cup finale, a list that includes two players — Scottie Scheffler and Abraham Ancer — who have never won on the PGA Tour.\n\nAnother addition is Billy Horschel, who would like to see the one-time criteria stay that way. Horschel said such a proposal has been presented to the Player Advisory Council.\n\nI think it's good, something they should do permanently, Horschel said.\n\nHe believes it would benefit the title sponsor, Wisconsin-based Sentry, along with the field next week in Honolulu. Horschel said the tour has crunched numbers and in a normal year, it would add eight to 10 players to Kapalua. He also said a reduction to three FedEx Cup playoff events makes it harder to reach East Lake, and those players should be rewarded.\n\nWhether it goes any further than the PAC is doubtful.\n\nThe tour has contemplated an expanded field over the years, such as giving a two-year exemption to Kapalua for winning a tournament. Sentry, in its fourth year as the sponsor, likes the exclusivity of being the toughest field to make all year.\n\nBesides, the name of the tournament would have to change. Tournament for really good years doesn't hold much appeal.\n\nIt fits for Schauffele, who did everything but win (even with the low score at East Lake).\n\nHe needed two putts from 35 feet on the final hole last year to win at Kapalua, only to three-putt for par in 30 mph gusts. That led to a three-man playoff won by Justin Thomas. He also had chances at Colonial and Shadow Creek.\n\nAnd he's lucky to be back at Kapalua in other ways. Schauffele tested positive for the coronavirus a week before Christmas, and he finished the self-isolation in time to make the trip to Maui.\n\nI got COVID, and the reason I'm here is because of COVID, so there's always a couple ways to look at it, he said. But yes, it is very strange to play in a Tournament of Champions without an official win.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKapalua also is the first tournament for Johnson since he won the Masters on Nov. 15. He decided not to play in the Mayakoba Classic and arrived last week on Maui to start shaking off the rust. Johnson and Thomas have played every year since 2016, the longest active streak for the winners-only event.\n\nFor others, Kapalua is a welcome return.\n\nSergio Garcia, who won the Sanderson Farms Championship, returns for the first time in 15 years. The former Masters champ has been eligible before, though like several Europeans, he often limited travel because he started his new year in the Middle East. Stewart Cink hasn't played in 11 years.\n\nIt's always great to start the year in Maui because it's Maui, but also it means that you've done something that's worthy of an invite here, Cink said.\n\nAdam Scott returns for the first time since 2014. He has missed previous years from playing in Australia deep in the year and needing something of an offseason. Because of the pandemic, Australian tournaments were canceled. Scott has been in Switzerland with his wife and three children, and only recently stopped over in the Bahamas to start practicing.\n\nHe moved up his practice so he could spend the afternoon surfing, but later was spotted on the putting green.\n\nNo waves, he said, though clearly not the end of the world.
Person of the Year: Ben Bernanke?\n\nHe's the Saddam Hussein of economics. He's one of the fat cats that the president says causes the problem. He was on the board of governors of the Federal Reserve from 2002 to 2005 and was chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers from 2005 to January 2006. In February 2006 he was appointed as a member of the board for a 14-year term and to a four-year term as chairman.\n\nWall Street and banking CEOs are crucified, but the government guy who's overseen the tanking of our economy is applauded?\n\nBernanke's victory was bad enough, but the other finalists were even worse. He was up against — I'm not kidding: Usain Bolt (he runs faster than most people); Gen. Stanley McCrystal (who was ignored by Barack Obama); Nancy Pelosi; Steve Jobs and — my favorite finalist — the Chinese worker. Which one? The one that dipped our toys in lead paint or the one that poisoned our dog food?\n\nI could go for the Chinese worker, if Time made it the slave that you are now slave to, but that's not the angle they were going for.\n\nFast runners, iPod creators, and people employed in Chinese sweatshops making iPods. Hmm, who is missing in this equation? I can't think of any protests or anything like that. There weren't many disagreements with this president. Progressives are jamming bills down our throats and America is just taking it. No questions asked.\n\nHow did Time miss the tea party movement or the 9/12 movement?\n\nTime's year in pictures review doesn't include any pictures of either the 9/12 rally or the tax day tea party protests all over the country. But these are some of the most memorable pictures of 2009.\n\nCindy Sheehan brought 40 people to Crawford, Texas and she was a media darling and included in Time's 2005 year-end review. How do you tell the full, complete story of America and totally miss this massive voice of opposition?\n\nThis is the movement that has, so far, stopped the government health care debacle from passing; there's no one else standing in the way. Democrats have the 60 votes they need. What else is holding things up? There is no reason for a Democrat to vote against it unless they fear for their re-election chances. And because of you, they do.\n\nAt the very least, I'd expect the tea party protesters and 9/12ers to be included in the way I've grown accustomed to journalists covering them: The tea-bagger people standing in the way of reform.\n\nBut it's even worse than just being slandered with lame sex jokes. Millions of Americans united in a belief that government is out of control and needs to scale back the spending, the corruption, the special interests and who are publicly demonstrating their frustration at health care town halls, on tax day and on 9/12, they aren't being mocked anymore. They are being completely ignored. You don't even exist.\n\nBut this is not unexpected for people who take the Obamas at their word. Listen to what Michelle Obama has said in the past:\n\n(BEGIN MAY, 2008 VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMICHELLE OBAMA: Barack knows that we are going to have to make sacrifices; we are going to have to change our conversation; we're going to have to change our traditions, our history; we're going to have to move into a different place as a nation.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nChange our traditions and change our history. What did she mean by that? I think we are starting to see it.\n\nChanging history means not just telling the same old tall tales of the free market system and the Founders. No, it's the history according to progressives. And it's not merely spinning the old facts; it's taking current events and molding them to fit the progressive agenda and, in this case, completely ignoring history.\n\nWhat else did she say? Change traditions. Here are some facts:\n\n• 92 percent of Americans believe in God\n\n• 83 percent believe public schools should celebrate religious holidays\n\n• 66 percent say they will celebrate Christmas as a religious holiday honoring the birth of Jesus Christ\n\n• Only 6 percent don't celebrate Christmas at all; 3 percent were not sure how to answer\n\nThat's what we believe. Those are our traditions. But here's what happens on the ground:\n\nTeachers of a second grade class in Taunton, Massachusetts gave an assignment to their class: Make a Christmas drawing, something that reminds you of the holidays. One of the 8-year-old students knew exactly what he'd draw. He and his family had just visited nearby National Shrine of Our Lady of La Salette where they have crucifixion statues. So, the little boy drew a stick figure Jesus hanging on the cross. Makes sense: Christmas is, after all, Jesus' birthday and the crucifix was fresh in his mind.\n\nNow, imagine an 8-year-old boy. He must have been so excited to see how the teachers would react. Like Ralphie in the movie A Christmas Story, eager to win his teacher's approval of the Red Rider story he concocted. And just like when Ralphie's teacher responded with a You'll shoot your eyes out reaction, this boy was also completely devastated. Instead of reacting with praise, the teachers immediately sent him home and ordered that he undergo a psychological evaluation.\n\nWhere is the common sense? The principle says school safety protocols in place that were followed. They had a safety net in place — great — but they still thought a picture of Jesus fit in the risk category?\n\nLet's go to New Jersey: A third grader was getting ready for quiet time at school. During this time the kids can read a book, sleep, rest or whatever. This little girl, her name is Mariah, decides she's going to read her bible. The teacher walks over to Mariah and tells her that the bible is not appropriate reading material and she has to put it away. Mariah was upset and confused.\n\nSee what's happening? Ninety-two percent believe in God; 64 percent celebrate Christmas as the birth of Jesus. But God is inappropriate and what your parents have shown you is so risky you may need a psychological exam?\n\nIt doesn't match the real values of the country. But removing God does fit the progressive agenda.\n\nChange history. Change traditions. But you can't just wipe them out, you need to replace it with something. And we are constantly being force-fed the progressive agenda through intentional propaganda:\n\n• NEA art propaganda: Obama-care regularly polls worse than Hillary-care, so they create the illusion of support through art\n\n• Those who stand up for the Constitution: Free speech isn't highlighted — no, no! You are part of some crazy right-wing militia\n\n• If you aren't convinced global warming is man-made and it might be that giant ball of fire in the sky slightly fluctuating from time to time, you are a flat-Earther. You think the moon landing was fake? You are a Holocaust denier!\n\n• If you believe in lower taxes for all, are you an opposing voice? Nope, you must hate poor people\n\n• Tea party-goer? Well, you don't even exist. You've been crossed out of the history books\n\nBut if you are crossed out, who is being put in?\n\nDateline, Wisconsin: Teachers at a Wisconsin schools will have to teach the history of organized labor, under a bill signed by Governor Jim Doyle. Doyle added that he was happy to sign the bill so students would understand the importance of the labor movement.\n\nI know the cheese unions were crucial in building Wisconsin, but really? Let's see, which has been better for Wisconsin: Jesus Christ or the labor unions?\n\nImagine if the governor came out and signed a bill forcing kids to learn about the positives of Jesus in textbooks? The ACLU would be in full crisis mode.\n\nWhere are the teachers? When a politician can not only say what to write — because of a special interest group — but also the importance of it? When they are out of power, who gets their turn to indoctrinate? Every member of the teachers union should be screaming at the top of their lungs.\n\nThey are changing our history, changing our traditions and indoctrinating our children.\n\n— Watch Glenn Beck weekdays at 5 p.m. ET on Fox News Channel
Newly-elected Utah senator Mitt Romney kicked off 2019 with an op-ed in the Washington Post that savaged Donald Trump's character and leadership. Romney's attack and Trump's response Wednesday morning on Twitter are the latest salvos in a longstanding personal feud between the two men. It's even possible that Romney is planning to challenge Trump for the Republican nomination in 2020. We'll see.\n\nBut for now, Romney's piece is fascinating on its own terms. It's well-worth reading. It's a window into how the people in charge, in both parties, see our country.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM TUCKER CARLSON.\n\nRomney's main complaint in the piece is that Donald Trump is a mercurial and divisive leader. That's true, of course. But beneath the personal slights, Romney has a policy critique of Trump. He seems genuinely angry that Trump might pull American troops out of the Syrian civil war. Romney doesn't explain how staying in Syria would benefit America. He doesn't appear to consider that a relevant question. More policing in the Middle East is always better. We know that. Virtually everyone in Washington agrees.\n\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL EPISODE OF TUCKER CARLSON TONIGHT.\n\n\n\nCorporate tax cuts are also popular in Washington, and Romney is strongly on board with those, too. His piece throws a rare compliment to Trump for cutting the corporate rate a year ago.\n\nThat's not surprising. Romney spent the bulk of his business career at a firm called Bain Capital. Bain Capital all but invented what is now a familiar business strategy: Take over an existing company for a short period of time, cut costs by firing employees, run up the debt, extract the wealth, and move on, sometimes leaving retirees without their earned pensions. Romney became fantastically rich doing this.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP.\n\nMeanwhile, a remarkable number of the companies are now bankrupt or extinct. This is the private equity model. Our ruling class sees nothing wrong with it. It's how they run the country.\n\nMitt Romney refers to unwavering support for a finance-based economy and an internationalist foreign policy as the mainstream Republican view. And he's right about that. For generations, Republicans have considered it their duty to make the world safe for banking, while simultaneously prosecuting ever more foreign wars. Modern Democrats generally support those goals enthusiastically.\n\nThere are signs, however, that most people do not support this, and not just in America. In countries around the world — France, Brazil, Sweden, the Philippines, Germany, and many others — voters are suddenly backing candidates and ideas that would have been unimaginable just a decade ago. These are not isolated events. What you're watching is entire populations revolting against leaders who refuse to improve their lives.\n\nSomething like this has been in happening in our country for three years. Donald Trump rode a surge of popular discontent all the way to the White House. Does he understand the political revolution that he harnessed? Can he reverse the economic and cultural trends that are destroying America? Those are open questions.\n\nBut they're less relevant than we think. At some point, Donald Trump will be gone. The rest of us will be gone, too. The country will remain. What kind of country will be it be then? How do we want our grandchildren to live? These are the only questions that matter.\n\nThe answer used to be obvious. The overriding goal for America is more prosperity, meaning cheaper consumer goods. But is that still true? Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones, or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy? They haven't so far. A lot of Americans are drowning in stuff. And yet drug addiction and suicide are depopulating large parts of the country. Anyone who thinks the health of a nation can be summed up in GDP is an idiot.\n\nThe goal for America is both simpler and more elusive than mere prosperity. It's happiness. There are a lot of ingredients in being happy: Dignity. Purpose. Self-control. Independence. Above all, deep relationships with other people. Those are the things that you want for your children. They're what our leaders should want for us, and would want if they cared.\n\nBut our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\n\nOne of the biggest lies our leaders tell us that you can separate economics from everything else that matters. Economics is a topic for public debate. Family and faith and culture, meanwhile, those are personal matters. Both parties believe this.\n\nMembers of our educated upper-middle-classes are now the backbone of the Democratic Party who usually describe themselves as fiscally responsible and socially moderate. In other words, functionally libertarian. They don't care how you live, as long as the bills are paid and the markets function. Somehow, they don't see a connection between people's personal lives and the health of our economy, or for that matter, the country's ability to pay its bills. As far as they're concerned, these are two totally separate categories.\n\n\n\nSocial conservatives, meanwhile, come to the debate from the opposite perspective, and yet reach a strikingly similar conclusion. The real problem, you'll hear them say, is that the American family is collapsing. Nothing can be fixed before we fix that. Yet, like the libertarians they claim to oppose, many social conservatives also consider markets sacrosanct. The idea that families are being crushed by market forces seems never to occur to them. They refuse to consider it. Questioning markets feels like apostasy.\n\nBoth sides miss the obvious point: Culture and economics are inseparably intertwined. Certain economic systems allow families to thrive. Thriving families make market economies possible. You can't separate the two. It used to be possible to deny this. Not anymore. The evidence is now overwhelming. How do we know? Consider the inner cities.\n\nThirty years ago, conservatives looked at Detroit or Newark and many other places and were horrified by what they saw. Conventional families had all but disappeared in poor neighborhoods. The majority of children were born out of wedlock. Single mothers were the rule. Crime and drugs and disorder became universal.\n\nWhat caused this nightmare? Liberals didn't even want to acknowledge the question. They were benefiting from the disaster, in the form of reliable votes. Conservatives, though, had a ready explanation for inner-city dysfunction and it made sense: big government. Decades of badly-designed social programs had driven fathers from the home and created what conservatives called a culture of poverty that trapped people in generational decline.\n\nThere was truth in this. But it wasn't the whole story. How do we know? Because virtually the same thing has happened decades later to an entirely different population. In many ways, rural America now looks a lot like Detroit.\n\nThis is striking because rural Americans wouldn't seem to have much in common with anyone from the inner city. These groups have different cultures, different traditions and political beliefs. Usually they have different skin colors. Rural people are white conservatives, mostly.\n\nYet, the pathologies of modern rural America are familiar to anyone who visited downtown Baltimore in the 1980s: Stunning out of wedlock birthrates. High male unemployment. A terrifying drug epidemic. Two different worlds. Similar outcomes. How did this happen? You'd think our ruling class would be interested in knowing the answer. But mostly they're not. They don't have to be interested. It's easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.\n\nBut Republicans now represent rural voters. They ought to be interested. Here's a big part of the answer: male wages declined. Manufacturing, a male-dominated industry, all but disappeared over the course of a generation. All that remained in many places were the schools and the hospitals, both traditional employers of women. In many places, women suddenly made more than men.\n\nNow, before you applaud this as a victory for feminism, consider the effects. Study after study has shown that when men make less than women, women generally don't want to marry them. Maybe they should want to marry them, but they don't. Over big populations, this causes a drop in marriage, a spike in out-of-wedlock births, and all the familiar disasters that inevitably follow -- more drug and alcohol abuse, higher incarceration rates, fewer families formed in the next generation.\n\nThis isn't speculation. This is not propaganda from the evangelicals. It's social science. We know it's true. Rich people know it best of all. That's why they get married before they have kids. That model works. But increasingly, marriage is a luxury only the affluent in America can afford.\n\nAnd yet, and here's the bewildering and infuriating part, those very same affluent married people, the ones making virtually all the decisions in our society, are doing pretty much nothing to help the people below them get and stay married. Rich people are happy to fight malaria in Congo. But working to raise men's wages in Dayton or Detroit? That's crazy.\n\nThis is negligence on a massive scale. Both parties ignore the crisis in marriage. Our mindless cultural leaders act like it's still 1961, and the biggest problem American families face is that sexism is preventing millions of housewives from becoming investment bankers or Facebook executives.\n\nFor our ruling class, more investment banking is always the answer. They teach us it's more virtuous to devote your life to some soulless corporation than it is to raise your own kids.\n\nSheryl Sandberg of Facebook wrote an entire book about this. Sandberg explained that our first duty is to shareholders, above our own children. No surprise there. Sandberg herself is one of America's biggest shareholders. Propaganda like this has made her rich.\n\nWe are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows.\n\nWhat's remarkable is how the rest of us responded to it. We didn't question why Sandberg was saying this. We didn't laugh in her face at the pure absurdity of it. Our corporate media celebrated Sandberg as the leader of a liberation movement. Her book became a bestseller: Lean In. As if putting a corporation first is empowerment. It is not. It is bondage. Republicans should say so.\n\n\n\nThey should also speak out against the ugliest parts of our financial system. Not all commerce is good. Why is it defensible to loan people money they can't possibly repay? Or charge them interest that impoverishes them? Payday loan outlets in poor neighborhoods collect 400 percent annual interest.\n\nWe're OK with that? We shouldn't be. Libertarians tell us that's how markets work -- consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives. OK. But it's also disgusting. If you care about America, you ought to oppose the exploitation of Americans, whether it's happening in the inner city or on Wall Street.\n\n\n\nAnd by the way, if you really loved your fellow Americans, as our leaders should, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it's everywhere.\n\nAnd that's not an accident. Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. Oh, but it's better for you than alcohol, they tell us.\n\nMaybe. Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who's been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. Because they don't care about us.\n\nWhen you care about people, you do your best to treat them fairly. Our leaders don't even try. They hand out jobs and contracts and scholarships and slots at prestigious universities based purely on how we look. There's nothing less fair than that, though our tax code comes close.\n\nUnder our current system, an American who works for a salary pays about twice the tax rate as someone who's living off inherited money and doesn't work at all. We tax capital at half of what we tax labor. It's a sweet deal if you work in finance, as many of our rich people do.\n\nIn 2010, for example, Mitt Romney made about $22 million dollars in investment income. He paid an effective federal tax rate of 14 percent. For normal upper-middle-class wage earners, the federal tax rate is nearly 40 percent. No wonder Mitt Romney supports the status quo. But for everyone else, it's infuriating.\n\nOur leaders rarely mention any of this. They tell us our multi-tiered tax code is based on the principles of the free market. Please. It's based on laws that the Congress passed, laws that companies lobbied for in order to increase their economic advantage. It worked well for those people. They did increase their economic advantage. But for everyone else, it came at a big cost. Unfairness is profoundly divisive. When you favor one child over another, your kids don't hate you. They hate each other.\n\nThat happens in countries, too. It's happening in ours, probably by design. Divided countries are easier to rule. And nothing divides us like the perception that some people are getting special treatment. In our country, some people definitely are getting special treatment. Republicans should oppose that with everything they have.\n\n\n\nWhat kind of country do you want to live in? A fair country. A decent country. A cohesive country. A country whose leaders don't accelerate the forces of change purely for their own profit and amusement. A country you might recognize when you're old.\n\nA country that listens to young people who don't live in Brooklyn. A country where you can make a solid living outside of the big cities. A country where Lewiston, Maine seems almost as important as the west side of Los Angeles. A country where environmentalism means getting outside and picking up the trash. A clean, orderly, stable country that respects itself. And above all, a country where normal people with an average education who grew up in no place special can get married, and have happy kids, and repeat unto the generations. A country that actually cares about families, the building block of everything.\n\n\n\nWhat will it take a get a country like that? Leaders who want it. For now, those leaders will have to be Republicans. There's no option at this point.\n\nBut first, Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion. Market capitalism is a tool, like a staple gun or a toaster. You'd have to be a fool to worship it. Our system was created by human beings for the benefit of human beings. We do not exist to serve markets. Just the opposite. Any economic system that weakens and destroys families is not worth having. A system like that is the enemy of a healthy society.\n\n\n\nInternalizing all this will not be easy for Republican leaders. They'll have to unlearn decades of bumper sticker-talking points and corporate propaganda. They'll likely lose donors in the process. They'll be criticized. Libertarians are sure to call any deviation from market fundamentalism a form of socialism.\n\nThat's a lie. Socialism is a disaster. It doesn't work. It's what we should be working desperately to avoid. But socialism is exactly what we're going to get, and very soon unless a group of responsible people in our political system reforms the American economy in a way that protects normal people.\n\n\n\nIf you want to put America first, you've got to put its families first.\n\nAdapted from Tucker Carlson's monologue from Tucker Carlson Tonight on January 2, 2019.
By rejecting the Keystone XL oil pipeline, President Obama did more than just pander to environmentalists. He shredded attempts by his handlers to cast him as a pragmatic and reasonable man who can appeal to independent voters.\n\nInstead, he stands naked as an ideologue willing to sacrifice workers on the altar of special-interest politics.\n\nThousands of jobs were cast aside with no more thought than yesterday's socks. Demolished, too, is the promised commitment to energy independence.\n\nThe $7 billion pipeline would carry Canadian oil to Gulf Coast ports. Despite three years of study by the State Department, Obama tried to put off the decision until after the election.\n\nBut Canada offered to change the route to avoid an aquifer in Nebraska, and unions demanded to know whether he would approve a permit, so Republicans put a 60-day deadline in December's payroll-tax legislation.\n\nNow we have undeniable proof of the president's priorities. The man who insisted that making sure jobs are available is the first thing I think about when I wake up every morning was just reading empty words from a TelePrompter.\n\nObama didn't even have the decency to explain himself, sending out a lame statement that hinted he wasn't making a decision on the merits, only reacting to the deadline.\n\nThe suggestion that he might ultimately approve the project is a shameless bid to deny the obvious. He made his choice because that's who he is.\n\nMeanwhile, Canada, saying it is profoundly disappointed, is turning to Plan B. It likely will build a pipeline to its West Coast and sell the oil to China.\n\nMichael Goodwin is a Fox News contributor and New York Post columnist.

Now that Nancy Pelosi is speaker of the House, her party and President Trump seem to be getting down to the business of not making a deal to end the government shutdown.\n\nFor the moment, at least, both sides would rather have the issue.\n\nSome Republicans have told me privately that they have explored possible avenues of compromise with Democratic colleagues and made little progress. It may well be that Pelosi and company, confident that the president has helped them brand this as the Trump Shutdown, would rather let the thing drag on and inflict more pain. But Republicans too, boxed in by Trump's hard-line stance, are resisting certain avenues of compromise.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPelosi's side is pushing a plan to fund the other six federal departments that aren't involved in the immigration controversy, which has a common-sense ring. But Republicans have told them that would obliterate their leverage, which is true. Media reports say Trump told Chuck Schumer he'd look foolish buying into such a plan. So the paralysis continues.\n\nLook at it this way: The government can't remain partially closed forever. In a week, two weeks, three weeks, there will be a papered-over compromise that will allow both sides to claim a measure of victory.\n\nSo why can't that happen right now?\n\nThe answer is that this has become a grudge match — and not really about the dollars involved — in which neither side is ready to give an inch.\n\nTrump wanted more than $5 billion for a border wall, the Dems offered $1.3 billion, and Republicans countered with $2.5 billion (although Trump hasn't embraced that number). Democrats haven't budged. Republicans want any figure that begins with a 2, which underscores how slim the differences are.\n\nBut the impasse is hardly painless, given that national parks and museums have shut down. And 800,000 federal workers, some of them living paycheck to paycheck, are not being paid and worried about paying the rent, the mortgage or ordinary living expenses.\n\nIn fact, some Republicans say privately that pressure will grow on both sides after next Monday, when government workers are scheduled to miss another paycheck.\n\nPelosi was hardly sending out an olive branch in a Washington Post interview, saying she respects the office of the presidency but not the occupant's lack of shared values about our country.\n\nWe have to stipulate to a set of facts if we're going to ever negotiate, she said. But he simply won't do it. What he talks about with the wall isn't true. It isn't true about terrorists coming over the wall, people with illnesses flooding the country. I mean, really?\n\nThe president, who has whacked a long list of political and media opponents, hasn't really slammed Pelosi. I like her. Can you believe it? I like Nancy Pelosi, he said after the Democrats won the House. I mean, she's tough and she's smart, he said after the midterm elections.\n\nThe Federalist has a smart take: If President Trump wants to end the government shutdown and get Congress to approve funding for his border wall, there's a way to do it — if he's willing to compromise with Democrats. Likewise, if Democrats want to end the shutdown and address the humanitarian crisis at the border, they could do that — if they were willing to compromise with Trump.\n\nBut they won't, because the fight over the border wall isn't really about addressing conditions on the border. It's about domestic politics and virtue signaling to each side's respective base.\n\nIn addressing the House chamber yesterday, Pelosi said that we should serve with our heart full of love and that Americans want a Congress that delivers results for the people. She got a cheer for saying her party would be offering legislation to reopen government today — which she pushed through last night.\n\nAnd yet she was talking to lawmakers who haven't managed to keep the government running. And that situation won't change until both sides decide that the time for political posturing is over.
2020. For the rest of our lives the mere mention of that fateful year will send a little chill down our spine. Every single person on this planet had life turned upside down and inside out by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nNow that 2020 is in the rear-view mirror, I think we have to ask the question: Is 2020 a year to forget?\n\nI can imagine your answer is a resounding 'yes!' After all, the Apostle Paul's life philosophy involved some intentional forgetting: One thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal… (Philippians 3:13-14).\n\nThere is a kind of forgetfulness that is good for us. It's not healthy or productive for us to wallow in what last year could or should have been. So, yes, in this sense— forget 2020.\n\nGEORGE CLOONEY, LEANN RIMES, ALOE BLACC AND MORE STARS REFLECT ON 2020: 'SO MUCH TRAUMA'\n\nBut, in another sense, we shouldn't forget 2020. Each experience in our lives is meant to teach us something, to change us in some way. If we fail to learn the lesson, then the trials were all in vain.\n\nThe Bible compares this to a man who looks intently in a mirror, but then goes away and at once forgets what he was like (James 1:23-24).\n\nTo forget by refusing to change destructive patterns in our lives can be complete folly.\n\nWinston Churchill said it like this, Men occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of them pick themselves up and hurry off as if nothing has happened.\n\nThe disruptions of 2020 held up a mirror to each of us, but most people will hurry off into 2021 as if nothing happened.\n\nDon't let that be you. Don't forget 2020.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nIn this spirit, here are three ways to learn the right lessons from 2020 and press forward into 2021:\n\n1. Reimagine Where You're Going\n\nDisruptions have a way of shattering the picture of the future we dreamt up in our minds.\n\nGiven the new realities created by 2020, you need to reimagine your future destination.\n\nIt's like using a navigation app on your phone. You have to plug in the destination first.\n\nOnce you do, the app can show you several good ways to get there. But if you don't know where you're going, you're going to end up somewhere else entirely.\n\nWhere was your life headed in January of last year? Given all that's happened, is that still where you should be going?\n\nHere's an exercise you could try for determining your life purpose.\n\nFirst, brainstorm to discover what things you're most passionate about.\n\nSecond, make an inventory of what special gifts God has given you.\n\nCombine these together to give yourself a brief purpose statement: My reason for existing is to ___________. Then, let this guide you into 2021 and beyond.\n\n2. Reevaluate How You'll Get There\n\nOnce you know your purpose, then you need to figure out how best to get there. You have to go to the right place in the right way.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSometimes we settle on a good destination, but then we veer off course. It's like taking a wrong turn and hearing the navigation app on your phone say recalculating, recalculating as you pass the exit you were supposed to take.\n\nBe honest with yourself and look at the pattern of your life: Were you always pursuing your goals with integrity?\n\nWere you keeping the right balance between work and your responsibilities to your family, your neighbors, and your church?\n\nWere you using your resources to help others in the best way you could?\n\n3. Reconnect with Your Maker\n\nSolomon, the wisest person to ever live, wrote this at the end of his life, Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth, before the evil days come and the years draw near of which you will say, 'I have no pleasure in them' (Ecclesiastes 12:1).\n\nMost of the time we ignore death. But 2020 made this impossible.\n\nAt some point or another, I think we all had to face the fact that we could die and that we will eventually die.\n\nBecause this is true, Solomon says, we shouldn't wait to ask whether we're right with our Maker.\n\nAs you begin this new year, reconnect to your Creator and find lasting joy and contentment in him right now.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis will reorient your life around what truly matters and give you a peace that no pandemic can ever take away.\n\nLet 2021 be a year full of hope, when you can move forward into an uncertain future with the certain knowledge that God loves you, cares for you, and offers you a destination worth pursuing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM DR.

Automakers love a good tease, but sooner or later they have to give up the goods. Here are four highly-anticipated models that should come out from behind the curtain in 2019.\n\nMID-ENGINE CHEVROLET 'CORVETTE'\n\nChevy has been toying with the idea of a mid-engine Corvette for over a half-century, and it's finally happening. Maybe. The company hasn't confirmed it's even working on one, but prototypes have been caught testing on public roads and there have been a number of trademarks and patents filed recently that are related to it. But is it a Corvette, or an all-new model? Only time will tell, and it may take some more of it. Rumor has it the project's debut has been delayed again due to development issues.\n\nFORD BRONCO\n\nThe Ford Ranger is returning to showrooms this year and a new Ford Bronco based on it isn't far behind. Ford hasn't released all of the details on the rugged SUV, but an official image of one hidden under a sheet promises a boxy body in the spirit of the original. A second image leaked from a secret dealer showing of a new small SUV that appears to be casting a shadow of the Bronco backs this up.\n\nJEEP WAGONEER\n\nJeep has been working on a new Wagoneer for years, but it went back to the drawing board not long ago to change it from a crossover to a body-on-frame truck like the Ford Expedition and Chevrolet Tahoe. Having pulled the wraps off of the latest Wrangler and Gladiator pickups at the Los Angeles Auto Shows of the past two years, don't be surprised to see it make a grand entrance in La La Land this November.\n\nTESLA MODEL Y\n\nTesla bucked the market trend away from sedans with strong sales of its Model 3 compact, but it knows where things are heading and plans to follow it up with a small SUV called the Model Y, completing a S3XY lineup of electric cars. A shadowy rendering heralds its expected reveal around the Ides of March.\n\nWHICH ONE ARE YOU MOST EXCITED ABOUT? LET FOX NEWS AUTOS KNOW ON FACEBOOK
Keeping hard working men and women employed is a serious challenge today. Competition is vicious and it seems like every day there is a new regulation or proposed legislation that will make our investment even more risky. No private business person I know is very optimistic. The perception of our current government in the eyes of businessmen and women is simply this: The government is against us. Leading the charge against American business is the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).\n\nThe latest assault comes in the form of a workplace election rule change that would shrink election windows, giving people only ten days to learn everything they need to know about unionizing before voting. The proposed rule change is profoundly disrespectful to the people that it would affect: workers around the country. It shows no respect for their intelligence or their judgment. It is unfair to make it virtually impossible for an employer to present the other side of the organizer's pitch. How can anyone in good conscience take away the opportunity to discover the truth and weigh their options from someone? How many doctors have to take their MCATs as freshmen in college? It seems reasonable because it would deprive the participant of important information. Why would you deny the same level of respect to workers during an organizing drive?\n\nThere have been numerous decisions by this Board that highlight hazards for unsuspecting workers. This Board allows organizers to exaggerate and make promises which have no weight during negotiations. For example, in Wolfrich Corporation, dba Thrifty Rent-A-Car, 234 N.L.R.B. 525, this Board permits organizers to tell workers they can make more money, even if that is not necessarily true, because employees generally understand that a union cannot automatically obtain benefits by winning an election, but must attempt to achieve them through the collective-bargaining process. Furthermore, in Coach & Equipment Sales Corp; 228 NLRB 441 the Board asserted that: [C]ollective bargaining is potentially hazardous for employees and that as a result of such negotiations employees might possibly wind up with less benefits after unionization than before. Is it remotely reasonable to expect every person to know such things?\n\nChanging one's working conditions is a matter of upmost significance, affecting their immediate and long term future. Such a decision is more personal and important than any political election, yet we expect extended political campaigns where both sides make their case. A politician would show profound disrespect to voters if they were to stand for election without campaigning.\n\nThe small employer is nearly hamstrung at the start even if they are aware of an organizing effort. Many employers are not aware of the effort until the organizer presents their cards. Most small businesses do not retain employment counsel. In fact, until the recent headlines, I doubt many small employers had even heard of the NLRB.\n\nWith all of the challenges in the current economy, it is unreasonable to expect an employer to drop everything and then respond in the potential time frame contemplated by this rule.\n\nCertainly any Board charged with guaranteeing workplace rights should be guaranteeing that those workers are shown the proper respect. That respect is demonstrated by ensuring that both sides of an argument that is so important to their working lives are given ample opportunity to be heard and understood. Under Section 8(c) of the National Labor Relations Act, an employer's right of free speech is protected, but this proposed rule change undermines that right. What good is a right if there is no practical way to assert it? This Board should not adopt this rule.\n\nBrett McMahon is Vice President of Miller & Long Concrete Construction and spokesperson for the Halt the Assault Campaign.
EXCLUSIVE: Actress Dolores Hart, who was once hailed as the next Grace Kelly, gave Elvis Presley his first on-screen kiss and worked alongside leading men like Montgomery Clift, Anthony Quinn and Marlon Brando -- just to name a few.\n\nBut in 1962 she left Hollywood behind and became a nun.\n\nIn 2016, the former star, now known as Mother Dolores Hart, celebrated 50 years of vowed life at the Abbey of Regina Laudis, an enclosed Benedictine monastery and working farm in Bethlehem, Conn. The now-82-year-old previously released a memoir titled The Ear of the Heart: An Actress' Journey from Hollywood to Holy Vows, where she detailed her surprising journey.\n\nHer story was also the subject of an Oscar-nominated short film on HBO, titled God Is the Bigger Elvis, released in 2012. Today, Hart receives hundreds of letters from people across the country seeking guidance on having a closer relationship with God.\n\nINGRID BERGMAN'S GRANDSON RECALLS GROWING UP WITH THE 'CASABLANCA' STAR, HOW SHE ENDURED ROMANTIC SCANDAL\n\nHart spoke to Fox News about bonding with Presley on set, ending her engagement and how she feels about Hollywood today.\n\nFox News: What was your initial impression of Elvis Presley?\n\nMother Dolores Hart: To be honest, I did not know who he was. In fact, when I first met him, I asked him what he did. I remember him being very courteous. He was an absolute gentleman and would call me Miss Dolores. And then I learned what a talented singer he was. By the time we did our second film, we couldn't walk down the street because there were so many people waiting for him, just wanting to touch him.\n\nI remember one moment when we were taking a break from filming. He walked over to me, handed me a Bible, and said, Miss Dolores, would you open this book? What do you see? What does it mean to you? And so, I offered my opinion on what I was seeing. And from there, we spent the time in between the scenes talking about the Bible. I never expected a fellow actor, in particular, to have that kind of genuine curiosity. He wasn't trying to set up anything. There were no flashbulbs around to take pictures of us. He did it because it was in his heart.\n\nFox News: Is it true you made Elvis Presley blush on set?\n\nHart: Well, it's true *laughs*. We both had to do a kissing scene, for [1957's] Loving You, which is a riot in itself. It's the last scene of the film, but when you walk in on set, you're told, This is the first thing you're going to do. I remember I had to put my arms around him and kiss him. There were about 100 people on the soundstage. Seconds into it, the director, Hal Kanter, yells Cut! I thought, Oh no, how can I kiss wrong?\n\n'GILLIGAN'S ISLAND' STAR TINA LOUISE PAYS TRIBUTE TO DAWN WELLS\n\nHe immediately asks for the makeup man to come over to fix me up. I thought, What's going on? That's it, it's over for me. Well, Hal tells me, Dolores, you're blushing in your ears. They're red. We need makeup. I was so embarrassed. After they fixed me up, we started again. And again, seconds later, he yells Cut! Get some makeup for Mister Presley! When I looked, he was red! But that's the way it was. We were just a couple of kids. But he was a simple and true man.\n\nFox News: Looking back, why did you leave Hollywood?\n\nHart: I think it's important for anyone to understand that it was a dramatic change. It wasn't something I planned on. I thought I would go through my time in Hollywood. However, this vocation showed me my life's purpose. Then I started to ask myself, What am I doing in Hollywood? Where is this going to take me? The realization became clear and really, it's a gift. I was so lucky. God called me.\n\nFox News: How did you discover the Abbey of Regina Laudis?\n\nHart: I was actually doing a show at the time, but the demands of the stage really became exhausting. It was a friend who suggested that I should take a few days to rest at the Abbey of Regina Laudis. It was supposed to be a welcoming retreat from New York where I could reflect on what was going to be the next step in my career.\n\nBut I wasn't expecting just how peaceful it truly was. I found inner certitude. I felt like this is where I belonged. It became more than just a retreat. It's the kind of feeling you get when you meet the person you're going to marry. The more I came to visit the more it came calling to me. And the more I knew God was present to me in a very special way that I couldn't deny.\n\nDEAN MARTIN'S DAUGHTER DEANA SAYS SHE STILL FEELS RAT PACK STAR'S PRESENCE: 'HE IS WITH ME ALL THE TIME'\n\nFox News: You were engaged to Don Robinson. Where did you find the courage to walk away and embark on the journey you're in now?\n\nHart: You're right, Don and I were engaged. I had a concern that somehow I wasn't sure [about the engagement]… He was a beautiful guy and a real gentleman too. He was also an architect and built houses. I remembered as soon as he asked me to marry him, he found the place that he wanted us to live. I said, Don, we're going too fast.\n\nThen Edith Head, who was a very important woman in show business at the time who did fashion designs for everyone, she called me one day. Edith said she found this wedding dress that she thought would be perfect for me. I tried to explain that I wasn't quite ready, but the next thing I knew, the dress was featured in this magazine with my name tagged onto it. Throughout this whole time, I was worried. I just felt this wasn't right for me.\n\nFox News: You broke off your engagement and by the end of 1962, you headed to Connecticut...you never returned back to Hollywood, and became a nun.\n\nHart: The time came when I knew this was not it. I felt it in my heart that this was not my path. I remember I was on a lunch date with Don. That's when I said, Don, I just have to tell you. I cannot say yes to this. He stood up from the table and yelled No! And of course, everyone at the restaurant looked at us. I looked at him and said, Don, I'm telling you the truth. I really love you, but not in the way that you want.\n\nThen I told him what I really wanted to do with my life. God was calling me and I felt it in my heart that I needed to answer. He then looked at me and said, I've known it. I know this is what you want. I'm going to help you. I promise you that I will.\n\n'WALTONS' STAR RICHARD THOMAS REFLECTS ON WORKING WITH LATE TV DAD RALPH WAITE: 'WE REALLY BONDED'\n\nThe first year I entered the Abbey, Don went to Hawaii. I thought, Well, that's goodbye. I will never hear from him again. I was wrong. Don came to visit me. And up until the day he died [in 2011] he came to the Abbey at least once a year to help in any way he could, to work in areas that would be acceptable. And he never married. I remember he once told me, Every love doesn't have to wind up at the altar. I believe Don is now with the Lord.\n\nFox News: How do you feel about Hollywood today?\n\nHart: I think Hollywood belonged to our time as a way for young people to find an identity, to feel a sense of importance, a sense of being, a sense of belonging. I think every generation has to go through their own experience in order to find themselves, to find God. I think Hollywood today belongs to the generations that are asking those very same questions, that yearning of finding their place in the world.\n\nI'm so delighted to see how many people of color have found a very prestigious place in Hollywood. This never happened in the '40s or '50s… Now there's an opportunity for people of color to be properly represented. I think there's an opportunity to do good in Hollywood.\n\nFox News: What advice would you give to someone who wants to connect with God, but doesn't know where to begin?\n\nHart: To find God is to find love. To understand God is to understand love… People write to me every day about their problems and how they're experiencing loss. We all have this beautiful need to find love and God is that. I take my letters very seriously and I never let anyone go without a response that's appropriate and true to their lives.\n\nAUDREY HEPBURN'S SON ON HOW SHE COPED WITH CHILDHOOD FAMINE DURING WWII: 'HER DREAMS KEPT HER GOING'\n\nI think we all need to walk down that path of self-discovery and truly understanding our purpose. And part of doing that is coming together and sharing our experiences, both the joyful and sorrowful ones. And I truly believe it's never too late. In all of my letters, I offer gratitude and prayer so that each individual can embark on their own personal journeys.

'What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,' he said Friday afternoon, surrounded by law enforcement officials at a White House roundtable. 'I'm not going to do it so fast.' The president has defiantly said for days he might declare a national emergency to expedite construction of the wall — and his administration has asked agencies to begin preparations. But he has gotten sharp pushback, even from Republicans, at the notion of declaring such an emergency. His lawyers have privately warned that he could be on shaky footing with such a move, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\n\n\nShutdown woes pile up as stoppage approaches longest in history - Fox News: The impact of the partial government shutdown intensified on Friday, as hundreds of thousands of federal workers missed their first paychecks since the funding lapse last month -- a situation putting rising pressure on Congress and the White House to reach an agreement to re-open shuttered agencies. … Most workers were issued their last paycheck two weeks ago, and it is unclear if and when they will receive the next. Some federal workers have had to apply for unemployment benefits and take out loans to stay afloat; while others have had to cancel trips and scale back spending in other ways. Statistics provided by the Department of Labor showed that 4,760 federal employees filed for unemployment benefits in the last week of December, an increase of 3,831 from the 929 who applied the week before.\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans start cracking - Roll Call: The number of House Republicans supporting Democrats' bills to reopen the government increased slightly on Thursday. On Thursday, the House voted 244-180 to pass a Transportation, and Housing and Urban Development spending bill and 243-183 to pass an Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal 2019. The votes come after the House passed a Financial Services spending bill on Wednesday. A vote on an Interior-Environment appropriations bill is planned for Friday. The Senate has no plans to hold a vote on any of the bills.\n\n\n\nInscrutable as ever, McConnell holds cards close - McClatchy: Mitch McConnell, uncharacteristically absent from deliberations as the shutdown approached the three-week mark, suddenly emerged as a player Thursday. But only for a few hours… McConnell had hosted a group of GOP senators in his office Thursday morning to discuss a compromise to break the impasse, but the White House quickly rejected the proposal. … McConnell … [spoke] on the phone with Trump, who agreed to legislation guaranteeing furloughed government employees would be compensated 'to ease their anxiety' as the shutdown continues. The partial shutdown is due to reach its 21st day Friday, tying the record set in 1996. What's not known is whether McConnell will gather members into his office again to discuss strategies or do as he's done the past three weeks, which is eviscerate Democrats on the Senate floor for refusing to give Trump $5.7 billion for his border wall and otherwise wait for Democrats and Trump to broker a deal.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: SO YOU GOTTA ACKRITE\n\nIn a monarchy [good behavior] is an excellent barrier to the despotism of the prince; in a republic it is a no less excellent barrier to the encroachments and oppressions of the representative body. – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 78\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: NO FOG ON THE MOUNTAIN TODAY\n\nTime: Google honored banjo-picking bluegrass legend Earl Scruggs with its Google Doodle on Friday. Scruggs, who pioneered a musical style known as the 'Scruggs style' which became integral to bluegrass, died in 2012 at age 88. The animated Doodle shows off Scruggs' fingerpicking playing style. Google's Doodle was timed to celebrate the anniversary of the 2014 opening of the Earl Scruggs Center in Shelby, N.C. The Scruggs Center is dedicated to celebrating Scuggs' life and helping to educate people about the North Carolina musical traditions that gave rise to Scruggs' talent. Scruggs' son, Gary, told Google: 'Even though my father, Earl Scruggs, passed away before the Earl Scruggs Center opened, he was involved in its planning stages. It was important for him that the Earl Scruggs Center would serve as more than a museum displaying interesting artifacts and memorabilia, but as an educational facility as well.'\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 42 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 53.4 percent\n\nNet Score: -11.4 points\n\nChange from one week ago: unchanged\n\n[Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 52% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 52% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nBROWN OUT TO IOWA\n\nPolitico: Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is preparing the biggest step yet toward a potential presidential campaign: a trip to Iowa in the coming weeks, which is in the final stages of planning and will soon be announced, according to four people with knowledge of the trip. Going to Iowa would be the latest signal from Brown and his wife, Connie Schultz, that he is considering a White House run organized around the 'dignity of work,' the theme of his reelection campaign last year. But preparations go beyond public statements as Brown's longtime aide and current chief of staff, Sarah Benzing works backstage to set up a campaign — with a particular focus on Iowa, where she grew up and worked on a series of congressional, Senate and presidential efforts earlier in her career. … And she has spent the weeks since Brown's reelection to the Senate … calling her Iowa network, seeking advice and operatives to staff a Brown presidential bid.\n\n\n\nGillibrand looks for upstate cred with campaign headquarters - [Albany] Times Union: Campaign representatives for Democratic U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand signed a lease for a 5,000 square foot space in downtown Troy, according to a local Democratic operative — a sign the recently re-elected Albany native could be basing a presidential campaign in the Capital Region. It was unclear which building the space is located in, and Gillibrand, who lives in the Troy suburb of Brunswick, has not officially announced she would run in the 2020 presidential race. But a Troy-based headquarters would be a nod to Gillibrand's familial roots in the area, which she represented in Congress before winning a Senate seat in 2010.\n\n\n\nInslee faces grumbling at home about his possible run - The Spokesman Review: Despite adding trips to New Hampshire and Nevada to his January schedule, Gov. Jay Inslee pushed back Thursday against suggestions he won't have his full attention on Washington when the Legislature starts next Monday. 'I have a fantastic story to tell, and that's the story of Washington state,' Inslee said of his plans to speak at events around the country. He hasn't officially announced a run, but is exploring adding his name to a growing pool seeking the Democratic nomination. This weekend he will be the keynote speaker to a conference of progressive activists in Nevada. On Jan. 22, he will talk about fighting climate change to two colleges in New Hampshire. He has registered a political action committee, the Vision PAC, with the Federal Election Committee and started accepting contributions.\n\n\n\nWhich Republicans might run against Trump in 2020? Too soon to say - WashEx: Renegade Republicans intent on upending President Trump in 2020 are keeping their powder dry, waiting to see if legal and political controversies drive him from office first. …Republicans who oppose Trump's re-election are eyeing June as the approximate moment for deciding on a primary challenge or independent bid. It's a strategic delay. Some Republicans think the weight of multiple investigations could motivate the president to exit the White House after one term — especially if special counsel Robert Mueller issues a politically damaging report. … The Republicans most often listed as possible Trump challengers are outgoing Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who ran in 2016; Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska, who is up for re-election next year; Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah … Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan; and former Sens. Bob Corker of Tennessee and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who sources say are unlikely to run.\n\n\n\nManchin considering returning to W.Va. for gubernatorial run - W. Va. Metro News: U.S. Senator Joe Manchin is once again considering running for Governor of West Virginia, according to several people who are familiar with the Senator's thinking. When asked Friday about his interest in the governor's race, Manchin fired a shot across [Jim] Justice's bow. 'The state of West Virginia deserves and needs a full-time governor,' he said. Manchin is already getting calls about 2020, some from Democrats who themselves are thinking about running for Governor and want to know his plans and some from West Virginians encouraging him to run. Also, he could run for Governor while continuing to serve in the Senate. … [T]he idea keeps surfacing and the dynamism of the legislative session that just started in Charleston is far more appealing to him than the protracted partial shutdown that's now gripping Washington.\n\n\n\nHOUSE GOP LEADERS, IOWA GOVERNOR SHUN KING\n\nWaPo: House Republican leaders on Thursday stepped forward to criticize Rep. Steve King for defending white nationalism... King, who won a ninth term in Congress in November, lamented in an interview with the New York Times that the term had become a pejorative one. 'White nationalist, white supremacist, Western civilization — how did that language become offensive?' King said in the interview, which was published Thursday. King later issued a statement in which he sought to walk back his remarks. He said he rejects 'those labels and the evil ideology that they define' and proclaimed himself 'simply a Nationalist.' … And Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), who backed King during the last campaign and appeared with him on the campaign trail, has said she will not endorse him this time, telling an NBC affiliate in Des Moines that 'the last election was a wake-up call for it to be that close.'\n\n\n\nGINSBURG TO MISS NEXT WEEK'S SUPCO SESSIONS\n\nFox News: Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg will miss next week's court sessions and work from home, but her recovery from early-stage lung cancer surgery remains 'on track' and no further treatment is needed, the court announced Friday. … 'Post-surgery evaluation indicates no evidence of remaining disease, and no further treatment is required,' [Supreme Court public information officer Kathy Arberg said in a statement]. The 85-year-old's absence this week from oral arguments -- her first since joining the bench -- after her surgery in December sparked speculation about a possible departure, and even led to low-key planning by the White House for that scenario. Sources confirmed to Fox News that the White House has quietly reached out to a small number of GOP lawmakers and conservative legal advocates, reassuring them it would be ready for any court vacancy.\n\n\n\nBarr looks to assuage Senate Dems' Mueller worries - WaPo: Attorney general nominee William P. Barr tried Thursday to assuage Senate Democrats' concerns he might be too biased to oversee the special counsel's Russia probe, but lawmakers said they would need to hear his answers under oath before they could consider backing his nomination. … Barr has been facing questions from Democrats and Republicans about his previous statements regarding Mueller's probe, particularly a 2018 memo blasting Mueller for examining whether Trump attempted to obstruct justice in his decision to fire James B. Comey from his post as FBI director. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), another committee member, said that during his meeting with Barr, he asked the nominee to prepare before Tuesday 'a complete, thorough and accurate description of what led to his Mueller memo.'\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nPergram: 'Democrats and many Republicans will explode if Trump bypasses Congress with emergency order' - Fox News\n\n\n\nFed chair Powell predicts economy will not plunge into a recession in 2019 - WaPo\n\n\n\nU.S. begins withdrawing troops from Syria - NYT\n\n\n\nExclusive: Pompeo announces international summit on Iran - Fox News\n\n\n\nAUDIBLE: IF YOU'VE GOT THE TIME, HE'S GOT THE BEER\n\nIt's Friday, too. – Freshman Congressman Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., who was prevented from taking a six-pack of beer onto the House floor.\n\n\n\nANY GIVEN SUNDAY\n\nThis weekend Mr. Sunday will sit down with Sen.

Watch #mediabuzz Sundays at 11 a.m. ET.\n\n\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\nIn the past, I have assailed you with modest proposals to which you have responded that you are far more optimistic than I about America's public institutions and future. However, in your latest missive, I sense a growing cynicism or perhaps a new assessment regarding where America is heading: 'Like many great civilizations before us, America is slouching toward authoritarianism. Democracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason.' I think you are correct as far as you have gone. What you seem unaware of or unwilling to recognize is that, even though the sample of democracies is perhaps too small to draw a conclusion, 'voters' appear to get what they collectively want, have worked hard to get, and/or deserve in some inexplicable way from their leaders. – Eric Hutchins, Santa Barbara, Calif.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: I guess I must have gotten a little too crabby sounding about our pitiful Congress, Mr. Hutchins! I remain highly optimistic about our future. Not to be too self-promotional but the book I wrote last year was about that very idea. We have had much closer brushes with authoritarianism in our past. We have also had periods of much deeper chaos, including a period between the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 and the American defeat in Vietnam in 1975. It has been worse before and in the not too distant past. We can do this and I believe the current trials and tribulations will result, as they did before, in a renewal of our commitment to republicanism and democracy.]\n\n\n\nDear Sir, As an ever-increasingly frustrated member of the sane middle, your commentary regarding the president's ability to declare an emergency and Congress's sudden abhorrence of the power they gave him hit all my sweet spots. But what do you think the chances are that: A) Republicans will denounce it if it happens? B) Democrats who denounce it if it happens will, in turn, denounce it if their future president attempts it? I suspect the answer to both is nil. – Jeffrey L. Greek, Jacksonville, Fla.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: I tend to disagree, Mr. Greek. I think there are lots of Republicans in Congress who would come hard against the president for such a broad overreach of executive power. And I think that goes for Democrats in the future. Whatever one thinks of our current political moment, there is no doubt that we are awake and alive to the possibility of darker, weirder things that could lay ahead.]\n\n\n\nThanks for your comments on the current 'emergency,' but I think that your analysis is a bit off. While it may seem true that '[d]emocracies tend toward kingship in almost every case since charismatic leaders and demagogues are so successful at deceiving voters by appealing to emotion rather than reason,' in fact, as the end of the Roman Republic shows, such a tendency occurs when the legislative body (e.g., the Senate) abdicates its power—which it need not do. Today, we see our legislative branch interested in everything except legislating—which activity the executive and judicial branches are happy to take up. Puzzling and heartbreaking. – Jim Voelz, Fort Wayne, Ind.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: So why is it that you think that legislative bodies advocate their powers? Voters preference for authoritarianism. Liberal democracy of our kind is messy, complicated and asks a great deal of citizens. Dictators ask much less of the governed, at least until they start the long, inevitable march toward oppression. Congress has not devolved its powers irrationally. It's hard to get re-elected if you address difficult questions. It's hard to raise money from powerful interests if you are independent and honest. Ceding issues that are likely to upset primary voters and donors to the other two branches takes the pressure off. The rise of authoritarianism logically follows. I'd submit the two are closely correlated.]\n\n\n\nDo not forget Abe Lincoln. He confiscated funds designated for another expenditure to use for war preparations without Congress' consent. He suspended habeas corpus without the consent of Congress. He signed an arrest warrant for Chief Justice Roger Taney because Justice Taney told him he could not suspend habeas corpus without the consent of Congress. The U. S. Marshall refused to serve it. Lincoln ordered the arrest of members of the Maryland legislature suspected of being southern sympathizers. He sent troops to arrest Missouri's legislators. He summoned the state militias without consent of Congress that resulted in the secession of Virginia, Tennessee and North Carolina. He arrested 13,000 without ever charging them. He sent federal troops fresh off the battlefield at Gettysburg to quell the riots of the Irish in New York City shooting them down in the streets. Before we talk of Wilson, Roosevelt, Nixon or Trump, discuss the originator of the empirical presidency. Of course, you can say that was a real emergency. It was, but he could have called a special session of Congress like Roosevelt did after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, but he did not. – Bill Billips, Palm Harbor, Fla.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: I will not nitpick your condemnatory descriptions of Lincoln's extra-constitutional activities as president. I take your basic point that he did exceed the boundaries of presidential authority, even in the creation of my home state of West Virginia. But suggesting that somehow Lincoln did not work through Congress in prosecuting the Civil War or that he lacked congressional authorization goes too far. I would also point out that the Constitution explicitly grants the president special powers in a time of domestic insurrection. There are many who seek to diminish Lincoln's legacy by casting him as some sort of despot, but that tends to either be sour grapes among still-unreconstructed Southerners or hot take aficionados. Lincoln's love for the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence is evident. When he was visited by a delegation of powerful American leaders who had participated in a peace conference in Washington prior to his inauguration, Lincoln was urged to accommodate the demands of the secessionists. As described by one who was there, Lincoln calmly, clearly told the men lecturing him: I will, to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. … It is not the Constitution as I would like to have it, but as it is, that is to be defended. The Constitution will not be preserved and defended until it is enforced and obeyed in every part of every one of the United States. It must be so respected, obeyed, enforced and defended, and let the grass grow where it may. And that was an 1861 version of a mic drop.]\n\n\n\nI thought when my children matured that I was through with childishness; but now I am witness to the most disgustingly childish behavior imaginable. (Modesty forbids me describing what I really think of all 535 of them.) If ever there was a valid argument for term limits this is it. Misfeasance, malfeasance, and nonfeasance. How can they be brought to trial? – Dick Carden, Richmond, Va.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: It is said that pain is the touchstone of all spiritual growth, and I think that applies to political reform as well. Perhaps we have not yet hurt badly, deeply or long enough to be ready to embrace substantive changes to our system. Issue-based arguments are becoming increasingly fruitless because the larger mechanisms that make up our constitutional process are breaking down. There is a time coming, I believe, when people across the political spectrum will embrace the concept of systemic reform rather than narrow ideological combat.]\n\n\n\nQuick question for you: How did Nancy Pelosi manage to get herself elected Speaker of the House once again? My understanding is/was that you need to receive a majority to win … 218 votes of the 435 total; but I caught part of a report on the radio wherein a pundit was stating (I think) that she received less than 218 and even had to have some Reps abstain from voting in order to have enough votes to win. Is this true? Can you win with less than 218? And if so, exactly how close was her 'by the skin of her teeth' victory anyway? – Bob Nelson, Norwell, Mass.\n\n\n\n[Ed. note: Good question, Mr. Nelson. You don't need any particular number to win the speakership, you just need a majority of the entire House. That number was not 218 this time because of some vacancies. Pelosi did lose some Democratic support. Fifteen members of the Blue Team did not vote for her. She ended up getting 220 votes, winning with three to spare.]\n\n\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\n\n\nDEPUTY POTEMKIN REPORTING FOR DUTY\n\nUPI: A Texas sheriff is taking on speeders in his county by placing cardboard cutouts of deputies next to roads rife with lead-footed drivers. Williamson County Sheriff Robert Chody tweeted a video showing one of the cutouts, which he said depicts one of the department's real-life deputies, giving the appearance of a police presence next to a road in the Fern Bluff neighborhood of Brushy Creek. 'It's a creative way to solve a problem without really working the problem,' Chody told KTCB-TV. Chody said the cutouts, which depict the deputy pointing a speed-measuring radar device at the road, look like a real deputy at first glance. … He said the department tested out the cardboard deputies by placing them near school zones, with real deputies waiting nearby to observe the results.

LeBron James called a prosecutor's decision not to file charges against a white police officer who shot a Black man in Wisconsin this summer a blow to the heart and to the gut.\n\nBack in Wisconsin, the Marquette men's basketball team wore black uniforms to protest the decision, and the NBA's Milwaukee Bucks said they plan to continue pushing for policy changes in law enforcement.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nJacob Blake, who is Black, was left paralyzed after being shot in the back on Aug. 23 by Kenosha police officer Rusten Sheskey, who is white.\n\nThe Bucks — who share Fiserv Forum with Marquette about 40 miles north of Kenosha — sat out an August first-round playoff game to protest the shooting. That led the NBA to postpone all games that day, and player-driven protests also led to postponements in the WNBA and Major League Baseball.\n\nI'm smart enough to know that even though we are playing a game of basketball that there's so much more going on in the world, James said Tuesday after his Los Angeles Lakers beat the Memphis Grizzlies 94-92. So much more that's even more important than us playing a game. To hear what happened in Kenosha today was a blow to the heart and to the gut, not only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process, seeing these outcomes for so long.\n\nKenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced Tuesday that no charges would be filed because he couldn't disprove Sheskey's contention that he acted in self-defense out of fear that Blake would stab him.\n\nIt keeps happening. It's sad, Los Angeles Clippers star Kawhi Leonard said. Hopefully, in the future, we can get these guys to stop releasing fire on us. We got to change the people that are in the uniform.\n\nMarquette played its scheduled game Tuesday against UConn but said it was wearing black uniforms in support of Jacob Blake, his family and the Kenosha community in reaction the announcement earlier today.\n\nWe were going to wear the black uniforms regardless of the situation, whether (Sheskey) got charged or not, Marquette guard Koby McEwen said after the Golden Eagles' 65-54 loss. If he got charged, it was in support of it. If justice wasn't served, it was in protest of (the decision).\n\nMarquette also issued a statement on the men's basketball program's Twitter account.\n\nWe are extremely disappointed in the decision involving Jacob's shooting and we will continue to use our platform to advocate and fight for racial justice,  the statement said. This is another reminder that just because racial and social injustice hasn't received as much attention recently, doesn't mean the need to fight against it has gone away.\n\nAdded coach Steve Wojciechowski: Our guys obviously have been impacted by the events all around our country, but especially the Jacob Blake situation. They feel very passionate about it and they wanted to come together and make a statement.\n\nThe Bucks, who weren't playing Tuesday, issued a statement regarding their stand against excessive force by police without commenting specifically on Graveley's decision.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Bucks organization remains firmly against excessive use of force by law enforcement, the Bucks said. This past year shed light on the ongoing racial injustices facing our African American and other marginalized communities. Reoccurring instances of excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging the Black community must stop.\n\nWe will continue to work to enact policy change so these incidents no longer exist. As an organization, we remain strongly committed to address issues of social injustice and anti-racism and to make meaningful change for African Americans and all marginalized members of our community.\n\nLos Angeles Lakers guard Wesley Matthews played for the Bucks last season. He went to high school in Madison, Wisconsin, and later played for Marquette.\n\nIt really is disheartening, Matthews said of the decision. But leaders have to be leaders and everybody has to take ownership for their own community.\n\nJames said players will maintain their efforts on behalf of social justice.\n\nWe've got to continue to stay strong continue to believe in each other and continue to push for the greater change and the greater good, James said.
It is not without a bit of irony that, in the 40 years since the explosion of the Watergate story, Bob Woodward would again be under attack from the White House for trying to tell the truth. But this time the attack is coming from a Democrat.\n\nWhile Barack Obama may not share the Nixon pedigree, he and his White House are the closest thing to the Nixon regime of any that we have seen since then -- both in the extent of their paranoia and their willingness to suppress the truth and push the boundaries of law.\n\nIn my lifetime, in over 40 years in national politics, Mr. Obama is the only president who comes close to rivaling Richard Nixon for fundamental disingenuousness.\n\n[pullquote]\n\nHowever, some things never change, just as Woodward and Bernstein were attacked then by the establishment mainstream media for daring to question a president -- or do a story that they wouldn't touch -- they are once again attacking Woodward the way they did when he and Carl Bernstein pursued Watergate.\n\nAs the youngest person on Nixon's enemies list in 1972, I am particularly sensitive to a White House where they have utter disregard for trampling on dissent and on the rights of individuals.\n\nSince Benghazi, when I raised the alarm about a media that was not only willing to blatantly support one political party or one political a candidate but for the first time seemed willing to suppress or ignore the facts and truth as related to a disaster of American foreign policy, my fear has been that we are now on a slippery slope. Almost everything since then has helped to realize that fear. Chuck Hagel, the sequester, Mr. Obama's speeches -- all of these have revealed a mainstream press that has absolutely decided to wear its bias openly as outriders of the Obama administration. Except for one issue -- when the president refused to allow reporters to cover him and Tiger Woods playing golf together. Now that's something they can get riled up about.\n\nWhat this Woodward, White House sequester battle highlights is the crisis in our democracy. Not so much for what it says about Mr. Obama and his administration but for what it says about the establishment press and all the members of my own party.\n\nDuring Watergate, there were a number of Republicans who were willing to stand against the president of their party in defense of the United States of America.\n\nSadly, as as Democrat, I must confess, that today there is no Democratic Senator or member of the House who appears to be willing to publicly put the country ahead of Barack Obama's White House.\n\nAs important as these other issues are, however, nothing rivals Benghazi.\n\nDuring the Chuck Hagel confirmation fight, it was revealed that to this day, neither the public nor the Congress know the names of those who were evacuated out of Benghazi. Nor have we ever seen the transcripts of the interviews which were conducted immediately after the event.\n\nThe White House's excuse, that this information cannot be revealed because of an FBI investigation, is eerily and frighteningly similar to Nixon telling H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman to turn off the Watergate investigation as it threatened national security.\n\nSadly, it now appears that Director Mueller and the FBI are willing to serve, once again, as an instrument of cover up for an administration -- this time following a tragedy in which 4 Americans are now dead.\n\nAs much as I have always admired Bob Woodward and admire now him in the sequester fight and for his willingness to take on the White House, I cannot refrain from expressing my disappointment that this man, who did such a service for the country 40 years ago, has essentially taken himself off the boards of the Benghazi fiasco. I wish that if Woodward were to get in a fight, he would do it on an issue that really matters to the safety of the United States.
One person was killed and two others injured in a shooting outside a Queens hotel Friday morning, marking the first homicide of 2020, cops said.\n\nThe shooting took place at the Umbrella Hotel in Kew Gardens around 1:10 a.m., police said.\n\nThree males — two of whom are 20 years old, and a third 40-year-old man — were struck by gunfire during a gathering outside the building.\n\nNEW YEAR'S EVE IN TIMES SQUARE RINGS IN 2021 WITHOUT THE PARTY CROWD\n\nBoth 20-year-olds were taken to the Queens Hospital Center, where one was pronounced dead and the other is listed in stable condition.\n\nThe older victim was taken to Jamaica Hospital Medical Center, where he is listed in critical condition.\n\nNYC TEEN CHARGED IN CONNECTION TO BIKE GANG BMW ATTACK RAILS AGAINST ALLEGATION\n\nPolice believe there was one shooter, who remained at large later Friday morning.\n\nThe hotel, across from Queens Borough Hall, briefly served as a city-run emergency shelter for homeless families after its initial opening, The Queens Chronicle reported.\n\nThey should shut it down, area resident Richard Rogers, 52, told the Post. There is too much going on there. There have been shootings, domestic fights….. And, the court is across the street!\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIf they don't shut it down, it's going to continue to cause serious problems for the neighborhood, he added. Being I've heard of other incidents there, I'm not surprised this happened. It was just a matter of time before someone got killed. This person barely lived to see 2021.\n\nThis report originally appeared in the New York Post.
A group of GOP senators led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, will object to the Jan. 6 certification of the presidential election results next week unless there is an emergency 10-day audit of the results by an electoral commission.\n\nCruz and the other senators claim the Nov. 3 election featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud and illegal conduct.\n\nJoining Cruz are Sens. Ron Johnson, R-Wis.; James Lankford, R-Okla.; Steve Daines, R-Mont.; John Kennedy, R-La.; Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., and Mike Braun, R-Ind.; as well as Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo.; Roger Marshall, R-Kansas; Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., and Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala.\n\nTheir effort is separate from one announced by Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who said this week that he will object to what he claims was the failure of some states -- most notably Pennsylvania -- to follow their own election laws.\n\nHAWLEY SAYS HE'LL OBJECT TO ELECTORAL COLLEGE CERTIFICATION OF BIDEN VICTORY ON JAN. 6\n\nVoter fraud has posed a persistent challenge in our elections, although its breadth and scope are disputed, the lawmakers said Saturday in a statement. By any measure, the allegations of fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exceed any in our lifetimes.\n\nWhile the Trump campaign has challenged the results in dozens of lawsuits, judges in multiple states have shot them down. Attorney General William Barr told The Associated Press last month that to date, we have not seen fraud on a scale that could have effected a different outcome in the election.\n\nA source familiar with the effort by the GOP senators told Fox News that it was Cruz who orchestrated the push for the audit just days before the joint session of Congress on Wednesday to officially approve the Electoral College votes electing former Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nThe lawmakers say there is a precedent of Democrats objecting to election results in 1969, 2001, 2005 and 2019. And, in both 1969 and 2005, a Democratic Senator joined with a Democratic House Member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged, they said.\n\nThe senators and senators-elect are calling for Congress to appoint a commission to conduct a 10-day emergency audit of the election returns in states where the results are disputed. They cite as precedent the 1877 race between Samuel Tilden and Rutherford Hayes in which there were allegations of fraud in multiple states.\n\nIn 1877, Congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy, the lawmakers said in the statement. Instead, Congress appointed an Electoral Commission -- consisting of five Senators, five House Members, and five Supreme Court Justices -- to consider and resolve the disputed returns.\n\nWe should follow that precedent. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, the senators intend to vote against certification.\n\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed, they said in the statement.\n\nAmerican democracy relies on the consent of the governed, Sen. Blackburn and Sen.-elect Hagerty said in a separate statement. Allegations of voter fraud, irregularities and unconstitutional actions diminish public confidence in what should be a free, fair and transparent process. Protecting the integrity of the electoral process is paramount to preserving trust and legitimacy in the final outcome.\n\nIt is unclear whether they will rally more Republicans to their cause, given Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's public acceptance of Biden's victory. While the lawmakers note that most Democrats and some Republicans will vote to certify the results, they argue that an audit would increase the public's faith in the process.\n\nThese are matters worthy of the Congress, and entrusted to us to defend. We do not take this action lightly. We are acting not to thwart the democratic process, but rather to protect it, they said. And every one of us should act together to ensure that the election was lawfully conducted under the Constitution and to do everything we can to restore faith in our Democracy.\n\nThe effort by the senators marks a major win for President Trump's continuing efforts to challenge the results of the election. Trump has repeatedly claimed he beat Biden, who flipped a number of states, including Georgia and Arizona, to get over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to secure the White House.\n\nTrump's campaign has launched a number of legal challenges, while Trump himself has urged states with Republican governors and legislatures to overturn Biden's victories.\n\nSenate GOP leadership, however, is against efforts to challenge Biden's win -- with McConnell urging Republicans behind closed doors not to contest the election results.\n\nBut if the group of GOP senators object, along with a similar effort by House Republicans, the joint session of Congress would be dissolved, and the House and Senate would then meet separately to debate any contested state's electoral votes.\n\nAfterward, each body would vote whether to accept or reject any contested votes. Then the House and Senate would reconvene the joint session.\n\nIn the House, at least 13 incoming House GOP freshmen are expected to back a move by Rep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., to object to certification. Rep.-elect Kat Cammack, Fla., was the latest to announce Saturday in a statement that she was among them.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe last time this happened (and only the second time in U.S. history) was in January 2005, following President' George W. Bush's narrow re-election victory over Democratic challenger John Kerry of Massachusetts. One Senate Democrat – Barbara Boxer of California – and one House Democrat – Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio – objected. In 2017, a handful of House Democrats objected to Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton, but no Senate Democrats joined them.\n\nA state's slate of electoral votes would only be thrown out if both the House and Senate vote to do so -- something that is unlikely given the Democratic majority in the House, and the push by GOP Senate leaders to certify.\n\nFox News' Paul Steinhauser, Jason Donner, Marisa Schultz and Tyler Olson contributed to this report.
The White House has sent national security adviser John Bolton on a mission to allay Israel's concerns about President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.\n\nThe pullout announced before Christmas was initially expected to be completed within weeks, but the timetable has slowed as the president acceded to requests from aides, allies and members of Congress for a more orderly drawdown.\n\nBolton planned to meet with Israel's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and other officials on Sunday before traveling to Turkey. Israeli officials have expressed alarm that a swift withdrawal of the roughly 2,000 troops could enable Iran to expand its influence and presence in Syria, wracked by a yearslong civil war and the Islamic State militancy.\n\nTrump's move has raised fears about clearing the way for a Turkish assault on Kurdish fighters in Syria who have fought alongside American troops against IS extremists. Turkey considers the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG, a terrorist group linked to an insurgency within its own borders.\n\nA Trump administration official told reporters traveling with Bolton that Bolton intended to discuss the pace of the drawdown, as well as American troop levels in the region. Bolton was expected to explain that some U.S. troops based in Syria to fight IS will shift to Iraq with the same mission and that some American forces may remain at a key military outpost in al-Tanf, in southern Syria, to counter growing Iranian activity in the region.\n\nBolton's also was to convey the message that the United States will be very supportive of Israeli strikes against Iranian targets in Syria, according to the official, who was not authorized to publicly discuss Bolton's plans before the meetings and spoke on condition of anonymity to preview the talks.\n\nBolton warned Syria's president, Bashar al-Assad, not to use the U.S. drawdown as a pretext to use chemical weapons against Syrians, saying there is no change to the U.S. position that their use is a red line. Trump has twice carried out airstrikes in Syria in response to apparent chemical attacks, with the intention of deterring Assad.\n\nWe've tried twice through the use of military force to demonstrate to the Assad regime the use of chemical weapons is not acceptable, Bolton said while en route to Israel. And if they don't heed the lessons of those two strikes, the next one will be more telling.\n\nTrump's announcement about the intended troop withdrawal was greeted by surprise and condemnation from many U.S. lawmakers and allies, and prompted the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the U.S. special envoy for the anti-IS coalition in protest.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo is following Bolton to the Mideast this coming week for an eight-country tour of Arab allies to shore up support for the administration's partners in the region.\n\nWhile in Israel, Bolton planned to encourage officials to take a tougher stance against Chinese electronics manufacturers ZTE and Huawei. The U.S. has expressed concerns about potential cyber-penetration by those companies.\n\nJoining Bolton in Turkey will be the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford. In meetings with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and other officials, they are expected to warn against an offensive targeting the Kurdish fighters in Syria.

But for now, at least, we can conclusively say that it benefits the narrow interests of President Trump and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n\n\nFor Trump it has put him back in the driver's seat. He got to be president by being the best at manipulating media coverage and those skills have obviously not left him entirely.\n\n\n\nWe're not talking about Special Counsel Robert Mueller or the agenda of the new Democratic House of Representatives or the topsy turvy economy. Like the North Korea summit, the ill-fated election fraud commission and other Trump showstoppers, the semi-shutdown is catnip for coverage and the engagement of his longtime supporters but doesn't add up to much.\n\n\n\nFor Pelosi, it has mostly kept the insurrectionists in her conference in check, mother truckers notwithstanding. Democrats may disagree on may things, but sticking it to Trump is not one of them. War with Trump makes life simpler and power more easily wielded.\n\n\n\nThe problem, as with every shutdown, is not how to get it started but rather how to get it stopped.\n\n\n\nTrump's problem was that he had painted himself in a corner. His demand was so small it sounded petty. When your government is running a $1 trillion deficit, it seems more than a little churlish to have all of these histrionics over a few billion dollars.\n\n\n\nFriday of this week is payday for many of those affected workers who, if a resolution is not found, have gone a month without salary. Soon enough, walkouts, the blue flu, furious passengers standing in line at airports and other problems will start piling up.\n\n\n\nLast Friday, Trump raised the stakes saying that the shutdown wasn't about $3 billion but rather about a comprehensive immigration reform effort. That may be too much in the other direction since such a goal is unlikely to be achieved, but it's certainly raises the stakes to a point that seems worth the trouble.\n\n\n\nNow, Trump is going to use his first-ever Oval Office address – the .44 Magnum in the presidential communications arsenal – to lay out this comprehensive plan. He will also, presumably, throw in some bar talk about invoking a national emergency to use extraordinary executive powers to get his way.\n\n\n\nThe intent here is to get Pelosi on defense and cast her as unwilling to deal with a huge issue of major importance to most Americans. It's not a format that suits the president, who struggles with scripted speeches, but if he can pull it off, could dramatically alter the political moment.\n\n\n\nWith roadblock coverage across all television broadcast and news stations, Trump will have a moment to tell the country what he really wants in simple, unambiguous terms. What does a deal that he would support look like.\n\n\n\nOr, he will go on another discursion about slats and concrete and what somebody's cousin Pete told him and the moment will be wasted and the next time he says he wants to address the nation it will get yawns.\n\n\n\nThe president has bluffed, bullied and wheedled his way into a very consequential moment. Now we'll find out what he wants to do with it.\n\n\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: IT'S ALWAYS THE LAST ONE YOU SUSPECT\n\nFor it is a truth, which the experience of ages has attested, that the people are always most in danger when the means of injuring their rights are in the possession of those of whom they entertain the least suspicion. – Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 25\n\n\n\nTIME OUT: LE SPIDER-MAN\n\nEnjoy a brief excerpt from a piece by the New Yorker's Jake Halpern about the skilled climber and thief referred to as Spider-Man by the French press. New Yorker: Long before the burglar Vjeran Tomic became the talk of Paris, he honed his skills in a graveyard. … At the age of ten, Tomic pulled off his first heist. He broke into a library in Mostar, climbing through a window that was nearly ten feet above street level. He stole two books, each of which appeared to be several hundred years old. … Tomic said of his early criminal adventures, 'It was intuitive. Nobody ever taught me anything.' … In time, Tomic began robbing apartments in more affluent neighborhoods. His climbing skills continued to improve, and by the age of sixteen he could scale the façade of a multistory building with relative ease. … One night, he had a vivid dream in which he stole five paintings from a museum. He took it as a portent. As he wrote to me, 'I knew that someday I would do something great.'\n\n\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\n\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTrump job performance\n\nAverage approval: 42 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 53.4 percent\n\nNet Score: -11.4 points\n\nChange from one week ago: unchanged\n\n[Average includes: Gallup: 40% approve - 55% disapprove; USA Today/Suffolk: 42% approve - 54% disapprove; Quinnipiac University: 39% approve - 52% disapprove; NBC/WSJ: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 46% approve - 52% disapprove.]\n\n\n\nBERNIE GETS BANGED UP\n\nFox News: As Bernie Sanders gears up for a likely second run at the Democratic presidential nomination, the Vermont senator finds himself facing a much higher level of scrutiny than he ever endured in 2016. … The allegations of harassment and sexism in Sanders' 2016 campaign – which emerged in reports last week by The New York Times and Politico – are raising new questions even among some of Sanders' strongest supporters. … And the home-state Barre Montpelier Times Argus newspaper just published a blistering editorial that began, 'Bernie Sanders should not run for president. In fact, we beg him not to.' The editorial listed several points, including the sexual harassment allegations, while noting they are not directed at him personally. But more broadly, the piece warned… 'It is one thing to start a revolution, but at a certain point you need to know when to step out of the way and let others carry the water for you.'\n\n\n\nBe best: Biden tells friends nobody in Dem field can top him - NYT: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination. Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are keenly interested in Mr. Biden's plans because of their consuming focus on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the increasingly diverse Democratic coalition. Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary…\n\n\n\nTrump campaign moving fast to rig nomination - Politico: President Donald Trump is tightening his iron grip on the Republican Party, launching an elaborate effort to stamp out any vestiges of GOP opposition that might embarrass him at the 2020 Republican convention. The president's reelection campaign is intent on avoiding the kind of circus that unfolded on the convention floor in 2016, when Never Trump Republicans loudly protested his nomination before a national TV audience. The effort comes as party elites like Utah Sen. Mitt Romney are openly questioning Trump's fitness for the job, and it's meant to ensure that delegates to next year's convention in Charlotte, N.C., are presidential loyalists… Trump political aides Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, the organizers of the project, held a national conference call with Republican state party chairs, who traditionally play an outsize role in picking delegates. Last week, the two advisers began having one-on-one calls with the state chairs to describe the campaign's mission and discuss various circumstances in each state.\n\n\n\nJ. V. Last: 'The Trump Primary Has Already Begun' - The Bulwark: The smartest thing Barack Obama ever did was running for president when everyone thought Hillary Clinton was invincible. The second smartest thing he did was invite Clinton into his Cabinet and keep her there through his first term. Obama understood that avoiding a primary challenge is a necessary (though not sufficient) condition for re-election. … President Trump, on the other hand, seems to be daring someone to run against him in 2020. He frequently insults his fellow Republicans and has made almost no effort to mend fences… He did not bring the people most likely to run against him—John Kasich and Mitt Romney—into his administration. And he has not kept the people who would be most dangerous to him—Nikki Haley and Jim Mattis—on his team. If you only looked at this top-line data, you'd almost think Trump wants a primary challenger. Maybe he does.\n\n\n\nPELOSI TALKS DOWN IMPEACHMENT\n\nWaPo: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) sought to quell a rising furor Sunday over whether Democratic lawmakers will seek to impeach President Trump, saying in an interview on CBS News's 'Sunday Morning' that the public has yet to hear the conclusions of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation. Democrats are unlikely to pursue a path of impeachment without Republican backing, Pelosi hinted. That could hinge significantly on whether Mueller's probe uncovers concrete evidence of wrongdoing. … Pelosi's remarks were echoed Sunday by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), who said calls for Trump's impeachment were a 'distraction' from Democrats' 'substantive agenda.' … Pelosi's remarks come amid days of Democratic infighting after newly elected Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) vowed … to 'impeach the motherf-----,' referring to Trump. Many of Tlaib's colleagues have cautioned against moving too quickly toward impeachment. Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) on Sunday told ABC News that impeaching Trump would be 'an unbelievably serious undertaking.'\n\n\n\nBut investigations to come fast and furious - Politico: Democrats want to investigate the Trump Hotel deal and President Donald Trump's taxes. They want to haul up conflicted Cabinet officials and dig into controversial changes to the census and food stamps. They want to put Education Secretary Betsy DeVos under oath and investigate child detentions at the border. The threat of subpoenas, investigations and oversight hearings will dominate the new House Democratic majority agenda, targeting the White House's most controversial policies and personnel, spanning immigration, the environment, trade and of course, the biggest question of them all: Russian collusion. … But for House Democrats in control for the first time in nearly a decade, it's also a role full of pitfalls. Trump has already tried to brand the prospect of congressional oversight as nothing more than 'harassment,' and Democrats will also have to show they can legislate, govern and investigate all at the same time in the House.\n\n\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nPergram: 'The outsiders move inside: New to Congress, with all the pitfalls' - Fox News\n\n\n\nBustos unveils ambitious plans for DCCC - Politico\n\n\n\nBolton puts terms on Trump's initial threat of Syria troop withdrawal - AP\n\n\n\nRubio gets bipartisan backing for foreign policy bill aimed at bolstering Israel - The Intercept\n\n\n\nTrump's consequential SupCo gambles piling up - USA Today\n\n\n\nAUDIBLE: MASSACHUSETTS WOMAN ENJOYS HUMAN EMBRACE\n\nI love it. I'm a hugger. – Sen. Elizabeth Warren telling the Des Moines Register about the number of hugs she received on her recent trip to Iowa.\n\n\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\nI think your history comment for [Friday] is a bit off or at least does not tell the whole story. The 44 Colt model of 1847 was a collaboration of Sam Walker and Colt in 1846-47. Walker was with the Texas Rangers at the time and wanted a more powerful weapon for the Mexican-American war. The 1000 US military orders were for the State of Texas Military is my understanding. The 44 Walker was the most powerful handgun until the 357 Magnum came along in 1935. They were called 'horse pistols' as they commonly were carried on the pommel of the saddle. These were powerful, accurate repeating weapons. Sam Walker carried two at the time of his death. Military Walkers are stamped with the US and 1847 on the left side of the revolver. Original Walkers are exceptionally expensive. Beat up ones might set you back 40 to 60 thousand dollars while the few really nice ones that are properly authenticated go for nearly a million. I attached a few pictures of me shooting my replica. They are fun guns to shoot and it teaches you a lot about patience as it takes a while to load up the black powder (pyrodex replica in my case) and it is quite powerful. My targets are not the best in the world but certainly show that the revolver could be quite accurate at 25 yards. The center group is 2 cylinders worth or 12 shots so a Ranger armed with a couple of Walkers would be force to be reckoned with. Keep up the great work on the Halftime Report.

Apparently to cause a traffic hazard, according to Cherokee County authorities. No, seriously. It's not a joke. The Cherokee County EMA is asking drivers to not eat the chicken fingers left on Highway 35 in a late Sunday night Facebook post. The tenders spilled on the roadway during an 18-wheeler wreck. The cases, which have been on the ground for 24 hours, aren't safe to eat, authorities warn. What's worse? Diving for free chicken tenders could land you in hot water with the law.

The world ushered in 2019 in a variety of ways, with major capitals and cultural centers drawing the most revelers – and attention.\n\nIn New York, rainy weather didn't dampen the spirits of those gathered at Times Square, who were at least grateful for temperatures in the 40s rather than below freezing.\n\nWe're troopers. We got this, reveler Nyia Williamson, 41, told the Associated Press, adding that he was attending the big ball drop in New York for the 11th time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThousands of police officers, many accompanied by bomb-sniffing dogs, plus more than 1,200 security cameras and more than 200 blocker vehicles were deployed to keep the crowd safe, the New York Daily News reported.\n\nThe big party is here in Times Square, city Police Commissioner James O'Neill told the newspaper. It's a wet night but people are still having fun.\n\nThe big party is here in Times Square. It's a wet night but people are still having fun. — Police Commissioner James O'Neill\n\nWhile TV images from New York typically show partiers packed tightly together, this week saw reports that crowd-size estimates may have been overblown over the years.\n\nPast estimates have pegged the headcount at 1 million or 2 million people. But a British crowd-science professor posited that the actual crowd size is probably more like that of a typical New York Giants game – somewhere short of 100,000 people.\n\nGenerally, people are overestimating crowd sizes by ten- to one hundred-fold, G. Keith Still of Manchester Metropolitan University, who trains police departments on techniques to calculate crowd sizes, told the Associated Press.\n\nRegardless of how many people showed up in Times Square this year, they were treated to performances by Christina Aguilera and Bebe Rexha as they waited for midnight to arrive.\n\nOther cities had their own ways of celebrating.\n\nLas Vegas, for example, was expected to ring in 2019 with fireworks shot from casino-resorts and superstar performances from Lady Gaga, Celine Dion, Gwen Stefani and others.\n\nCelebratory midnight toasts were to be anchored by the 8-minute fireworks show on the Strip. The pyrotechnics were to be choreographed to a soundtrack that includes Frank Sinatra's Luck Be a Lady, Lionel Richie's All Night Long and Dion's version of I Drove All Night.\n\nNew Year's Eve is worth more than $400 million to Vegas.\n\nSecurity is a high priority for police on the Las Vegas Strip, where a gunman in 2017 opened fire on a country music festival, killing 58 people and injuring hundreds of others.\n\nPolice, including rooftop snipers and plainclothes and uniformed officers, will be out in full force along with federal agents. Authorities are also restricting revelers from bringing backpacks, ice chests, strollers and glass items to the street celebrations.\n\nHere's how cities around the world rang in 2019:\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO\n\nMore than 2 million people celebrated the new year on Copacabana beach in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nA 14-minute fireworks display ushered Brazil into 2019 only hours before far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro will be sworn in as president.\n\nMany Brazilians were on the road to the capital of Brasilia on Monday night to watch the former army captain's inauguration Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThe last evening of 2018 in Rio was 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius), and many Brazilians took a dip in the water and made their offerings to Yemanja, a sea goddess in the Afro-Brazilian Candomble faith.\n\nLONDON\n\nBritons ushered in the new year with the familiar chimes of Big Ben, even though the world famous clock has been disconnected for more than a year because of a conservation project.\n\nParliament announced last week that the clock's massive bell would sound to mark the new year with the help of a specially built electric mechanism to power the hammer, which weighs about 440 pounds (200 kilograms). The clock mechanism, which has kept time since 1859, has been dismantled as part of the renovation work.\n\nNew Year's Eve without Big Ben would be positively un-British. The comforting chimes are used by TV and radio stations throughout Britain to herald the moment of transition from the old to the new year.\n\nPARIS\n\nParisians and tourists gathered on the Champs-Elysees to celebrate New Year's Eve under heavy security.\n\nAnti-government protesters from the yellow vest movement have issued calls on social media for festive demonstrations on the famous avenue.\n\nParis police set up a security perimeter in the area, with bag searches, a ban on alcohol and traffic restrictions. The Interior Ministry said Sunday that the heavy security measures are needed because of a high terrorist threat and concerns about non-declared protests.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron gave his traditional New Year address to briefly lay out his priorities for 2019, as some protesters angry over high taxes and his pro-business policies plan to continue their demonstrations in coming weeks.\n\nAhead of midnight, a light show with the theme of brotherhood took place on the Arc de Triomphe monument at the top of the Champs-Elysees.\n\nBERLIN\n\nTens of thousands of people celebrated the start of 2019 at Berlin's landmark Brandenburg Gate.\n\nThe annual New Year's celebrations took place amid tight security, with about 1,300 officers deployed throughout the heart of the German capital and revelers banned from taking fireworks, bottles or large bags into the fenced-off party zone.\n\nBy midnight, Berlin police reported fewer incidents than in previous years.\n\nVATICAN CITY\n\nPope Francis has rounded out the most problematic year of his papacy by presiding over a vespers service and praying before the Vatican's giant sand sculpture Nativity scene.\n\nDuring his homily Monday, Francis lamented how many people spent 2018 living on the edge of dignity, homeless or forced into modern forms of slavery.\n\nAccompanied by his chief alms-giver, Francis then walked out into St. Peter's Square, where he greeted pilgrims and prayed before the Nativity scene, carved out of 720 tons of packed sand.\n\nOn Tuesday, Francis will celebrate Mass to mark the start of a new year and officially leave behind 2018, which saw a new eruption of the clergy sex abuse scandal.\n\nUNITED ARAB EMIRATES\n\nFireworks crackled at Dubai's Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, as hundreds of thousands of spectators gathered downtown to watch the spectacular display.\n\nThe fireworks replaced last year's somewhat anticlimactic LED lightshow that ran down the facade of the 828-meter-tall (2,716-foot-tall) tower.\n\nCafes and restaurants with a view of the Burj Khalifa charge a premium for their locale on New Year's Eve. Casual sandwich chain Pret a Manger, for example, charged $817 for a table of four. That price gets you hot and cold drinks and some canapes. For burgers near the action, fast food chain Five Guys charged $408 per person for unlimited burgers, hotdogs, fries, milkshakes and soda.\n\nElsewhere in the United Arab Emirates, the emirate of Ras al-Khaimah attempted to set a new Guinness World Record with the longest straight-line display of fireworks reaching 7.35 miles (11.83 kilometers).\n\nTHAILAND\n\nWhile many celebrate New Year's Eve with fireworks, hundreds of Thais traveled to Takien Temple in a suburb of Bangkok to lie inside coffins for traditional funeral rituals.\n\nParticipants believe the ceremony — symbolizing death and rebirth — helps rid them of bad luck and allows them to be born again for a fresh start in the new year.\n\nThey held flowers and incense in their hands as monks covered them with pink sheets and chanted prayers for the dead.\n\nIt wasn't scary or anything. It is our belief that it will help us get rid of bad luck and bring good fortune to our life, said Busaba Yookong, who came to the temple with her family.\n\nPHILIPPINES\n\nDozens of people have been injured ahead of New Year's Eve, when many across the Philippines set off powerful firecrackers in one of Asia's most violent celebrations despite a government scare campaign and threats of arrests.\n\nThe Department of Health said it has recorded more than 50 firecracker injuries in the past 10 days. That is expected to increase as Filipinos usher in 2019.\n\nOfficials have urged centralized fireworks displays to discourage wild and sometimes fatal merrymaking.\n\nThe tradition stems from a Chinese-influenced belief that noise drives away evil and misfortune.\n\nEarlier Monday, suspected Muslim militants remotely detonated a bomb near the entrance of a mall in Cotabato as people did last-minute shopping ahead of celebrations. Officials said at least two people were killed and nearly 30 wounded.\n\nCHINA\n\nNew Year's Eve isn't celebrated widely in mainland China, where the lunar New Year in February is a more important holiday. But countdown events were held in major cities, and some of the faithful headed to Buddhist temples for bell-ringing and prayers.\n\nBeijing held a gala with VIP guests at the main site of the 2008 Summer Olympics. The event looked ahead to the 2022 Winter Games, which also will be held in the Chinese capital.\n\nOutdoor revelers in Beijing had to brave temperatures well below freezing.\n\nAdditional police were deployed in parts of Shanghai, where a New Year's Eve stampede in 2014 killed 36 people.\n\nIn Hong Kong, festive lights on skyscrapers provided the backdrop for a fireworks, music and light show over Victoria Harbor on a chilly evening.\n\nKIRIBATI\n\nThe Pacific island nation of Kiribati was the first in the world to welcome the new year, greeting 2019 with muted celebrations after spending 2018 on the front line of the battle against climate change.\n\nKiribati is made up of low-lying atolls along the equator which intersect three time zones, the first of which sees the new year 14 hours before midnight in London.\n\nMuch of the nation's land mass, occupied by 110,000 people, is endangered by rising seas that have inundated coastal villages. The rising oceans have turned fresh water sources brackish, imperiling communities and raising doubts the nation will exist at the next New Year.\n\nFormer President Anote Tong said the only future for Kiribati may be mass migration.\n\nThe new year was welcomed in the capital, Tarawa, with church services and mostly quiet private celebrations.\n\nAUSTRALIA\n\nAn estimated million people crowded Sydney Harbor as Australia's largest city rang in the new year with a spectacular, soul-tinged fireworks celebration.\n\nOne of the most complex displays in Australia's history included gold, purple and silver fireworks pulsating to the tune of (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman, made famous by Aretha Franklin, who died in August. The show used 8.5 tons of fireworks and featured more than 100,000 pyrotechnic effects.\n\nEarlier, a thunderstorm drenched tens of thousands of people as they gathered for the traditional display, creating a show of its own with dozens of lightning strikes.\n\nIn Melbourne, 14 tons of fireworks deployed on the ground and on roofs of 22 buildings produced special effects including flying dragons. In Brisbane, people watched as fireworks exploded from five barges moored on the Brisbane River.\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nAfter an eventful year that saw three inter-Korean summits and the easing of tensions over North Korea's nuclear program, South Koreans entered 2019 with hopes that the hard-won detente will expand into a stable peace.\n\nThousands of South Koreans filled the streets of the capital, Seoul, for a traditional bell-tolling ceremony near City Hall. Dignitaries picked to ring the old Bosingak bell at midnight included famous surgeon Lee Guk-jong, who successfully operated on a North Korean soldier who escaped to South Korea in 2017 in a hail of bullets fired by his comrades.\n\nA peace bell was tolled at Imjingak, a pavilion near the border with North Korea.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this story.
Clemson coach Dabo Swinney's stance that teams playing only six games ought to be barred from the College Football Playoff -- and ranking Ohio State 11th in his final coaches' poll -- made ample bulletin board material for the Buckeyes going into Friday night's game.\n\nAfter Clemson's 49-28 loss to Ohio State, Swinney was blasted on social media even before the clock hit triple zeroes.\n\nOhio native LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers was among the critics, chiding the coach for his low ranking.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nSwinney told reporters after the game he had no regrets about ranking Ohio State where he did.\n\nI don't regret any of that, and polls have nothing to do with motivation. Both teams were highly motivated to play, he said, via ESPN.\n\nThey're a great team. [The ranking] had nothing to do with Ohio State. I said they were good enough to beat us, good enough to win the whole dang thing. But I didn't think anybody that didn't play at least nine games, in my poll, that I wasn't going to put them in the top 10. So I wasn't going to change that just because there was a chance we could play them. So I don't have any regret about that. Only thing I regret is obviously not doing a good enough job getting my team ready.\n\nOHIO STATE ROUTS CLEMSON IN SUGAR BOWL, WILL PLAY ALABAMA IN NATIONAL TITLE GAME\n\nOhio State quarterback Justin Fields, who had six touchdown passes, wouldn't touch the question immediately after the game. His teammate, tight end Jeremy Ruckert, said it didn't motivate them any more than the game itself, but it made the win a bit sweeter.\n\nAnything motivates you, whether it's what they say or what we say, he said. This is the biggest stage in college football. If that doesn't motivate you, I don't know what you're doing here. We definitely heard what he was saying and used it as motivation, but the stage, the platform of the playoff and the chance to go move on, that's motivation in itself. Now we just have to keep that energy going.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOhio State will play Alabama for the national championship on Jan. 11.
The disappearance of Vanessa Guillén, a 20-year-old soldier at the sprawling Texas Army base of Fort Hood last April, captured headlines across the world.\n\nAfter 10 torturous weeks and growing fears that another soldier who had sexually harassed her was involved, Guillén's dismembered, burned body parts were unearthed from a box by a river. That fellow soldier, her suspected killer, died by suicide as police inched closer to him.\n\nBut critics of the military installation vow there is much more to it. Last year, more than 30 soldiers associated with Fort Hood died – 11 were deemed suicides and five homicides.\n\nThe public outrage at Guillén's murder forced an independent review of the base, led by a five-member civilian team. The findings found a deficient climate at Fort Hood, as well as an ineffective implementation of the Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) program that resulted in a pervasive lack of confidence, fear of retaliation, and significant underreporting of cases, particularly within the enlisted ranks.\n\nBut the review unveiled Tuesday also details deep concerns about the culture at the base, which has a population of over 60,000, including nearly 37,000 service members.\n\nThe murder of Specialist Vanessa Guillén shocked our conscience and brought attention to deeper problems, stated Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy.\n\nFORT HOOD SOLDIER'S DEATH MARKS 28TH AT TEXAS BASE THIS YEAR\n\nBeyond sexual harassment, the committee's findings also cast a disturbing light on the ad hoc approach to soldiers who do not show up for duty. They are automatically labeled Absent Without Official Leave (AWOL), with few resources dedicated to finding them or learning why they're missing. Guillén was listed AWOL even though her car keys and military identification were still inside the garrison, her car was in the parking lot, and there was no activity on her bank accounts.\n\nIn the civilian world, people are treated not as AWOL, but as missing persons. Our military is not second-class citizens, Natalie Khawam, the Guillens' attorney, told Fox News. This needs to be the year of the military. Who wants to join if cases are mishandled, and there is a real abuse of power and discretion?\n\nThe report also pointed to a lack of experience and high turnover within the ranks of the Criminal Investigation Department, leading to problems with launching sufficient investigations.\n\nAs it stands, there are more than 1,000 deserters wanted by the U.S. Army and it remains unclear explicitly what is being done to determine their fates. Ten months before Guillen disappeared, Pvt. Gregory Morales also vanished from Fort Hood. His body was unintentionally recovered a few miles from the base in June, during the search for Guillen. He had been listed as AWOL in August 2019 and later as a deserter.\n\nHowever, for his mother, Kim Wedel, her life in Oklahoma halted as she pleaded for assistance and answers from Fort Hood's Army Criminal Investigation Department (CID).\n\nIf any other business had this many glaring problems, leadership would be gone. Why did it take an investigation to see that the CID was understaffed and overwhelmed? There was a lack of response from CID, and they certainly didn't know what to do with me as a mom calling all the time, Wedel told Fox News.\n\nIf any other business had this many glaring problems, leadership would be gone. — Kim Wedel, mother of Army private who died under suspicious circumstances.\n\nThe Killeen Police Department is heading the investigation into Morales' death, in which foul play is suspected, according to local reports.\n\nThe Army didn't care enough to see there was a problem, Wedel asserted. I still haven't really heard from anyone down there. My son will never be at the forefront, and it is shocking how many parents like us are out there. People don't just disappear because they choose to.\n\nScott Weinhold, 24, a veteran of Fort Hood, went fishing with friends from the base in February 2019. He disappeared and his body was eventually found at Temple Lake Park along with that of his friend and fellow soldier. His death was ruled a drowning with hypothermia.\n\nThere was one survivor, but according to his New Hampshire-based mother, Jennifer Florin, she has never been given proper access to him and she is left to piece together her son's final hours.\n\nFlorin also claimed that there were threats of arrest from Fort Hood leaders during their initial search for their son, pertaining to being in waters belonging to the base.\n\nBut what was worse, Florin said, was having to buy her own flag, then learning that officials were not permitted to attend because of a back-up at the crematory. The family needed to return to the East Coast.\n\nIt was just one slap in the face after another; it was horrific, she said. I would like to see a complete investigation that isn't only focused on sexual trauma because there are a lot more issues at that base. It needs drastic oversight. We thought we had to be worried about sending our children to foreign soil, but it turns out we have to be more worried about them here.\n\nWe thought we had to be worried about sending our children to foreign soil, but it turns out we have to be more worried about them here. — Jennifer Florin, mother of dead Fort Hood veteran\n\nPENTAGON, LOCKHEED SOMEHOW BUILD 123 NEW F-35S IN 2020 AMID PANDEMIC\n\nIndeed, problems have plagued Fort Hood through multiple administrations, according to family members torn by grief and frustration.\n\nThe family of Fort Hood Army Cpl. Christopher Ferguson said his death in March 2007 is steeped in mystery and they are still in pain almost 14 years later.\n\nWe got a call one night that he had been drunk, and got into an accident and had fallen several stories from a balcony and landed on the top of his head, his sister, Christina McDonald recalled.\n\nOn the flight from Ohio, she envisioned her brother wrapped like a mummy in bandages at the hospital. Only he just looked as though he was sleeping, minimal scratches, no broken bones, she said.\n\nFerguson, who McDonald described as very straight-edged and never drank or smoked or got into trouble, was on life support and never regained consciousness. But nothing, she said, that she was being told about the off-base gathering at a fellow Fort Hood soldier's apartment that night ever made sense.\n\nShe noted that she later found her brother's camera, complete with photographs at the apartment that night of people who had vowed that they were never there. When she pushed for an independent medical examination, she was told it seemed more like her brother had been hit, and his brain was jarred.\n\nThe official cause of death was undetermined but ruled an accident years later, McDonald said. She said there is neither closure nor clarity.\n\nBut victims and skeptics of the installation's leadership have long bemoaned that for years, answers and transparency were challenging to come by.\n\nThat same year, 2007, 20-year-old Spc. Kamisha Block deployed to Iraq with a military police unit from Fort Hood, but was shot and killed just weeks later by Staff Sgt. Paul Brandon Norris. Block's younger sister Shonta said he later killed himself.\n\nBoth Block and Norris were members of the 401st Military Police Company and believed to have been in a secret relationship; it was prohibited under the Uniform Code of Military Justice. But it turned tragic in a war zone more than 7,000 miles away.\n\nAt the time, the distraught Block family – at their home in Vidor, Texas – were informed that Block died from a friendly fire gunshot through the heart. Yet after viewing the body at a local funeral home, Shonta questioned the official cause of death.\n\nWhen I saw her, I said, 'Mom, that's not her hair' – there was a fake bun glued to her head. Her head had been blown out at the back, Shonta told Fox News, stressing that the body showed multiple bullet wounds rather than only one, as they had been informed. My family never got answers.\n\nWith her advocacy, the Army re-opened the case in 2018 to investigate an allegation that someone was ordered to destroy medical records related to the case. It was closed again in 2020, on the grounds that no credible information was found to substantiate the allegations.\n\nThe Army opened it and handed it right back to CID, Shonta lamented.\n\nHowever, change could be coming.\n\nSince the review, McCarthy has ordered the firing, suspension, or re-assignment of 14 of Fort Hood's senior leadership – a number of whom were part of CID. It marks one of the most significant punitive actions ever executed by the service.\n\nThe independent committee also put forth 70 recommendations relating to areas including SHARP; Fort Hood Criminal Investigation Command (CID); missing Soldier protocols; and the installation's crime prevention and public relations efforts.\n\nIn response to the findings of the independent review, the Secretary of the Army signed a directive clarifying expectations and responsibilities of unit commanders and Army law enforcement authorities focused on the first 48 hours after a Soldier fails to report for duty, an Army spokesperson told Fox News. When one of our teammates does not report for duty, we now change their duty status to 'absent-unknown' and take immediate action to find them.\n\nWhen one of our teammates does not report for duty, we now change their duty status to 'absent-unknown' and take immediate action to find them. — Army spokesperson\n\nThe spokesperson also emphasized that the challenges at Fort Hood forced us to take a critical look at our systems, our policies, and ourselves.\n\nWhile the independent review focused on the command climate and culture at Fort Hood, the findings contained in the committee's report impact the entire Army and more than 1.2 million Soldiers, the representative continued. In response, we created the People First Task Force to analyze the findings and recommendations in the report, develop a plan of action to address issues identified by the committee, and reevaluate current policy and programs.\n\nThe Task Force will present its recommendations to Army leadership as quickly as possible for Army senior leaders' review and implementation.\n\nUnder McCarthy's direction, the military also is running its own investigation into Fort Hood, and further disciplinary measures could be taken.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, many soldiers and families connected to Fort Hood told Fox News that the personnel changes were merely cosmetic, and they feared business as usual when the spotlight faded.\n\nJennifer Norris, an Air Force veteran and military crime analyst who has focused on Fort Hood issues since 2016, said in order to look forward, one also must look back.\n\nThe deaths ruled a suicide – they need to be investigated. Why did they take their lives? Were those deaths properly investigated? Was it really a suicide, or was it a murder? Everything needs to be questioned, she added. We can't just pretend the last 20 years didn't happen.\n\nIf you or someone you know is at risk of suicide please call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255, text HOME to 741741 or go to SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.
Homicides surged about 40 percent last year in the nation's capital while nearby Baltimore continued to notch almost one killing per day — defying the downward trend in other big U.S. cities.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, a total of 160 homicides as of Monday night was driven by the more frequent use of guns in crimes.\n\nLaw enforcement officials told the newspaper that petty disputes between people who already know each other and are armed account for many of D.C.'s killings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDespite that, the city also saw its share of heartbreaking, seemingly random deaths.\n\nOne especially wrenching c ase involved a 10-year-old girl named Makiyah Wilson who was shot and killed as she clutched a $5 bill to buy a treat from an ice cream truck in July. Police have made several arrests in that case.\n\nI'm horrified, Langston Civic Association President Sydelle Moore told WJLA regarding the homicide spike. Everyone is afraid.\n\nOfficials would like to see the homicide trend change in 2019.\n\nWhen you look at our known homicide offenders in the city, about 40 percent of those have a prior gun arrest, D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham told the Post. At all levels of the criminal justice system, we have to do better.\n\nNeighboring Baltimore has reportedly seen the greatest raw number increase in killings of any other city than Chicago, which has four times the population.\n\nIn 2011, there were 211 homicides in Baltimore; by last year, that number had risen to 307.\n\nNEW STATE LAWS FOR THE NEW YEAR: GUN RIGHTS, ABORTION AND WAGES\n\nIn Baltimore's case, the Post reports, the wave of violence began not long after the April 2015 death of Freddie Gray, who suffered a severe neck injury and lost consciousness while he was handcuffed and shackled inside the back of a police van.\n\nIt's an open market, open season for killing, Daphne Alston, whose son Tariq was murdered in 2008, told the publication. After Freddie Gray, things just went berserk.\n\nAuthorities said that poor relations between community members and law enforcement officers, along with homicide detectives who are simply overwhelmed with caseloads, fed into the problem.\n\nOVERFLOWING GARBAGE, FECES PROMPT YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK OFFICIALS TO CLOSE SOME AREAS\n\nOur clearance rate isn't what I think it should be, Baltimore Police Commissioner Gary Tuggle, who has been running the department on an interim basis since May, said in an interview with the Post. We've got a really, really talented homicide unit, but we're understaffed.\n\nIn Baltimore, each detective is responsible for about nine homicide cases in addition to other suspicious death cases. However, a Post analysis found that big police departments with success in making arrests tend to assign detectives fewer than five cases a year.\n\nResidents say that understaffing often means there's little chance for justice to prevail. It also contributes to Baltimore's shockingly low arrest rate, which has not gotten above 30 percent since plummeting in 2015 following Gray's death.\n\nThis boils down to the relationship between communities and police, Tara Huffman, director of criminal and juvenile justice programs at Open Society Institute-Baltimore, said. They need people to come forward, they need people to answer the door when they knock, and they need people to talk to them on the scene.
It's a full-time job to find a job, but meddling mishaps by your significant other sure don't make things any easier.\n\nA man has found himself demoted in life after spotting a mistake on his girlfriend's resume, realizing the less-than-professional typo may explain why his partner hasn't been able to find work in months.\n\nReddit user MyNameIsFranks came clean on the social forum last week, sharing the autocorrect accident in a valuable lesson to job hunters today.\n\nWORKING FROM HOME CAUSING MAJOR STRESS FOR DURING PANDEMIC: SURVEY\n\nThe Redditor began with the backstory, explaining that about three months ago, his partner had asked him to use her computer to save her resume.\n\nSimple right? Wrong... he wrote. Whilst saving said resume, her computer thought it would be funny to change the name header back to the profile user name. PRINCESS BANANA HAMMOCK, which was then shortened to Princess Banana Hamm due to spacing.\n\nWorse yet, neither of us noticed.\n\nFast forward to the present, as the Redditor's girlfriend opened up her CV to apply for a new job – and was horrified to finally catch the faux pas.\n\nFOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS\n\nWe both immediately realized why she hasn't been getting called back for any interviews... he sheepishly said. Needless to say she's not too impressed with me right now and I'm not allowed to do anything on her computer for her ever again.\n\nMoving forward, the Redditor said he's crossing his fingers for better things to come in 2021 and hoping that his partner might get some calls back in the search for a new gig.\n\nIn response, commenters were out for the count on who exactly was in the wrong for the formatting fiasco.\n\nHonestly, at a certain point it became her fault for not double checking her resume each time she submitted it, one critic said. This is called not having 'an attention to detail.'\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' CONTINUING CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nOn the other hand, a Friends fan thought the funny blunder was understandable; the nickname is a nod to an episode of the hit show when character Phoebe (temporarily) changed her name to Princess Consuela Banana-Hammock.\n\nIn similar sentiments, another sympathizer was confident that time would heal all.\n\nYou will laugh about it in time. Like what if she lands the job of her dreams... that she never would have been looking for if the Banana Hammock resume hadn't happened? they wondered.\n\nThese are the kind of screw-ups we learn from... so learn, be better, and do something special for her.
Kevin Hart took to social media Saturday to address ongoing criticism he has received since his interview with Ellen DeGeneres that aired Friday.\n\nHart, 39, has been under fire ever since a series of homophobic tweets dating back to 2011 resurfaced shortly after he was announced last month as the host of the 2019 Academy Awards.\n\nHart initially declined to apologize for the old tweets, saying that he had addressed them in the past, but he subsequently stepped down from the hosting gig, saying he did not want to be a distraction on the night and issued an apology to the LGBTQ community for his insensitive words in the past.\n\nHart wrote in his latest Instagram post: When did we get to the point where we forgot that we all learn, then we all have the ability to grow and with that growth comes a wealth of knowledge. You can't change without a understanding of what GROWTH means. Please grasp this and use it in 2019.\n\nThe post also included a statement talking about learning.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nA news anchor or a journalist does not start at the top …. They have to LEARN and develop to be great at their job, the post read, which could be interpreted as a response to a number of journalists who have called him out for his handling of the controversy.\n\nOn Friday night, CNN's Don Lemon, who is openly gay, called on Hart to be a leader and not walk away from the controversy.\n\nWalking away right now, that is your choice, but many of us need to keep the conversation going, he said. It's life or death. Someone like Kevin Hart can be a leader — the ultimate change agent — he can help change homophobia in the black community.\n\nLemon also said Hart's apologies have fallen flat.\n\nFor many in the gay community, but especially in the black community, the Twitter apologies or explanations on 'Ellen' have fallen flat, Lemon continued. To many, they seem insincere, and that he has somehow turned himself into a victim instead of acknowledging the real victims of violent and sometimes deadly homophobia. Kevin, if anything, this is the time to hear people out.\n\nKEVIN HART'S MOST CONTROVERSIAL COMMENTS, FROM LEWD TRUMP DIG AT MTV VMAS TO SUPER BOWL RANT\n\nWriter Caroline Framke wrote in a column posted Friday in Variety arguing that Hart hadn't proven that he'd learned much.\n\nIf he gets the job back, it won't be because he's convinced his detractors that he actually cares about gay people, Framke wrote. It'll be because he spun a story about vicious trolls going after him for no good reason. It might be a compelling enough angle to convince DeGeneres and her audience, but even if it manages to sway the Academy, it still won't actually be true.\n\nDuring the interview, DeGeneres defended Hart and urged him to reconsider his decision to host the awards show. Hart told DeGeneres he was evaluating retaking the hosting position.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
Now that's a pretty penny.\n\nA penny that a Massachusetts teenager found in his change from lunch money could be worth as much as $1.65 million (£1.3 million) when it is auctioned off.\n\nThe 1943 Lincoln penny is made up of copper and has been described as the most famous coin made in error, according to Heritage Auctions, which is auctioning off the coin. Only 20 were ever made and for years the U.S. government denied its existence, but one coin was found by Don Lutes Jr. in his school cafeteria in March 1947.\n\nDISCOVERY OF A LIFETIME: 'FAKE' GOLD COIN WORTH MILLIONS\n\nDespite relentless searching by eager collectors over a period of more than 70 years, only a handful of legitimate specimens have ever been discovered, Heritage wrote on its website. PCGS CoinFacts estimates the surviving population at no more than 10-15 examples in all grades. We have compiled a roster of all specimens certified by the two leading grading services below, including an unknown number of resubmissions and crossovers.\n\nIn the 1940s, copper was considered a strategic metal, largely because of World War II, as it was used to make shell casings, telephone wire and other wartime necessities. To preserve the metal, 1943 Lincoln pennies were made of zinc-coated steel, but a tiny fraction of the pennies put into circulation wound up using copper.\n\nAlmost as soon as the pennies were pressed, rumors began to emerge that some copper cents had made their way into circulation. The frenzy had become so heightened that it was speculated that car magnate Henry Ford would give a new car to anyone who could give him one of these copper pennies, though that speculation was later proven false.\n\nStories appeared in newspapers, comic books, and magazines and a number of fake copper-plated steel cents were passed off as fabulous rarities to unsuspecting purchasers, the auction house added on its website. Despite the mounting number of reported finds, the Mint steadfastly denied any copper specimens had been struck in 1943.\n\nThe rumors of the copper penny, described as the Holy Grail of mint errors, were eventually proven true after it was found out that copper planchets – which are actually made of bronze – had become lodged in the trap doors of the mobile tote bins used to feed blank coins in the presses at the end of 1942. The planchets went unnoticed and eventually became dislodged and were fed into the coin press, along with the wartime steel blanks, Heritage wrote on its website.\n\nOther genuine examples of the 1943 Lincoln copper penny have been found, including 10-15 from the Philadelphia Mint, a half dozen from the San Francisco Mint and one from the Denver Mint.\n\n$1 MILLION FOR A PENNY? EXTREMELY RARE 1792 COIN UP FOR AUCTION\n\nAt the time, Lutes, who was 16, had heard of the rumor about Ford, but when he was later told it was false, kept the coin for himself in his collection. Over the years, he received offers for the coin and eventually even inquired with the U.S. Treasury about it, but was told that it was fraudulent, that All pennies struck in 1943 were zinc coated steel and eventually decided to just keep it for his collection.\n\nThe 1943 zinc-coated steel pennies proved to be so unpopular with the public that they were eventually replaced with brass recovered from shell casings.\n\nLutes passed away in September and now the coin is going up for auction, where no one really knows what it will sell for, Sarah Miller of Heritage Auctions said. This is the most famous error coin in American numismatics and that's what makes this so exciting: No one really knows what it's going to sell for, Miller said in comments obtained by SWNS.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe auction is ongoing and is slated to end on Jan. 10.\n\nFollow Chris Ciaccia on Twitter @Chris_Ciaccia
Protesters around the world disrupted Black Friday shopping in order to draw attention to climate change days before the United Nations met to discuss the issue in Madrid.\n\nThe retail holiday saw protests in a long list of countries -- including France, Germany, the United States -- with some activists entering stores and others holding mock funerals. Near Paris, climate demonstrators blocked a shopping mall and gathered in from of Amazon's headquarters to protest over-production they say is killing the planet.\n\nTo many activists, Black Friday is the epitome of this shift, a purely commercial event designed to boost U.S. retailers ahead of the Christmas holidays, the symbol of capitalism run amok.\n\nWe are living in a system of endless consumerism, the group Extinction Rebellion NYC tweeted on Friday. Earth cannot sustain that, especially as we accelerate towards climate and ecological catastrophe.\n\nHARVARD-YALE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTEST AT FOOTBALL GAME SEES 42 CHARGED, OFFICIALS SAY\n\nThe group posted photos and videos purportedly showing activists protesting the holiday.\n\nProtesters also reportedly shut down streets in Vancouver, Canada for a mock funeral procession.\n\nThe Sunrise Movement, a group that's helped promote the Green New Deal, swarmed the large Water Tower Place shopping mall in Chicago.\n\nCLIMATE ACTIVISTS TURN UP THE HEAT ON ELECTED DEMS, CRITICIZE INACTION\n\nIn Washington, D.C., actress Jane Fonda led yet another protest as part of a series called Fire Drill Fridays. In a post retweeted by Fonda, the group cliamed that 38 people were arrested demanding food justice. Activists also reportedly planned to hold a Black Friday Funeral for the Future on Capitol Hill in order to eulogize and mourn all that has been lost and all that is threatened by the climate crisis.\n\nClimate change protests seemed to intensify in the fall with thousands skipping school during September's climate strike. Activist Greta Thunberg also appeared at a United Nations meeting where she vehemently denounced politicians for inaction on climate change.\n\nAnd last week, nearly 260 groups sent a letter requesting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Ill., pursue policies like the Green New Deal instead of incremental or isolated policy tweaks.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT BLASTS CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTERS FOR DELAYING HARVARD-YALE FOOTBALL GAME WITH 'EMPTY ACTIVISM'\n\nAccording to The Washington Post, the group Extinction Rebellion held a hunger strike in an attempt to force the speaker into a video-recorded meeting. When they realized she was planning to leave D.C., the protesters attempted to storm past her office's entrance and into a broader room where her chief of staff sat.\n\nAlso last week, climate protesters delayed a Harvard-Yale football game when they occupied the field and demanded the Ivy League schools divest from the fossil fuel industry.\n\nThe disruptions will likely continue as the United Nations meets to discuss the issue in Madrid on Monday.\n\nThe United Nations offered what it called bleak findings Tuesday as it warned that the world was headed toward global extinction and would need to increase its efforts fivefold if nations wanted to reach the temperature reduction goal outlined in the Paris climate agreement.\n\nAGGRESSIVE CLIMATE CHANGE PROTESTS HIT MAJOR CITIES IN EUROPE, AUSTRALIA, MORE THAN 300 ARRESTED\n\nThe United States recently filed paperwork to officially remove itself from the multilateral agreement. Conservatives, meanwhile, have warned about economic consequences of large-scale reform and pointed to failed, historical climate predictions as reasons for avoiding drastic change.\n\nAccording to AP, Quang Paasch of the activist group Fridays for Future said governments attending next week's annual climate conference should keep in mind the goals of the 2015 Paris accord, which set a target of keeping global warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). We need to keep taking to the streets, we need to defend Paris.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn Berlin, about two dozen environmental activists jumped into the chilly waters of the Spree river in front of parliament to protest a government-backed package of measures they say won't be enough to reduce the country's greenhouse gas emissions. The package was blocked Friday by Germany's upper house, which represents the country's 16 states.\n\nLater, tens of thousands of students rallied in front of the Brandenburg Gate.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
At least 3 million people have already cast early votes in the Georgia runoff elections, in what has been a 2-month sprint that will likely determine which party gets the majority in the U.S. Senate.\n\nThose numbers were more than half of the record-setting 4.9 million total voters in the state who cast in the general election.\n\nBoth Georgia Senate seats – and control of the chamber – will be up for grabs on Tuesday as Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler aim to hold off Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock.\n\nREP. COLLINS EXPECTS GEORGIA GOP ELECTION DAY TURNOUT TO COUNTER DEMS' EARLY VOTING ADVANTAGE\n\nThe runoff elections have gripped national attention and were necessary after no candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the Nov. 3 election.\n\nDemocrats are optimistic based on early-voting numbers. Figures showed that Black voters made up a larger percentage of the early-voting electorate than in November's general election.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of millions of dollars have been spent on ads in what are likely to be two of the most expensive months of nonpresidential politics in American history. If Republicans win one or both of those seats, the party will retain a slim majority in the Senate.\n\nWith Democrats already having control of the House and the White House after November's election, Loeffler told Fox News Sunday that Democratic victories this week would result in drastic changes in Washington.\n\nGEORGIA VOTERS HOLD PRAYER MARCH AHEAD OF SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nIt's a choice, it's a stark contrast between the freedoms — our way of life here in Georgia — or socialism, government control, she said. We know the agenda of the left because Chuck Schumer told us he was going to take Georgia and then change America. And we know that radical agenda is not just high taxes, open borders, defunding the police, government-run health care, but he has radical candidates in this race, his agents of change.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLoeffler said President Trump knows exactly what's on the line on Tuesday. Both Trump and President-elect Joe Biden will travel to Georgia on Monday and make one final push in the state's runoff elections.\n\nFox News' Tyler Olson, Paul Steinhauser, and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report

Lewis, On living in an atomic age, 1948.\n\n\n\nTHE STORY OF THE GREAT REPUBLICAN CRACKUP\n\nIt's amazing to write, but the biggest political story in Georgia today is not about Tuesday's white-knuckle, two-seat runoff election with control of the Senate on the line.\n\n\n\nInstead, it is a recording of President Trump badgering the state's elections chief to swipe Georgia's electoral votes for him.\n\n\n\nOr, as Trump might characterize it, swipe them back.\n\n\n\nIn a leaked recording of a weekend call between Trump and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the president tells Raffensperger to find just one more vote than needed to reverse President-elect Joe Biden's 11,779-vote Georgia victory.\n\n\n\nTrump told Raffensperger – who rejected the demand – that such corruption is merited because he really won the state by hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\n\n\nThe claim is, of course, hogwash. But the fact that Trump is still trying so hard to filch a second term and the fact that so many Republicans are still playing along despite Trump's conduct is one of the biggest stories of the century so far.\n\n\n\nWhat Trump is doing with the help of many members of his party is certainly the most historically significant part of his presidency – more than an impeachment, more than judicial appointments or any piece of policy. It is unprecedented and deals with matters central to the survival of the republic\n\n\n\nThis is truly Trump's legacy project, and its disposition will have a great deal to say about the future of a badly divided Republican Party and also our capacity as Americans for self-governance in the era of brain-dead partisanship and easy disinformation.\n\n\n\nWe've tried not to spend too much time on the flapdoodle of Trump's attempts. They may be significant for history taken as a whole but they are crushingly boring and mostly irrelevant as a matter of day-to-day news.\n\n\n\nTrump team: Everyone is ignoring the massive fraud that destroyed our democracy!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\nJustices/judges/law enforcement/elections officials: Whoa! We're all ears! Please show us the evidence!\n\n\n\nTrump team: Trump was winning and then they kept counting votes and then he lost.\n\n\n\nJustices/judges/law enforcement/elections officials: Ah! That's because some states counted mail-in ballots last, and Democrats dominated among mail-in voters. Because of the pandemic, there were lots more mail-in votes this year. You're claiming fraud. You need proof of fraud.\n\n\n\nTrump team: *shuffles papers and mumbles* Your demand PROVES that you are part of the Chinese Communist effort to destroy America. Do what we want or we will destroy you!!!!\n\n\n\nJustices/judges/law enforcement/elections officials: K bye.\n\n\n\nIt has been the equivalent of a two-month-long Michael Avenatti interview and just as painful to endure. #basta\n\n\n\nBut with Trump on tape trying to bully an elected official into fabricating an election result and senators falling all over themselves to join Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley in turning Wednesday's congressional certification of results into reality television, it seems like today is the time to slip on our hazmat suit and get into it.\n\n\n\nFox News has lots of great coverage of the Georgia runoffs ahead of Tuesday's conclusion (though the actual counting may go on much longer – sorry) and we will be back before the polls close with our full analysis of the race. If you'd like some great context and deep background, Chris joined Abby Hornacek on her latest Getting Schooled podcast to talk about the peculiar history and details of this week's runoffs.\n\n\n\nThe two subjects are certainly intertwined. If Republicans do manage to lose the Senate in Georgia, Trump's desperate bid to cling to power and the efforts by Republicans to help him will be the main reason.\n\n\n\nThe key swing voters in Georgia are those mostly-affluent suburbanites who split their votes between Biden for president and the Republican Senate candidates. If the purpose of having a Republican Senate is to support Trump, even to the point of this absurdity, then those folks won't really want a Republican Senate. In fact, they might want to send a message to the GOP about the way their senators have been behaving.\n\n\n\nAdd in those poor souls who really believe Trump's claims of massive, uncorrected, systemic electoral fraud who decide not to vote and you have created the only conditions under which Republicans really could lose the Senate.\n\n\n\nTrump has promised to bring lots of new allegations of misconduct against Georgia's elections officials to his rally tonight in Dalton, a small city just across the border from Chattanooga in a county where Trump won 70 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nWe can imagine that in the wake of Sunday's revelations, Trump's attacks on the electoral system will be even more intense than in his December rally.\n\n\n\nThat's a long way of saying: please enjoy the thread below which aims to trace the arc of the Republican meltdown and what it may portend. We think you'll get something out of it and, hey, you can at least say it was worth the price.\n\n\n\nSee you Tuesday with the nitty gritty on Georgia.\n\n\n\nBackbone backfire - Pity poor James Lankford, the unlikeliest member of the Senate's new election deflection brigade. His sudden and deep dive into the realm of the Kraken is quite reflective of how this mania spread in the GOP.\n\n\n\nThe junior senator from Oklahoma is up for re-election next year in a state Trump just carried by 33 points. But on Nov. 11, Republican Lankford did something the president very much did not like.\n\n\n\nWhile Lankford did not say the truth that Joe Biden had won the presidency, he did say that Biden needed to start receiving intelligence briefings immediately as part of a potential transition.\n\n\n\nLankford, a member of the committee with oversight of the agency that facilitates presidential transitions, said on Tulsa talk radio: I will step in as well to be able to push to say: 'This needs to occur.' So that regardless of the outcome of the election — whichever way that it goes — people can be ready for that actual task.\n\n\n\nDespite having been in the Senate for only five years, Lankford was esteemed among his colleagues. He replaced the legendary Tom Coburn and seemed to be growing into the job. In addition to his perch on Homeland Security and other high-profile committees, Lankford was chosen to be the chairman of the ethics committee.\n\n\n\nSo perhaps he didn't think it would be such a big deal that he would say Biden should be briefed. After all, Lankford had gently criticized Trump's Lafayette Park Bible brandishing photo-op in June and seemed to have suffered little for the president's rebuke.\n\n\n\nLankford was unlucky, this time, though. While other Republican senators would soon make less ambiguous statements about the need to get on with an orderly transition, Lankford's hit just before the wave crested and so got lots of coverage from reporters looking for evidence of a Trump-Senate GOP split.\n\n\n\nLike many Republicans, Lankford may have assumed that after Trump had used up his legal options for contesting the election that things would die down. What they did not know was that Trump was not running a legal effort, but rather another campaign.\n\n\n\nThe brunt of that campaign came down on Lankford and the senator soon buckled. Five days after saying that the matter needed to be resolved immediately, Lankford said he was not in a hurry to get Biden briefed.\n\n\n\nOof.\n\n\n\nLankford must have heard the drooling of his potential primary challengers. If a major question for primaries in states like Oklahoma next year will be how abject one's support for the former president has been, Lankford has trouble. Rep. Markwayne Mullin, for example, is about as abject as they come.\n\n\n\nBy allowing that Biden might win and saying that he would push the Trump administration, Lankford plopped himself in the prone position before the onrushing mass hysteria that grips the populist right.\n\n\n\nAnd that is how Lankford, once the boy wonder of the Boehnerite faction of the House GOP and up-and-comer of Mitch McConnell's Senate squad, ended up signing on to Cruz's radical effort to subvert the election.\n\n\n\nFailing forward - Not that it will succeed. Like a lot of the chicanery we've seen in Trump's effort to cling to power, Cruz's bid relies on the knowledge of its participants that it will fail.\n\n\n\nIt's one thing to attempt to overturn an election for the sake of staging a made-for-TV spectacle on Wednesday, but neither Lankford nor any of the notorious self-promoters on Team Cruz would do it if it might actually work. None would want to be remembered by history as having precipitated what would surely be the worst crisis since the Civil War.\n\n\n\nThis is only par for Cruz, whom many Americans first got to know as the architect of the bogus 2013 defund ObamaCare government shutdown. Then he succored Trump's 2016 candidacy when he thought it would benefit him but concluded his doomed run lashed up with John Kasich and Carly Fiorina in a desperate, goofball bid to block Trump. The guy who told delegates in Cleveland that year to vote your conscience may have abrogated his former views, but never his ambition.\n\n\n\nCruz, six other senators and four senators-elect have joined together to demand that Congress select a commission to perform a 10-day emergency audit of the election results and present its findings to state legislatures just a few days before the Jan. 20 inauguration so they could select new electors and strip Biden of the presidency.\n\n\n\nUnless their demands are met (which they won't be) Cruz, & Co. say they will vote against certifying the votes of disputed electors (of which there are none).\n\n\n\nBy procedural rules, though, their votes will trigger two hours of debate per contested state. That will allow Trump's supporters to repeat their thoroughly debunked claims.\n\n\n\nBut, like Cruz's Green Eggs and Ham quasi-filibuster, the content is almost immaterial. The platform is the point. And for, say, a senator thinking of a presidential comeback or one being hounded by a mob back home, it would be invaluable.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the consequences of this bit of keister covering will far outlast the fears and desires of its perpetrators.\n\n\n\nCivil War re-enactors - Unlike his possible 2024 presidential rival, Hawley, Cruz did not want to be so obvious in declaring his move a publicity stunt. So Cruz dressed it up with a proposal based on the electoral crisis of the fall and winter of 1876-1877.\n\n\n\nIn the election of 1876, former Confederates finally had enough power to brutally crack down on the Black voters in the South – the beginning of a nearly century-long effort to deny African-Americans the vote. That year, in three states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – Republican elections boards threw out results they said were de-legitimated by terrorism.\n\n\n\nAs a result, officials in the three states each sent two slates of electoral votes to Congress: One intentionally inaccurate, the other accurate but the result of brutal coercion. Lawmakers deadlocked. The Democrat-controlled House backed their man, New York Gov. Samuel Tilden, and the Republican Senate stood strong for theirs, Ohio Gov. Rutherford Hayes. That left 20 electoral votes in limbo and the presidency dangling by a thread.\n\n\n\nThis is the big difference between then and now. All of the states have submitted their electoral votes and there is no dispute. That is not to say that there is no disagreement about the results, but there is no dispute in terms of the findings of the states.\n\n\n\nPrivate citizens have opinions. Individual lawmakers have opinions. But in America, the states conduct elections, the results of which are confirmed by designated officials. Congress has no role in conducting elections, only in verifying that the results are official.\n\n\n\nThe official findings are complete and Biden won with 306 electoral votes. Congress has no power to change that.\n\n\n\nIn fact, rules like the safe harbor provision that helped conscientious lawmakers, officials and judges get to this point despite unprecedented efforts to subvert the results are the product of a law passed in the wake of the 1876 nightmare to prevent a repeat.\n\n\n\nPlaying with fire - Tilden or blood was the cry of the Democrats that year. If Congress did not give the presidency to Tilden, who had also won the popular vote, then Democrats said the sons of the South would be ready to resume hostilities against the Union.\n\n\n\nIt may have been a hollow threat given the devastated condition of the former Confederacy, but for a nation still traumatized by war in ways we can't imagine, it was enough.\n\n\n\nThe commission that Cruz & Co. say they would like to emulate was not for election investigation but rather for trying to find a solution for the deadlock and save a country splitting at the seams. Its members eventually voted eight to seven to award the disputed votes, and the presidency, to Hayes.\n\n\n\nBut Democrats had only dropped their threat to blockade the result after Hayes had agreed to pull the remaining federal troops out of the South. By then, there were just two significant garrisons in the former Confederacy. They were there to protect the duly elected governments of South Carolina and Louisiana from terrorists.\n\n\n\nBut, knowing that he would not have the power in a divided government to do much more to protect Black Americans in the South anyway, Hayes capitulated and agreed to pull the troops out and let the terrorists drive Black lawmakers from power. So began a decades-long reign of terror and its lasting shame.\n\n\n\nThe resolution of the 1876 election was a disaster and the start of a dreadful period of American history. That Cruz would invoke it now as a model would be shabby enough even without his attack on one of the central pillars of federalism: state control of elections. These new nationalists really do mean business.\n\n\n\nLeaders 144 years ago were trying to find a way to resolve an inconclusive election without setting off another civil war. If these senators really were sincere in trying to do more than play political games, this would be the reverse.\n\n\n\nThat's what you get - What Trump and his posse are hoping for on Wednesday is to have two mobs protesting the results: one in Congress and one outside in a promised wild rally of Trump supporters.\n\n\n\nThis will be the second consecutive transition that will be marked by mass protests. Like their pussycat-hat-wearing counterparts in the anti-Trump march of 2017, the red hats of 2021 want the world to know that the new president is not legitimate.\n\n\n\nThese kinds of mass demonstrations around the outcomes of elections are out of character for Americans. This is what you get in places where elections are not free and fair or where strongmen rule.\n\n\n\nIn historical terms, elections in our era are cleaner than they have ever been. Fraud is much, much harder than it was in the bad old days of political machines and stuffed ballot boxes. The degree of scrutiny and oversight far, far surpasses anything our parents or grandparents would have known.\n\n\n\nAnd yet, voters increasingly believe they are rigged. That inverse correlation is the work of Trump, yes, but also of a coterie of folks across the political spectrum willing to exploit ignorance and fear for the sake of immediate gains – to survive a primary, to get clicks, to gain an advantage on rivals.\n\n\n\nThe American system survives because most citizens and most elected officials are holding the line. But it is reasonable to expect that work is going to get harder because of the recklessness of radicals.\n\n\n\nIf we have to repeat this misery in 2024, can we count on so many lawmakers, officials and judges to stand up to the threats of a sore loser of their own party? One would hope, but one would also assume that intervening primary elections will continue to punish individuals that prize propriety over party.\n\n\n\nLike Lankford, many will find that no resistance will be tolerated. Like Cruz, many others will find that there are significant advantages to be had in not just joining, but seeming to lead the parade.\n\n\n\nWill some future Congress cross the line from crass pandering and into the actual work of stealing an election? Will the results of some future election be decided not by counting ballots but by the partisan composition of statehouses? Will courts one day cower from angry mobs outside their chambers?\n\n\n\nThose things are not the likely outcomes in our near future. We hold fast to our belief that Americans tend to reject excesses in our leaders and that the pendulum will swing away from angry populism of the left and right. But it is certainly a possible future that could unfold in our lifetimes.\n\n\n\nTwo decades from now, those of us still on this side of the sod will have a chance to reflect on the events of the fall and winter of 2020-2021. Will we say that Trump set a precedent that his successors followed? Will we say that the backlash against such efforts activated our small-r republican immune system against demagoguery?\n\n\n\nThe answers to those questions won't come on Wednesday or on Jan. 20. But how we as a people answer them in the years to come will determine whether America can endure in the Founders' vision and meet the duties that come with our privileged place in history.\n\n\n\nFellow citizens, we cannot escape history. We of this Congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. No personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. The fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. We say we are for the Union. The world will not forget that we say this. We know how to save the Union. The world knows we do know how to save it. We -- even we here -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. We shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. Other means may succeed; this could not fail. The way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and God must forever bless. – President Abraham Lincoln in a message to Congress, Dec. 1, 1862\n\n\n\nChris Stirewalt is the politics editor for Fox News.

Whole Foods CEO John Mackey is facing backlash for suggesting Americans wouldn't need health care if they'd eat better.\n\nAs Americans battle a health care and hunger crisis during COVID-19 with millions of jobless Americans without health insurance, the Amazon-owned company is being slammed by critics after Mackey's comments on Freakonomics Radio surfaced.\n\nI mean, honestly, we talk about health care. The best solution is not to need health care, Mackey said in the Nov. 4 interview with host Steven Dubner that went viral on Tuesday, CNBC first reported.\n\nThe best solution is to change the way people eat, the way they live, the lifestyle, and diet. There's no reason why people shouldn't be healthy and have a longer healthspan. A bunch of drugs is not going to solve the problem, he continued.\n\nMackey, 67, also said in the interview that 71% of Americans are overweight and that 42.5% are obese, claiming: Clearly, we're making bad choices in the way we eat. It's not a sustainable path. And so, I'm calling it out.\n\nThe commentary was met with a wave of criticism on social media Tuesday with people calling his responses tone-deaf as millions of Americans are left without health care and as food banks struggle to keep up with unprecedented demand.\n\nWealthy ceos making these broad sweeping statements while refusing to acknowledge how most Americans are simply unable to live these lolll im healthy bc i eat and sleep well lifestyles is so tone deaf. please leave it in 2020, one critic scoffed on Twitter.\n\nAnother wrote: Does this apply to the hundreds of team members who have gotten covid while working at Whole Foods? Do they not need healthcare, Johnny? one user remarked on Twitter.\n\nOthers noted Mackey's disregard for those suffering from mental health conditions.\n\nWhole foods guy say we need to eat better instead of having Healthcare, excuse me while I get prescribed carrots for my depression, another user posted on Twitter.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC CAUSING MASSIVE INCREASE IN HUNGRY FAMILIES\n\nThe comments come as more Americans rely on food banks as a result of job losses spurred by the pandemic. Indeed, more than 50 million people and more than 17 million children living in the U.S. were projected to be food insured by the end of 2020, according to the nonprofit organization Feeding America.\n\nWhole Foods did not immediately return a Fox News request for comment regarding the backlash and if the grocer had plans to help make food more accessible to lower-income Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's not the first time Mackey has been outspoken about health care. He penned an editorial for the Wall Street Journal in 2009 titled The Whole Foods Alternative to Obamacare arguing against the Affordable Care Act, stating that Americans' health issues could be avoided if individuals made healthier lifestyle choices.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nWhole Foods came under fire in March when some of its employees staged a walkout, demanding workplace safety, benefits including sick pay and hazard pay during the coronavirus pandemic and claiming there wasn't enough personal protective equipment, potentially exposing them to COVID-19.
next Image 1 of 2\n\nprev Image 2 of 2\n\nWith little resistance from a friendly White House, Israel has launched a new settlement push in the West Bank since President Donald Trump took office, laying the groundwork for what could be the largest construction binge in years, according to data obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe figures, gathered from official government sources by the anti-settlement monitoring group Peace Now, show an increase in building in 2018 and a sharp spike in planning for future construction.\n\nThis trend, highlighted last week when an Israeli committee advanced plans for thousands more settlement homes on war-won lands, has only deepened Palestinian mistrust of the Trump administration as it says it is preparing to roll out a Mideast peace plan. Each new settlement expansion further diminishes the chances of setting up a Palestinian state alongside Israel.\n\nBoth supporters and opponents of settlements confirm a change in atmosphere since early 2017, when Trump took over from Barack Obama, whose administration had tried to rein in construction.\n\nThe feeling of the (Israeli) government is everything is allowed, that the time to do things is now because the (U.S.) administration is the most pro-settlement you can ever have, said Hagit Ofran of Peace Now's Settlement Watch program.\n\nPeace Now uses several measurements of settlement activity. These include plans, or the early bureaucratic stages of preparing a project; tenders, when bids are solicited from contractors to do the work; and construction starts, when the building actually begins.\n\nEach of these figures tells a different story. While construction starts give a snapshot of the current level of settlement activity, they reflect decisions made years ago. In contrast, the planning and tender stages are seen as forward-looking indicators of a government's intentions.\n\nThe data compiled by Peace Now showed a drop in construction starts during Trump's first year in office, to 1,643 units in 2017 from 3,066 units the previous year. This drop appears to reflect the lingering effect of reduced planning during the final two years of the Obama administration.\n\nBut the data for the first nine months of 2018 indicate the beginning of a Trump effect, with construction starts 20 percent higher than the same period a year earlier.\n\nThese trends are even more evident when looking at the planning process. In 2017, plans were advanced to build 6,712 new settlement homes, roughly 2.5 times the 2016 level.\n\nIn 2018, plans for an additional 5,618 units were advanced, nearly half of which were processed last week alone. Together, these numbers are the highest level of planning seen since 2013. At that time, Israel pushed forward settlement construction to counter criticism of its release of Palestinian prisoners as part of then-Secretary of State John Kerry's peace efforts.\n\nThe biggest surge in settlement activity during the Trump era is in tenders— projects that are ready to be launched.\n\nIn 2017, 3,154 tenders were issued, up from just 42 during Obama's final year in office. In 2018, that number rose to over 3,800, the highest number by far since Peace Now started compiling the data in 2002. This sets the stage for a huge jump in construction in the near future.\n\nThere's definitely a change of atmosphere. There's definitely a change of winds, said Oded Revivi, mayor of Efrat, a major settlement near Jerusalem, and the chief foreign envoy of the Yesha settlement council.\n\nRevivi said that Obama pressured Israel into greatly curtailing settlement activity. Now, he said, Israel is trying to make up for lost time.\n\nBasically what you're seeing now is the statistics are trying to catch up to the needs that were built up during the eight years of the Obama administration, when everything was in a standstill, Revivi said.\n\nWhite House Mideast envoy Jason Greenblatt's office declined comment, and State Department officials were not immediately available for comment.\n\nThe Palestinians and most of the international community consider Israeli settlements to be illegal and obstacles to peace. Over 400,000 Israelis now live in the West Bank, in addition to 200,000 in east Jerusalem. The Palestinians seek both areas, captured by Israel in 1967, as parts of their state.\n\nFor decades, a string of U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, condemned settlement construction.\n\nThings quickly changed when Trump took office. Trump refused to condemn settlement construction and surrounded himself with advisers — including his son-in-law Jared Kushner and Ambassador to Israel David Friedman — who are Orthodox Jews with close ties to settlements. Trump at times has asked Israel to show restraint, but his administration has remained largely silent as Israel has pressed ahead with its construction efforts over the past two years.\n\nThis has been welcome news to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose outgoing coalition is dominated by religious and nationalist settlement sympathizers. Favored to win re-election in April, Netanyahu has said he expects his next government to look very similar.\n\nIsrael never annexed the West Bank, meaning the Israeli military remains the sovereign there. Construction in the West Bank requires approval from COGAT, a Defense Ministry body that oversees civilian affairs in the territory.\n\nPlans are submitted by the government to COGAT's Higher Planning Council, which decides if they meet legal criteria.\n\nCOGAT routinely portrays decisions on new settlement activity as a technical matter, playing down the political impact. In a statement, COGAT said it acts in accordance with planning and building laws in the West Bank.\n\nCritics say COGAT routinely promotes settlement expansion and development at the expense of Palestinian communities in the 60 percent of the West Bank that is under full Israeli control. Palestinians have varying degrees of autonomy, including over building permits, in the remaining areas of the West Bank, where most Palestinians live.\n\nThe offices of Avigdor Lieberman, who served as defense minister in 2017 and 2018, and his deputy, Eli Ben Dahan, did not respond to requests for comment. Both are strong supporters of the settlements and settlers themselves.\n\nThe settlement surge has added to the Palestinians' distrust of the White House. The Palestinians cut off ties with the administration over a year ago after Trump recognized contested Jerusalem as Israel's capital. President Mahmoud Abbas has said he will reject any peace plan the Trump team presents.\n\nAbbas' spokesman, Nabil Abu Rdeneh, said U.S. silence and lack of condemnation and pressure have given a green light to the Israeli government to step up settlement activity.
Congresswoman Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., has gone viral with an ad in which the newly-elected lawmaker explains why she plans to carry her Glock handgun on the streets of Washington D.C. and in the Capitol building.\n\nGovernment does NOT get to tell me or my constituents how we are allowed to keep our families safe, Boebert tweeted in a caption along with the ad. I promise to always stand strong for our 2nd Amendment rights.\n\nEven though I now work in one of the most liberal cities in America, I refused to give up my rights, especially my second amendment rights, Boebert says in the ad. I will carry my firearm in DC and in Congress.\n\nBoebert explained that, as a woman and mother of four, she chooses to defend her family with all of the force the Constitution provides. She also said D.C. is one of the top 10 most dangerous cities, citing rising homicide and violent crime rates.\n\nBeing a member of Congress is pretty basic, she added. I don't go to work in a motorcade or armored car. I don't get police escorts everywhere I go. I walk to my office every morning by myself. So as a 5 foot tall, one hundred pound woman, I choose to protect myself legally because I am my best security.\n\nREP.-ELECT LAUREN BOEBERT BLASTS DEMOCRATS FOR TRYING TO BAN HER FROM CARRYING GUN AT CAPITOL\n\nBoebert also argued that one challenge of working in D.C. is that people don't understand how real America lives.\n\nThe second amendment is a part of our lives, she said. Gun ownership is cherished and it makes our little town safer.\n\nBoebert said she first took advantage of Colorado's open carry laws following a violent incident at her restaurant, Shooter's Grill. After waitresses at the restaurant asked if they could open carry as well, Shooter's Grill began mandatory training and target practice for all staff members.\n\nEducated law-abiding gun owners are the safest people in America to be around. So when anyone comes in to limit my rights and safety of my family, I'll tell them exactly what this mom thinks, Boebert's ad concluded. Not only is it my right, but it's a right I was sent here to protect from Rifle, Colorado. So if you see me in DC, say hi, you're safe with me.\n\nGOP CONGRESSWOMAN-ELECT THINKS THIS WILL GET DEMS TO SUPPORT CONCEALED CARRY\n\nThe advertisement comes after Boebert wrote a letter to House leadership Friday, urging them to keep a 1967 rule that exempts lawmakers from a ban on firearms inside the Capitol building.\n\nThe letter, which was signed by 82 other current and incoming GOP Congress members -- including Dan Crenshaw, Mo Brooks, Louie Gohmert, and Matt Gaetz -- came three days after 21 Democratic lawmakers asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to change the 53-year-old rule to keep Boebert from carrying her gun into work.\n\nOn Saturday, Boebert appeared to score a victory, as new rules unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not appear to include a proposed ban on firearms in the Capitol.\n\nThe current guidelines for weapons in the Capitol are set by the Capitol Police Board, which includes the sergeants-at-arms of the House and Senate. A spokesperson for the Capitol Police Board did not immediately return Fox News' request for comment.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMetropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee III said during a press conference Monday that he will reach out to the newly-elected Colorado lawmaker about her plans, noting he wants to ensure she is aware of what the laws of the District of Columbia are.\n\nThat congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that's caught on the D.C. streets carrying a firearm, Contee added.\n\nA spokesperson for Boebert told FOX News that the congresswoman is a fierce advocate of the Second Amendment and that she will comply with all applicable firearm laws and regulations.\n\nA representative for the Metropolitan Police Department did not immediately return FOX News' requests for comment.
Boeing's woes and the Chinese coronavirus outbreak have caused the White House to lower its projections for the U.S. economy, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Mornings with Maria Thursday.\n\nI think our projections have been reduced, because of Boeing and other impacts, so it will be lower, Mnuchin said. We would have hit 3% ... There's no question that the virus will have some impact on global growth and some impact on the U.S.\n\nTicker Security Last Change Change % BA THE BOEING CO. 255.21 -10.42 -3.92%\n\nCHINA'S VIRUS OUTBREAK WEIGHS ON GLOBAL BUSINESS\n\nHe said there are many unknowns about coronavirus' impact but that after another two weeks we'll have a much better way to model how this virus spreads.\n\nMnuchin said in mid-January Boeing would have an outsized impact on the U.S. economy, before the coronavirus outbreak was dominating headlines.\n\nMnuchin's claims come after President Trump's chief economic adviser Larry Kudlow said exports in the phase one trade deal with China will be slowed down because of the coronavirus on Mornings with Maria on Tuesday.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE ON FOX BUSINESS\n\nIt is true the 'phase one' trade deal, the export boom from that trade deal, will take longer because of the Chinese virus, Kudlow said. On the other hand, the North American trade deal, USMCA, is going to unlock tremendous investment ... Manufacturers will benefit.\n\nChinese Ambassador Huang Ping responded to the comments Tuesday, saying he hopes the virus will not affect the trade deal. Huang said he did not know if China would use a clause about unforeseeable events in the trade deal to help the country meet its commitments.\n\nGET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE
The Trump administration on Tuesday announced that the number of miles of wall at the southern border had topped 450, a key election promise set by President Trump – with a top official saying that about 350 miles more is already funded.\n\nThis isn't just a remarkable achievement, I think it's an historic accomplishment for many factors, Acting Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Mark Morgan said during a call with reporters.\n\nAS BORDER NUMBERS INCREASE, CBP CHIEF SAYS US FACES 'FULL-BLOWN CRISIS' IF TRUMP-ERA POLICIES END\n\nPresident Trump had made the pledge of 450 miles by the end of 2020 as part of an effort to show that his administration had succeeded in his central 2016 campaign promise of building the wall at the border. At the beginning of January 2020, only 100 miles had been built.\n\nMorgan said he was briefed that the goal had been met on Dec. 31, 2020, and said he thought back to those who said such a goal was not possible.\n\nWe were challenged and a lot of people didn't think we were going to be able to get it done, he said.\n\nWhile much of the wall has been replacement for existing structures, officials have repeatedly noted that the enormous 30-foot structures – complete with anti-climb technology and cameras – are radically different from the old landing mat that it replaced.\n\nThe wall was fiercely opposed by Democrats as well as immigration and environmental activists. Morgan praised President Trump for continuing to back the effort even as the administration fought against numerous lawsuits, as well as opposition to funding on Capitol Hill.\n\nHe actually listened and heard from the experts, from the folks on the border, on the frontlines of America's borders every single day, who are risking and sacrificing so much, he said. He didn't just hear them, he listened to them, he spent time with them, traveled down to the border, learned about the border, heard from them.\n\nMorgan has said that the 450 miles does not mark an end to the project, and pointed to $1.375 billion that was included in the recent omnibus spending bill passed by Congress and signed by President Trump.\n\nThat money completes a total of about $16 billion for the wall system, Morgan said, which will fund a total of almost 800 miles of new wall.\n\nSo in addition to the 450 that we've already got on the ground, we've got funded 350 miles of wall system to go in the ground, he said. The overwhelming amount of those miles, that funding, the contracts have already been awarded.\n\nWHAT HAPPENS TO THE BORDER WALL UNDER A PRESIDENT BIDEN?\n\nThe future of construction at the border is unclear. President-elect Joe Biden opposed wall construction and has promised that there will not be another foot of wall constructed on my administration.\n\nHowever, it might not be that simple. Morgan warned that with those contracts already awarded, it would cost the U.S. billions to suddenly walk away from those contracts and could cost thousands of jobs.\n\nThe challenge marks one of a number that the Biden administration will have to navigate if it wants to dramatically change track on immigration. Biden has promised to end a number of key Trump policies on illegal immigration and asylum – leading to fears that such changes could lead to a border surge and a new migration crisis.\n\nTop Biden officials recently warned that changes may take longer than some had expected.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nProcessing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off, incoming domestic policy adviser Susan Rice told Spanish wire service EFE recently. Migrants and asylum seekers absolutely should not believe those in the region peddling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on Day 1. It will not.\n\nMorgan called such remarks a glimmer of hope but also added that merely delaying moves like abolishing the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) would not mean that such a crisis would not happen.\n\nThey just kicked the crisis can down the road, he warned.
Fox Nation host Kat Timpf is calling the closing of Congress' opening prayer nonsense for including the terms amen and awomen.\n\nI have certainly faced sexism, faced things that men don't have to face just because I am a woman, Timpf told Trace Gallagher on America's Newsroom on Monday. I have to admit, the word 'amen' is not among those things.\n\nREP. CLEAVER ENDS OPENING PRAYER FOR NEW CONGRESS: 'AMEN AND AWOMAN'\n\nRep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo., closed Congress' opening sermon on Sunday by saying amen and awoman. Critics noted amen is not a gendered word; it means so be it or so shall it be in Latin.\n\nTimpf said the prayer has nothing to do with gender whatsoever.\n\nI know they're trying to appear tolerant and woke, but if anything I feel like they're really making a mockery about issues women do face because we are women, Timpf said.\n\nJEFFRIES DEFENDS GENDER-NEUTRAL LANGUAGE IN HOUSE RULES, SAYS IT REFLECTS 'GORGEOUS MOSAIC' OF AMERICA\n\nTimpf also weighed in on new proposed House rules to remove gender-specific pronouns from bills. The rules, if passed, would change father and mother to parent, daughter and son to child, brother and sister to sibling, and aunt and uncle to parent's sibling.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n[This] blows my mind. This is what Congress is spending time on right now with everything going on, Timpf said. I could think of a million better things they could be spending their time on than this.\n\nThis has nothing to do with tolerance, she added later. It's all about trying to appear like you're smarter and you're more woke. It's all about self-obsession and it's not altruistic whatsoever.
The final stage in the selection of an American president comes at 1 p.m. on Wednesday, Jan. 6.\n\nUnder the conditions of the 12th Amendment to the Constitution, both the House and Senate meet at 1 p.m. in a joint session of Congress in the House chamber.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, in his capacity as president of the Senate, presides. But, there have been several instances where the president pro tempore of the Senate (the most senior member of the majority party) presides in place of the vice president. This would be Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa.\n\nFor instance, President Richard Nixon defeated the Democratic nominee, Vice President Hubert Humphrey in 1968. Humphrey was still vice president. But he was overseas for the funeral of the first United Nations Secretary General Tryvgie Lie. So, the duties fell to Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., the president pro tempore, to preside over the session in Humphrey's absence.\n\nThe 12th Amendment says that the vice president shall open the certificates and the votes shall then be counted;- The person having the greatest number of votes shall be President.\n\nThere is some debate as to the role of the vice president at this stage. Some believe it is ceremonial. The lawsuit filed by Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas -- tossed out of court by a federal judge appointed by President Trump -- pushed for the vice president to have more power over the session and the adjudication of electoral votes sent in from the states.\n\nGOP SENATORS WANT ELECTION COMMISSION SIMILAR TO WHAT DECIDED DISPUTED 1876 RACE\n\nAll 50 states certified their election returns last month. The Electoral College convened. Each state sent an electoral slate to Washington.\n\nFox is told it's not unheard of for a rogue slate of electors to be sent to the vice president's office or the archivist of the United States as a practical joke, or perhaps someone attempting to cause mischief.\n\nFox has learned that when a surrogate slate of electors was sent in, the powers that be would simply ignore it. Don't forget that White House adviser Stephen Miller suggested sending in alternative slates of electors from competitive states.\n\nThis is in fact where Pence could flex some muscle. It depends on which electoral certificates the vice president elects to open under the 12th Amendment.\n\nThis brings us to the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Congress approved the Electoral Count Act after an epic battle from the disputed election of 1876 between President Rutherford B. Hayes (the ultimate winner) and his vanquished opponent Samuel Tilden. More on that later. But the Electoral Count Act -- alongside the 12th Amendment -- sets the ground rules for how Congress operates during the joint session of Congress to certify the winner of the Electoral College.\n\nAPPEALS COURT UPHOLDS DISMISSAL OF GOHMERT'S LAWSUIT CHALLENGING 2020 ELECTION RESULTS\n\nOne footnote before we begin:\n\nIt's common for the House and Senate to prepare what's called a concurrent resolution, which could establish certain parameters for handling Electoral College disputes this time around. Such a resolution is often non-controversial. But, that resolution could carry extra weight or have the potential to upend or truncate this year's Electoral College certification. But both the House and Senate must first agree to that resolution.\n\nSo, under the Electoral Count Act, the vice president and Congress are supposed to only pay attention to the certificate that is signed by the governor of a state. But there is the potential for deference by the vice president as to which slate of electors he should recognize if there are multiple certificates from an individual state.\n\nHawaii wasn't a determinative state in the 1960 presidential election between President John F. Kennedy and future President Richard Nixon.\n\nKennedy was going to win the White House, regardless of Hawaii.\n\nThere were allegations of vote fraud elsewhere, notably Illinois and Texas. Initial results from Hawaii showed that Nixon captured the Aloha State. But a recount shifted the win to Kennedy. Hawaii sent two slates of electoral votes to Washington: one for Nixon and one for Kennedy, both signed by the governor. By the book, Hawaii's electoral votes should have gone to Nixon. But when the joint session of Congress convened in January, 1961 Congress handed Hawaii's then three electoral votes to Kennedy. Nixon, then vice president, presided. Nixon could have recognized the other slate of votes from Hawaii – for himself.\n\nThe electoral votes are brought into the House chamber in mahogany boxes. The vice president reads aloud the votes from each state in alphabetical order. No issues are expected with Alabama and Alaska.\n\nBut hold on when we get to Arizona, third in line. The same is likely true for Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nUnder the Electoral Count Act, a petitioner from both the House and Senate is required to challenge a state's slate of electoral votes and the provocation must be in writing.\n\nHouse members contested Electoral College results in 2001 and 2017 without a Senate sponsor.\n\nIn 1969, Rep. James O'Hara, D-Mich., and Sen. Edmund Muskie, D-Maine, challenged North Carolina's slate over a faithless elector. This is an elector who cast his ballot for George Wallace when he was pledged to Nixon. The 1969 incident marked the first time a state's electoral slate was challenged under the Electoral Count Act of 1887.\n\nIn 2005, Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, joined forces with Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., to challenge Ohio's electoral slate.\n\nWhat happens if at least one House member and one senator get together to oppose a state's electoral votes?\n\nLet's start with Arizona.\n\nRep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., and dozens of House members are expected to raise issues with Arizona's slate of electors. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., has already said he would join various House challenges.\n\nA coalition of other GOP senators, led by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, did not say they would object to a state's electors on the floor as Hawley did. But instead, these Republicans declared they intend to vote on January 6 to reject electors from disputed states.\n\nThese senators argue that in 1877, there were disputed electors from Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina and Oregon. Congress then created an Electoral Commission to determine how to parse out the electoral votes from these states. Congress would ultimately vote on those results. In those days, the Electoral College was smaller. The Electoral Commission awarded all contested electoral votes to Hayes, making him president, 185 electoral votes to 184 electoral votes for Tilden.\n\nThe coalition of GOP senators is calling for the creation of a similar committee today.\n\nSuch a prospect remains doubtful. But here's what happens when House and Senate members join together to challenge a state's electoral slate:\n\nThe joint session is suspended.\n\nThe House then meets – just as the House. Senators then head back across the Capitol Rotunda to the Senate chamber. And, for up to two hours, the House and Senate separately consider and debate whatever grievances lawmakers have with Arizona's electoral slate.\n\nMembers may speak for up to five minutes during the two-hour window. The House and Senate then both take separate votes. It takes both the House and Senate to reject a state's electoral votes. If that happens, the electoral slate just disappears. It's as though Arizona never happened. The House and Senate then reconvene in the joint session and continue with Arkansas, California and Colorado.\n\nThere probably isn't another issue until they get to Georgia.\n\nBut, as we always say, it's about the math, it's about the math, it's about the math.\n\nThe House begins with 432 members. 222 Democrats, 210 Republicans and three vacancies. The Senate starts with 51 Republicans and 48 senators who caucus with the Democrats and one vacancy.\n\nSen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., continues as a senator because she is fulfilling an unexpired term. Former Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., does not. His term ceased. Remember, the Senate calculus could change midstream – in the middle of all of this – if the election results in the two Georgia Senate runoffs come in.\n\nIt is believed that Democrats would certainly vote to reject any electoral challenges from Republicans. And, there are certainly enough Republicans to join Democrats to do the same in the Senate.\n\nBut remember, this is being done in the age of COVID-19.\n\nThe House and Senate are both at the margins for both parties right now.\n\nAbsences imposed due to positive tests or quarantine matter. A lot. You never know exactly who is going to be there.\n\nMoreover, the House of Representatives will reinstitute its remote voting regime for the 117th Congress. The Senate has never had a remote voting option. But the House is barred from using remote voting during the certification of the Electoral College.\n\nSo, contesting each state probably takes a few hours. This is why the final certification of the electoral vote probably bleeds well into the wee hours of Jan. 7 if not deep in the day on Jan. 7 – or beyond.\n\nConsider that there is a two-hour debate for each state. That is to say nothing of how long it takes to conduct the roll call votes in a pandemic (the House averages about an hour per roll call vote these days). That also doesn't address all of the ceremonial time, speeches and minutes devoted to roll through states with uncontested electoral slates.\n\nYou see easily how this process could chew up a couple of days.\n\nThe Electoral Count Act does permit recesses. But the House and Senate aren't allowed to dissolve the joint session of Congress until the Electoral College is finalized. And, Congress must wrap this up within a five-day window.\n\nThe U.S. is into some new turf here as to what happens when multiple states electoral slates are in play. In 2005, the Senate rejected the objection to Ohio's slate 74-1. The House turned down the appeal 267-31.\n\nThis entire exercise is set against the backdrop of loyalists to President Trump claiming election fraud and Trump summoning protesters to demonstrate in Washington.\n\nThis process also has the potential to splinter the Republican Party and set a rocky precedent for years to come.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., counseled Republicans against challenging electoral votes. But those calls fell on deaf ears.\n\nSens. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Ben Sasse, R-Neb., Susan Collins, R-Maine, Pat Toomey, R-Pa., Roger Wicker, R-Miss., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Ark., have all spoken out against the maneuver to challenge the electoral votes.\n\nMoreover, each state of contested votes triggers a roll call vote documenting how lawmakers in both the House and Senate stand on, say, Pennsylvania's electors or Michigan's electors.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a helpful vote for some right-wing Republicans or those close to President Trump. It may help them avoid a primary challenge or ingratiates them with the GOP base.\n\nBut these votes could come back to haunt others. And, there will certainly be some Republicans who represent states or districts where their vote – one way or the other on each electoral slate – could help or hurt them. Choose the wrong direction and it could be dangerous politically.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is precisely why McConnell and other GOPers hoped to avoid such an electoral imbroglio. It's divisive for Republicans and will echo throughout American politics for decades to come.\n\nBut by the end of the day on Jan. 6, 7 or 8, there is going to be a decision. And everyone in Congress is going to be on the record as either upholding the Electoral College results – or rejecting them.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Tuesday night that President Trump used his prime-time Oval Office address to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear, and divert attention from the turmoil in his Administration.\n\nThe President of the United States – having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill – has shut down the government, Schumer said in a response delivered jointly with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. American democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum.\n\nSchumer called on Trump to approve legislation ending the partial government shutdown while allowing debate over border security to continue.\n\nTRUMP LAMENTS 'CRISIS OF THE HEART AND A CRISIS OF THE SOUL' AT BORDER\n\nWe can re-open the government and continue to work through disagreements about policy, Schumer said. We can secure our border without an expensive, ineffective wall. And, we can welcome legal immigrants and refugees without compromising safety and security. The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty, not a thirty-foot wall.\n\nIn her remarks, Pelosi said the president's statements during the partial shutdown have been full of misinformation and even malice, and accused the administration of practicing cruel and counterproductive policies at the southern border.\n\nThe fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge, said Pelosi, adding that President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must re-open the government.\n\nBORDER CRISIS INTENSIFIES AMID SHUTDOWN STANDOFF, FUELING TRUMP'S WALL DEMANDS\n\nPelosi noted that the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives passed legislation to fully reopen the government last week, including a measure to fund the Department of Homeland Security that provides $1.3 billion for border security with no funding for the wall. Trump, who has repeatedly requested $5.7 billion for the wall, has said he will sign no such bill and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has repeatedly said he will not bring that legislation up for a vote in the upper chamber.\n\nNeither Schumer nor Pelosi indicated whether they would meet with Trump at the White House, as the president requested in his remarks. Previous meetings have not led to any progress in breaking the deadlock.\n\nIn a separate rebuttal, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., spoke of the effect of the partial shutdown on federal employees, whom he said deserve to be treated with respect, not held hostage as political pawns.\n\nPresident Trump has stated tonight, and, over and over again in recent weeks, that this country faces a national emergency, said Sanders, who is said to be considering a run for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. Well, he's right. But it's an emergency and a crisis that he himself has created.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSanders also accused Trump of trying to create fear and hatred in our country ... and, in the process, divert our attention away from the real crises facing the working families of this nation, specifically citing income inequality, climate change, health care, and student debt.\n\nMr. President, we don't need to create artificial crises. We have enough real ones, Sanders said. Let us end this shutdown and bring the American people together around an agenda that will improve life for all of our people.
This is a rush transcript from Sunday Morning Futures, January 12, 2020. This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nMARIA BARTIROMO, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Welcome. Good Sunday morning, everybody.\n\nThanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo.\n\nStraight ahead right here on Sunday Morning Futures, my exclusive\n\ninterview with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, as President Trump hits\n\nIran with new sanctions. Plus, former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is here on why he is\n\ncalling on the president to delay the State of the Union. He will join me\n\ncoming up live. Then, Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy on the House voting to limit the\n\npresident's war powers and why he says the measure has no teeth.\n\nAlso, ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes,\n\nis here with exclusive news. He will break news on the Ukraine whistle-\n\nblower complaint this morning. Plus, Florida Senator Rick Scott joins me to discuss the Senate impeachment\n\ntrial expected to finally begin this week, as the articles are being sent.\n\nAll that and a lot more right now, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning\n\nFutures. And we begin in the Middle East this morning.\n\nThe Trump administration is ratcheting up sanctions against Iran, after\n\nTehran targets American troops with missiles. Protesters are now rising up\n\nin the streets of Iran against the ayatollah, after Iran admits mistakenly\n\ndowning the Ukrainian airliner.\n\nMeanwhile, in Asia, voters in Taiwan reelect the incumbent president,\n\nsupporting her tough stance against mainland China, this as we look ahead\n\nto this week's signing ceremony for the phase one of the U.S.-China trade\n\ndeal, all of this coming amid a record stock market performance and more\n\nsigns of job growth in America.\n\nJoining me right now, exclusively this morning, is Treasury Secretary Steve\n\nMnuchin.\n\nAnd, Mr. Secretary, it's good to see you this morning. Thanks very much for\n\nbeing here.\n\n\n\nSTEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: Thank you, Maria. It's great to\n\nbe with you.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Incredible pictures across the world of protesters and people\n\ntaking to the streets wanting freedom, wanting democracy.\n\nLet's start in Iran, where we did see those protesters this weekend. The\n\nU.S. has targeted Iran's billion-dollar metals industry and senior regime\n\nofficials. Tell us about these latest round of sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Maria, let me just start by first expressing our condolences to\n\nthe families that were involved in the crash. Obviously, it is just a\n\nterrible, tragic situation.\n\nThe additional sanctions that we put on this week and the additional\n\nexecutive order that the president authorized gave us additional\n\ncapabilities to target both primary and secondary sanctions in different\n\nsectors, including the metals industry, construction, and travel, amongst\n\nothers.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: The economy there has already weakened quite a bit. You talked\n\nabout this with Secretary Pompeo on Friday.\n\nHere is the secretary, Pompeo, with me last week on this program talking\n\nabout the state of the Iranian economy today. Watch.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nMIKE POMPEO, U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: We have crippled their economy.\n\nThey have never been in this position, Maria. Iran has never been in a\n\nplace where they have been challenged, not only economically, but\n\ndiplomatically, with a global coalition that, in May of last year, put out\n\na united statement against Iran. This is a challenge and a strategy that President Trump has laid out that\n\nwe're executing with great vigor. And it will protect and preserve and\n\ndefend the American people.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Is there anything left or anyone left to sanction? I mean, how\n\nmuch farther can you go? And what do you need to see from the Iranian\n\nregime to actually take these sanctions away?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Well, with the new executive order, we have very, very strong\n\nauthorities now across all industries, including in this executive\n\nauthority. It gave both myself and Secretary Pompeo the authority to target additional\n\nsectors as needed. And, Maria, this is all really about cutting off money, oil sales, other\n\nrevenue that would be funding their terrorist activities and their nuclear\n\nweapons development. So we continue to allow for humanitarian transactions\n\nwith Iran. I'm pleased to say that OFAC expedited all the waivers, as I said they\n\nwould, as it relates to the airline crash investigation. And we don't want\n\nto target people of Iran. We want to cut off revenues that are going for\n\nbad acts.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: And yet there is a real partnership developing and deepening\n\nbetween Iran and China -- actually, I should say, Iran, China and Russia.\n\nBut let's stay with Iran and China for a moment.\n\nAs you know, the expectations are that 50 to 70 percent of Iran's oil\n\nexports are flowing to China. Why is China allowed to go around these\n\nsanctions and do business with Iran, 70 percent of their oil and gas going\n\nto China?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Well, Maria, let me just say we have got cut off probably over 95\n\npercent of the oil revenues. So there is a very small amount of oil revenues. And you're right. A\n\ncomponent of that, a big component of that is China.\n\nI sat down with the Chinese officials. They flew in a delegation to meet\n\nwith us in the State Department to talk about this. They have cut off all\n\nof the state companies from buying oil. And we're working closely with them\n\nto make sure that they cease all additional oil activities.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So you are pursuing trying to get China to cease all\n\nactivities? Because they're obviously giving Iran the money, and Iran is using the\n\nmoney to support terrorism, if 70 percent of their oil and gas is going to\n\nChina.\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: It is 70 percent, Maria. But let me just say, it's 70 percent of a very, very small number.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: OK.\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: And China is subject to sanctions, like everybody else.\n\nWe actually sanctioned some of their shipping companies that were involved\n\nin the oil. And we will continue to pursue sanctions activities against\n\nChina and anybody else around the world that continues to do business with\n\nthem.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So what about France? You know, France is doing business Iran\n\nas well. What about the NATO countries, including France, that seem to be\n\ncontinuing their relationship with Iran, even as the U.S. pleads with them\n\nnot to, promising sanctions? Are we going to see secondary sanctions?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: The Europeans are adhering to our primary sanctions. Again, as we\n\nroll out additional sectors, they will be cutting back activities in those\n\nsectors. But the Europeans are complying with our primary sanctions, because they\n\nwould be subject to secondary sanctions. And they understand that. And even\n\nin the case of INSTEX, we have warned INSTEX that they may be -- depending\n\nupon how they set it up, they would most likely be subject to secondary\n\nsanctions as well. But, again, let me just emphasize, humanitarian transactions are available.\n\nWe're setting up a Swiss channel to handle that. So, this is not about\n\nattacking the people of Iran. This is about, as the president said, making\n\nsure that Iran stops their terrorist activities and making sure that they\n\nnever have nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Let me move on to China, because you are planning a big event\n\nthis Wednesday, the signing ceremony for the phase one deal between the\n\nU.S. and China. Is this same deal that you told us about at the end of last year?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: It is. And let me just say, Ambassador Lighthizer has led a very, very large team\n\nacross all the different agencies. Almost every single one of our agencies\n\nhave been involved in this. And this is really a historic transaction.\n\nNow, it's is not everything. And, as we have said, there will be a phase\n\ntwo. But this is the first time we have had a comprehensive agreement with\n\nChina on technology issues, agricultural issues, financial services,\n\npurchases, and has a real enforcement mechanism. So this is a big win for\n\nthe president.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: The last time we spoke about this, looking at this deal at the\n\nend of last year, we were expecting that there would be a snap-back\n\nprovision in there where, if China doesn't keep its promises, if they lie,\n\nas they have for so many times to so many different parties, that the U.S.\n\nwould be able to snap back tariffs and -- in place. Is that still in it, or has that been changed through translation?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: No, that is still in it, Maria. There is a real enforcement\n\nprovision. And if they don't comply with the agreement, the president\n\nretains the authority to put on tariffs, both existing tariffs and\n\nadditional tariffs.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: And what about the agricultural buying, because that is another\n\nquestion? There are concerns this morning, as you know, Secretary, that the language\n\nhas been changed in translation. Why wasn't the English version released to\n\nthe public, so that we can understand specifically what is in the deal\n\nwe're away -- 48 hours from signing? People want to see the English\n\nversion. Was it changed in translation?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Maria, let me first say it wasn't changed in translation. I don't\n\nknow where that rumor started. We have been going through a translation process that I think we said was\n\nreally a technical issue. And the language will be released this week. So I\n\nthink it is -- the day of the signing, we will be releasing the English\n\nversion. And people can see. This is a very, very extensive agreement.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So, you expect the Chinese to buy $40 billion to $50 billion of\n\nagricultural products from the United States, then?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: I do. Let me just say, it is $200 billion of additional products across the board\n\nover the next two years, and, Specifically, in agriculture, $40 billion to $50 billion.\n\nSo, this is a big opportunity for our farmers. And I think some people have\n\nquestioned whether they can produce it. And the president said they are\n\ngoing to go out and buy more land and produce plenty of agriculture.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: On the intellectual property issues, you have been talking a\n\nlot about protecting I.P. for American companies and innovators.\n\nIs it true the Chinese recently adopted malicious cybersecurity rules that\n\nnegate any opportunity for the U.S. to protect its intellectual property?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: No, Maria, that is not true.\n\nThere are very important intellectual property rules in here that we expect\n\nthem to adhere to. There are cyber concerns that we do have. So let me just\n\nbe clear. Cyber will be part of phase two.\n\nBut we have incorporated provisions in phase one that we think are\n\nimportant protections for U.S. companies. So, we have made very clear there\n\ncan be no forced technology transfer and that China is putting out laws to\n\nprotect both U.S. technology and other technology.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So all of your plans are coming together? You have got the\n\nsigning ceremony on Wednesday. You have got USMCA likely going to pass the\n\nSenate. When would you expect that?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: I know it is going through the Senate committees now. We expect\n\nit to pass quickly. We hope that this little sideshow that is going to show\n\nup at the Senate doesn't delay it. But we look forward to the Senate acting\n\nquickly. And let me just say, the president's economic program is really coming\n\ntogether. As we have talked about Maria, from day one, it's tax cuts, it's\n\nregulatory relief, and it is trade. And the president has delivered on all\n\nthree. You saw the stock market break 29000 for the first time last week.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: That was pretty incredible, actually. Looking at the backdrop in the terms of the economic growth story, that is\n\nwhat driving the markets. I know that we got more signs of jobs growth on\n\nFriday, with the jobs numbers coming out,although it is slowing down from\n\nthe numbers we saw about a year ago. What would be your expectation for growth, economic growth, and jobs in 2020?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Well, Maria, I wouldn't focus on any one week. We have created\n\nmore jobs under President Trump than ever created before.\n\nThat is something that we continue to focus on. And we look forward to a\n\nhealthy economy in 2020. Now, let me just say there is no question that the\n\nBoeing -- the Boeing situation, it is going to slow down the GDP numbers.\n\nBoeing is one of the largest exporters.\n\nAnd with the 737 MAX, I think that could impact GDP as much as 50 basis\n\npoints this year. But we -- we look forward to very healthy growth in 2020.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: And the trade story is one leg of the three legs in terms of\n\nderegulation, tax legislation, and the trade changes that you are making\n\nand the administration has led here. Would you expect things to pick up in 2021, then? What is your expectation\n\nin terms of economic growth?\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Well, I think, for this year, we have been looking at 2.5 to 3\n\npercent, as I said. It may be closer to 2.5 because of the adjustment of\n\nthe Boeing numbers. But this would have been 3 percent otherwise. And I think there is no\n\nquestion that USMCA and the China deal are going to add significantly to\n\ngrowth.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Secretary, I know you have got a big week, with the China\n\nsigning and these incredible growth numbers, with the stock market\n\nreacting. Great to talk with you this morning. Thanks so much.\n\n\n\nMNUCHIN: Thank you, Maria.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Secretary Steven Mnuchin joining me. Coming up, the House voting to limit the president's war powers. Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy will join me next with exclusive reaction. Follow me on Twitter @MariaBartiromo, @SundayFutures, and on Instagram\n\n@SundayFutures. Stay with us. Let us know what you would like to hear from this incredible\n\nlineup of guests, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. Back in a minute.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back. Congress now grappling with the fallout from the killing of Iranian General\n\nQasem Soleimani. The House passed a resolution that reaffirms the 1973 War Powers Act. That\n\nseeks to limit the president from taking further military action. Many\n\nRepublicans say this could actually weaken America's position in the Middle\n\nEast. Joining me right now is House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. Congressman, it's always a pleasure. Thanks so much for being with me.\n\n\n\nREP. KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CA): Thank you.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Let's go through these -- War Powers Act.\n\nThe House, obviously, on Friday voted. Can you tell us a little bit this\n\nand where this is going?\n\n\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, this is -- this resolution we passed is going nowhere,\n\nbecause it's way they passed it.\n\nThey did a concurrent resolution. And you have to understand this, Maria,\n\nthat a concurrent resolution is only used for like the Soap Box Derby or\n\ngiving a medal that we did to Jack Nicklaus.\n\nThis is nonbinding. This will not go to the president. It will not change\n\nthe War Powers Act.\n\nAnd it's what the Democrats have done. I mean, think about what the --\n\nPresident Trump has done. It is his natural instinct to always put America\n\nfirst and keep us safe. The Democrats' instinct is to blame America first.\n\nInstead of having a resolution on the floor condemning Iran for shooting\n\ndown a civilian aircraft, or will we have resolution on the floor this week\n\nstanding with those individuals who seek freedom in Iran? I don't believe\n\nwe will, because these Democrats will do anything to defame the president\n\nover defending this nation.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Eight Democrats opposed this resolution. Six are in the swing\n\ndistricts won by Donald Trump. Talk about that, because I know that you\n\nhave talked before in the past about those swing districts really watching\n\nand pressuring Nancy Pelosi to not go forward with the impeachment.\n\nBut we know that the articles are going to the Senate this upcoming week.\n\n\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, last year, it would take 19 new seats to win the majority.\n\nAnd this year, it only takes 18, because a Democrat, Jeff Van Drew,\n\nswitched party over impeachment and the way Nancy Pelosi has been treating.\n\nHe is more -- he is a Republican now on where his positions are. There are\n\n30 Democrats who sit in seats that President Trump carried. We only need 18\n\nto win the majority. They're seeing the tide continuing to shift, as Nancy\n\nPelosi, the speaker of the House, continues to stand with the socialist\n\nwing of the Democratic Party, instead of standing where America wants to\n\nsee us.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So what happens this week? You have got vote on the House\n\nmanagers for the impeachment trial.\n\nAnd then this impeachment trial, which I assume will begin this upcoming\n\nweek, could go for several weeks. Tell us how you see it playing out.\n\n\n\nMCCARTHY: Well, we first have to name the managers and vote on it.\n\nRemember where the Democrats said this was so urgent, that they had to move\n\nthis so quickly, before end of the year. And now Nancy Pelosi has been\n\nholding the papers?\n\nSo, sometimes, we will vote after their caucus, would be Wednesday or\n\nThursday. So, I find it very difficult for the Senate to even start\n\nimpeachment this week. And what happens with impeachment is, the senators\n\nhave to be in their desks. They cannot have a phone. They cannot talk to\n\none another. And they stay in their desks.\n\nWith the Clinton impeachment, it lasted five weeks. And this is the dirty\n\nlittle secret that nobody is talking about, why the speaker held these\n\npapers. Remember what happened in the last nomination process, where the DNC\n\nchairman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, had to resign the night before the\n\nnomination convention started, because they had found out they had cheated\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders from the opportunity to become the nominee.\n\nThey are doing the exact same thing right now. The Iowa caucus is on\n\nFebruary 3. Bernie Sanders is in first place. And what this does is, this\n\nbenefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and\n\ncould become their nominee, because he will be stuck in a chair, because\n\nNancy Pelosi held the papers, different than what she said to the American\n\npublic why she had to move so urgently.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So, you think that it is by design that Nancy Pelosi is sending\n\nthe articles now, slow-walking, really, slow-walking the impeachment trial,\n\nto have the senators in the room? I mean, that is collusion. That is obstruction, once again keeping Bernie\n\nSanders at bay, and clearing the decks for Joe Biden? Is that what you're\n\nsaying?\n\n\n\nMCCARTHY: That is exactly what I'm saying.\n\nRemember what the Democratic Party did this time. They removed the\n\nsuperdelegates from the first round of voting because what they had done to\n\nSenator Sanders. Now they don't have the power, had he got to the convention fairly. So,\n\nwhat power does the speaker have? Remember, when she first started\n\nimpeachment, I sent her a letter about process, could we have a fair\n\nprocess, laying out 10 questions, the exact same process for Bill Clinton\n\nand Richard Nixon. She ignored that and didn't care about process.\n\nNow she tries, in hypocrisy, bring up process in the Senate, where she has\n\nno power?\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Wow.\n\n\n\nMCCARTHY: She told the American public it was urgent. She had to move so\n\nfast. The only reason why she should be -- that she is doing this that no one is\n\ntalking about, it is harming the -- Bernie Sanders, the senator, who has\n\nbeen coming into first place, who could win Iowa and propel himself to be\n\nthe nominee. It's the exact same thing they did to him four years ago.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: That is unbelievable, actually. That is breaking news,\n\nCongressman. Thanks very much for joining us with this, this morning. We will see you\n\nsoon, Kevin McCarthy. Up next, my exclusive interview with the always outspoken former White\n\nHouse strategist Steve Bannon -- his reaction to developments with Iran,\n\nChina, why he says the president should delay the State of the Union\n\nimmediately, as we look ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. Back in a minute with Steve Bannon.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back.\n\nBreaking news this morning on support for democracy and freedom rising in\n\nthe Middle East and Asia.\n\nIn Iran, protests in the street after the country's leaders admit\n\nmistakenly shooting down a Ukrainian jetliner, killing all 176 people on\n\nboard. In Taiwan, voters are celebrating this weekend, the island's pro-democracy\n\nleader winning reelection, again, people in the streets wanting freedom and\n\ndemocracy. And in Hong Kong, protesters holding up the American flag as they fight for\n\nfreedom. Joining me right now on what it all means for America is former White House\n\nchief strategist, host of the hit podcast, wildly successful, War Room.\n\nSteve Bannon is here. Steve, it's great to see you.\n\n\n\nSTEVE BANNON, FORMER WHITE HOUSE CHIEF STRATEGIST: Thanks for having me,\n\nMaria.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Reaction to what's taking place across the world?\n\n\n\nBANNON: Look, this is the Trump doctrine, whether it's in Hong Kong at\n\nballot box in Taiwan, in the streets of Tehran, freedom and democracy.\n\nThis is what -- President Trump has stood up to the Chinese Communist\n\nParty, the dictators in Beijing. He's stood up to the mullahs in Tehran.\n\nAnd now you're seeing it. You're seeing the people, whether it's at the\n\nballot box in Hong Kong or in the protest. They just had a sweeping victory\n\nthere a couple of weeks ago, a landslide victory for the -- for the freedom\n\nand democracy party in Taiwan, with a record turnout.\n\nAnd this is with the Chinese Communist Party trying to put their thumb on\n\nthe scale to try to do it, in Tehran, the exact same thing. Remember, in\n\nHong Kong, and in Taipei, you're seeing the American flag. They're waving\n\nin these American -- these independence movements, these freedom movements.\n\nThey have gotten President Trump -- posters of President Trump as Superman\n\nor some sort of superhero. This is the Trump policy. It's ironic that, this\n\nweek, we're going to have the signing of the Chinese trade deal.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Right.\n\n\n\nBANNON: At the same time, they're moving -- they're going to vote to send\n\nthe impeachment articles over to the House, because these are inextricably\n\nlinked. What President Trump did is go against the established order. The\n\nestablished order, the permanent political class' foreign policy was to\n\nappease these dictators, to appease piece Beijing. And that's why you saw\n\nthe rise of China. To appease the mullahs in Iran. And that's why you saw\n\nthis -- this expansion, this expansion of Iran in -- with Hezbollah\n\nthroughout the Middle East. Donald Trump said, this is not going to happen on my watch. We're going to\n\nstop here and now. He's taken a very Churchillian stand, like Churchill\n\ntook in the 1930s. It's the permanent political class and the John Kerrys,\n\nthe Hillary Clintons, the foreign policy establishment, the Neville Chamberlains. They were the appeasers. He stopped the appeasement. He went to economic\n\nwar. He -- in the trade deals.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\n\n\n\nBANNON: He did economic war with the tariffs against China. He put\n\neconomic sanctions on Tehran. Economic war is winning.\n\nAnd the people in the streets support Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, the Democrats don't see it that way, Steve.\n\nShe is sending the articles for impeachment over to the Senate. We're going\n\nto have a Senate trial. And yet I can't figure out if, in fact, the\n\npresident wants witnesses or doesn't want witnesses. What is this going to\n\nlook like? Why is it that this freedom, this democracy, this movement in the economic\n\ngrowth story is not resonating on his critics?\n\n\n\nBANNON: Well, listen, they're not.\n\nThis is why they oppose him, the established order. First off, they hating\n\npersonally. But more importantly, they oppose his America first policies,\n\nbecause the America first policies are resonating.\n\nFreedom and capitalism are resonating around the world. And that's what\n\nthey oppose. And this is why he's continuing to push this forward.\n\nRemember, when they put these articles of impeachment up, what they want to\n\ndo is basically bigfoot everything he's doing. They want to have -- and\n\nthis is, I think, the problem Mitch McConnell has, is that they see this\n\nkind of trial as being on C-SPAN, right, with some very tight legal\n\narguments. I think President Trump and the reason on Laura Ingraham the other night\n\nhe called for an expanded -- he called for an expanded witness list was, he\n\nunderstands that the jury is not the Senate. The jury is the American\n\npeople, but the audience is the world. They're watching on the streets of Taipei. They're watching in Hong Kong.\n\nThey're watching in Tehran. They're watching to see if the established\n\nborder can back down Donald Trump.\n\nAnd Donald Trump has the ability to win here. And that's why I have been\n\ncalling it the trial the century. He calls it the crime of the century. It\n\nis the crime of the century. It should be treated like that. And that's\n\nwhy, on Laura Ingraham, he walked through the witnesses he wants.\n\nI think those witnesses have to be called.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: The crime of the century, meaning that this was a coup.\n\nKevin McCarthy was on several times over the last year, who called it the\n\nworst coup that we have seen ever in our history of our country. That's why\n\nthe president calls for these witnesses.\n\nLet's listen to the president on Laura Ingraham the other night in that\n\ngreat interview. Watch.\n\n\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nDONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I would like a trial.\n\nAnd I'd love to have sleepy Joe Biden. I'd love to have his son. I call\n\nthem where's Hunter? I have changed his first name to where. Where's\n\nHunter? I'd love to have the whistle-blower who wrote a fake report.\n\n\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Will we get there? Will we actually get all those people to\n\ntestify? Because that will expose the crime of the century.\n\n\n\nBANNON: If they're making a big deal on the Democratic side, and some of\n\nthese moderate senators are starting to call -- they want Bolton and\n\nMulvaney and the e-mails and Vought at OMB. Bring them. What do they have to show?\n\nDonald Trump did nothing wrong. This is why -- it's just like his support\n\nof the freedom movements throughout the world. And, yesterday, he tweets\n\nout in Farsi to support the people in the streets of Tehran. The\n\nestablished order were appeasers. They appeased the Chinese Communist\n\nParty. They appeased the mullahs.\n\nHe stood up to that. And he showed you, in the crime of the century, we\n\nshould have the whistle-blower up. We should have Hunter Biden up. And we\n\nshould have the gentleman Horowitz, who wrote the I.G. report.\n\nWe should have those people up there. They should testify. If you have to\n\ntrade off by having John Bolton and Mick Mulvaney, who cares? What are they\n\ngoing to say?\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So...\n\n\n\nBANNON: Right?\n\nWhat President Trump said at the very beginning of this, when we started\n\nour podcast, unity and substance. I did nothing wrong. This call was\n\nperfect. And I think the facts bear him out. It's one of the reasons -- two reasons\n\nNancy Pelosi slow-walked this. One was to find more evidence, OK, because\n\nthey didn't have it. And they are afraid the guns are going to be turned\n\nback on them for a weak case. The second was to make sure she could bigfoot President Trump's State of\n\nthe Union message. That's why she slow-walked this entire thing. President\n\nTrump understands that the jury is the American people. The audience is the\n\nworld. The world is watching this. That's why he has to take a hard stand, I believe.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, so you want him to delay the State of the Union.\n\nI got to ask you about that, because you are asking him, calling for him to\n\nmake this announcement tomorrow morning. Let's take a short break. We have got a lot more with Steve Bannon when we come right back. Stay with us.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: And I'm back with Steve Bannon. He is former White House chief\n\nstrategist, host of the War Room podcast.\n\nEarlier, I mentioned that comment by Kevin McCarthy, where he said that we\n\njust witnessed the attempted coup to take down President Trump. It was the\n\nworst coup since Lincoln, is what he said on this program.\n\nAnd this is one of the reasons why you believe they're not going to stop\n\nattacking the president. You want the president to fight back.\n\n\n\nBANNON: This is continual. This is the nullification project to nullify\n\nhis presidency.\n\nAnd you see why. They were wrong. They are the appeasers. He's the\n\nChurchill figure. He has stood tall. That's why this is the trial of the\n\ncentury. It's about the crime of the century. It has to be big.\n\nThis is not C-SPAN 3. This is going to be on global television. That's why\n\nI believe he has to have some of the House people, like Lee Zeldin and Mark\n\nMeadows and Jim Jordan and Gaetz and these guys that...\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: That's not going to happen, though, is it?\n\n\n\nBANNON: Well, I think he -- I think he's still got an opportunity to do\n\nthat. I think the president needs them, because they need to be -- these fire-\n\nbreathers need to be there. We can't worry about the decorum of the Senate.\n\nThis is about the direction of the United States of America. It's about the\n\npeace and prosperity of the world. Donald Trump's policy is working. And this is why she slow-walked this. She\n\ninvited him to do the State of the Union, and then she purposely slow-\n\nwalked this, because she wants in the middle of the trial -- and I can see\n\nThe New York Times' headline: Under a cloud of uncertainty, Trump\n\naddresses the nation.\n\nHe has to be acquitted. He will be acquitted and exonerated. That should\n\nhappen. And then you do the State of the Union, because the whole world\n\nwill watch this.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So you're calling on President Trump to do what, tell Nancy\n\nPelosi what about the State of the Union?\n\n\n\nBANNON: Tell Nancy Pelosi -- hey, tell Nancy Pelosi, when you deliver it,\n\nand we have a trial, and after I'm acquitted, I'm going to come and have\n\nthe State of the Union, not until then.\n\nI'm not -- President Trump's got a great saying, no games, OK? This is all\n\ngame-playing by the Democrats. It's got to be brought to an end. OK?\n\nNow, they forced her this week to deliver them. That's why he's -- and I\n\nthink this trial, he ought to go big. He ought to demand witnesses. I think\n\nPresident Trump ought to demand. There's no witness on the other side of Bolton or Mulvaney. There's nothing\n\nthey can say that's going to be that big a deal.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, they want to hear from John Bolton.\n\nJohn Bolton last week, why did he come out and say, yes, I'm ready to\n\ntestify?\n\n\n\nBANNON: I have no -- maybe to sell books.\n\nAll I know is that President Trump has to protect the office of the\n\npresidency for future presidents, as he said, about executive privilege.\n\nBut there's nothing about the details of this thing that will be any big\n\ndeal, offset by the whistle-blower, by Brennan, by Biden, by Hunter Biden,\n\nby the I.G. report. This is the crime of the century. This was an attempted coup on a sitting\n\npresident, a sitting president who turned out to be right. And you know who\n\nsays he's right? The kids in Tehran, the kids in Beirut that are in the\n\nstreets trying to throw off Hezbollah, the kids in Hong Kong that are\n\ntaking -- being gassed and taking rubber bullets, the voters in Taipei who\n\nyesterday threw out the Chinese Communist Party with a landslide, who all\n\nwave American flags, and all have signs of Donald Trump being a superhero,\n\non the streets of the world.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\n\n\n\nBANNON: The people that want freedom and democracy against these dictators\n\nthat Trump said, no more appeasement. I'm going to confront this, OK? I'm\n\ngoing to confront it, and we're going to stop it on my watch.\n\nThe nation should be proud of this. And if the trial is handled -- this is\n\nnot some technical legal thing.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: But doesn't that also impact the president, I mean, and his\n\ntimeline? Remember last time, the State of the Union. It was pushed back a week. She\n\nsaid she didn't want him to come to the chambers to deliver the State of\n\nthe Union. He was talking about giving a rally. I mean, this is deja vu all\n\nover again.\n\n\n\nBANNON: Well, that was more games about when he -- actually, the\n\ngovernment shut down because he demanded certain things, particularly for\n\nthe wall. The wall is going to give us security.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So, here we are questioning the State of the Union again?\n\n\n\nBANNON: Well, no, but here's the reason.\n\nShe's gamed this. Why did she take so long? Remember, they impeached him\n\nbecause he's a clear and present danger. That's what they said. He's a\n\nclear and present danger. We have to do this before Christmas. It has to\n\nhappen because all this influence in the following elections, right? He's a\n\nclear and present danger. They have waited for weeks for two things. They're trying to get more\n\nevidence. They're running around trying to get more evidence, because they\n\nhave no evidence. They're afraid that guns are going to be turned on them\n\nand they're going to be put on trial, because they don't have a case.\n\nThe other is that she wants him to have a State of the Union where there's\n\nsome uncertainty. After it's all over, after he's been exonerated, then he\n\ngoes before the world at the State of the Union and lays out the state of\n\nthis union and the state of the world.\n\nThe world is going to be more peaceful and prosperous and less war, because\n\na president like...\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: He has answered...\n\n\n\nBANNON: A president like Donald Trump came up, like Churchill did, and\n\nsaid, we're going to stop this.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Has he answered you on this? Have you told him? You have\n\ncalled...\n\n\n\nBANNON: I just -- we just said this the other day on the show. We have\n\nbeen saying this kind of nonstop for the last 24, 48 hours. I think, listen...\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: So, do we know if he's considering delaying the State of the\n\nUnion?\n\n\n\nBANNON: Listen, President -- President Trump is a feel player. He\n\nunderstands the moment.\n\nHe will think this through. He understands. I also think -- he said it on\n\nLaura Ingraham the other night...\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\n\n\n\nBANNON: .. about who he wants as witnesses, who he would see.\n\nThat's the way the trial should be run. It should be, put them on trial,\n\nput the whistle-blower, put Brennan. Put the apparatus that tried to shut\n\ndown and do a coup against a democratically elected president that had the\n\nright ideas about how to bring peace and prosperity to the world.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Meanwhile...\n\n\n\nBANNON: The Chinese are not coming this week to sign this trade deal,\n\nbecause everybody mocked him on tariffs.\n\nHis tariffs worked. He broke them. And that's why they're here. That's why\n\nthey're here to sign this trade deal, is because Donald Trump's program\n\nworked, when everybody on Wall Street, all the op-ed pages and all the\n\nbusiness leaders said, oh, this is wrong.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\n\n\n\nBANNON: It was Trump. After 20 years of allowing them to lie, cheat and\n\nsteal, he brought them to account. And he brought them to account because\n\nhe took bold and dramatic action.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, even the Democrats on stage ready to debate this week,\n\ntheir last debate leading up to the Iowa caucuses, believe that China is\n\nthe bad actor here and agree with the president holding a firm...\n\n\n\nBANNON: They do -- they do agree, Maria. But it's like -- they're like in\n\nseventh grade.\n\nIt's embarrassing to see what they say about what to do with China. Look at\n\nDonald Trump's actions on China to hold them to account, OK, to -- and\n\nthat's why you have got explosions in Hong Kong and Taipei, to hold the\n\nmullahs to account with economic warfare, not sending American troops,\n\nkilling bad guys when you need to kill them, but having economic warfare\n\nthat broke the mold and broke the mullahs.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Real quick on the debate stage this upcoming week, Michael\n\nBloomberg will not be there. But he's willing, apparently, to spend up to a billion dollars if he\n\ndoesn't get that nomination.\n\n\n\nBANNON: On -- on -- on...\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: It worked to get the House majority last year, didn't it?\n\n\n\nBANNON: The reason he's being impeached is because of Michael Bloomberg's\n\nmoney and backing these candidates that Nancy Pelosi curated.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, you're going to see the effect of money in the Democratic\n\nprimary, because he's going to drop a financial atomic weapon on the field.\n\nHe's already spent almost $200 million.\n\nMichael Bloomberg is committing a billion dollars. This is how maniacally\n\nthey want to remove Donald Trump from office.\n\nAnd the American people, now we're seeing the golden age. Freeman the other\n\nday in The Wall Street Journal said, we're seeing the golden age of the\n\nunderdog in America, the golden age of the striver in America, 9 percent\n\nincome growth if you don't have a high school degree, the first time that\n\nblue-collar workers over white-collar workers, workers over managers, blue-\n\ncollar over white-collar. And they see this in Tehran. They see this in Beirut.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Look at women. How about women?\n\n\n\nBANNON: They see this in Hong Kong, and they see it in Taipei.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes. And, certainly, in the U.S., you have got very strong jobs\n\nperformance as well, 50-year low on unemployment. Steve, it's great to see you.\n\n\n\nBANNON: Thank you, ma'am.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Thank you so much, Steve Bannon joining us. We have got exclusive breaking news ahead on Sunday Morning Futures. It has been a news-breaking program. Congressman Devin Nunes will join me next with breaking news on the inspector general.\n\nAnd be sure to watch FOX Business Tuesday morning for my exclusive\n\ninterview with Jamie Dimon, the CEO and chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase. We\n\nwill get more on the economy and where it is now with the lead banker in\n\nthe country. More with Sunday Morning Futures when we come back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Welcome back.\n\nAs the Senate prepares for the expected start of the impeachment trial this\n\nupcoming week, House GOP leaders are investigating the original whistle-\n\nblower complaint that started the inquiry in the first place.\n\nThe ranking Republican on the Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, sending\n\nthis letter to the intelligence community's inspector general, demanding\n\nanswers over inconsistencies that were found in the complaint.\n\nCongressman Nunes joins me now exclusively.\n\nCongressman, it's always a pleasure to see you. Thanks very much for\n\njoining us.\n\n\n\nREP. DEVIN NUNES (R-CA): Great to be with you, Maria.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: I have got your letter in front of me. Tell us the crux.\n\n\n\nNUNES: Well, the bottom line is that Republicans asked back in the end of\n\nSeptember for the ICIG to provide e-mails, documentation about how it's\n\npossible that someone that only had secondhand information could possibly\n\nbe a whistle-blower, when it wasn't on the form.\n\nWhat we got back was essentially a non-answer answer at the early stages of\n\nOctober. At that time, we moved into impeachment in the House.\n\nAnd what I said at the time, even though the media largely ignored it, I\n\nsaid that we're not finished with the ICIG.\n\nLo and behold, the Democrats know that the ICIG is a major problem. You\n\nknow why? Because they haven't released his testimony. So he's the only\n\none. Of all the Star Chamber games that were played in the basement of the\n\nCapitol, with these secretive interviews, the only one that's not released\n\nis the one with the I.C. inspector general.\n\nThat is -- that's unacceptable. So what we're asking for here is -- because\n\nwhat he's claiming is essentially that we're just dumb, we made mistakes,\n\nit was a -- it was a huge mistake.\n\nThat's fine, if you want to claim incompetence, but you need to have the\n\ndocumentation, the evidence to prove that you were indeed incompetent,\n\nbecause it just doesn't pass the smell test. And it looks so much like\n\neverything else we have seen, from the Russia hoax to the Ukraine hoax that\n\nbecame the impeachment scam.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: This is unbelievable. So do you think you will get these answers?\n\n\n\nNUNES: Well, I think it's pertinent that the ICIG get these answers by\n\nFriday, because this is the guy who lit the fuse for this impeachment scam\n\nthat's now going to be on trial in the Senate.\n\nSo, if he wants to clear his name and prove that he is, in fact, and his\n\noffice is, in fact, incompetent, he needs to provide the evidence that he's\n\nincompetent.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Well, the whistle-blower apparently also worked for John\n\nBrennan, worked with John Brennan for a time.\n\nConnect the dots here, because you have been exposing the fraud by a cabal\n\nof individuals, whether under the leadership of John Brennan at CIA or Jim\n\nComey and the FBI.\n\nNUNES: Well, look, and that's the other problem here with the ICIG, is\n\nthis ICIG actually has connections, was a lawyer for some of the very\n\npeople that were involved in the FISA abuse scam.\n\nSo all of this becomes intertwined and related. And we need to get to the\n\nbottom of it.\n\nAnd, look, the ICIG, in theory, works for Congress. So why he wouldn't\n\nprovide evidence, which is really -- the I.G.s, that's their game, right?\n\nThat's what Horowitz proved is, they're very good at getting e-mails and\n\nevidence that exist within the bureaucracy.\n\nSo this is not hard for the ICIG to provide us all the documentation on\n\ntheir supposed stupidity.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Let me move on and ask you for some reaction to this David Kris\n\nnaming.\n\nI know you obviously have a lot of experience with this individual. The\n\nsurveillance court picks ex-DOJ leader David Kris to review FBI reforms. We\n\nknow that Christopher Wray's coming out with reforms.\n\nWe're going to show some of the headlines that David Kris wrote about you\n\nand about the Nunes memo, which, of course, as we know, was 100 percent\n\ntrue when you first came out with that Nunes memo, which was exposing the\n\nwrongdoing and the attempted coup to take down then candidate Trump, and\n\nthen President Trump.\n\n\n\nNUNES: Well, look, I don't -- I don't know this gentleman.\n\nI remember, at the time, there were conspiracy theorists out there who were\n\nsaying that -- they were accusing me essentially of committing crimes,\n\nwhen, in fact, it was the FBI and the dirty cops and the Clinton people\n\nthat were engaged in this conspiracy to try to take out the president of\n\nthe United States.\n\nSo the fact that, of all the people in the swamp -- I mean, granted, the\n\nswamp isn't very big, but there are several million people that live in\n\nthis area. This is the guy that you come up with, the guy that was accusing\n\nme of federal crimes, the guy that was defending the dirty cops at the FBI?\n\nI mean, look, that's why -- I said this last night in a tweet. The court\n\nmust be trying to abolish itself, because there is long-term damage. I\n\nmean, this is just another misstep.\n\nRemember, the judge from last year that now -- there was in charge of all\n\nthese FISAs, she claimed, at the end of the year, which was great, oh, my\n\nGod, there was a problem here and we need the FBI to do something.\n\nWell, that, in and of itself, was essentially a lie, or very close to a\n\nlie, because she knew from the House Republicans that there was a fraud on\n\nthe court.\n\nThey had more information and evidence than we did. And so now you have a\n\nnew judge who has been put in place, and he picks one of the guys that was\n\nessentially covering up for the dirty cops. You can't make it up.\n\nI guess we're just going to have to abolish this whole FISA system at this\n\npoint and try to build something new.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: What -- I mean...\n\n\n\nNUNES: I don't think the American people and Republicans in Congress -- if\n\nthis continues, you're going to have a continued concern amongst\n\nRepublicans and conservatives that there's really something wrong with the\n\nFBI.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\n\n\n\nNUNES: And I don't think that there is. I think they're doing a really good job on a number of fronts.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Right.\n\n\n\nNUNES: But this court is not acceptable.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Which is why this program has been calling for accountability\n\nin the face of all of this.\n\nCongressman, I know you will get it. Thank you so much. We will keep\n\nfollowing your work on this, Congressman Devin Nunes. We will be right back.\n\n\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Senate impeachment trial set to begin soon, likely in the next\n\nweek, after Nancy Pelosi says that she will send the articles over this\n\nweek to the Senate. It is still unclear if the senators will vote to call witnesses.\n\nJoining me right now in this exclusive interview is Republican Senator Rick\n\nScott of Florida. Senator, good to see you. Thanks very much for joining us.\n\n\n\nSEN. RICK SCOTT (R-FL): Well, good morning.\n\nWell, Pelosi stopped -- is going to stop her circus, it looks like. And she\n\nclearly caved. We're going to follow the rules that we have in the Senate.\n\nAnd we're going to listen to both sides. And then we will make a decision\n\nwhether we have -- whether we have witnesses or not.\n\nBut I do -- I would like to hear from Biden, Hunter Biden, and find out --\n\nget to the bottom of that, because so much of this started with what he\n\ndid.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Nancy Pelosi is on another program this morning, and she said\n\nthat -- that the president violates the Constitution again and again.\n\nShe was asked, do you think it's possible that the House might have to file\n\nnew articles of impeachment? And she said, well, let's just see what the\n\nSenate does. It doesn't look like they're going to stop in terms of trying to come up\n\nwith even new articles, sir.\n\n\n\nSCOTT: You know, what's frustrating is, I got elected a little over a year\n\nago. I got elected to come up and try to solve problems.\n\nI didn't get elected to have Nancy Pelosi play games, which is all she's\n\ndoing. We have -- we got a secure border, reduced the drug prices. We got\n\nissues. We got issues with Iran and North Korea and things like that.\n\nAnd she wants to spend all of her time on just trying to impeach this\n\npresident because she hates Donald Trump. She's hated Donald Trump, and a\n\nlot of the Democrats have, since the day he walked down that -- came down\n\nthat escalator. Why don't we get back to what people elected us to do and solve the\n\nproblems of this country?\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: How long are you expecting this trial to go? Do you think that\n\nyou will end up getting witnesses in there?\n\nAnd, if you don't, will you get blowback from Nancy Pelosi?\n\n\n\nSCOTT: Well, we're going to get blowback from Nancy Pelosi whatever we do.\n\nBut, look, the Democrats proved that the person didn't -- didn't do\n\nanything wrong. That's what they -- that's what they did. The only person\n\nthat's been transparent here is Donald Trump.\n\nI mean, he's -- he put out the transcript. They said, oh, the transcript is\n\nhorrible. So, I mean, I don't know what we're going to -- I don't know how\n\nyou're going to vote on something, when we can even find the crime that he\n\nsupposedly committed.\n\nI mean, this is high crimes and misdemeanors. What did he do? I mean, he's\n\ndefended this country. He -- and I still -- let's find out exactly what\n\nHunter Biden was doing. This all started with Hunter Biden.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes. Yes.\n\nSo, you think that you would like to see, then, Hunter Biden come down and\n\ntestify? In terms of witnesses...\n\n\n\nSCOTT: Yes. Let's get the...\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Yes.\n\n\n\nSCOTT: Yes, let's get to the bottom of it. But, look, the bottom line is, we're going to do this.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Right.\n\n\n\nSCOTT: We're going to follow the Senate rules. And we're not going to\n\nfollow Nancy Pelosi's rules. We're going to listen to both sides. Then we will make a decision.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: Senator, thank you so much for joining us this morning, Senator\n\nRick Scott there.\n\n\n\nSCOTT: Thanks, Maria.\n\n\n\nBARTIROMO: We will be watching.

At last, you've found yourself with an Amazon Echo speaker. The Echo (or Echo Dot, or Echo Tap, or Echo Show, or Echo Plus, or Echo Spot) is now in your kitchen, and it's ready for your every command.\n\nWith so many Echo models, is that Echo even the best fit? Before you toss that gift receipt, here's a quick read to figure out which Amazon Echo is right for your lifestyle.\n\nAlexa can perform so-called skills. Amazon and its partners have developed more than 15,000 skills, and they run the gamut of uses – from workflow to domestic life to entertainment to safety to whimsical party tricks.\n\nBy now, you may have already learned that Alexa can play music and answer simple questions. If not, here's a list of basic Alexa commands to get you started. That's just the start. Below are several exciting ways that an Alexa device can assist you.\n\nTell Alexa to check your email\n\nWhat does it mean to have Alexa check your email? For most people, it would be tedious to hear every single message dictated aloud from a small speaker. But this skill is actually convenient: Simply say, Alexa, check my email, and she will respond with a summary of your email messages that have been received within the last 24 hours.\n\nYou can read, reply to, delete, and archive email messages using voice commands. Just a word to the wise. If your reply is more than a few sentences, it can get frustrating.\n\nYou can also have Alexa notify you when you receive an email from a specific person, so you don't have to refresh your screen endlessly, and you never miss a long-awaited missive.\n\nDiscover and call local businesses with Alexa's help\n\nMost Echo devices establish your location right away, and you can quickly connect to Google and other geographically sensitive apps. Alexa can now search for and call local restaurants and businesses by only using your voice. Just ask a question like, Alexa, what's the number for Domino's? to connect to the nearest venue.\n\nYou can also say, Alexa, where is the nearest Whole Foods? and then say Alexa, call them to reach your local store.\n\nUse Alexa to handle your to-do lists\n\nAnyone can use an Echo for entertainment and basic searches, but to take real advantage of your virtual assistant, you can create to-do lists and then build them out into full-on routines. To get started, say, Alexa, create a to-do list, and then add tasks as you think of them. You can also create other individual lists for daily needs.\n\nYou could say, Alexa, put get an oil change on my to-do list, or Alexa, add milk to my shopping list. It's quite handy.\n\nHave Alexa tell you the latest news\n\nAmazon calls it a Flash Briefing, a quick overview of news and other editorial content. The feature is designed to quickly aggregate and summarize the most important headlines of the day. Alexa reads text or plays audio content provided by each enabled skill. Flash Briefing's will soon become a regular part of your day.\n\nA typical command would be, Alexa, give me my Flash Briefing, or Alexa, what's in the news?\n\nIf you don't mind a shameless self-promotion, here's a tip on setting up your Amazon Echo to listen to Komando podcasts.\n\nAlexa can keep you on time\n\nThanks to the new updates for Alexa devices, you can now adjust the timer settings using just your voice. This setting is especially popular among busy or multi-tasking people, who need real-time reminders for specific tasks, appointments, and time-sensitive steps.\n\nFor example, say you are in the kitchen preparing a ham for Easter dinner. You can set a timer with your Alexa device and by saying, Alexa, add five minutes to my timer, and adjust the timer to fit your needs.\n\nAlexa can welcome you home and turn on the lights\n\nWith Alexa, you can now create location-based routines which are automatically activated when you enter or leave a location. The routines are based on GPS information gathered from your smartphone when location sharing is enabled.\n\nFor example, say you come home after a long day at work. Using only your voice, you can have Alexa turn on the lights when you walk into your living room. You could also have Alexa turn off the music whenever you leave your home.\n\nThis excellent feature can potentially save money on your power bill, and it prevents you from worrying about whether or not you turned off the kitchen lights after you have left your house.\n\nTurn Alexa into a smart home command center\n\nIf Echo is the only smart device you ever buy, you probably won't be disappointed. But to explore the full power of a smart home, you can connect your Echo to an ever-growing arsenal of smart appliances. To start, say, Alexa, discover my smart home devices, and your futuristic adventure will begin.\n\nThere are countless examples and combinations, but commands might include: Alexa, connect to my phone, Alexa, turn on the lights, Alexa, raise the temperature 5 degrees, and, if you have a Geneva smart oven and the relevant skill, Alexa, tell Geneva to preheat my oven to 350 degrees. Nice.\n\nHere are 14 other ways to control your home with Echo and Alexa.\n\nAlexa will keep you organized with reminders\n\nWith Alexa, you can now set reminders that are triggered when you leave or arrive somewhere based on the location of your smartphone. Just say something like, Alexa, remind me to take the chicken out when I get home, and when you arrive at home with your phone, Alexa will automatically send a notification to your phone and set a reminder.\n\nLocation-based Reminders are also available for locations outside the home where an Echo device may not be nearby, such as your office. For these location-based Reminders, you will receive a helpful push notification via the Alexa app on your phone.\n\nHave Alexa help you workout and stay in shape\n\nIf you're at home, and you have a spare seven minutes, and you don't mind getting a little sweaty, there's every reason to try the seven-minute workout skill. To get started, say, Alexa, start the seven-minute workout. Alexa will coach you through a series of exercises, which can be conducted just about anywhere.\n\nThere's an emerging industry based on health and wellness skill for Alexa, so if you have an interest in indoor fitness and mindfulness exercises, this is a genre to keep an eye on.\n\nGo to sleep with Alexa's help\n\nWho doesn't love falling asleep to music or sleep sounds? Using your Alexa device, you can now set a sleep timer for music within Alexa Routines.\n\nFor example, you can create a Good Night routine that will play sleep sounds, music, or white noise for an hour before automatically turning off. You can also add wait actions between Alexa Routine actions.\n\nFor example, you can create a Good Morning routine that turns on the lights at 8 a.m. and then 20 minutes later plays your Flash Briefing. This fantastic feature allows you to remain in control of your evening and morning routines, therefore allowing for a more productive day.\n\nTell Alexa not to disturb you\n\nWhile having a smart home device can be very beneficial, sometimes you may not want to be disturbed with Alexa's voice. Thankfully with the Do Not Disturb option you can avoid this.\n\nUsing voice commands, you can create a Good Night routine that turns off the lights, starts sleep sounds, and enables a Do Not Disturb feature on your devices for up eight hours.\n\nTrick burglars with Alexa's help\n\nWhenever folks leave their homes for a few days (or weeks), they wonder whether burglars are casing their house. This is a frightening prospect, and many residents will use simple tricks, like leaving certain lights or the television on to give the illusion that the home is occupied.\n\nAlexa can radically bolster that defense, thanks to the Away Mode skill. Just say, Alexa, run Away Mode, and Echo will start playing a scripted-yet-realistic conversation. Burglars may think the family is home having a discussion. There are several different dialogues using several different characters, but the idea is to confuse potential criminals with credible chatter.\n\nFind out how to use Amazon Alexa to control your home security system.\n\nUse Alexa to call 911\n\nIn the event of a real honest-to-goodness emergency, the best bet is to call 911. Your Echo can call 911, but it uses VOIP which can be unreliable. Also, for your Echo to call 911, you need to set up several steps before an emergency. Here is a step-by-step guide to using your Echo to call 911.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have? Call my national radio show and click here to find it on your local radio station.

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., defended his party's proposed new House rules for the 117th Congress, specifically addressing new language that would replace gendered terms with more general ones.\n\nFor example, if passed the rules would replace terms such as mother, father, daughter, son, sister and brother with parent, child and sibling, respectively. Examples of other terms include the replacement of chairman with chair and seaman with seafarer.\n\nREP. CLEAVER ENDS OPENING PRAYER FOR NEW CONGRESS: 'AMEN AND AWOMAN'\n\nFrom my standpoint, the gender-neutral language is just consistent with an effort for the House, in the best tradition of the House, to reflect the gorgeous mosaic of the American people in the most sensitive fashion possible, Jeffries told reporters when asked about the language. And the House, of course, is designed to be the institution closest to the American people to reflect the hopes, the dreams, the aspirations, the fears, concerns, anxieties, in the words of the framers the passions of the American people.\n\nThe congressman went on to note that the closeness to the people is why members of the House serve two-year terms instead of four years like presidents, six years like senators or lifetimes like Supreme Court justices.\n\nWHAT TO EXPECT WHEN CONGRESS MEETS TO COUNT ELECTORAL COLLEGE RESULTS\n\nHouse Minority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had a blunt reaction to the genderless terminology.\n\nThis is stupid, McCarthy tweeted Friday adding, Signed – A father, son, and brother.\n\nMembers of Congress on Monday debated the new rules on the House floor.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to the new language, the proposed rules would also continue proxy voting during the coronavirus pandemic, ban lawmakers convicted of certain crimes from visiting the House floor again, and change payment rules on legislation related to the virus and climate change that previously required lawmakers to identify new revenue sources or spending cuts to fund their priorities.\n\nThe proposal would also authorize funding for the House Administration Committee to investigate election disputes underway in Iowa's 2nd District, where Democrat Rita Hart is contesting a six-vote win by Republican Mariannette Miller-Meeks. It would not include a proposal that had been suggested by Democrats to ban lawmakers from carrying guns at the Capitol they way visitors are prohibited from bringing in firearms.\n\nFox News' Marisa Schultz contributed to this report.
A 23-year-old Florida man is now out of isolation after being the first person in the state to test positive for a new and more contagious strain of COVID-19, health officials said Saturday.\n\nThe presence of the new strain in Martin County, on Florida's Treasure Coast, was first discovered Thursday through the CDC's random sampling of COVID-19 tests.\n\nThe CDC is now working with the Florida Department of Health to examine more cases in the area and ascertain how much the new strain has spread.\n\nIt is unclear when the individual tested positive, but Martin County health official Carol Ann Vitani described the patient Saturday as very cooperative, following COVID-19 protocols. The person was asymptomatic and had not traveled outside the state recently.\n\nTEXAS SUPREME COURT BLOCKS COUNTY ORDER FOR COVID-19 RESTAURANT CURFEW\n\nCases of the new strain, which originated in the United Kingdom, also were found in Colorado and California.\n\nIt is common for viruses to change as they spread, but some health experts are concerned that current vaccines won't be effective if COVID-19 mutates too much.\n\nFor now, that is not the case.\n\nUK DOCTOR FILMS NYE CROWD CHANTING 'COVID IS A HOAX' OUTSIDE HOSPITAL\n\nAt this time, experts anticipate little to no impact on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, the state's health department said.\n\nThe state is currently rolling out the coronavirus vaccine, giving priority to its vulnerable elderly population and health care workers with direct patient contact.\n\nFlorida has vaccinated 243,107 residents, but the head of the state's Division of Emergency Management said Wednesday that the state is not getting the vaccine out fast enough.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI know people are frustrated, and I know this is the light at the end of the tunnel and they want to get there as soon as possible, Jared Moskowitz, who is overseeing Florida's rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, told the Orlando Sentinel. I know the systems set up aren't meeting the moment.\n\nFlorida has recorded 1,354,833 confirmed cases and 21,890 deaths from the disease.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.
U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., told Fox & Friends there is no question she will carry her Glock handgun in Washington, D.C., despite pushback from the chief of police.\n\nThe newly elected lawmaker and owner of Shooters Grill in Rifle, Colo., defended her viral ad Tuesday.\n\nIt's right there in our Constitution. It's an amendment to our Constitution, and there's an absolute uproar over people wanting to defend myself, the 34-year-old mother of four said.\n\nI mean, come on. I'm 5-foot, 100 pounds. I am now in one of the most dangerous cities in America. The violent crime rate here is 158% times the national average. I will be walking alone a lot, she said.\n\nREP. LAUREN BOEBERT EXPLAINS WHY SHE PLANS TO CARRY IN CONGRESS IN NEW AD\n\nJust like I say in my ad, being a member of Congress is pretty basic. I don't go to work in an armored vehicle. I don't have personal police escorts. I am my own security here and my most basic right is my right to defend myself, Boebert concluded.\n\nMetropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee III said during a press conference Monday that he will reach out to the Colorado lawmaker about her plans, noting he wants to ensure she is aware of what the laws of the District of Columbia are.\n\nThat congresswoman will be subjected to the same penalties as anyone else that's caught on the D.C. streets carrying a firearm, Contee added.\n\nBoebert responded by saying there's no question she will be able to carry in the Capitol, noting the newly sworn-in police chief's first order of business is to come after a 34-year-old woman who wants to protect herself in this dangerous city.\n\nI have gone through the concealed carry courses that Washington, D.C., requires to obtain a concealed carry permit, and I think it's very interesting that he wants to ensure that I understand Washington, D.C.'s, firearm laws, Boebert added. Maybe I should make a video announcing that I plan to drive a car in Washington, D.C., and then the chief of police will say that he's going to inform me of Washington, D.C.'s, traffic laws. Is this what he does to everyone who comes into the District of Columbia? Inform each and every person of their laws? I don't think so.\n\nBoebert first took advantage of Colorado's open carry laws following a violent incident at her restaurant, Shooter's Grill. After waitresses at the restaurant asked if they could open carry as well, Shooter's Grill began mandatory training and target practice for all staff members.\n\nEducated, law-abiding gun owners are the safest people in America to be around. So when anyone comes in to limit my rights and safety of my family, I'll tell them exactly what this mom thinks, Boebert's ad concluded. Not only is it my right, but it's a right I was sent here to protect from Rifle, Colorado. So if you see me in DC, say hi, you're safe with me.\n\nThe advertisement comes after Boebert wrote a letter to House leadership Friday, urging it to keep a 1967 rule that exempts lawmakers from a ban on firearms inside the Capitol building.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe letter, which was signed by 82 other current and incoming GOP Congress members -- including Dan Crenshaw, Mo Brooks, Louie Gohmert and Matt Gaetz -- came three days after 21 Democratic lawmakers asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to change the 53-year-old rule to keep Boebert from carrying her gun into work.\n\nOn Saturday, Boebert appeared to score a victory, as new rules unveiled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did not appear to include a proposed ban on firearms in the Capitol.
Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr called out a number of Republican leaders on Wednesday after pro-Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, claiming: You reap what you sow.\n\nKerr spoke to the media in a pregame press conference before the Warriors took on the Los Angeles Clippers and addressed a number of Republican senators by name, seemingly blaming them for inciting the day's protests by questioning the legitimacy of the election results.\n\nLEBRON JAMES SUGGESTS BUYING WNBA TEAM FROM GEORGIA SEN. KELLY LOEFFLER AFTER PROJECTED LOSS\n\nI wish that people like Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley had to do pregame media before they met in Congress, he said, via The San Francisco Gate. It would be great for them to answer the question: 'Are you happy now? Do you keep moving the line back? Does this change anything? Are you going to continue to enable?'\n\nKerr, an outspoken Trump critic who also publicly supported the Black Lives Matter movement and the NBA's effort to spotlight it, told reporters that the continued behavior by some in Washington has allowed events like Wednesday's to become normal.\n\nIf we enable people in power to lie, you all of a sudden have millions of people doubting an election that was certified in every state, he continued.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nWe had seven or eight million more people who voted for [Joe] Biden than for [Donald] Trump. Every state has certified those results. Every court appeal has been turned down. A legitimate election is suddenly questioned by millions of people, including many of the people who are leading our country in government, because we've decided over the last few years to allow lies to be told. This is who we are. You reap what you sow.\n\nThis is who we are. You reap what you sow. — Golden State Warriors head coach Steve Kerr\n\nPresident Trump issued a statement on Thursday morning promising an orderly transition later this month after Congress certified the Electoral College vote that handed Biden the presidency.\n\nEven though I totally disagree with the outcome of the election, and the facts bear me out, nevertheless there will be an orderly transition on January 20th, the statement read. I have always said we would continue our fight to ensure that only legal votes were counted. While this represents the end of the greatest first term in presidential history, it's only the beginning of our fight to Make America Great Again!\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump was heavily criticized by both sides on Wednesday for not outright condemning the protests.\n\nFox News' Evie Fordham contributed to this report.
Wow, what a way to ring in the new year.\n\nAs the world celebrated the start of 2019, scientists with NASA's New Horizons spacecraft partied with them. But the bigger celebration came just over 30 minutes later, when New Horizons made history with the flyby of Ultima Thule, a mysterious object 4.1 billion miles (6.6 billion kilometers) from Earth in the Kuiper Belt, home to frozen relics left over from the birth of the solar system. It's the farthest flyby of an object in our solar system; and the second rendezvous for New Horizons, which visited Pluto in July 2015.\n\nWe set a record! Never before has a spacecraft explored something so far away, New Horizons principal investigator Alan Stern, of the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Boulder, Colorado, said after the flyby today (Jan. 1). I mean, think of it. We're a billion miles further than Pluto, and now we're going to keep going into the Kuiper Belt. [New Horizons at Ultima Thule: Full Coverage]\n\nNew Horizons flew by Ultima Thule at 12:33 a.m. EST (0533 GMT), hurtling past at a mind-boggling 32,000 mph (51,500 km/h) as it captured the first close-up views of a Kuiper Belt object. The cosmic rendezvous occurred so far from Earth, it'll take more than 6 hours for a signal from New Horizons to reach Earth. NASA expects to hear back from the probe at 10:30 a.m. EST (1530 GMT).\n\nAnd I can't promise you success, Stern said hours before the flyby, adding that the flyby is much harder than the Pluto rendezvous. We are straining the capabilities of this spacecraft.\n\nBut oh, the party.\n\nNerding out on New Year's Eve\n\nTo celebrate New Horizons' visit to Ultima Thule, the mission team here at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory threw an epic New Year's Eve party. Hundreds of guests — including science team members, dignitaries, reporters and their families — packed an auditorium here to ring in 2019, and then cheer for the flyby. As Stern said, everyone was nerding out at New Year's Eve.\n\nAre you psyched? Stern asked the crowd as they cheered just seconds before the flyby. Are you jazzed?\n\nAmong those guests were Rep. John Culberson (R-Texas), actor Chase Masterson of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, as well as astrophysicist (and Queen lead guitarist) Brian May. May even debuted a new original song — the aptly named New Horizons — at midnight to celebrate.\n\nTo me, it is the incredible newness of it, May, a New Horizons mission team member, told reporters before the flyby. This is going way beyond where anyone has gone before, literally.\n\nAstrophysicist Brian May, the lead guitarist of Queen, speaks with reporters ahead of NASA's New Horizons flyby of the Kuiper Belt Object Ultima Thule on Jan. 1, 2019 at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. May composed a special song just for the flyby.\n\nThe celebration occurred in the midst of a partial government shutdown, which shuttered much of NASA's public outreach for the Ultima Thule flyby. But NASA and JHUAPL were able to stream live webcasts and photos of the flyby. Thomas Zurbuchen, NASA's associate administrator for science, even received special dispensation from NASA chief Jim Bridenstine to attend.\n\nI think it is fitting that this flyby of Ultima Thule is at the interface of the 60th anniversary of Explorer 1 [the first U.S. satellite] in 2018 and the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 in 2019, Zurbuchen said in an email that Stern read aloud Monday. To me, this milestone for New Horizons is full of everything that NASA and NASA science is about.\n\nAnother NASA mission also hit a milestone on New Year's Eve. The space agency's sample-return probe OSIRIS-REx officially began orbiting its target asteroid Bennu on Monday (Dec. 31), making it a banner 24 hours for planetary science.\n\nVoyage to the Kuiper Belt\n\nIt's been a long road to Ultima Thule for New Horizons.\n\nNASA launched the $700 million nuclear-powered spacecraft in January 2006 on a mission originally aimed at Pluto. That mission was an astounding success, with New Horizons zipping by Pluto and its five moons on July 14, 2015, revealing the first-ever detailed photos of the dwarf planet (including its adorable heart).\n\nBut even before New Horizons reached Pluto (which itself is in the Kuiper Belt), mission scientists were looking to the next target. In 2014, mission scientist Marc Buie of SwRI discovered Ultima Thule (then known only by its official name, 2014 MU69) using the Hubble Space Telescope and a new destination was set. [Ultima Thule in Photos: Images from the Kuiper Belt]\n\nNew Horizons and Ultima Thule will be 4.1 billion miles away when it visits the Kuiper Belt object. This chart shows the path of New Horizons compared to other probes that have left the solar system.\n\nThe key draw of Kuiper Belt objects is their primordial nature. They are time capsules, Stern said, preserving the earliest conditions of the solar system at temperatures near absolute zero.\n\nThe object is in such a deep freeze that it's essentially preserved from its initial formation, he added. Everything that we're going to learn about Ultima, from its composition to its geology to how it's assembled, are going to teach us about the original formation conditions of the solar system.\n\nAnd scientists have a lot to learn. They've only managed to glean tantalizing clues about Ultima Thule since its discovery in 2014.\n\nIn Hubble telescope photos, Ultima Thule appears to have a reddish hue. Exactly why is unknown. Early observations suggested that it may actually be more than one object, a binary, but more recent images (including one taken on Saturday, Dec. 30) have hinted that this isn't so. Ultima Thule appears be a single object, mission scientists said.\n\nWe know it's not round, said deputy project scientist John Spencer of SwRI before the flyby. Recent images show Ultima Thule as an elongated, oval-shaped object.\n\nBut exactly what shape is Ultima Thule? How fast does it spin? Does it have craters, or a smooth surface? Does it spout dust? Could it host moons or rings or something altogether unexpected?\n\nThis is unknown exploration; anything is possible, Spencer said. Anything is possible out here when you're exploring a new class of world that you haven't seen before.\n\nOnly a detailed analysis of New Horizons' images and other data from its seven instruments will tell the tale, scientists said.\n\nWe are going to change what we know about the Kuiper Belt, literally overnight, Stern said.\n\nAnother flyby ahead?\n\nIt will take about 20 months for New Horizons to beam back all of its images and other observations of Ultima Thule. That's because it has just a small 15-watt transmitter to beam a vast amount of data home.\n\nI am in awe that we can even do this, Stern said. The spacecraft has a 15-watt transmitter on it...that's a quarter of a light bulb. And we're receiving it from 4 billion miles away.\n\nBut the New Horizons team won't be idle during that time. Scientists are actively searching for a third Kuiper Belt object for New Horizons to potentially visit.\n\nIf that target is found soon, and if it gets funding approval from NASA, the team could get the green light for another flyby, in a year that will also celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, the first by astronauts.\n\nFifty years ago, the first humans walked on another world, the moon, as a result of NASA, Stern said. And NASA was the first space agency in the world to reach every planet in the solar system, from the closest planets — Venus and Mars — to the farthest, Pluto. And now we're out exploring even further.\n\nEmail Tariq Malik at tmalik@space.com or follow him @tariqjmalik. Follow us @Spacedotcom and Facebook.
Americans are yet again going to bed unsure of who will win a major election.\n\nAs of late Tuesday night, the margins in the two Georgia Senate runoff races are razor-thin as more and more votes are reported, with races seesawing between the Republican and Democrat candidates.\n\nRepublican David Perdue, whose Senate term expired Sunday but can still win reelection, was in a dead heat with Democrat challenger Jon Ossoff Tuesday with about 95% of votes in. Meanwhile, Democrat Raphael Warnock narrowly led Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga.\n\nThe Republicans earlier in the night held a small lead but a tranche of votes was reported in DeKalb County, which makes up part of Atlanta, that closed the gap for the Democrats. As of late Tuesday night there were still scattered votes yet to be reported in several counties, both blue and red.\n\nLeads are expected to shift through Tuesday night, Wednesday morning and potentially beyond as different tranches of votes from different areas are counted.\n\nControl of the Senate is on the line in the races, with ramifications for how the incoming Biden administration will be able to pursue its agenda.\n\nAbout $500 million was spent between the two races, amounting to some of the most expensive two months of nonpresidential politics in American history. Boldface political names from across the spectrum made their Peach State pilgrimages to stump for their respective party's candidates, including a bevy of other senators, U.S. representatives and former presidential candidates.\n\nIf that was not enough to underscore the importance of the race, current, former and future presidents and vice presidents also stumped for Loeffler and Perdue, or Warnock and Ossoff, respectively.\n\nLIVE UPDATES: PERDUE, LOEFFLER 'ENCOURAGED BY HIGH TURNOUT IN GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS\n\nPresident Trump, Vice President Pence, President-elect Biden, Vice President-elect Harris and former President Obama all held at least one rally in Georgia. Pence, Trump, Harris and Biden all were in the state Monday. Harris was there Sunday.\n\nEverything that we've achieved together is on the line, Trump said Monday.\n\nUnlike any time in my career, one state, one state can chart the course, not just the next four years, but for the next generation, Biden said, also Monday.\n\nIn the November elections, Republicans won enough Senate races to control 50 seats in the chamber. That means if they win just one of the races on Tuesday, Republicans will hold a majority in the body for the next two years. If the GOP caucus remains united, they'll have an effective veto over much of Biden's agenda. That agenda, Republicans have said, would be a transformational far-left plan to change the country.\n\nYou heard Joe Biden just today say that this is a generational election. What does he mean by that? Well, it's exactly what [Senate Minority Leader] Chuck Schumer said. Take Georgia and change America, Perdue, a former businessman, said on Fox News' Special Report Monday. [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.] said, no, we want to win those two seats because we do not want to negotiate. They want the Green New Deal without compromise.\n\nIf Democrats sweep both races, however, they will bring the Senate to an effective 50-50 tie. That would mean Harris would be able to break ties on votes falling along party lines.\n\nHowever, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the situation in the Senate would be somewhat more complicated than Democrats being able to pass whatever they want.\n\nPRO-GOP GEORGIA BATTLEGROUND FIND RAISES $58 MILLION IN RUNOFF SHOWDOWNS\n\nIn the past, Republican and Democrat leaders have worked out power-sharing agreements when the body was tied 50-50. Any legislation would have to get past a filibuster. And with such tight margins, the balance of power has sometimes even changed within a single Congress -- something not entirely out of the question given the number of septuagenarians and octagenarians in Congress.\n\nMoe Vela, a former senior adviser to Biden when he was vice president, told Fox News that no matter the outcome in Georgia, he believes Biden will be able to negotiate with Republicans to get at least some of his agenda across the finish line.\n\nI disagree with most people's assessment of the impact of today's races. I don't think that they are going to alter the president-elect's agenda initiatives, Vela said. For 40-something years, over 45 years, if you go back and look at this man's career... this man knows how to work with people who don't always agree with him. This man knows how to build bridges with people who have different ideologies, different perspectives.\n\nBut nevertheless, victories for Warnock and Ossoff Tuesday would give Democrats a decided upper-hand while one win for either Loeffler or Perdue would allow Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to keep a grip on the job he's held since 2015.\n\nYOUR FOX NEWS GUIDE TO GEORGIA'S SENATE RUNOFF ELECTIONS\n\nAs final results trickle in, which areas in the state had higher turnout will be key. Republicans were counting on heavy Election Day turnout in rural areas, particularly in North Georgia, which is where President Trump held a rally Monday.\n\nA senior GOP campaign staffer told Fox News that if Republicans could turn out 1 million GOP voters on Election Day, they believed they'd win the election. Perdue and Loeffler, meanwhile, released a joint statement saying they were seeing good numbers in the precincts that matter to them.\n\nWe are encouraged by reports of high voter turnout across the state – particularly so in North Georgia, where President Trump rallied Republicans last night, the statement said. But make no mistake about it: this is going to a very close election and could come down to the difference of just a few votes in a few precincts across the state.\n\nBut, if turnout in urban areas is in the same ballpark as that in rural areas, Democrats may hold the edge. Democrats traditionally win larger margins in early voting ballots and mail-in ballots.\n\nWe've seen amazing turnout, Warnock, the pastor at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, said earlier Tuesday. Over three million folks have already voted. That's good news.\n\nSpecifically, more than one million mail ballots were returned and over two million people took advantage of Georgia's in-person early voting.\n\nUnderscoring the urgency on both sides, Republicans were sending text messages and making calls to their supporters telling them to get in line at polling places even into the 6 p.m. hour Tuesday.\n\nGEORGIA'S SENATE RUNOFF WINNERS MAY NOT BE KNOWN TONIGHT\n\nThe race has been as nationalized as any U.S. Senate race in history. Rivers of out-of-state money and support have flowed for each candidate. Ossoff, a former congressional staffer and the current CEO of a documentary film company, has taken to telling voters that the Biden agenda was achievable -- but only if voters picked him and Warnock.\n\nWe can pass a historic infrastructure plan that includes massive investments in clean energy, energy efficiency, and environmental protection, he tweeted. But we need to win the Senate.\n\nWe can pass $2000 relief checks for the people, he wrote in another post, but we have to win this Senate election.\n\nOssoff also previously ran in an extremely expensive special election for the U.S. House in Georgia but lost to former Rep. Karen Handel, R-Ga.\n\nMeanwhile, Loeffler, the part-owner of Atlanta's WNBA franchise, has shifted her approach to politics in the past year to align as much with Trump as possible and turn out his base. Loeffler, when she was first appointed to her seat in 2019, was chosen by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp over the objections of Trump, who wanted Rep. Doug Collins, R-Ga., to replace retired Sen. Danny Isakson, R-Ga.\n\nLoeffler has now said she will object to the certification of electoral votes for Biden on Wednesday and has called for the resignation of Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger -- a Kemp ally -- all while Trump has promised to campaign against Kemp in 2022.\n\nI have an announcement, Georgia. On Jan. 6, I will object to the Electoral College vote, Loeffler said at Trump's rally Monday. This president fought for us, we're fighting for him.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDepending on how close the races are, it could be Wednesday or even longer before there are definitive winners. This is partially because of the number of mail ballots the state will need to count, which are more physically laborious to tally than traditional in-person ballots.\n\nGeorgia took several days before there was a definitive winner in the presidential race in November because the results were so close -- Biden won by slightly less than 12,000 votes, a margin confirmed by multiple recounts. A similar situation is possible for the Senate races.\n\nFox News' Chad Pergram, Peter Doocy, Stephanie Bennett and Robert Sherman contributed to this report.

I took some time off of writing songs and just didn't know I was searching for… kind of where I landed was falling in love with my guitar and writing more than ever.\n\nIn 2021, the pair said they are ready to pursue solo endeavors.\n\nWe've been on a 10-year journey together and we wouldn't change it for the world, Hubbard said. We're going to continue our journey, and you as our fans have changed our lives.\n\nFLORIDA GEORGIA LINE'S TYLER HUBBARD REUNITES WITH FAMILY AFTER CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE\n\nWe created this freedom around ourselves that we can do whatever we want to do creatively and musically, he added.

A new coronavirus variant discovered in the United Kingdom is now making its rounds in the U.S., with the B.1.1.7 variant most recently identified in New York in a man who has no recent travel history.\n\nThe variant is said to be more transmissible than COVID-19 — though as of now, it's not thought to be more virulent or resistant to vaccines and treatment. That said, a new study suggests who may be most at risk for contracting B.1.1.7: Those under 20 years of age.\n\nThe study, which was conducted by researchers at Imperial College London and others and has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that those under 20 years of age are more likely to make up a higher percentage of B.1.1.7 cases — or what is identified in the study as the Variant of Concern or VOC.\n\nAvailable data indicates a shift in the age composition of reported cases, with a larger share of under 20-year-olds among reported VOC than non-VOC cases, per the study.\n\nDAILY CORONAVIRUS CASES IN CALIFORNIA SURGE PAST 45,000\n\nHowever, the researchers said that it's too soon to determine the mechanism behind this change, noting that it could have been influenced, in part, by the variants spread coinciding with a period where lockdown was in force but schools were open.\n\nFurther research is ongoing on the specific nature of any changes in how the virus affects this age group, noted a press release on the findings.\n\nUnlike COVID-19, the B.1.1.7 may be more likely to infect children, suggests the study, which echoes concerns expressed by Professor Neil Ferguson, a scientist at Imperial College London and a study author, in December.\n\nAt the time, Ferguson warned that early analysis hints that it has a higher propensity to infect children.\n\nIf it were true, then this might explain a significant proportion, maybe even the majority, of the transmission increase seen, he added, per the BBC.\n\nUS CORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL SURPASSES 350,000 AS EXPERTS ANTICIPATE POST-HOLIDAY SURGE\n\nThe Imperial College London study also estimated the reproduction number (R0) of the new variant to be between 1.4 and 1.8.\n\nThese analyses, which have informed UK government planning in recent weeks, show that the new variant of concern, B.1.1.7, has substantially higher transmissibility than previous SARS-CoV-2 viruses circulating in the U.K., said Ferguson in a statement. This will make control more difficult and further accentuates the urgency of rolling out vaccination as quickly as possible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAll viruses evolve, and very rarely a virus will change in a way that requires us to re-evaluate public health policy, added Dr. Erik Volz, a scientist at Imperial College London and one of the study authors, in a statement. We find overwhelming evidence of a change in transmissibility of the B.1.1.7 variant that should be taken into account when planning our COVID-19 response in the new year.\n\nFox News' Kayla Rivas contributed to this report.
Patricia Arquette apologized for her potty mouth at the 2019 Golden Globes.\n\nWhile accepting the award for best actress in a limited series for Escape at Dannemora, the 50-year-old actress cursed, which she later said she didn't intend to do.\n\nI didn't plan that. It was an unplanned f-bomb, Arquette admitted, according to Variety. I'm so sorry. ... You can't take [the award] back, can you?\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nArquette gained more than 40 pounds to play Tilly Mitchell in the Showtime series, and she admitted that it was a refreshing change from trying to conform to often unrealistic and unattainable body standards in Hollywood.\n\nI felt so free. I never once heard this refrain that I have heard so often in my career — 'Is she likable enough? Is she attractive enough?' She added, I'm glad to see some of these films being given opportunities. Hollywood always responds when they see so much revenue coming from it. Diversity is starting to pay off for Hollywood.\n\nArquette, who's been vocal about the gender wage gap in Hollywood and beyond, also spoke about pay parity.\n\nWe have a lot of moms out there who are sole breadwinners or primary breadwinners for their families. We have to look at equal opportunity and equal pay, she said. I'm excited about how many we have coming into the House.
California Gov. Gavin Newsom didn't waste any time picking up where his predecessor left off when it comes to criticizing President Trump.\n\nIn his inaugural speech on Monday in Sacramento, Newsom, a Democrat, slammed Trump for his perceived incompetence and vowed that California would act as the vanguard in combatting the White House's policies.\n\nThere is an administration in Washington that is clearly hostile to California and California's interests, Newsom said.\n\nCALIFORNIA VS. TRUMP\n\nWhat we do today is even more consequential, because of what's happening in our country, he added during his address. People's lives, freedom, security, the water we drink, the air we breathe — they all hang in the balance. The country is watching us. The world is waiting on us. The future depends on us. And we will seize this moment.\n\nNewsom, who is California's 40th governor, takes over the post after serving as lieutenant governor under the Golden State's former leader Jerry Brown. Under Brown, California led the nation in the battle against the Trump administration's policies on everything from immigration to climate change.\n\nCalifornia has positioned itself as the center of the Trump resistance, Jessica Levinson, a clinical law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, told Fox News. It's bloody combat.\n\nIf Newsom's comments during his inaugural speech are any indication, it appears the combat will continue.\n\nWe will offer an alternative to the corruption and incompetence in the White House, Newsom said. Our government will be progressive, principled, and always on the side of the people.\n\nCALIFORNIA DEMS FLEX NEW SUPERMJAORITY, WITH PLANS TO PURSUE GUN TAX AND MORE\n\nDuring his time on the campaign trail, Trump became an almost constant foil for Newsom. In March, Newsom put out a campaign ad calling the president's proposed border wall a monument to idiocy and referred to Trump as a small, scared bully.\n\nAnd while Newsom thanks Trump for visiting the state following last fall's deadly wildfires, he said that the president's rhetoric made it difficult to work with him.\n\nWe're grateful that he came. We're grateful for his time and attention, Newsom said, according to the Sacramento Bee. That said, we're living in an environment, tweet by tweet, day by day, issues raise themselves to the fore. That makes it challenging for us to cooperate at all levels all of the time.\n\nNewsom, who won the governorship by a landslide, takes office amid a soaring state economy that has a projected $16 billion in reserves and an additional $14.8 billion unrestricted surplus. He campaigned heavily on issues relating to housing, health care and education that could raise state spending and, during his speech, Newsom promised fiscal responsibility to prepare for uncertain times ahead.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe will be prudent stewards of taxpayer dollars, pay down debt, and meet our future obligations, he said We will build and safeguard the largest fiscal reserve of any state in American history.\n\nThe midterm elections last November saw Democrats easily take control of not only California's governor's mansion, but also its state legislature with the party now holding a veto-proof majority in both houses.\n\nNewsom, during his speech, attempted to also appeal to those conservative voters who feel disenfranchised by the election results.\n\nI intend to represent all Californians, not only those who voted for me, he said. I recognize that many in our rural communities believe that Sacramento doesn't care about them – doesn't even really see them. Well, I see you.
Green Bay Packers offensive tackle David Bakhtiari will miss the rest of the season after the three-time Pro Bowl selection injured his knee in practice Thursday.\n\nPackers coach Matt LaFleur confirmed the severity of the injury Friday. The injury comes six weeks after the standout left tackle agreed to terms on a four-year contract worth up to $105.5 million with a $30 million signing bonus.\n\nIt's just one of those unfortunate, freak things that happens sometimes in practice, LaFleur said. It was certainly nobody's fault. It was a freaky deal, and you know, it's tough to replace a guy of his caliber. I mean, you're talking about a premier left tackle in this league.\n\nThe injury was first reported by NFL Network.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nBakhtiari played a major role in helping the Packers (12-3) win a second straight NFC North title and and score a league-leading 31.6 points per game. The 2013 fourth-round pick from Colorado was one of seven Packers selected to the Pro Bowl last week.\n\nHe was a first-team Associated Press All-Pro in 2018 and a second-team selection in 2016, 2017 and 2019.\n\nQuarterback Aaron Rodgers said Friday he was still kind of in the grieving process after learning Bakhtiari wouldn't return this season.\n\nIt's tough to see a guy go down at practice like that, Rodgers said. You're hoping for the best. I got a call from him yesterday late in the afternoon. I was hoping for some good news, didn't get it. You've got to move on, but right now it's still a little raw. We're still sad and hurting for Dave just because it's our brother and it's our left tackle, our teammate. It's been a tough time for us...\n\nBakhtiari missed three games earlier this season with broken ribs.\n\nBakhtiari's injury will force Green Bay to shuffle its offensive line once again as it heads to Chicago (8-7) in a game with major implications for both teams.\n\nGreen Bay can earn the No. 1 seed in the NFC playoffs plus a first-round bye if it beats or ties the Bears, or if San Francisco (6-9) beats or ties Seattle (11-4). Chicago can clinch a playoff berth with a victory.\n\nDuring those three games, Green Bay adapted by moving usual right tackle Billy Turner over to the left side and having Rick Wagner enter at right tackle. Green Bay went 2-1 during that stretch with victories at Houston and San Francisco sandwiching a home loss to Minnesota.\n\nComplicating matters this time: Wagner suffered a knee injury Sunday in a 40-14 victory over the Tennessee Titans. LaFleur said Friday that we think he's going to be good to go for the Bears game.\n\nThe Packers have dealt with multiple injuries on the offensive line but still have allowed just 20 sacks, the second-lowest total behind Pittsburgh's 13.\n\nLane Taylor opened the year as the starting right guard but tore his ACL in the first game of the season. Bakhtiari missed those three games. Center Corey Linsley sat out three games with a knee injury. Turner sat out the Packers' first two games with a knee issue.\n\nGreen Bay withstood those losses because it has linemen who can play multiple positions. Pro Bowl selection Elgton Jenkins has made 11 starts at left guard, two at center and one at right tackle this season. Turner has started six games at right tackle, four at right guard and three at left tackle. Lucas Patrick has made 10 starts at right guard and four at left guard.\n\nLaFleur said Friday that this is the best offensive line group I've been around. The depth of that line now will face its biggest test after losing its standout player.\n\nThere's going to be nobody's that's feeling sorry for us as a football team, LaFleur said. And our standards, our expectations, they don't change. And so, we're very fortunate to have a lot of depth at that position and the versatility of guys that can play multiple spots. So we'll lean on that, we'll rally around each other and, you know, we're going to make the best of it.

The two Senate runoff elections in Georgia on Tuesday will determine the direction of our nation.\n\nAs Americans, we are blessed to live in the greatest country on the planet. Our nation was founded on the principles of freedom, liberty, and opportunity—principles afforded to us by generations of men and women who have bled and died to defend them. We should never take them for granted.\n\nIf Georgians vote for radical liberal Raphael Warnock and trust-fund socialist Jon Ossoff, they will allow Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to do exactly what he told us he would do: win Georgia and change America.\n\nWhat exactly is Schumer's idea of changing America?

MARCO RUBIO: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS -- THE FATE OF OUR NATION IS IN GEORGIA'S HANDS\n\nThis is what the left – including Warnock and Ossoff—is offering.

If you eat hamburgers or use plastic drinking straws, consider yourself part of the climate change problem. That was the assessment of Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg on Thursday during an appearance on CNN's New Day.\n\nButtigieg, the 37-year-old mayor of South Bend, Ind., told host Alisyn Camerota he thinks many people view climate issues from the perspective of guilt.\n\nYou know, from using a straw to eating a burger. Am I part of the problem? In a certain way, yes, he said. But the most exciting thing is that we can all be part of the solution.\n\nBUTTIGIEG INVOKES GOD WHILE DISCUSSING CLIMATE CHANGE: HE'D THINK POLLUTION IS 'MESSED UP'\n\nButtigieg said part of his climate-change proposal involves motivating the public.\n\nI think the downside to us facing just how colossal of a challenge this is, is it can feel paralyzing, Buttigieg said. But we can rise to meet this and be proud of it. That's part of what my climate plan is about. It's not only about all of the things we've got to do technologically and with regulation and so on. It's about summoning the energies of this country to do something unbelievably hard.\n\nIf you look at the moments when this country rose to a major challenge, overcoming the Great Depression, winning World War II, going to the moon, it required something out of all of us. And I think we could be standing taller, he continued.\n\nButtigieg made his remarks a day after he and other Democrats running for president discussed plans to combat climate change during a CNN town hall telecast Wednesday.\n\nDuring the town hall, the 2020 hopeful claimed climate change was a national security issue and that the Syrian war was the first war partly caused by climate change. He also invoked God and religion in the climate change debate, saying environmentally irresponsible behavior was kind of a sin.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nLet's talk in language that is understood across the heartland about faith, Buttigieg said. If you believe that God is watching as poison is being belched into the air of creation, and people are being harmed by it — countries are at risk of vanishing in low-lying areas — what do you suppose God thinks of that? I bet He thinks it's messed up.\n\nHe added, You don't have to be religious to see the moral dimensions of this because frankly, every religious and non-religious tradition tell us that we have some responsibility of stewardship, some responsibility of taking care of what's around us- not to mention taking care of our neighbor... At least one way of talking about this is that it's a kind of sin.\n\nFox News Joseph A. Wulfsohn contributed to this report.
Democrats used non-legislature officers in states with GOP legislatures to improperly change election laws and procedures, Mark Levin alleged on Hannity Tuesday night.\n\nIn ... Pennsylvania, which has [a] Democrat governor, Democrat secretary of state, Democrat majorities of justices on the state Supreme Court, explained the Life, Liberty & Levin host, they used all of these non-legislature officers to change the laws in Pennsylvania to assist the Democrats. So the legislature was cut out.\n\nIn Georgia, Levin continued, Democrats went after the signature requirement. They watered it down to the point where it really doesn't work anymore.\n\nLevin blasted Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger as weak and claimed they capitulated by entering a consent decree with former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams that violated the Constitution.\n\nThe Michigan secretary of state issued seven million ballots, Levin continued. The problem is, under Michigan law, you have to request a ballot. You need some identity requirements.\n\nThe syndicated radio host also alleged that similar events took place in Milwaukee, Madison, and other heavilyy Democratic parts of Wisconsin.\n\nLevin said that the Founding Fathers specifically rejected the direct election of the president as well as the idea that governors or the judiciary would be involved in the process of selecting electors.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYet in all four of those states, the executive and the judiciary had more impact and more input into the election laws leading up to this election than the state legislatures did, he concluded. They were utterly cut out. So here we have a problem. We have a constitutional crisis that nobody wants to talk about.\n\nYou had unconstitutional elections, if you follow the Constitution, unconstitutional elections as a result of what the Democrats did, circumventing the state legislatures.
The future of America is at stake Tuesday in Georgia and voters have a very simple choice. Reelecting Senators David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler will stop the Democrats' radical, left-wing agenda dead in its tracks and help preserve President Trump's many accomplishments.\n\nSending radical liberals Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock to Washington would make Chuck Schumer the next Senate Majority Leader and pave the path for him and his allies to turn America into a socialist nation.\n\n\n\nSenators Perdue and Loeffler are proven conservatives and political outsiders who have led the fight against the Democrats' extreme plans for America.\n\n\n\nWhen Washington Democrats launched a divisive and baseless impeachment effort against President Trump, Senators Perdue and Loeffler stood up and called out the shameful smears and partisan political stunts for what they were, leading to the President's rightful acquittal.\n\nSEN. JONI ERNST: GEORGIA SENATE RUNOFFS -- LET'S WIN THE PEACH STATE AND SAVE AMERICA\n\n\n\nAfter President Trump fulfilled his constitutional duty by nominating Amy Coney Barrett for the Supreme Court, Sens.

Instead, they held firm and led the fight to get Justice Barrett confirmed, securing a conservative Supreme Court for the next generation in the process.\n\nSenators Perdue and Loeffler have been stalwart champions of President Trump's agenda on everything from cutting taxes for hardworking families to securing our borders to strengthening our military and keeping our promises to veterans. They will keep fighting to protect everything President Trump has accomplished.\n\n\n\nJon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock want to go to Washington to erase everything President Trump has done for our country. The first vote they will cast is to make Democrat Chuck Schumer the next Senate Majority Leader. From there, they will act as his rubber-stamps and pass everything on his big government, socialist wish list.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n\n\nThat means President Trump's tax cuts will turn into tax hikes on American families. Democrats will change the rules and pack the Supreme Court, stealing the conservative majority secured by Trump and turning judges into nothing more than left-wing politicians in robes.\n\nDemocrats will literally start tearing down the miles of walls and reinforced infrastructure at our Southern border built by the Trump administration, taking us back to the Obama-era of open borders.\n\nThis is why Sen. Schumer recently proclaimed to his liberal supporters that now we take Georgia, then we change America!\n\nThis is the one time you should actually take Schumer at his word. If he gets the majority, he will change America, and it certainly isn't going to be the kind of change that makes us more free or prosperous.\n\nAnd this is exactly why the left is hoping that conservatives in Georgia don't appreciate what's really at stake on Tuesday. They hope conservatives simply stay home, and unknowingly hand Ossoff and Warnock victories, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schumer the keys to power.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\n\nHowever, we know better. Georgia voters who care about the future of our country and protecting President Trump's accomplishments need to go out and vote Tuesday if they haven't already.\n\nLet's send Senators Perdue and Loeffler back to Washington and send Pelosi and Schumer the message that their socialist agenda is now dead on arrival.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM SEN.

Texas fired football coach Tom Herman on Saturday, weeks after athletic director Chris Del Conte seemingly backed him.\n\nThe university made the announcement days after the Longhorns beat Colorado 55-23 in the Alamo Bowl.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nWhile we have made measured progress during the past several years under Tom Herman's leadership, Chris has recommended to the university president, Jay Hartzell, that UT make a coaching change to get us on track to achieving our ambitious goals, Texas said in a statement.\n\nPresident Jay Hartzell and the chair of the UT Board of Regents, Kevin Eltife, agreed with Del Conte's recommendation, according to the statement.\n\nHerman took over as the Longhorns' coach in 2017 and was 32-18 in that span. He led the team to a bowl game in each of his four seasons, winning every one, including the Sugar Bowl in 2018.\n\nMISSISSIPPI STATE'S MIKE LEACH 'SHOULD BE EMBARRASSED' OVER POSTGAME MELEE, ESPN STAR SAYS\n\nHowever, Texas never made it to the College Football Playoff.\n\nDel Conte seemingly ended speculation over Herman's future last month as Texas' regular season ended.\n\nMy policy is to wait until the end of the season before evaluating and commenting on our program and coaches. With the close of the regular season, I want to reiterate that Tom Herman is our coach, he said at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHerman had three seasons left on his guaranteed contract, which was going to pay him more than $6 million per year.\n\nTexas later announced they hired Alabama offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian to replace Herman.\n\nWe are excited to have Steve Sarkisian join us and lead the next chapter of our football program, Eltife said. University of Texas football has a long and proud history of competing at the highest levels within our conference and nationally, and he brings with him the coaching caliber and championship experience needed to restore this kind of excellence to our program.\n\nSarkisian was previously a head coach at USC and Washington before a stint in the NFL and Alabama.
