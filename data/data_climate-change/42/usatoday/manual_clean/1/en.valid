Ellen DeGeneres won the Globes' Carol Burnett Award for excellence in television, and although she had her own acceptance speech, she was overshadowed by Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon's introduction. McKinnon was funny (listing all the clothes she wore doing her DeGeneres impressions) and deeply moving as she recalled how DeGeneres boosted her confidence as a young gay woman. She risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth, McKinnon said. That mix of hilarity and heart is exactly the kind of thing an awards-show host needs. Maybe McKinnon will step up next year.

Weinstein has been charged with felony counts of forcible rape, forcible oral copulation, sexual penetration by use of force, and sexual battery by restraint, Los Angeles County District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced today.
Omar, who sported a red hijab Thursday, said she understands the symbolism of her historic election, especially in a time when there is so much divisiveness in our nation…It still tells people that there is hope and we should still be optimistic about the American dream. And it's really not one off. There are so many of us that are walking into Congress that really are showing this nation that we are capable of having the American dream realized.
The surge was driven largely by Democrats as the party took over House control for the first time in eight years.
Women weren't the only ones to make history Thursday.
A funny acceptance speech is always welcome, but so are those that elevate thank you to the HFPA to something deeper.

He had really high hopes, but I don't think when he was thinking about the opportunities that awaited his children as he brought us here,'' Omar recalled as she rushed to get in line for a ceremonial picture with the new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi. I don't think that he imagined that they would be of abundance - that he would within a little over 20 years take his daughter to get sworn in into the United States Congress. And so we are humbled and overwhelmed really with joy.
″It's probably the first forming galaxy we've seen, and if that's right, galaxy formation is a much more extended process than heretofore imagined,″ Stanislav Djorgovski of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics told the Associated Press back in 1987. ″That's something very new and changes our conception of how galaxies form,″ Djorgovski added.

Honestly, the best part of the awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the small organization that votes on the Globes, is that sometimes it helps shine a light on small films and TV shows that could use a boost. This year the lucky recipient was the great Ramy Youssef, the star and creator of Hulu's Ramy, who knew that this big room of Hollywood heavy hitters hadn't seen his show. But they'd better now.

Career changes accounted for about half of all moves across the country, according to a survey from United Van Lines. Retirement, lifestyle change and family were also among top reasons for moving in some regions.
There were a few chuckles to be had, but even fans of Gervais' harsh brand of humor would likely be disappointed. There weren't many barbs to his supposedly sharp humor, merely a few weak jabs at Apple and political celebrities. More than anything else, it was dull.
For years, Congress has neglected to finance the upkeep of cherished public lands — and America deserves better. Or so Pacific Crest Trail Association executive director and columnist Liz Bergeron says in this CALMatters commentary.

Was Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais even trying in his fifth time at the Globes microphone? With a glass of beer on the lectern, Gervais looked a little tired when he opened the show, reminding viewers he didn't care anymore (and never really did). He had a lackluster, lazy parade of jokes about Baby Yoda and Joe Pesci (the internet has beat him to much better jokes on the tiny alien), Felicity Huffman making license plates (the audience definitely wasn't with him there), Cats, Martin Scorsese's height and movies about pedophiles.

Have eyebrows ever been thanked at an awards show before? Stellan Skarsgard, who won best supporting actor in a limited TV series or movie for HBO's Chernobyl, helped kick off the night with an excellent and incredibly surprising speech.

Hopefully it starts a trend. Can't wait for someone to thank their fingernails.
