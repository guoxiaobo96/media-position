{"original": "Everett Potter\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like hotel room service. Be it an indulgence or a necessity, few things seem better suited to serve a jet-lagged traveler than a freshly delivered breakfast tray or a late-night sandwich. While seasoned road warriors may have their room service routines down to a science, many of us pause before picking up the phone to order. Maybe it's the fact that room service food can seem incredibly expensive, take forever to get to the room and is often tepid and less than tasty when it finally arrives. Here are five myths about room service.\\n\\n1. Room service menu prices are identical to those in the hotel's restaurant.\\n\\nIt sure doesn't seem that way. John Mariani, the legendary food critic and author of Mariani's Virtual Gourmet Newsletter , says that they are usually somewhat higher plus they add a massive service charge and very often, a gratuity.\\n\\nLarry Olmsted, author of the bestselling Real Food Fake Food, falls into that higher-priced camp as well, noting that in many cases, the exact same dishes are priced higher on the room service menu than in the hotel restaurants.\\n\\nThe culprit may be the add-ons that make room service seem like an expensive indulgence.\\n\\nAlexander Lobrano, a Paris-based food writer and restaurant critic whose newsletter is Hungry for Paris, says that room service prices aren't usually that far off those of prices in the restaurant.\\n\\nHe insists that it is those extras that can make for an expensive tab when you order that club sandwich or bowl of pasta and have it sent up to your room. What drives the prices up is the fine print of service charges, tray charges and other ways of making you pay for the pleasure of private dining, something that most hotels have pretty much fallen out of love with because it's logistically complicated.\\n\\nThose fees, add Olmsted, might include a service fee comparable to what you would tip downstairs, plus an 'in-room dining' surcharge, often in the $5-12 range, means it almost always costs more to dine in.\\n\\nFive myths about hotel housekeeping\\n\\n2. Room service food is just as fresh as I'd get in the restaurant.\\n\\nAh, not exactly. Lobrano points out that most room service items are at least partially pre-prepared, since the room service kitchen or area of a larger kitchen dedicated to room service needs to work ahead of time. And if you really want to see what's pre-prepared or dead easy to slap together, study the night owl room service menu, since those are designed so that anyone can prepare their dishes easily.\\n\\nMariani agrees, noting that whatever is being made is usually not made from the same quality of ingredients. For example, it will be chicken roll versus freshly roasted chicken. Or it has been prepped in advance as much as possible. There is usually a separate brigade of cooks, most of whom loathe being on room service duty, especially at 3 a.m.\\n\\nThe freshness debate aside, there's also the very important matter of what it tastes like when it arrives. Olmsted says it might be made just as fresh but it is practically guaranteed to take longer to reach you, meaning it is far more likely to be cold. And in most cases your entire meal is served at once versus one course at a time, exacerbating this problem.\\n\\nFive myths about hotel concierges\\n\\n3. You must tip the hotel employee who delivers room service.\\n\\nEvery hotel is different but what doesn't change is being vigilant in examining the bill. It's often a three-tiered system of service add-ons, starting with an extra room service fee that is not negotiable. Then there's a gratuity that may be automatically added, often in the vicinity of 18%. That may or may not be negotiable. Then there's a blank line for a tip, which is essentially a second chance to tip on the room service charge. It all adds up fast.\\n\\nThe problem, says Olmsted, is that with a built-in gratuity, you never know whether the staffer actually gets it. You certainly do not need to tip when two fees are added, service charge plus delivery charge, but I usually do it anyway to avoid guilt.\\n\\nSo does Lobrano, who says that I'd always rather err on the side of generosity than caution when it comes to tipping.\\n\\nTravel tipping guide: Who gets what?\\n\\n4. Room service won't do special orders.\\n\\nThey may like you to order off the menu, but hotel kitchens can accommodate you better than you might think. As a rule of thumb, room service is generally only offered at better hotels, and just like better restaurants, they will usually accommodate customers as best they can.\\n\\nThe solution may be to keep it simple, says Lobrano, who says that I find most room service kitchens are happy to oblige a request for simpler food than what's found on their menu. To wit, a good grilled cheese sandwich with some soup, or spaghetti with just butter, Parmesan and a squirt of lemon juice.\\n\\nFive myths about hotel spas\\n\\n5. Hotels restrict food delivery services to encourage guests to use room service.\\n\\nMany hotels now freely allow food deliveries from outside the hotel. In fact, in less expensive hotels, there are often restaurant delivery brochures in guest rooms. Of course, the dirty secret that the more expensive hotels don't want to 'fess up to is that outside delivery is typically far cheaper than the room service they have on offer. But hotels discourage it for other reasons besides lost revenue.\\n\\nFor security reasons, many big-city hotels don't want their corridors filled with food deliverers and are also wary of the mess that ordered-in food leaves behind, Lobrano says. But an increasing number of business hotels will allow food delivery, and I find the best way to sway an undecided front desk is to say I'll eat my ordered-in meal in the bar with a glass of their wine — no one's ever refused this request."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nMADISON, Wis. (AP) — Greg Gard looked down at the stat sheet to find something to harp on about Ethan Happ.\\n\\nHe missed four foul shots and committed three turnovers. But those miscues got glossed over by all the good things that Happ did on Tuesday night.\\n\\nThe athletic forward had 28 points in one of his best all-around efforts of the season, and undermanned Wisconsin overcame another injury to beat Indiana 71-61. Happ hit 11 of 17 shots, adding nine rebounds, four steals and two blocks for the Badgers (9-7, 2-1 Big Ten).\\n\\nHe plays hard. He makes a lot of good things happen. It's not always pretty but ... a lot of good things happen by just playing hard, Gard said.\\n\\nEspecially in the second half, when the Badgers held a 20-8 advantage on the boards.\\n\\nWe were, to be honest with you, soft on the glass, Indiana coach Archie Miller said. In the second half, the game really changed on second shots.\\n\\nCollin Hartmann led Indiana with a career-high 18 points, hitting 4 of 8 from behind the arc off the bench. Robert Johnson added 14 points and five assists.\\n\\nBut the Badgers still won their fifth straight game despite being without starting guard Brevin Pritzl, who was scratched 90 minutes before tipoff with a head injury after getting hurt in shootaround.\\n\\nBrad Davison added 14 points for Wisconsin, which extended its winning streak over the Hoosiers (8-7, 1-2) in Madison to 16 games.\\n\\nI think it's just something at Wisconsin where it's next man up — that's how we transition with new guys in different roles, the 6-foot-10 Happ said.\\n\\nIndiana had no answer for Wisconsin's athletic, do-it-all forward.\\n\\nAfter trailing by three at halftime, the Badgers took over slowly and led by about 10 for most of the last five minutes. Happ muscled his way around three defenders for an offensive rebound and putback for a 62-51 lead with 4:34 left.\\n\\nHapp added four assists, including a pass out of the post to an open Davison on the wing for a nine-point lead with 6:51 left. Indiana's Josh Newkirk slipped on the other end with the ball for a turnover to camp the momentum-swinging stretch for Wisconsin.\\n\\nHartman had 13 points in the first half to help Indiana take a 33-30 lead at the break. But the Hoosiers ended up falling to 0-4 this season on the road.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nIndiana: Hartman, who was averaging 5.3 points, hit 3 of 5 from 3-point range and took advantage of open looks from the perimeter in the first half. He helped make up for the foul trouble that plagued leading scorer Juwan Morgan, who had two points and two fouls in the half. Morgan, who averaged 18.4 points in December, finished with 17 against Wisconsin\\n\\nWisconsin: Gard's team continues to get tested with backcourt injuries after Pritzl joined fellow guards D'Mitrik Trice (foot) and Kobe King (knee) on the sideline. Davison is already playing through a shoulder injury, and 6-foot-5 Khalil Iverson's game is more suited to a small-forward role. The only other healthy true guard is former walk-on T.J. Schlundt, a junior who earned his scholarship before this season. Six-8 Aleem Ford, who normally starts at forward, also picked up backcourt minutes.\\n\\nIverson had 10 points and Ford scored nine.\\n\\nFILLING IN\\n\\nDown another key rotation player, the Badgers did get important contributions from normally little-used bench players Aaron Moesch, who had two points, three rebounds and two assists in 25 minutes; and Schlundt, who had three points on a 3-pointer and a steal in 20 minutes.\\n\\nLOW ENERGY\\n\\nWhen asked, Miller questioned his team's energy level.\\n\\nCollectively, I think every guy can raise their level a lot, he said. You just don't know what you're going to get game to game.\\n\\nQUICK CHANGE\\n\\nThe team had two or three hours to have to adjust to playing without Pritzl. It was quite the difference from a month ago, when the Badgers were blown out by Marquette in their first game without Trice and King.\\n\\nAdded toughness has been the biggest difference to Gard.\\n\\nIn terms of the toughness factor, that needs to be our identity, Gard said.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nIndiana: Wraps up a two-game road swing with visit on Saturday to Minnesota.\\n\\nWisconsin: Begins a three-game stretch on the road with a trip to Rutgers on Friday.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball coverage: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_Top25"}
{"original": "ORLANDO, Fla. — Michigan football is in purgatory. Good season followed by good season followed by down season followed by good season.\\n\\nBut never great.\\n\\nJim Harbaugh arrived five years ago and immediately gave Michigan a jolt. He deserves credit for stabilizing the program.\\n\\nYet he was hired to win big. Until he finds and develops an elite quarterback, he won't.\\n\\nHe's tried everything else.\\n\\nHarbaugh has changed defensive coordinators, defensive line coaches, offensive coordinators, quarterbacks coaches. He's changed schemes and philosophies and the way he communicates with his players.\\n\\nHe's gone from headline-making recruiting jaunts and firing lobs on Twitter to receding into the (relative) quiet inside Schembechler Hall. He's tried everything, really, to sell the program and build the program and win the kind of game he lost Wednesday against Alabama.\\n\\nThe kind of game he's yet to win.\\n\\nDARRYL STINGLEY:Derek Stingley Jr. barely knew grandpa but thinks of him 'every time I go on the field'\\n\\nTUA'S DECISION:Alabama QB says he'll make his decision about NFL draft on Jan. 6\\n\\nHe came close against Ohio State in his second season in Ann Arbor and lost by a few inches in the end. Everyone remembers the agonizing replay that gave the Buckeyes a first down that led to their winning score in overtime.\\n\\nBut Michigan would not have been in overtime if its quarterback, Wilton Speight, hadn't thrown a pick-six late in the second quarter. Speight was playing hurt that game and maybe he steps into the rushing defender in a more commanding way if he'd been healthy.\\n\\nNot that the Wolverines lost because of Speight. There were other chances to make plays. Many chances.\\n\\nYet in football it's still about the quarterback. And while it's not fair to lay the loss at Speight's feet, it is fair to say he couldn't do enough to lift his team.\\n\\nHe's not alone.\\n\\nNo Michigan quarterback has. Not in the moments when a Big Ten title is on the line.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a reason Harbaugh hasn't been able to win the conference or get to the college football playoff, this is the place to start.\\n\\nHe has no one to blame but himself.\\n\\nHarbaugh arrived in Ann Arbor with a reputation as a quarterback guru for good reason. Everywhere he'd been, he developed a difference-maker at the most critical spot on the field.\\n\\nAt San Diego, he produced Josh Johnson. At Stanford, Andrew Luck. At San Francisco he propped up Alex Smith and unleashed Colin Kaepernick.\\n\\nYeah, most coaches would've won with Luck. He was that kind of talent. But Harbaugh hasn't even found a Josh Johnson for Michigan.\\n\\nJake Rudock was the closest. A grad transfer from Iowa who got to Ann Arbor when Harbaugh did five years ago. Rudock was a fine player and is hanging around the fringes of the NFL.\\n\\nAt the time, he seemed like the starting point. Instead, he's been the high point. Better than anyone who has followed. Certainly, more consistent.\\n\\nAnd while Shea Patterson had more overall playmaking ability and absolutely improved during his two seasons under Harbaugh, he still had too many moments like Wednesday, when he'd drop back, feel the pressure, take off running, and … fumble.\\n\\nOr throw an interception.\\n\\nOr miss a deep ball to an open receiver. Though Michigan's receivers struggled to get consistently open against Alabama.\\n\\nWhich brings us to Harbaugh's other struggle since he took over the Wolverines: finding game-breakers. For if you don't have an elite quarterback, you've got to have elite playmaking.\\n\\nMichigan hasn't had either. Not at the level you see at Alabama, or Ohio State, or Clemson, or LSU, or even Georgia.\\n\\nIf you watched the semifinal last week between Ohio State and Clemson you saw speed all over the field. You also saw two endlessly talented quarterbacks.\\n\\nAgain, if you don't have one, you better have the other. Give Patterson Alabama's collection of future pros and Harbaugh doesn't lose Wednesday. Heck, give Patterson just Jerry Jeudy and the game flips.\\n\\nBut then Jeudy is the best receiver in college football. He runs routes like a 10-year NFL veteran and he's fast. And his 204-yard receiving performance earned him MVP honors in the Citrus Bowl.\\n\\nHarbaugh said Patterson played well against Alabama. He said his receivers were mostly covered. One of those statements is true.\\n\\nEven Patterson admitted he struggled. Said he missed some throws — he did. Said he couldn't calm his happy feet — he couldn't.\\n\\nStill, his feet might have been happier if his receivers found more open space down the field. Which means asking him to fit passes into impossibly tight spaces isn't fair.\\n\\nHe isn't built to do that. The truth, though, is that no quarterback at Michigan under Harbaugh has done that consistently, either.\\n\\nPatterson, like every quarterback who has played for Harbaugh in Ann Arbor, is a fine player. He's helped Michigan win lots of games.\\n\\nJust not the big games.\\n\\nUnless Harbaugh rediscovers the magic unearthing and developing quarterbacks, this isn't going to change. And U-M will be back here again next January, talking about another season that ended with a couple of losses.\\n\\nContact Shawn Windsor: 313-222-6487 or swindsor@freepress.com.

{"original": "A winter storm is expected to dump snow and ice along the East Coast, turning into a 'bomb cyclone' in New England. As temperatures continue to drop, here are some things you shouldn't leave in your car:\\n\\nCellphones\\n\\nApple advises against storing the iPhone or iPad at temperatures below negative-4 degrees, and they shouldn't be operated at temperatures lower than 32 degrees. There are similar recommendations for Samsung phones and other electronics. Lithium-ion batteries popular in cellphones are the most vulnerable component to cold, USA TODAY reports. They can stop working in extreme cold but should be OK once you get back indoors. However, repeated exposure to subzero temperatures can cause problems.\\n\\nMore:Let it snow — maybe even in Florida as cold wave tightens grip on USA\\n\\nSoda or beer\\n\\nWater expands when it freezes. And for canned liquids under pressure, that can mean explosion. The freeze temperature for Coca-Cola is 30 degrees, and the temperature for beer that's 5% alcohol by volume is 27 degrees (higher-alcohol beers freeze at lower temperatures), as NJ.com reported.\\n\\nMusical instruments\\n\\nThings contract when they freeze, so this can cause some instruments to go out of tune. More seriously, damage can be done when an instrument shrinks as a result of the cold air. If your instrument is made of real wood, the cold air can cause cracking, which is very expensive to repair. Sometimes they are broken beyond repair, according to The Real School of Music. If an instrument is left in a freezing car for a long period, try to make it warm up gradually.\\n\\nEggs\\n\\nEggs shouldn't be allowed to freeze in their shells; if that happens, throw away any cracked eggs. Keep the un-cracked ones frozen, and move them to the refrigerator before use. These can be hard cooked successfully, but other uses may be limited. That's because freezing causes the yolk to become thick and syrupy so it will not flow like an unfrozen yolk or blend very well with the egg white or other ingredients, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service.\\n\\nCanned foods\\n\\nLetting a can of beans freeze allows for the water to freeze and expand in a similar way to beer and soda. The USDA advises that this can result in a broken seal, causing spoilage. If canned food freezes, allow it to thaw in a refrigerator. If the product doesn't look and/or smell normal, throw it out. DO NOT TASTE IT! If the seams have rusted or burst, throw the cans out immediately, wrapping the burst can in plastic and disposing the food where no one, including animals can get it, according to the USDA.\\n\\nMedication\\n\\nIf you're visiting a pharmacy during the deep freeze, consider that some medications can be affected by low temperatures. Drugs like insulin can lose their effectiveness if they freeze. The same goes for any so-called suspended medication that has to be shaken before use, according to a report in The New York Times.\\n\\nLoved ones\\n\\nThis should be obvious. But it's worth noting that children and elderly people can be more susceptible to hypothermia at cold temperatures, with symptoms such as shivering, confusion and exhaustion, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. So even limited amounts of time in an unheated vehicle could be dangerous. The same goes for pets.\\n\\nA low gas tank\\n\\nKeeping a fuel tank more than half-full helps to prevent fuel lines from freezing. It's also a good idea to check fluids, such as antifreeze. The cold can affect tire pressure. A temperature change of just 10 degrees can cause a 10% reduction, or constriction, of air in tires. So tire pressure can be affected from day to night temperature, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.\\n\\nFollow Robert Allen on Twitter: @rallenMI"}

Iran funds and supports proxy militias across the Middle East.\\n\\nNew escalation:U.S. launched airstrike that killed Iran's Qasem Soleimani\\n\\nThe 62-year-old military commander played a key role in expanding Iran's influence and military reach in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His death marks a new, major escalation between Tehran and Washington following Trump's withdrawal from a nuclear accord between Iran and world powers. Soleimani had a hand in virtually every significant Iranian military and intelligence operation stretching back two decades, including a recent two-day siege against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that ended Wednesday. The assault led to the Pentagon rushing reinforcements to the diplomatic compound in Iraq.\\n\\nPro-Iran protesters want U.S. troops to leave the country.\\n\\nSoleimani was widely viewed as one of Iran's most powerful men and, at home, a heroic national figure who was standing up to Trump's maximum pressure Iran strategy that includes stinging economic sanctions and confrontational rhetoric and military deployments. Soleimani headed Iran's U.S.-sanctioned, elite Quds Force, part of the nation's hard-line paramilitary Revolutionary Guard Corps.\\n\\nIran's President Hassan Rouhani called Soleimani's killing a heinous crime and said Iran will take revenge, while Ali Rabiei, a spokesman for Iran's cabinet, said that Iran's response would be severe, swift and decisive.\\n\\nThe Pentagon defended the targeting of Soleimani as a defensive action, saying that Soleimani had orchestrated attacks on coalition bases in Iraq over the last several months - including the attack on December 27th - culminating in the death and wounding of additional American and Iraqi personnel.\\n\\nThe Trump administration considered him a terrorist and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Soleimani was killed because he was planning an imminent attack.\\n\\nHe said the operation saved American lives.\\n\\nKey figure: What we know about the strike that killed Iran's Gen.

These allies include Iraqi militiamen, Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels.\\n\\nIn the latest attacks that the Trump administration blames on Iran or its proxies, oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were hit by a missile-and-drone strike in September, temporarily halving the kingdom's oil production. Iran also shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz, a key passageway for oil, and laid mines targeting oil tankers. At the time, Trump pulled back from retaliating for the attacks. Oil prices surged more than 4% Friday on concerns Iran may respond to Soleimani's killing by disrupting global supplies."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nTHOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) — Matt LaFleur knows the Falcons well after spending the previous two seasons as quarterbacks coach in Atlanta before joining the Los Angeles Rams.\\n\\nBut the first-year offensive coordinator can only do so much to help the Rams' defensive staff ahead of their playoff game against the Falcons on Saturday night. LaFleur has been available to the defensive coaching staff this week, but doesn't believe he can offer much that cannot be gleaned from the usual film study.\\n\\nSure, there are some things that they ask me about in terms of some of the scheme — I can't really get into those specific questions — that I'll share with them, but I kind of leave them alone, LaFleur said Thursday. If they have a question, I'm here for them and I'll try to do the best I can, but it's not like I'm sitting there studying their tape.\\n\\nInstead, LaFleur's knowledge of Atlanta's personnel and scheme have him focused on trying to make sure the Rams (11-5) can match the Falcons (10-6) score for score if it comes to that.\\n\\nAtlanta averaged 22.1 points per game, down 12 points from last season when they led the NFL in scoring and won the NFC title before losing the Super Bowl to New England in crushing fashion. However, the Falcons are a perfect 10-0 this season when scoring at least 20 points.\\n\\nThe Rams went from last in scoring last season to averaging a league-leading 29.9 points per game while winning their first NFC West title since 2003.\\n\\nLaFleur sees similarities between the two teams in terms of the quality of the overall offensive personnel.\\n\\nBoth achieve balance between the run and pass.\\n\\nThe Rams ride running back Todd Gurley, while the Falcons share the load on the ground between Devonta Freeman and Tevin Coleman. Julio Jones had 35 percent of Atlanta's receiving yards, compared to a Los Angeles passing offense with its top four options all averaging between 39.5 and 65.1 yards receiving per game.\\n\\nI feel both of us have two of the more elite groups in this league, so there's going to be a lot of explosive weaponry on the offensive side of the ball, that's for sure, LaFleur said.\\n\\nThe biggest contrast comes in the experience level of the two quarterbacks, LaFleur said. Jared Goff will be making his first postseason start and 23rd overall for the Rams. Falcons stalwart Matt Ryan has 164 career starts between the regular season and playoffs.\\n\\nDespite working with Goff and Ryan at different points in their careers, LaFleur sees a similar resolve in each.\\n\\nBoth of them have battled through adversity, LaFleur said. You look at Matt in 2015, some might say he struggled. And then he rebounds and he's the league MVP. Same goes for Jared. I know his rookie year didn't go as well for him. And then you look at him this year. I think he has handled himself and has shown improvement on a weekly basis. The mindset, the mentality that those guys have is very similar.\\n\\nLaFleur has tried not to think about the friendships and professional relationships he built with the Falcons in 2015-16, but expects that might change once he gets to the Coliseum. He already went through that experience in the regular-season finale against San Francisco, where his brother Mike LaFleur is the wide receivers coach and passing game coordinator. Matt LaFleur also got to catch up with 49ers head coach Kyle Shanahan, the Falcons' offensive coordinator when he was in Atlanta.\\n\\nYou try to get the meet-and-greet out of the way early and then go back into the locker room and just kind of get your mind right for the game, LaFleur said. There's always time for that stuff postgame. Ultimately, we're all there to win a football game.\\n\\nNOTES: LB Mark Barron (Achilles) practiced in full Thursday and is expected to start after missing the final two regular-season games. .

{"original": "Kim Komando\\n\\nSpecial to USA TODAY\\n\\nAirPods were a holiday season top seller, and if you haven't already cut the cord on your earbuds, you can expect to do so soon. Small, sleek, and Bluetooth-enabled, AirPods have turned regular old earphones into dynamic devices in their own right, and they have only improved with each generation.\\n\\nYet, many people are concerned that AirPods may cause cancer since they are embedded within one's ear canal, directly exposing the inner ear to EMF radiation. The proximity to the brain is also alarming to many scientists. Tap or click here to read the research 250 scientists presented to the United Nations and World Health Organization.\\n\\nThe earbuds are pricey, retailing from $159 to $259 on Apple's site. But one clever Redditor built his own Airpods using parts purchased on eBay. Tap or click here to learn how he made AirPods for $4.\\n\\nIf you're new to AirPods, here are 9 helpful tips that will enhance your auditory experience. I bet you'll find more than one on this list you'll use time and time again.\\n\\n1. Use only one pod when in a pinch\\n\\nAlthough you can expect your AirPods to last several hours on a single charge, here's a clever, quick fix for when you're in a battery pinch. Leave one AirPod in the charging case while you use the other. Swap them when necessary.\\n\\n2. Put Siri to work for you\\n\\nIf you installed the latest operating system, Siri can read your incoming messages via your AirPods, using nothing but your voice. After listening to your messages, you also have the option to reply to texts with a voice command.\\n\\nThe latest models of AirPods let you summon Siri with the simple Hey Siri command. You can request Siri to help with any number of additional tasks, such as change songs, turn up the volume or get the weather forecast.\\n\\nDo proceed with caution, though. Apple gives you the option to disable Siri's audio collection. Tap or click here to learn which privacy setting you must change to keep Siri from spying on you.\\n\\niPhones top tech seller for 2019:But AirPods the hit\\n\\n3. Easily connect your AirPods to your various devices\\n\\nUsers routinely connect their AirPods to their iPhone, Macbook, iPad, and Apple Watch simultaneously. AirPods automatically switch audio between the two devices. But there may be occasions you want to put down your iPhone and use your AirPods to listen to the audio from your Mac or iPad.\\n\\nThe transition requires little effort if you pair your AirPods with your iPhone first. That's the trick. This process connects the headset to your Apple account, which will allow the buds to work across all of your Apple devices.\\n\\nTo switch up devices open Control Center (swipe down the home screen on iPhone X or newer and swipe up on an iPhone 8 or older). Press down on the audio card in the upper right corner of Music and tap on the device you want to use.\\n\\n4. Share the AirPod love\\n\\nBecause AirPods are wireless, you can opt to share the earbuds with someone else when listening to music or watching a movie. Even if you receive a phone call while sharing your earbuds, you both can hear the phone conversation. Do keep in mind because only one mic is active at a time; only one person can speak to the caller.\\n\\n5. Find your lost AirPod\\n\\nAirPods are super easy to lose. If you need to replace one AirPod, a 2nd gen is $69 each, and an individual AirPod Pro is $89. Make it routine that when you are done using your AirPods, you drop them directly back into its charging case. Knowing that might not always happen, it's essential to take precautionary steps now.\\n\\nIf you have the Find my iPhone feature activated on your portable device and have paired it with your AirPods, you can also use this feature to locate your lost earbuds. When you need to find missing AirPods, go into your iPhone Settings, and tap your name. Click Find My and enable Find My iPhone and Send Last Location.\\n\\n6. Know who's calling without looking\\n\\nThanks to your AirPods and Siri, you can hear who is calling without needing to check your iPhone. To enable this feature, go into your iPhone Settings and tap on Phone, then tap Announce Calls and select Always. Nice.\\n\\n7. Use your AirPods with non-Apple products\\n\\nDespite what you may think, AirPods are not exclusive to Apple products. You can use your earbuds with other iOS gear not logged into an iCloud account or with Android devices.\\n\\nWith your AirPods in the closed case, open the lid, press and hold down the pairing button on the back of the case. Launch the Bluetooth settings on your device, the select AirPods to confirm pairing. To re-pair with your iPhone when done, reselect AirPods within your iPhone's Bluetooth settings.\\n\\nIf you're wondering how AirPods compare to Bose, Beats, Echo and Sony's similar products, tap or click here for my complete buying guide.\\n\\n8. Turn your AirPods into a makeshift hearing aid\\n\\nIf you have ever had difficulty hearing someone during a conversation, AirPods can be your on-demand hearing aid. Apple introduced a feature, starting with iOS 12, called Live Listen. Once set up, you can place your iPhone closer to the person you want to hear, and the AirPods will produce clearer audio for you.\\n\\nTo set up this feature, go into your iPhone Settings and click Control Center. Select Customize Controls and tap the plus sign next to Hearing. When ready, place the AirPods in your ears, and either swipe down your iPhone X (or newer) home screen or up on an iPhone 8 or older and click the ear icon. Tap Live Listen.\\n\\n9. Customize how you use your AirPods\\n\\nAlthough the default double-tap settings on your AirPods are functional as is, you may wish to change them. It's easy to customize both the double-tap or press-and-hold settings for either earbud.\\n\\nWith your AirPods connected to your iPhone or iPad, go into Settings and select Bluetooth. Click on the i icon next to your AirPods and choose the left or right to make changes. Options include play, pause, play genre and skip to next track.\\n\\nLearn about all the latest technology on the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nDallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle responded angrily Sunday after LaVar Ball's claim that the Los Angeles Lakers no longer want to play for coach Luke Walton.\\n\\nBall, the outspoken father of Lakers point guard Lonzo Ball, made his latest outlandish statement to ESPN for a story published Sunday. He said Walton is too young to coach and has no control of the team — comments that Walton said didn't bother him, but ones that clearly angered some of his NBA coaching colleagues.\\n\\nCarlisle, the National Basketball Coaches Association president, called the article a disgrace and LaVar Ball's words an ignorant distraction.\\n\\nESPN is an NBA partner, and they've been a great one, Carlisle said. Part of that partnership is the coaches do a lot of things to help them with access, interviews, all those kinds of things, and in exchange for that, they should back up the coaches. Printing an article where the father of an NBA player has an opinion that's printed as anything legitimate erodes trust. It erodes the trust that we built with ESPN, and our coaches are upset.\\n\\nLuke Walton does not deserve that, Carlisle added.\\n\\nLongtime ESPN college basketball announcer Dick Vitale wrote on Twitter that Ball totally aggravates me more than any other personality in my 39 yrs and lamented that media outlets enable him to scream his absurd opinions by providing a forum for him.\\n\\nThe Lakers beat Atlanta 132-113 on Sunday night to snap a nine-game losing streak. At the team's morning shootaround, Walton said he is certain that he has the support of the Lakers' front office and that he was mostly concerned that Lonzo Ball could be adversely affected by his father's comments.\\n\\nIt doesn't bother me, Walton said. My only concern with any of it is for Zo. As long as Zo is fine with it and Zo can come in and play and it doesn't affect mine and his relationship, then it doesn't bother me at all.\\n\\nWalton said before the game that some coaches have reached out to him after the comments.\\n\\nThey're all on the same idea of it's our job as coaches to coach our teams and not be concerned with parents and what other people outside the organization think, Walton said. A lot of them have shown their support as far as they know what it's like coaching young teams and from what they see, how hard our group plays, just like I do.\\n\\nLonzo Ball did not seem affected one way or another.\\n\\nHe's going to speak his mind, Lonzo Ball said of his father. He's not going to change.\\n\\nLaVar Ball made the comments in Lithuania, where Lonzo Ball's two younger brothers — LiAngelo Ball, 19, and LaMelo Ball, 16 — are now part of a team called BC Prienu Vytautas. LiAngelo Ball left UCLA after getting suspended and arrested for shoplifting during the Bruins' season-opening trip to China in November, and LaMelo Ball was removed from Chino Hills High in California so he could join the Lithuanian club.\\n\\nCalling out Walton is just the latest in an ongoing series of sagas.\\n\\nLaVar Ball has made headlines in the past for, among many other things, insisting that no other team should draft Lonzo Ball except the Lakers, placing a $495 price tag on the sneakers offered by his Big Baller Brand clothing line, saying he could beat Michael Jordan 1-on-1 and getting into a rift with President Donald Trump over how LiAngelo Ball was ultimately allowed to return to the U.S. following his shoplifting issue in China.\\n\\nLaVar Ball's comments on Walton overshadowed many other storylines in the same piece, including his prediction that LiAngelo Ball will play for the Lakers next season — and that LeBron James will leave Cleveland and join them.\\n\\nGet rid of everybody, LaVar Ball told ESPN. Give him LeBron and Gelo. You got a 2 and a 3. And it's a win. It's a wrap.\\n\\nKnicks coach Jeff Hornacek, whose team was in Dallas to face the Mavericks and Carlisle on Sunday, suggested that LaVar Ball doesn't know enough about the inner workings of NBA locker rooms to make conclusions on the coaching process.\\n\\nNobody's with these guys every day and when they have comments on teams, chemistry, that kind of stuff, they don't really know what's going on in the overall picture, Hornacek said. Yeah, there probably shouldn't be many comments from outside.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP freelance writers Dave Jackson in Dallas and Alex Vejar in Los Angeles contributed to this report."}
{"original": "Robert Powell\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nQ: My father, who is 88, sent a few HH bonds that he purchased in 1996 to Treasury Retail Securities Site in Minnesota. He got the principal/face value amount of these sent to him but we are confused about any interest that is due. The lower left hand corner of the bond stated that the deferred interest was $438.64. – Ken Idstein Waukegan, IL\\n\\nA: The interest HH bonds earn each year is reported on a form IRS 1099-INT issued to the bondholder, says Jean-Luc Bourdon, a certified public accountant and personal financial specialist with BrightPath Wealth Planning, LLC. That way, the interest gets included on the bondholder's yearly federal income tax return, he says. The interest is not taxable for state income tax purposes.\\n\\nNow, because your father paid tax on the interest he got from his HH bond each year, the amount of deferred interest listed on the bond is understandably confusing, says Bourdon.\\n\\nAccording to Bourdon, here's how it came about: When your father got his HH bond in 1996, they were only available in exchange for other bonds. If the bond(s) exchanged had deferred interest, that interest got included in the face amount of the HH bond. Because that interest was rolled into the HH bond and not paid to your father, federal income tax on that deferred interest was postponed.\\n\\nNow that your father cashed in the HH bond, the form IRS 1099-INT he gets this coming January will include the $438.64 of deferred interest listed on the bond, says Bourdon.\\n\\nYou can find more details at https://www.treasurydirect.gov/indiv/research/indepth/hhbonds/res_hhbonds_hhtaxconsider.htm\\n\\nQ: I purchased I bonds in 2000 and 2001 yielding around 5% and plan to hold them as long as possible based on the 30 years I have available. My wife and I are 65 [and retired] with infant grandchildren. Is there any way I can use these for their college needs and avoid the taxation at that time on the interest earned? The I bonds were issued one-half to me (with my wife as beneficiary) and one-half to her (with me as beneficiary). – Steven Steinberg, Buffalo Grove, IL\\n\\nA: For the Series I bonds or Series EE bonds to qualify for the interest exclusion of the Education Savings Bond program, they must be used to cover the educational expenses of the taxpayer, taxpayer's spouse or taxpayer's dependent within the meaning of IRS Code Section 151, says Stephen Allen, a personal financial specialist with Reitz & Allen CPAs,\\n\\nSince your intent is for the funds to be used for the education of your infant grandchildren, who I would assume are not your dependents, it would not qualify for the interest earned exclusion, says Allen, who is also a member of the AICPA's PFP Executive Committee.\\n\\nAn additional provision for it to meet the qualification, says Allen, is the bonds have to be issued after 1989 to an individual that is at least 24 years old before the bond's issue date.\\n\\nYou could possible look into transferring ownership of record for the series I bonds to his children, but the date provision above could limit this possibility, says Allen. If they were over age 24 when the bonds were issued, they could list the grandchildren as beneficiary. But this change process would entail much more clarity on the facts and extremely careful planning to facilitate such a change.\\n\\nRobert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, contributes regularly to USA TODAY, The Wall Street Journal and MarketWatch.

{"original": "Staton McGowin went house hunting seven years ago but couldn't afford the monthly mortgage payments on his $18-an-hour construction worker salary.\\n\\nNow 29 and an electrical engineer, McGowin's pay has more than doubled, allowing the Greenville, Texas, resident to easily purchase a $223,000 newly built starter home, which he and his girlfriend, Caitlin Nance, moved into late last month.\\n\\nAltura Homes sold McGowin the three-bedroom, one-story home after ramping up construction of entry-level houses last year. Units costing less than $300,000 made up about 50% of the company's production in 2019, up from 20% to 30% the previous six years.\\n\\nIn the last 12 months, we have made an effort to try to build more affordable homes, Altura CEO Justin Webb says. We just know there are buyers out there.\\n\\nThe starter home, an endangered species since the housing recovery began eight years ago, is making a comeback. Builders are putting up more small, low-priced homes as demand from millennials picks up and contractors figure out how to turn a profit from the units, even with persistently high construction costs.\\n\\nBuilders are finally pushing to capture first-time buyers, says economist Yelena Maleyev of Grant Thornton.\\n\\nThe pickup is also helping address a nationwide shortage of affordable housing for low- to middle-income Americans of all age groups, says Stephen Kim, a senior housing analyst at Evercore ISI.\\n\\nStore closings:Macy's is reportedly closing more than two dozen stores. Is your location on the list?\\n\\nIn November, single-family homes and townhouses priced at $200,000 to $299,000 comprised about 34% of all new home sales through the first 11 months of last year, up from 30% in 2017 and 2018, U.S. Census Bureau figures show. The median price of a new home in the third quarter was $311,000, according to the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB).\\n\\nBut since prices keep climbing and vary widely depending on the market, house size trends are even more telling. From 2015 to 2018, the share of new houses under 2,400 square feet rose to 51% from 47%, according to an NAHB analysis of Census Bureau data.\\n\\nThere's some movement in the right direction, says NAHB Chief Economist Robert Dietz. We think it's a fairly clear signal.\\n\\nSmall new homes nearly vanished\\n\\nWhen the housing recovery began in 2012 following the late 2000s crash, the trend was decidedly in the other direction. The share of new homes with less than 2,400 square feet was tumbling after reaching 60% in 2009. Many of the first-time buyers who drove sales during the housing bubble left the market after their risky subprime mortgages imploded and they lost their homes to foreclosure.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the Great Recession of 2007-09 set back the early careers of the millennials who were supposed to comprise a new crop of first-time buyers, leading many to delay marriage and children. That, combined with massive student loan debt, prompted many young adults to live with relatives, or to rent, and put off home purchases.\\n\\nBanks, meanwhile, tightened lending standards after the housing meltdown, making it harder to qualify for a mortgage even for millennials who wanted to buy.\\n\\nAt the same time, construction costs soared as housing emerged from the depths. Land prices leaped because of a shortage of developed lots. Labor expenses shot up amid construction worker shortages after laid-off employees left the industry. And material costs surged, most recently because of Trump Administration tariffs on imports such as Canadian lumber.\\n\\nDoes claiming benefits early make sense?:Why claiming Social Security early could be more popular than ever this decade\\n\\nHomebuilders also faced stringent local regulations that limited construction of smaller homes and townhouses.\\n\\nBuilders, in turn, overwhelmingly put up larger homes priced above $400,000 that could earn a healthy profit despite the higher costs and sold them to higher-income buyers who were trading up or moving into the luxury market.\\n\\nIt became increasingly difficult to build entry-level homes, says Jerry Konter, president of Konter Quality Homes in Savannah, Georgia.\\n\\nThe tide is turning\\n\\nBut many older millennials in their early to mid-30s have better-paying jobs and savings for down payments. They're finally getting married and having kids. And they're moving to the suburbs from the urban cores they favored in their 20s, says Brad Hunter, managing director of RCLCO, a real estate consulting firm.\\n\\nIn the third quarter of 2019, 37.5% of millennials owned homes, up from 36.8% a year earlier and the largest share since 2011. Millennials also made up the biggest portion of all homebuyers in 2018, at 37%, according to the National Association of Realtors.\\n\\nIt's just the peace of mind knowing I'm investing in something that can benefit me in the future instead of burning money on rent, says McGowin, the freshly minted Greenville, Texas, homeowner. While his higher salary allowed him to qualify for a bigger mortgage, he also whittled down his student loan debt to about $3,500 from $24,000 when he first shopped for a home.\\n\\nBuilders, meanwhile, have figured out ways to squeeze out an industry average 20% profit margin on starter homes despite the higher costs. Their chief strategy: provide just a handful of choices for floor plans and features such as cabinets, countertops, and carpeting. That allows them to order materials in bulk so they can get discounts and minimize changes that delay construction and add costs, Kim says.\\n\\nBuilders have been able to crack the code, he says.\\n\\nNational homebuilder D.R. Horton led the effort, launching its Express Homes division in 2014 to target first-time homebuyers, Hunter says. The brand offers fewer floor plans and little to no options, company vice president Jessica Hansen said in an email. It also has lower material costs because it's such a large buyer. And it snapped up lots of land before prices skyrocketed.\\n\\nNoting that its flagship D.R. Horton brand also has been putting up more entry-level homes, Hansen says 68% of the houses it closed in fiscal 2019 were priced at less than $300,000.\\n\\nThe other national builders have followed that path the past couple of years. Besides offering fewer floor plans, Pulte Group typically builds starter homes a little further from the city center where land is less expensive, says company Vice President Jim Zeumer.\\n\\nIn its fourth-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Lennar said it produced 16% more homes compared to a year ago but its average sales price fell 7%. Entry-level homes make up about 40% of its business, the company recently said.\\n\\nWhile starter homes are cheaper, builders can put them up more quickly and in greater numbers, helping offset lower per-unit profits, Kim says. It takes as little as three months to complete a starter house, he says, compared with six months or longer for pricier units.\\n\\nPrices have risen\\n\\nOne caveat: With entry-level homes still in short supply, their average price has climbed from about $200,000 to nearly $300,000 the past several years, Hunter says. Even existing starter homes are appreciating at nearly twice the rate of expensive houses, according to real estate research firm Trulia. That could shut out some first-time buyers but it bolsters the business case for affordable homes.\\n\\nFor example, luxury home builder Toll Brothers, with an average sale price close to $900,000, has waded into starter homes but with a higher price range of $300,000 to $500,000, says company Senior Vice President Fred Cooper.\\n\\nNoting that many millennials waited until their mid-30s to buy, he says, The choices of first-time homebuyers may not be traditional…Instead, they're looking for more features and a more upscale design.\\n\\nRegulations are also slowly easing in some areas, Dietz says. Places like Minneapolis and Oregon are allowing higher housing densities.\\n\\nKonter, the Savannah builder, notes the Trump administration is relaxing a 2015 rule that restricted development even on small wetlands areas. That – along with strategies such as smaller bedroom doors that don't swing out as much to save space -- should help Konter build about 10 starter homes this year and 35 in 2021, he says.\\n\\nWebb, the Texas builder, developed the community where McGowin lives after obtaining a zoning change that let him construct more houses on smaller lots.\\n\\nThe market is fixing itself, he says."}
{"original": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. – As the third round of his UFC 232 meeting with Andrei Arlovski this past Saturday came to an end, Walt Harris believed he'd done enough to take the nod.\\n\\nBut then, upon hearing that one of the three judges had given Arlovski (27-18 MMA, 16-12 UFC) all three rounds of the heavyweight match, Harris (12-7 MMA, 5-6 UFC) was nervous.\\n\\nI've been on the bad end of some decisions since I got in the UFC, and I was like, 'Man, here we go again, Harris told reporters, including MMAjunkie, after the FS1-broadcast preliminary card bout at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif.\\n\\nFortunately for Harris, that one judge turned out to be a dissenting voice. The other two gave him 29-28 scores, thus sealing via split decision what Harris says assertively is the biggest win of his career.\\n\\nLike I told Andrei after the fight, I was like, 'Dude, it was an honor,' Harris said. I used to literally watch him fight before I started fighting. I got started pretty late fighting, so I was watching him, ordering his pay-per-views, like there's no way in hell I'd fight that dude. And there I am in the cage with him. It was kind of surreal, but then I had to snap out of it.\\n\\nHarris didn't get to put Arlovski away like he wanted, but he did get to score a win over a former UFC champion. The win rounded out a perfect 2018 in the cage for Harris, who'd knocked out Daniel Spitz back in June. As a bonus, current 0-3 stretch aside, Arlovski is still a presence in the UFC's official heavyweight rankings – meaning that Harris could be making his own appearance there soon.\\n\\nAll in all, not a bad place to be. But the 35-year-old heavyweight says there's still plenty of room to grow.\\n\\nI want somebody in the top-15 – If not top-10, Harris said. I'm just getting better, man. I feel like the sky's the limit for me in 2019. I made a gym change, I got new people around me in my life and I'm the happiest I've ever been since I've been in the UFC. So I feel like everything is about to start clicking for me.\\n\\nSo whatever the UFC has for me, whatever they offer, I'm willing to take it. I think you guys know that I'm ready to fight anybody.

{"original": "The Associated Press\\n\\nDAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Fernando Alonso needed just three laps around Daytona International Speedway to recognize the magnitude of one of auto racing's iconic venues.\\n\\nThe Formula One star is entered in the Rolex 24 at Daytona, one of the most prestigious sports car races in the world, as the Spaniard attempts to cross another event off his bucket list. He skipped the Grand Prix of Monaco last year to race the Indianapolis 500, and his participation captured attention all around the world.\\n\\nThat Indy venture last May was his first time racing on an oval, his first time in an Indy car, and Alonso was dazzling until his engine blew late in the race. As he tested Friday for Rolex, held Jan. 26-27, he soaked in his newest venture.\\n\\nYou feel, you smell motor racing here, Alonso said. That's a good feeling for any driver. The speedway is amazing. The size is huge. I did only three laps this morning, yet enough to have a feeling in the car and on the speedway as well.\\n\\nThe high banking was special. You feel the compression in the body, you feel the visibility change… it was good fun. The best feeling.\\n\\nPENSKE:Taylor, Rahal among top drivers joining team's sports car lineup\\n\\nPRUETT:To end 50-year racing career after Rolex 24 at Daytona\\n\\nFORMULA ONE:Announces 2018 race schedule; Brazil security issue raised\\n\\nNASCAR:Announces start times, TV networks for 2018 Cup season\\n\\nAlonso was a surprise entry at Indy last year when McLaren boss Zak Brown gave him the greenlight to skip Monaco and knock The Greatest Spectacle in Racing off a list Alonso considers iconic events. Now he's got permission to run the twice-round-the-clock race at Daytona — he's driving a Ligier LMP2 in the Prototype class for United Autosports — and he hopes the same AloMania that swept Indy will follow him to this sports car event.\\n\\nBut the Rolex 24 draws a massive group of world-renowned racers, and Alonso is just another driver in a firesuit at Daytona. His two F1 championships are envied, but the field has plenty of accomplished racers.\\n\\nThere are so many good drivers here from different series, and I think that's the key to this race, said 2016 IndyCar champion Simon Pagenaud. The best drivers from everywhere come over here to do the first race of the year, to get warmed up and try to bring the big trophy home. It's exciting to have Fernando, but exciting to have all the names.\\n\\nIndyCar driver Graham Rahal applauded Alonso's desire, and noted his participation will only help IMSA's profile.\\n\\nClearly he's a racer. Obviously, he loves it, or he wouldn't be doing all the things he's doing, Rahal said. But all of us are, so hopefully the combination of everybody (racing) will help elevate the sport and sports car racing.\\n\\nMuch like Indy, the Rolex will be a series of firsts for Alonso.\\n\\nPHOTOS: FERNANDO ALONSO THROUGH THE YEARS\\n\\nAlthough he's driven a sports car earlier in his career, he said the race later this month will be his first endurance event, his first time driving a sports car at night, his first time driving a prototype, his first time having to navigate traffic from the slower GT classes\\n\\nHe's confident he will have the hang of it when he returns to race in three weeks.\\n\\nIt's the same goal as Indianapolis: try to learn different driving techniques, try to learn from the specialists of endurance racing, try to be a better driver when the 24 hours finish, he said. So many new things will come step by step. It's quite a big challenge. But like what happened at Indianapolis, if you feel the opportunity and you feel competitive, you go for it.\\n\\nAs soon as you smell the blood, you go for it, like the sharks.\\n\\nAlonso led 27 laps at Indy driving for Andretti Autosport and was a contender for the win. His engine failed 21 laps from the finish.\\n\\nIt was still considered a massive success, for IndyCar, the speedway and the storied race because Alonso was so humble and charming during the buildup to the event. He's made no secret of his desire to continue entering iconic events and has his eye on the 24 Hours of LeMans should his schedule permit.\\n\\nThe main focus and priority for me is Formula 1 and winning the third world championship, he said. But to race in some iconic events and not disturb Formula 1 is also in the plan. Doing this race is the first step in the endurance championship, learning how these races are and how much I (might) enjoy them. After the 24 Hours in Daytona, I will have a better understanding.\\n\\nBut LeMans 24 Hour and Triple Crown is another goal. If I can fit LeMans 24 this year, because I am not doing the Indy 500, that will be great. Hopefully the following year, the Indy 500 can be in the plan again.\\n\\nWhat about NASCAR?\\n\\nWell, Alonso said it's not on his list right now, in part because of how much time he'd need to devote toward figuring out a stock car. Even so, after just one day at Daytona, he's hooked and plans to be among the viewing audience for next month's NASCAR season-opening Daytona 500.\\n\\nI imagine the grandstand full of people for the NASCAR race (Daytona 500) and that would be an amazing thing to experience, Alonso said. That is not my thoughts at the moment because NASCAR driving technique is very unique. I would need a lot of practice, a lot of test, before making that adventure, and at the moment I don't have enough weekends free.\\n\\nBut definitely after being here for the 24 Hours, definitely I will watch the race on TV and enjoy the NASCAR race.\\n\\nCopyright 2017 The Associated Press.

She remains without remorse, defiant, proclaiming, I am entitled to my privacy.\\n\\nEntitled sure is the right word.\\n\\nWhat's so offensive about Hillary's charade is her complete ignorance about what life is like for immigrants and people of color in this country.

All due respect, we aren't the ones pretending not to know the English word for cucumber. We aren't the ones who decided to change our names to sound more ethnic, more than two decades into our lives. We aren't the ones who change our accent every time we are on television.\\n\\nThere are plenty of people in this country who speak with accents, who were born somewhere else and came here for a better way of life. The melting pot that is the United States of America is at the heart of what makes our country truly great. Real immigrants are the backbone of our lives and the very foundation of our national identity. They are communities of grit, heart, passion and courage. They are proud of their heritage and home. They live lives of honesty and decency.\\n\\n2020 lessons:2020 was the 'apocalypse' that must continue in 2021 to correct what COVID has revealed\\n\\nHillary suggests she isn't hurting anybody with her deceptions. That might very well be true, but they are incredibly tone deaf and disrespectful when you consider the cultural context we find ourselves navigating in the here and now. She can romanticize what it means to be from a different culture. She can learn the language and give her children more ethnic-sounding names. But neither she nor her children will have to confront the other side of being nonwhite or nonnative in America. They will never be profiled or stereotyped because of their accents or physical attributes. They will not be taunted with racial tropes or have their potential handicapped by ignorance and intolerance.\\n\\nUltimately, how Hillary Baldwin handles this going forward is her choice, and that's the point I'm trying to make.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nCLEVELAND (AP) — Cavaliers coach Larry Drew hoped a team meeting following a blowout loss a night earlier would move his struggling team in a positive direction.\\n\\nInstead, Cleveland's ninth straight loss was its most lopsided of the season.\\n\\nJrue Holiday and Julius Randle both scored 22 points, and the New Orleans Pelicans routed the Cavaliers 133-98 on Saturday.\\n\\nThe defeat came a night after Drew and his players had a long talk following a 26-point loss to Utah. Cleveland (8-32) not only has the worst record in the league, but hasn't played competitive basketball during most of the losing streak.\\n\\nWe knew they played last night, so for us, we wanted to get out and run more to get them tired, said Pelicans star Anthony Davis, who didn't play in the fourth quarter. We know they've been struggling in third quarters, so we went out hard.\\n\\nThe Cavaliers have lost six straight at home by a total of 141 points. The last five defeats have been by 20 or more points, an NBA record.\\n\\nDrew benched four starters when New Orleans began the third quarter with a 15-0 run, which likely will lead to lineup changes when Cleveland hosts Indiana on Tuesday.\\n\\nWe can't continue to go at this rate, Drew said. I refuse to. It's important these guys understand that, one, this is not acceptable and, two, I'm not going to let this continue at this pace. I've got to do something different.\\n\\nCenter Tristan Thompson has gone from playing on a team that reached four straight NBA Finals to one that seems to get blown out every night.\\n\\nIt definitely tests your character, he said. If you love the game and you care about being a competitor, you're going to hate times like this. You're going to have sleepless nights and it's gong to mess with you.\\n\\nDavis had 20 points and 10 rebounds. Randle had 12 rebounds and six Pelicans scored in double figures.\\n\\nOur offense was really good and our defense was really good, coach Alvin Gentry said. When you're running on misses, not makes, it makes a big difference for your offense.\\n\\nJordan Clarkson led Cleveland with 23 points. Rookie Collin Sexton and Jalen Jones both had 15.\\n\\nNew Orleans' third-quarter run pushed the lead to 76-52, and Larry Nance Jr. was the only Cleveland starter who remained on the floor. The margin grew throughout the second half and reached 39 points at 132-93 in the last two minutes.\\n\\nDavis set a franchise record with 26 rebounds and scored a game-high 34 points in Wednesday's loss to Brooklyn. Nance and Thompson each picked up two fouls in the first eight minutes trying to defend the All-Star forward. Channing Frye, who had played in only 18 games, came off the bench and also fouled Davis.\\n\\nNew Orleans broke away from a 28-all tie with Davis getting a rest. Holiday had nine points in the quarter and Randle added seven, helping the Pelicans build a 61-52 halftime lead.\\n\\nCleveland's injury problems have been a major factor in its season-long struggles. All-Star forward Kevin Love has started some basketball activities after surgery on his left foot in November, but there's no timetable for his return.\\n\\nRodney Hood (sore left Achilles) and Matthew Dellavedova (sprained left foot) were out Saturday. Hood played the last two games after missing three in a row. Dellavedova didn't play Friday.\\n\\nTIP-INS\\n\\nPelicans: New Orleans broke a six-game road losing streak and is 5-16 away from home. ... C Nikola Mirotic (right ankle) sat out his 11th straight game.\\n\\nCavaliers: Sexton appeared to injure his left arm after being knocked to the floor in a collision with Holiday in the second quarter, but stayed in the game. ... C Ante Zizic (sore right knee) and G David Nwaba (sprained left ankle) are also out with injuries.\\n\\nTAKE A SEAT\\n\\nSexton, Thompson, Cedi Osman and Alec Burks were all benched during New Orleans' big run to start the third. The four returned later in the quarter.\\n\\nIf you lose by 40 two games in a row, you might as well make a change and switch things, Thompson said. It's worth a shot.\\n\\nBIG NIGHT\\n\\nRandle barely fell short of a triple-double with eight assists. The Pelicans shot 58 percent while holding Cleveland to 36-of-88 shooting.\\n\\nThis was really good for us, a win like this, Randle said. I like what we were doing on the defensive end.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nPelicans: Host Memphis on Monday.\\n\\nCavaliers: Host Indiana on Tuesday."}

Goran Dragic and Gerald Green returned to Talking Stick Resort Arena for the first time since last year's departures to Miami, which also has former Suns great Amar'e Stoudemire.\\n\\nThe Dragon did not spew fire at the Suns this time, not like in February when Dragic said he did not trust Suns management any longer over broken promises and reduced time at point guard.\\n\\nMiami Heat's Goran Dragic returns to face Phoenix Suns\\n\\nAfter trading him to Miami, the Suns brass fired shots back at Dragic, painting him as selfish and noting that they believed Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Knight and Markieff Morris were better than Dragic. The Suns were upset because Dragic's request came just as they had negotiated to trade Isaiah Thomas and restore the previous 48-win season's backcourt dynamic.\\n\\nLast season, Dragic expressed regret for the harshness of his I don't trust them any more statement. On Friday, he gave a quick No when asked if he had any regrets.\\n\\nI'm not even thinking about that because what happened in the past, happened in the past, Dragic said. You cannot change nothing. I'm just focused about tonight's game and trying to help my team.\\n\\nDragic kept his Valley home and remains fond of ex-teammates, Suns staff and Suns fans.

It brings a lot of memories back. I had an awesome five years here. I'm grateful for what they did for me.\\n\\nDragic, 29, is starting a five-year, $90 million contract. He entered Friday's game averaging 11.9 points and 5.1 assists with 46.0 percent shooting (29.3 percent on 3-pointers) for the East's No. 3 team.\\n\\nIt's quite different but I like it, Dragic said of his role. We're winning. This is a good organization and I'm happy to be part of that. We have so many players that can score. We just need to put those pieces together and we'll be OK. Everybody needs to make some sacrifices. I did that and I feel good.\\n\\nDragic said he is sure that the Suns are going to figure it out despite a recent 5-20 stretch. After two 2 ½-year stints in Phoenix, Dragic said the 2010 Western Conference finals run remains his favorite memory over being All-NBA third team two seasons ago.\\n\\nI put my name on the map that year in the NBA, Dragic said. We just had a great chemistry. It was awesome. I'm trying to do that here now. We have a great group of guys who are committed.\\n\\nGreen back\\n\\nGreen was asked Friday if he was especially excited to face the Suns. A slightly sinister giggle came out.\\n\\nGreen wanted to stay in Phoenix after last season despite falling out of favor. Green had a career season with the Suns in 2013-14, when he started 48 games, made 204 3-pointers at a 40 percent rate and averaged 15.8 points for a 48-34 team.\\n\\nI talk to some of the previous guys about if they'd kept the team together, Green said. It's about 'What if? What if? What if?' I guess that stuff is irrelevant nowadays.\\n\\nLast season, Green's shooting dipped and his defense became a greater issue. He was benched at times in March and saw only 19.4 minutes per game for the season.\\n\\nI'm just getting a lot more opportunity than I got my second year in Phoenix, Green said. Here defensively with the Heat, I'm on a lot more tough defensive assignments. They trust me. My teammates trust me. It's all about trust on the court. I didn't have that last year here.\\n\\nGreen, 29, entered Friday's game averaging 11.2 points, shooting 41.3 percent overall and 34.3 percent on 3s. He is on a one-year contract for a veteran-minimum salary of $1.36 million with Miami, his eighth NBA team.\\n\\nSuns snap 9-game skid with win over Hornets\\n\\n'STAT' chat\\n\\nStoudemire said he considered signing with Phoenix last summer but wanted to be on a title contender.\\n\\nThat's why I chose Miami but Phoenix is still not ruled out, Stoudemire said.

{"original": "Andy Slavitt\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump and his assault on our ability to mount a response to the coronavirus pandemic were soundly defeated Nov. 3. But his enablers, and the people who stand in the way of soundly defeating this virus — the Republican majority in the U.S. Senate — are still at large. A dynamic and successful response to COVID-19 requires as many oars rowing in the same direction as possible. Congress so far is failing to step up to its vital role supporting the public, states, small businesses and the distribution of vaccines, and giving Americans what they need to support their families and safely isolate.\\n\\nThere is one chance to change that and to increase the incoming Biden administration's odds of limiting the loss of life. That chance is in Georgia in Tuesday's runoff elections, where Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock both are challenging sitting Republican senators. Not only is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's track record of obstruction on the ballot, so are the things Americans value the most: their own families' health, and the nation's best chance to preserve and grow jobs.\\n\\nFor all of us, a successful response to the pandemic and best opportunity for financial recovery are very much on the Georgia ballot Tuesday.\\n\\nLeaders must pull together in crisis\\n\\nSome subscribe to the theory that the government we should want is a divided government, one where the excesses of one party can all be checked by the other. But that's a theory, if you subscribe to it, for a time when we are not in the throes of the largest national crisis in a century. That may be a theory for when we are not at war. A theory for a time Americans shouldn't have to wonder whether government inaction means they won't have enough money to eat, or keep their homes, if they are unemployed.\\n\\nBut a McConnell Senate that is pledged to a Biden failure, or even the protracted give-and-take of a one-for-you, two-for-me negotiation, would slow us down when what we need are urgency and unity to pull ourselves out of a ditch. Pandemics don't come under control easily — and a competent and capable Biden administration is just the start.\\n\\nCongress must provide enough resources so a vaccine can be distributed without delay, and must provide for restaurants and other small businesses so they can hang on for the months we'll need to reduce the spread of the virus. Combat pay for our front-line medical staff is a must. So is paid medical leave and other elements of the safety net Americans need to survive the most difficult time of their lives.\\n\\nThe Senate, under McConnell's leadership, has failed to act with urgency on any of this. Governors have been forced into the Sophie's Choice of whether to open the economy enough to save a handful of small businesses or keep it closed to try to save more lives. With congressional support, America can do what is being done in Germany and throughout the world — that is, do both.\\n\\nA Congress narrowly in Democratic hands would not be promising for a legislative onslaught of long-term and controversial changes. But that's not what's most important right now. A Democratic Senate and House would allow President-elect Joe Biden to tell the public, We have your backs. We will protect you during this chaos. As countries around the world have shown, when that compact is made and kept, the public is much more able and willing to follow basic public health recommendations.\\n\\nCOVID, COVID and COVID: Top 10 ways Joe Biden can lead on health care, and why he should\\n\\nBiden's candidacy for president was about one simple idea more than any other: to heal and unify a nation paying the price after years of neglect, hundreds of thousands of needless deaths, and record jobs and small business losses. His agenda — to bring an end to the pandemic as quickly as possible, reinvest in the economy, promote racial justice and take steps to preserve the climate — is supported by the vast majority of Americans.\\n\\nDivided government is not the answer\\n\\nBut what Biden can accomplish depends a great deal on what happens in Georgia's two Senate races. Were he in the minority, McConnell's obstructionist politics would take a back seat to urgent action on potential solutions to our national challenges. With a single vote margin, the Senate would be anything but a rubber stamp for Biden. Any single senator could derail any piece of legislation, and the many Senate rules provide a safeguard, for better and for worse, against a highly activist agenda.\\n\\nWe are well beyond fretting about the political fate of one party or another. We are well beyond the nationalization of a local election and the money pouring into Georgia. We are at a place where we must recognize that pulling together and defeating the virus will take all of us. McConnell has demonstrated that regardless of what else you think of him, we can't rely on him to do everything he can to speed the nation's response and protect those most at risk.\\n\\nGeorgia, if you're listening: Ignore conservatives peddling socialist Senate hallucinations\\n\\nFor Biden, this is not about ruling the minority party. He demonstrated in the primary and general election campaigns that he clearly understands our divided nation. His role as president might be most closely akin to President Abraham Lincoln's: healing deep wounds, listening to and including the voices of rivals — as he did on the political left in reaching out to Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters. Should the Democrats control the Senate, Biden's instinct to be magnanimous and inclusive would not only help defeat the pandemic, it also would slowly bring a more constructive tone to our politics.\\n\\nOur best chance to accelerate out of the crises ripping through our country is with a narrow but unified Democratic Senate majority, able and willing to work together to meet America's urgent needs. That is what's on the ballot Tuesday in Georgia.\\n\\nAndy Slavitt is board chair of United States of Care, host of the In the Bubble podcast and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

The Wildcats have been short-handed all season, yet keep finding ways to win. Arizona has played all season without Allonzo Trier (unspecified) and Ray Smith (knee), and point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright missed six games. Jackson-Cartwright returned last week for wins over California and Stanford, giving Arizona another scoring option. The Utes have bounced back from a loss to San Francisco at the Diamondhead Classic, playing one of their best games of the season the last time out, a 16-point victory over Colorado.\\n\\nLOOKING AHEAD: UCLA (14-1, 1-1) lost its first game of the season last week, a thrilling 89-87 road loss to No. 15 Oregon. The Bruins bounced back by knocking off Oregon State, but it dropped them two spots to No. 4 in the AP Top 25 . UCLA plays at home this week, against California on Thursday and Stanford on Sunday. Southern California gets the opposite Northern California teams this week after losing its first game of the season, 84-61 to Oregon .\\n\\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS: Oregon's 11-game winning streak is the fifth-longest in the nation. ... Four Pac-12 teams are among the top 10 nationally in blocked shots: 1. Oregon (7.7 per game); 4. Washington (6.9); T7. USC and UCLA (6.5). ... Arizona's 87 straight weeks in the AP Top 25 is the second-longest streak in the nation behind Kansas at 151. ... The 48 career double-doubles by Stanford's Josh Hawkinson is the highest active total in the country.\\n\\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Dillon Brooks, Oregon. The junior missed the first three games of the season due to offseason foot surgery and took a few games to get back into the groove. He's sure in one now. Brooks was named the NCAA and conference player of the week after averaging 25.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists in victories over previously-unbeaten No. 4 UCLA and No. 25 USC.

Zylan Cheatham did a little of everything, finishing with 12 points, seven rebounds and five assists.\\n\\nThis is the first game I felt we put 40 minutes together, playing together as a team, collectively all in the game, said White, who made 9 of 11 shots.\\n\\nColorado shot poorly in a loss to Arizona on Thursday and continued to clank away up the interstate in Tempe, going 5 for 26 from 3-point range. McKinley Wright IV had 12 points to lead the Buffaloes, who have lost four of five.\\n\\nWe played against a desperate Arizona State team, Colorado coach Tad Boyle said. I thought they played with kind of an edge and desperation that we didn't play with. I don't think our guys didn't compete. They tried. It's just right now we can't make open shots.\\n\\nThe Sun Devils appeared to have righted themselves after an unexpected home loss to Princeton to close out the nonconference season, jumping out to a 17-point lead against Utah on Thursday.\\n\\nArizona State fell back into its inconsistent ways after the midpoint of the first half, allowing too many open 3-pointers and baskets in transition, leading to a 10-point loss.\\n\\nHurley shook up his starting lineup and turned into just what the Sun Devils needed.\\n\\nOpening in a 2-3 zone, Arizona State swarmed the Buffaloes, holding them without a field goal for nearly 6 1/2 minutes while opening on a 13-2 run.\\n\\nOur confidence definitely waves and it shows, said Colorado big man Evan Battey, who had seven points. We didn't get shots to fall and lost our confidence.\\n\\nColorado saw a few shots go down later in the half, yet couldn't make up ground. Arizona State led 44-26 after holding the Buffaloes to 8-of-27 shooting, including 2 for 13 from the 3-point arc.\\n\\nThe Sun Devils continued the energy into the second half, crushing the Buffaloes with stingy defense and a series of transition dunks.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nColorado started cold and stayed that way, leaving Arizona with a two-game desert disappointment.\\n\\nArizona State got its mojo back on both ends of the floor, just in time for its first conference road trip of the season.\\n\\nREMY'S INFLUENCE\\n\\nMartin has played fast, sometimes too fast, since returning from injury seven games ago. The sophomore got sped up against Utah after a strong start, but was in almost total control against the Buffaloes.\\n\\nMartin didn't take a shot, but had eight assists with two turnovers.\\n\\nHe really was a good floor leader, Hurley said. Remy is going to find more balance and chances to score. There might have been a few he passed up, but he's got the right mindset to get his teammates involved.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nColorado hosts Washington State on Thursday.\\n\\nArizona State plays at California on Wednesday.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}

{"original": "Former NBA commissioner David Stern, a visionary who turned the pro basketball league into a popular and global multibillion-dollar business and became one of the best commissioners in pro sports, died Wednesday, the league announced. He was 77 years old.\\n\\nStern suffered a brain hemorrhage on Dec. 12 and underwent emergency brain surgery.\\n\\nFor 22 years, I had a courtside seat to watch David in action, current NBA commissioner Adam Silver said in a statement. He was a mentor and one of my dearest friends ... David took over the NBA in 1984 with the league at a crossroads. But over the course of 30 years as commissioner, he ushered in the modern global NBA.\\n\\nBorn on Sept. 22, 1942, Stern was the son of a New York City deli owner and worked at the deli as a kid. He developed a fondness for the New York Knicks and attended Knicks games with his father, who used to slip an usher a few bucks in exchange for better seats.\\n\\nStern never strayed far from the game. After college at Rutgers and law school at Columbia University, Stern began a five-decade association with the NBA, first as an attorney for Proskauer Rose, a high-powered law firm that represented the NBA. It also happened to be the firm where Silver's father, Edward, worked as a labor attorney and chairman.\\n\\nStern joined the NBA as general counsel in 1978, became executive vice president in 1980 and was named commissioner in 1984, beginning a 30-year run in charge of the league until 2014 when Silver took over.\\n\\nDuring that 30-year span, Stern altered the NBA in ways that seemed impossible in the mid-1980s, creating lucrative TV deals and corporate sponsorships, a global audience and marketable superstars, starting with Larry Bird and Magic Johnson and continuing with Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant and LeBron James.\\n\\nHe was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in in 2014.\\n\\nToday, players make millions, including some who make more than $35 million a season, and the average franchise is worth about $2 billion, including the New York Knicks, who were valued at more than $4 billion by Forbes in February. Fans can watch games on their phones from just about anywhere in the world.\\n\\nStern was many things: intelligent, savvy, bold, stubborn, driven, competitive, charming, humorous, kind, biting, forceful and demanding.\\n\\nDavid Stern is the No. 1 force, the No. 1 reason why this league is where it is today, Miami Heat president Pat Riley told USA TODAY in 2014. That's not disrespectful to any one great player in any one era or any owner. This has to do with the leadership of one man.\\n\\nOver that span of time, things don't change because they're coincidences. They don't. There's somebody at the top who is going to eliminate what is bad and market what is good. He was a very forceful, very pragmatic visionary.\\n\\nAn attorney by trade, Stern also knew sports marketing. He saw the potential Bird and Johnson had and wanted to make sure basketball fans knew what players like that could do on the basketball court. Stern also had to fight an uphill battle at the time. The league didn't have the greatest reputation, hampered by lack of exposure and high-profile drug problems.\\n\\nStern made sure fans witnessed a great product on the court and the electric personalities who played the game via TV. He had two great ones in Bird and Magic, who defined much of the NBA in the 1980s with their Celtics-Lakers rivalry. Isiah Thomas came along, then Jordan and the mesmerizing high-flying, gravity-defying plays on the court captured the attention of fans.\\n\\nThe way that he took it head on, the way he presented the game to America, he didn't hide behind anything, Thomas said in 2014. This is our league. This is who we are. This is who these young men are. Once you get to know them, America will fall in love with the player and the product. He was masterful at that.\\n\\nStern dreamed even bigger — an international audience. He helped send pro basketball players to the 1992 Olympics where the Dream Team was a major story. Not only were fans around the world drawn to the NBA, foreign-born players wanted to join the NBA. When the 2019-20 season opened, 108 international players were on NBA rosters compared to 24 in 1994-95. The league is making deeper inroads in Asia and Africa and the league on Dec. 12 announced a G League team will begin play in Mexico City in in 2020.\\n\\nIn 1996, he ushered in the WNBA which has been and is filled with stars.\\n\\nStern had his share of setbacks, too. He was part of two lockouts that resulted in lost games in 1998-99 and 2011-12. Sitting across the bargaining table from Stern was not fun.\\n\\nHorrible, longtime National Basketball Players Association attorney Ron Klempner once told USA TODAY. It's an adversary who's prepared and making your arguments better than you are. He never lets down his guard. He never exhibits any weakness. He's constantly in control of himself and his own side of the table. He's such a difference-maker when it comes to the economics, the appearance, the end product. You can't quantify the difference he makes and has made in the growth of our game.\\n\\nThe unfortunate Malice at the Palace brawl between the Indiana Pacers, Detroit Pistons and fans and the Tim Donaghy referee betting scandal also happened on his watch.\\n\\nThe wrath of Stern was unpleasant. Whether it was team owner, a players' union official, a player, an NBA staffer or a reporter, Stern chided as he saw fit.\\n\\nLos Angeles Lakers owner Jeanie Buss said, He didn't waste words.\\n\\nShortly after buying the Minnesota Timberwolves, Glen Taylor asked a question at a Board of Governors meeting and Stern told him to be quiet.\\n\\nHe did have a strong personality, Taylor said six years ago.\\n\\nStern understood how to navigate difficult times. When Magic Johnson announced he was HIV-positive in 1991, Stern backed Johnson and tried to educate the league and public at a time when people were frightened of the AIDS epidemic. It was another critical moment in Stern's career, and he helped break down misconceptions and falsehoods.\\n\\nDavid Stern was such a history maker, Johnson tweeted. When I announced in 1991 I had HIV, people thought they could get the virus from shaking my hand. When David allowed me to play in the 1992 All Star Game in Orlando and then play for the Olympic Dream Team, we were able to change the world.\\n\\nThe NBA wouldn't be where it is today without David J. Stern."}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Coach Ron Rivera said the Panthers need to evolve as an offense and find new and different ways to use versatile quarterback Cam Newton following a disappointing 6-10 season.\\n\\nNewton struggled in 2016, one year after being named the league's MVP. He threw just 19 touchdown passes — after tossing 35 in 2015 — and had 14 interceptions and a league-low 52.9 completion percentage. He wasn't as effective as a runner either, averaging a career-low 4 yards per carry while playing behind an injury-riddled offensive line.\\n\\nHe still has a unique skillset, Rivera said. We just have to find the best way to utilize it now.\\n\\nCarolina dropped from No. 1 in scoring in the league in 2015 to 15th in 2016.\\n\\nWhile the Panthers have relied heavily upon Newton as a rusher during his first six seasons, that could change.\\n\\nHe's carried the ball 689 times during the span — by far the most of any quarterback in the league — and has run for more TDs (48) than any QB in league history. Rivera sounded like the team will be veering away from the read option which the Panthers ran so effectively early in Newton's career in order to prevent further wear and tear on his body.\\n\\nThe 27-year-old Newton missed one game with a concussion in 2016 and struggled through a shoulder injury late in the season.\\n\\nHe's not as young and nimble as he used to be, Rivera said. We have to be smart about that and think about other ways to use him. ... You can't sit there and expect us to run 20 zone reads and then expect him to carry the ball say 10 out of 20 times.\\n\\nRivera made it clear that he believes offensive coordinator Mike Shula is the right man to help the offense evolve. And he also thinks Newton will be up for any change in philosophy, regardless of what it entails.\\n\\nCam is always all in, Rivera said.\\n\\nThe Panthers finished last in the NFC South, one year after going 15-1 and reaching the Super Bowl. They're the 13th team to lose a Super Bowl and not make it back to the postseason the following season.\\n\\nThe Carolina Panthers are not going away, general manager Dave Gettleman said. We will get this corrected.\\n\\nFive things to watch for from the Panthers in the offseason:\\n\\nCAM'S SHOULDER: Newton will not need surgery in the offseason despite playing the final month of the season in obvious pain.\\n\\nRest, Newton said on Sunday. Lots of rest.\\n\\nRivera said he appreciates Newton giving it all he had for the team and playing through pain, adding I thought Cam Newton was about as courageous as it gets.\\n\\nHEAD GAMES: There is plenty of uncertainty surrounding the future of left tackle Michael Oher, who only played three games this season due to a concussion. Oher has two years remaining on a three-year, $21 million contract he signed last offseason, but if he decides to call it quits the Panthers will need to find a replacement to protect Newton's blindside.\\n\\nLinebacker Luke Kuechly, the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 2013, is in a similar situation having missed nine games over the past two seasons with concussions. However, Kuechly was cleared from the concussion protocol for the final three games — although he didn't play in them — and Gettleman said he has no concerns about Kuechly availability next season.\\n\\nSHORT TIMER?: The Panthers will have to make a decision on whether to use the franchise tag on soon-to-be free agent defensive tackle Kawann Short. The franchise tag hasn't worked out well for the Panthers the past few seasons with Josh Norman and Greg Hardy, but Gettleman wouldn't rule out using it on Short.\\n\\nUnlike Norman, Short said he would probably sign the franchise tag offer if the Panthers used it on him.\\n\\nWe are two totally different people, Short said.\\n\\nSECONDARY SETTLED: The Panthers had plenty of questions surrounding their cornerback position following the departure of Norman and veteran Charles Tillman last offseason. However, Gettleman was pleased with the development of rookies James Bradberry and Daryl Worley, who have a chance to be the starting tandem for years to come.\\n\\nI'm proud of how they came to work, how they approached things, but also the growth that they made, safety Kurt Coleman said. They started to make a lot of plays. They weren't just out there, they made an impact.\\n\\nASSISTANT COACH WATCH: The Panthers coaching staff remained intact last offseason, but it's unclear if Rivera will have the same group in 2017. Defensive coordinator Sean McDermott will interview with the Buffalo Bills for their head coaching vacancy.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Ronald J. Hansen, Yvonne Wingett Sanchez and Pamela Ren Larson\\n\\nThe Republic\\n\\nPHOENIX — For Molly Nygren, longtime Democrat and Houston transplant, 2018 was her first election in Arizona.\\n\\nAlice Lehr skipped the 2016 presidential election, but believes politics reached an intolerable tipping point last year under President Donald Trump.\\n\\nBoth women participated in the state's historic 2018 election, in which Democrats won a U.S. Senate race in Arizona for the first time in 30 years and won three other statewide contests.\\n\\nThey are the type of voters who will help settle Arizona's elections in a year when Democrats and Republicans alike are treating the state as a crucial battleground for the White House and control of the Senate in November.\\n\\nNygren, a Gilbert nurse, lives in the southeast Valley, where Democrat Kyrsten Sinema persuaded voters who collectively supported Trump in 2016 to back her Senate bid in 2018.\\n\\nI wasn't working, and didn't know what to do with myself, Nygren, 41, said of her political engagement in her new home state. I kind of thrust myself into politics when I moved here.\\n\\nLehr lives in a new home in Buckeye, near where Democrats have traditionally done well, but where turnout is relatively light. Unimpressed with her choices, she didn't vote in the presidential race in 2016, but chose Sinema over Republican Martha McSally in 2018.\\n\\nIn 2018, voters like Lehr, 74, turned out in record numbers. The bulging margins in those areas helped negate McSally's strong showing in rural Arizona.\\n\\nAn Arizona Republic analysis of precinct-level voting results and registration trends shows both parties making gains, but Democrats turned Republican red precincts purple, while their blue precincts turned deeper blue.\\n\\nAn area that roughly traces Loop 101, from communities spanning the Gilbert-Chandler line up north through Scottsdale, west to Peoria, has emerged as a key battleground within a state where the outcome will be fiercely fought. These voters were most likely to split their tickets in 2018 and could do so again this year.\\n\\nArizona's changing election results owe partly to evolving demographics and to the unique moment in its politics.\\n\\nThe state is, as usual, one of the fastest-growing in the nation, and its Hispanic population is increasingly of age to vote.\\n\\nAt the same time, Trump, the most polarizing figure in politics, has helped push up GOP support among whites and in rural areas, while pushing away college-educated voters and minorities.\\n\\nWith Trump back on the ballot this year, Democrats think they can build on their winning formula from 2018.\\n\\nRepublicans are hopeful their party can again carry a state Trump won by 3.5 percentage points in 2016.\\n\\nBoth parties will be battling for voters like Jeff Blodgett, a Republican from Peoria, just off Loop 101. He's a disaffected Republican who voted for Trump and McSally in past elections but is open to voting for Democrats in the presidential and Senate races this year.\\n\\nHe's fed up with the partisan fighting that has gridlocked the nation. So, too, were most of the two dozen Arizona voters interviewed in key precincts.\\n\\nThey don't want to work together, Blodgett, 62, said. It's like a war.\\n\\nA state in demographic flux\\n\\nAt a recent appearance at the Arizona Republican Party's headquarters in central Phoenix, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale was preparing his troops.\\n\\nParscale stood before a room filled with supporters to give them the inside scoop on the biggest volunteer army in the history of the Republican Party that he was building to help Trump in 2020.\\n\\nFor Republicans, alarm bells are ringing.\\n\\nTrump's narrow win in 2016 and the party's 2018 loss of a Senate seat signaled peril. Republicans view the state as one of the most competitive in the election cycle and began building out their 2020 political infrastructure months earlier than normal.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence said during his October visit to the state that he and Trump would spend a lot of time in Arizona this election season. Republicans expect Trump could visit the state early this year.\\n\\nYou've got to understand, Parscale said to supporters. Arizona has not normally been a state where we've had to put this much work into it. Democrats see Arizona as a possibility. I don't think it's there yet, but that's why all of you have to make sure you get active and you work hard.\\n\\nRepublicans are having to work harder because the state is in flux, political experts say.\\n\\nIn some ways, this is like the proverbial frog in the boiling water. These changes are happening, but they're happening so slowly, it's hard for us to observe them, said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political science professor who studies voting behavior.\\n\\nYou've got a competitive Senate election, you've got a competitive presidential election, and these changes are going to manifest themselves statewide, but at the same time they're going to be geographically located in the suburbs, he said.\\n\\nMcDonald said Arizona's newfound competitiveness is a combination of an electorate growing more ethnically diverse, which usually benefits Democrats, while it also becomes older, which typically helps Republicans.\\n\\nRachel Bitecofer, an election forecaster at Virginia's Christopher Newport University, sees Arizona continuing its leftward lean in 2020.\\n\\nWhen I'm looking at Arizona, I'm looking at the metro areas … and how much untapped surge potential is there, she said. They have not tapped into anywhere near the potential of the Latino population. If the Democrats were running Republican campaign efficiency, Arizona would already be blue. The voters are already there.\\n\\nHispanic voters a rising force\\n\\nMidterm elections typically see a sharp fall in participation. This is usually most evident in more diverse areas. But in 2018, Arizona's Hispanic voters remained politically engaged, according to a voting analysis by Catalist, a progressive firm that tracks voter data.\\n\\nThe estimated share of Hispanics in the midterms fell by 0.2 percentage points or less in 16 of the state's 30 legislative districts, the firm's data shows.\\n\\nIn three contiguous districts running diagonally from Litchfield Park, east to Paradise Valley, the Hispanic share of voters actually went up.\\n\\nTheir sustained presence was seen in districts with large Hispanic populations and in ones where they are a small fraction of the electorate. And there are Hispanics who plan to vote this year who haven't before.\\n\\nIn 2016, Democrat Norma Hernandez was so uninspired with her choices for president, she didn't vote. She won't do that again in November.\\n\\nI want him out, the middle-aged mom said of Trump. I feel like he's not really working for the people. He's working for himself. I want to have a voice. If there's going to be change, I want to be a part of it.\\n\\nHernandez plans on voting for whomever the Democrats nominate. She also plans on voting for Democratic candidate Mark Kelly in the Senate race.\\n\\nWhether it was driven by Trump's border and immigration policies or just a growing political engagement already seen in other states, such as Florida, Hispanic voters had a bigger stake in the results in 2018. That trend is expected to carry over into the 2020 elections.\\n\\nA less rural electorate\\n\\nWhile Hispanics figured more prominently in the state's electoral equation in 2018, so, too, did the state's two population centers, Phoenix and Tucson.\\n\\nIn 2014, turnout in Arizona's two most populous counties, Maricopa and Pima, was about 1 percentage point lower than it was in the 13 other counties.\\n\\nIn 2018, turnout in Maricopa and Pima was 3 percentage points higher than the rest of the state. It has meant a growing share of voters — 77% in 2016 and 2018 — came from areas that are more urban and racially diverse.\\n\\nThere is another troubling fault line for Republicans in Pima County.\\n\\nTrump lost in that historically Democratic-leaning county by 57,000 votes. He mostly erased that deficit by winning Maricopa County by 44,000 votes and carried the rest of the state by 104,000.\\n\\nIn 2018, McSally won rural Arizona by 65,000 votes. But she lost by 60,000 in Maricopa County and by 61,000 in Pima County. The Pima results were especially disappointing for a candidate from Tucson.\\n\\nHer problem in Pima County could get worse running against the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, D-Ariz., who hailed from southeastern Arizona.\\n\\nTrump carried Arizona in 2016, but McSally's performance in 2018 suggests a need for Republicans to expand well past the rural voters who have been a reliable cornerstone of their political base.\\n\\nBoth parties are working on the ground to identify new voters they believe will help them get the upper hand in a narrowly divided state.\\n\\nFor Republicans, one Trump-aligned PAC has identified 142,000 prospects they deem as conservatives who have not already voted for Trump but likely would.\\n\\nGroups aligned with Democrats are targeting a pool of 200,000 new registrants.\\n\\nThe changing mix of people who vote in Arizona contributes to the state's partisan drift.\\n\\nArizona remains one of the fastest-growing states in the country, and Maricopa County has been the nation's fastest-growing county three years in a row.\\n\\nFigures from the U.S. Census Bureau suggest the county's new residents largely come from Democratic-leaning areas.\\n\\nTwelve of the 15 out-of-state counties that have provided the most new residents to Maricopa County in recent years are locations where Democrats have dominated elections or voter registration.\\n\\nThese include Democratic counties encompassing areas such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston and Chicago.\\n\\nBut the transplants come in all political stripes.\\n\\nRepublican Scott Fishman, 53, moved to Goodyear three years ago from New Jersey, drawn by the nice weather and lower taxes. He plans on voting for Trump again in 2020, even though he views him — and all other politicians — as corrupt.\\n\\nFishman said Trump's America First agenda is a patriotic appeal to people like him, who feel like the nation has been ripped off by international trade deals.\\n\\nI'm us-first, he said. We put everybody first all the time. You can't do that. You've got to put us first.\\n\\nHe sees the Democratic candidates as too weak to go toe-to-toe with Trump on the issues that matter most to him, such as border security and job creation.\\n\\nI like (Trump's) personality. He's not boring, Fishman said. Is he the most articulate? No, but then again you've got (former Vice President Joe) Biden, who is articulate, but can't put two sentences together without jumbling it up. And with them, everyone's far left. Everything is free.\\n\\nSoutheast Valley up for grabs\\n\\nPerhaps no part of Maricopa County better epitomizes the changing complexion of the state's most populous region than the area around Chandler and Gilbert.\\n\\nThe cities, home to corporate anchors such as Intel, GoDaddy and Northrop Grumman, have had some of the largest population gains in the nation's fastest-growing county.\\n\\nCensus data shows residents are, as usual, relatively well-educated and affluent. But the political winds have shifted.\\n\\nWhile many areas of the county voted less Republican than in recent years, this area of the southeast Valley flipped outright from 2014 to 2018.\\n\\nVoters in those cities supported Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2014 and Republican Sen. John McCain in 2016.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nBRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Grigor Dimitrov concentrated on fun and games at the season-opening Brisbane International, looking for something a bit different to his regular routine.\\n\\nIt turns out, that's what he'd been missing. Dimitrov ended a title drought that dated back to 2014 when he beat third-seeded Kei Nishikori 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 in the final on Sunday.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old Bulgarian attributed some late-night trips to the game arcades in downtown Brisbane for the change of fortunes.\\n\\nI played motor bikes, we played cars, basketball, I mean, I went there with my fitness coach and we were — I think we were the biggest kids out there, he said. You know, it's something so childish, if you want to say it.\\n\\nWell, every time I was going to bed, I was, like, 'Wow, that feels so good.' It's just something so small.\\n\\nDimitrov, dubbed 'Baby Fed' earlier in his career for his style similarities with Roger Federer, lost the Brisbane International final to Andy Murray in 2013. He won three titles and reached the Wimbledon semifinals in 2014 as he rose to a career-high ranking of No. 8.\\n\\nBut his form faded and he slipped down the rankings to No. 40 by the middle of last year.\\n\\nThat's when he had to make some decisions, refocus, set some goals. The first was to win a tournament in 2017 — he's achieved that in the first week of the season. There are other goals, including better runs at the Grand Slams — he hasn't been past the fourth round since a career peak in the Wimbledon semifinals in 2014, when he beat Murray but lost to Novak Djokovic.\\n\\nHe entered the season-opening Brisbane event ranked No. 17 and seeded seventh, and could rise to No. 15 for the Australian Open, which starts Jan. 16.\\n\\nIt's been pretty emotional, Dimitrov said. This trophy means a lot.\\n\\nHe didn't elaborate too much on any emotional upheaval, saying it's part and parcel of touring so much as a professional player. But he did say he needed to adjust how he spends his time on the road.\\n\\nI'm the kind of guy that I cannot just lock myself in the room and just think tennis for 24 hours. It hasn't helped me, he said. And since I have been here, every night I've been going to the arcades, for example, for an hour and a half, been playing arcades. It's given me tremendous joy.\\n\\nThat's why I say those, I think, these 10 days that I have been here — I don't remember having so much fun, but in the same time I was very focused, played quite solid all the matches. So I was just — overall, I just felt good.\\n\\nHe beat defending champion Milos Raonic in the semifinals, improving his career record to 3-1 against the big-serving Canadian.\\n\\nHe'd never beaten Nishikori in three previous matches, and he had to save break points in the first game and again in the third. After that, he went on a roll.\\n\\nNishikori, who reached his first Brisbane final after losing three previous semifinals, fended off a breakpoint early in the second set and went on to break Dimitrov's serve twice in an almost reverse of the first set.\\n\\nBut the Japanese star lost momentum after a medical timeout for a left hip problem after the second set, and Dimitrov dominated before getting the decisive break in the eighth game and then serving out at love.\\n\\nNishikori said the hip pain was intense in the second set, and may force him out of a scheduled exhibition match in Sydney on Monday before he heads to Melbourne.\\n\\nWell, sort of it was OK, but yeah, a little bit sad to finish (the tournament) like this, he said. But I think it was great week to start of the year. I had good four matches here. Well, I try to stay healthy next week and hope I can be ready for, for the Australian Open."}
{"original": "Selena Maranjian\\n\\nThe Motley Fool\\n\\nCost-cutting can be great, but it can also lead to undesired consequences.\\n\\nConsider, for example, the Social Security Administration (SSA), which has undergone multiple years of budget cuts and faces further cuts. While the major agency continues to serve tens of millions of retired and disabled Americans and many survivors, its recent performance leaves room for improvement.\\n\\nSpecifically, a study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that many retirees are not being given some critical information that would help them get the most out of the program.\\n\\nSocial Security in a nutshell\\n\\nSocial Security pays close to 62 million Americans, with benefits totaling $955 billion in 2017. About 42 million recipients are retirees collecting retirement benefits. Others are dependents of those retirees, disabled workers and their dependents, and survivors, including children.\\n\\nNot only is Social Security a massive program, it also is a critical one for most Americans. The program was designed to replace about 40% of pre-retirement income for those who earn an average income. But the reality today is that a majority of elderly beneficiaries get 50% or more of their income from Social Security, while 23% of married ones and 43% of unmarried ones get fully 90% or more of their income from it, according to the SSA.\\n\\nJust how much are they getting? Well, what you get out of Social Security largely depends on what you paid into it. Remember that workers get 6.2% of their wages withheld as a Social Security tax, with their employers coughing up a corresponding 6.2%, for a total 12.4% tax on earnings. (The self-employed have to pay both the employer and employee portions, forking over the entire 12.4% on their own.)\\n\\nThe average monthly retirement benefit was recently $1,375, which totals $16,500 per year. If your earnings have been above average, though, you'll collect more than that -- up to the maximum monthly Social Security benefit for those retiring at their full retirement age, which was recently $2,639. (That's about $32,000 for the whole year.)\\n\\nWhat's the problem?\\n\\nBudget cuts to Social Security have led the SSA to trim its workforce, close more than 60 field offices, and reduce the hours that representatives are available to help the public. This has resulted in longer waits in person, on the phone, or online, when people seek help or information.\\n\\nThe SSA has tried to offset the reductions by beefing up its online presence and offering more services online. Given the fact that Social Security benefits are so important to most retirees, and that many people don't fully understand their options, it's vital that the SSA give people the information they need to make the best decisions for themselves.\\n\\nBut a 2016 GAO report found that when retirees and pre-retirees consult the SSA, they're often not given some key information that could help them get more out of the program. For example, ... in 8 of 26 claims interviews in which the claimant could have received higher benefits by delaying a claim, the claims specialist did not discuss the advantages and disadvantages of delay. That's a problem.\\n\\nWhile most retirees would do well to start collecting benefits at their full retirement age or even at age 62, some might be best served by delaying collecting up to age 70, in order to get bigger checks. Starting to collect early is often smart, though, as you'll get many more checks, despite their being smaller. If you expect to live a longer-than-average life, however, and you can afford to delay starting to collect, that can be the wise choice.\\n\\nMany people seeking information or guidance from the SSA are also not briefed on basics of how their benefits are calculated. For example, benefits are based on earnings in the 35 years in which a worker earned the most. If you only work 31 years, four years of zero earnings will be entered into the formula, lowering your benefits.\\n\\nWhat to do\\n\\nThe situation isn't good, but there are some smart things you can do to deal with it. For starters, learn more about how to maximize your Social Security benefits on your own. Don't be afraid to consult the Social Security Administration, too. Some advise that it's best to go in person to get more information, and that if the front-line person you meet with doesn't seem to be serving you sufficiently well, ask to see a Tier 2 representative, who will be even more informed.\\n\\nYou might also keep abreast of plans in Washington to change Social Security, whether it's Congress looking to shrink its budget further to reduce benefits, or to strengthen the program and possibly increase benefits. Contact your representatives to let them know what you'd like them to do regarding Social Security.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

{"original": "Mike Wynn\\n\\nThe (Louisville, Ky.) Courier-Journal\\n\\nCorrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this report did not contain a footnote about the Indiana State Teachers' Retirement Fund (Pre-1996 Account) in the list at the end of the story.\\n\\nINDEPENDENCE, Ky. — Before Bert Baldwin retired from teaching in 1994, a financial adviser told her she needed only $80,000 in savings to supplement her pension benefits and avoid money worries later in life.\\n\\nNow at 81, Baldwin ticks off all the expenses that eat up her pension check each month — utilities, food, transportation. For insurance and property taxes, Baldwin relies on earnings from private investments.\\n\\nIf I just had $80,000, I could not stay in this house, she said, sitting in her living room on a recent morning in this Cincinnati suburb. The $2,200 monthly pension benefit doesn't cut it, and I'm not an extravagant person.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to severe underfunding in Kentucky's public pension plan for educators, she said young teachers should be nervous.\\n\\nThe best- and worst-run states in America\\n\\nThousands of working and retired teachers, such as Baldwin, are looking to the Kentucky legislature this year to address a massive shortage in their state retirement plan and ensure that benefits remain secure for decades to come.\\n\\nWhile the Kentucky General Assembly will grapple with dozens of major issues in 2016 — including voting rights, labor concerns, religious interests and a beleaguered state budget — few carry the high financial stakes of pensions.\\n\\nCyndi Powell-Skellie, a history teacher at Shelby County High School in Shelbyville, Ky., said teachers are talking about the issue between classes, some wondering if they should take their retirement and find another career.\\n\\nThe possibilities are numerous and staggering as to what could happen, she said. Many of my colleagues feel very worried.\\n\\nAccording to the latest analysis, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System has only 55% of the money needed to cover benefits during the next 28 years, and overall it faces $13.9 billion in unfunded liabilities.\\n\\nThe system sold off $650 million in 2014 to help pay out benefits and expects to liquidate another $750 million this year.\\n\\nBefore it did that, its funded ratio, a pension plan's assets divided by its liabilities, was less than 52%. Only three other states in 2013 had lower percentages for their teacher pension funds: Indiana's pre-1996 account at 32%, Illinois at 41% and Alaska at 48%, according to information that the Pew Charitable Trusts gathered for a state pension funds report in mid-2015.\\n\\nIn a 2012 report, Morningstar, the stock-market research and analysis company, considered a funded ratio of less than 70% not fiscally sound. Of 31 state pension plans specifically designated to include teachers, almost two-thirds had a funded ratio of less than 70%, according to the numbers that Pew collected.\\n\\nFunding shortfalls put pensions in peril\\n\\nFederal pension protections through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. cover only private employers.\\n\\nKentucky lawmakers have debated solutions to the problem for more than a year. But heading into the next legislative session, which begins Tuesday. they remain at odds on proposals to resolve the financial gap.\\n\\nGary Harbin, head of the teachers' retirement system, warns that without a significant financing plan in the next budget, Kentucky will face two pitfalls:\\n\\nOne, the system will continue on a downward spiral of selling assets that should be invested for teachers in the classroom today.\\n\\nthe system will continue on a downward spiral of selling assets that should be invested for teachers in the classroom today. Two, bond rating agencies are likely to lower the state's credit rating again.\\n\\nAt some point, recovery becomes too stressful for the budget to handle, he said.\\n\\nThat's what we are trying to avoid, reaching a point that the state's budget and the 4 million people of the state can't support this benefit because we let the debts grow too long, Harbin said.\\n\\nWhen lawmakers start writing the state's next two-year budget, the Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System will need $520 million in additional allocations in the first year and nearly $513 million more in the second year.\\n\\nLawmakers also are reviewing proposals to overhaul benefits — particularly for new hires — and at least three main approaches are in development for the 2016 session:\\n\\n• The state's new Republican governor, Matt Bevin, is pushing to create a separate 401(k)-style pension plan for new hires, similar to retirement plans used in the private sector. Bevin also said the state must honor commitments to current employees, but he hasn't released any specifics on how.\\n\\n• The state's longtime Democratic House speaker, Greg Stumbo, said he will refile a bill from last year to authorize up to $3.3 billion in pension obligation bonds.\\n\\nThe teachers' pension fund could use proceeds from the bonds to pay benefits, allowing their investment assets to remain in the market and continue earning money. Stumbo's bill also calls on the state to incrementally increase retirement contributions over a period of about eight years until it reaches full financing.\\n\\n• A Republican state senator, Joe Bowen, is working with a small group of lawmakers on another bill that gradually would phase in contributions over a four-year period, meeting 25% of the needed contributions in the first year of the budget and 50% in the second year.\\n\\nHowever, lawmakers still would have to find and allocate money in the budget. The measure also would include a separate plan for new hires and some possible benefit changes for current teachers.\\n\\nSupporters of bonds say they would provide immediate money to stabilize cash-flow problems in the teachers' pension system and allow the budget to slowly transition into making full contributions. The deal allows Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System to refinance debt and makes economic sense, proponents say, considering that investment earnings are expected to outpace the interest on bonds.\\n\\nChristie to detail new pension, benefits changes\\n\\nBut the proposal faces steep opposition among Republicans. Critics say bonds are too risky, stacking debt upon debt when investment returns are uncertain.\\n\\nRepublicans also argue that a new benefit tier for future hires and other structural changes are an essential part of any solution to help the system meet current obligations and avoid racking up more shortfalls. They say that traditional pensions have proved unsustainable in the private sector and that state government must follow suit to protect taxpayers.\\n\\nBut teacher groups — and many Democrats — oppose changes to benefits, especially moving future hires to a 401(k)-style pension plan. They say the change would cost more money, at least in the short run, and leave teachers with an unreliable retirement, making it difficult to recruit and retain high-quality educators.\\n\\nIt's hard to know which strategy will be invoked by the end of the session, Bowen said. I think everyone understands the magnitude of the issue.\\n\\nKentucky Teachers' Retirement System officials have spoken out in favor of Stumbo's bond bill, arguing that it would stabilize the system's cash-flow problems and help the state budget transition to full funding.\\n\\nHarbin said Bowen's proposal would work as well and sounded an optimistic note on reaching a deal in 2016.\\n\\nWe are well down the road to getting a solution, he said.\\n\\nThe Kentucky Teachers' Retirement System manages retirement for 72,246 active and 49,822 retired teachers. Some lawmakers have noted that even without any action from the General Assembly, the system will not run out of money for more than two decades.\\n\\nBut Harbin warns that another recession could reduce that number to eight or even six years.\\n\\nN.Y. pension fund paid cop for 28 years after his death\\n\\nPowell-Skellie, the Shelby County teacher who is also active in the Kentucky Education Association, said teachers feel betrayed by the underfunding and remain concerned that they won't receive the promised benefits.\\n\\nTeachers don't earn enough to contribute sufficiently to a 401(k), she said.\\n\\nIn the 2013-14 school year, Kentucky teachers' average salary, including new and experienced educators, was a bit more than $50,700, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. The U.S. average was $56,100.\\n\\nEx-chief of huge pension fund guilty of bribery\\n\\nPowell-Skellie also worries that good teachers will get out of the profession because it's rocky right now as to what they can do in the future.\\n\\nBaldwin, who taught elementary school for 27 years in Kenton County, said she believes her own retirement is secure, but she also remains worried about the implications for education and a high-quality workforce. And she said she knows a lot of retired teachers who are struggling on what pensions provide now.\\n\\nThey just need to find a solution, she said. They are not rewarding me with this money. I earned this money. I earned this pension. I paid into it.\\n\\nFollow Mike Wynn on Twitter: @MikeWynn_CJ\\n\\nTeacher pension funds on shaky ground\\n\\nStates' pension woes across the USA extend to teachers' retirement plans.\\n\\nMarket analyst Morningstar considers a pension fund fiscally sound if it has a 70% funded ratio, the amount of its assets divided by liabilities.

{"original": "Jerushah Duford and Ross Murray\\n\\nOpinion contributors\\n\\nThis time last year we were blissfully unaware of what was bubbling underneath the surface of the thoughts in Christian churches and in the mindset of many Americans. We hoped it wasn't true, and even though there were signs over the last decade, the last four years has shown that what we had hoped were merely isolated thoughts of bigotry, racism and elitism were actually more pervasive than we thought.\\n\\nIn 2020 it seemed like we were living in the apocalypse.\\n\\nUsing biblical language like that might sound like histrionics or exaggeration, but it is actually pretty accurate. The word apocalypse is from the Greek apokalyptein, or to uncover, disclose, or reveal. If anything, it feels like this last 12 months not only uncovered a lot of what we feared, but revealed a lot about America and its people.\\n\\nJesus favored poor, not privileged\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has revealed the lack of support we provide for our health care infrastructure — including health care workers — on a local, national, and global scale. Furthermore, the uprisings for racial justice after the killing of so many Americans such as Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd have revealed how systemic racism has only continued to grow in this country, not abate. The aftermath of the 2020 presidential election has revealed just how divided this nation truly is — with nearly half of the United States believing that facts and published reports are merely fake or just a hoax.\\n\\nThe Apocalypse has been thrown around Christian circles for millennia, and while there were a few Christian voices that have been loud over the course of 2020 speaking out for justice, fighting for the poor and marginalized, and standing alongside those who have been disproportionately impacted by racism and a justice system that criminalizes their own existence, many Christians failed to speak out, or even speak up, at all during this new apocalypse. The discourse seemed to be coming from a few vocal Christians who chose to not fight for the marginalized, but to uplift an administration that contradicts what Jesus taught us about how to treat others.\\n\\nWe may seem like an unlikely duo to write about this topic. After all, one of us is the granddaughter of the late Billy Graham, and the other is a director for an LGBTQ advocacy organization. Yet, our own discovery of just how disparate the narrative seemed to be from the Jesus we know helped us realize how much our values are in alignment with each other.\\n\\nIn the biblical apocalypse there are false prophets claiming the voice of God. Similarly, today there are those who claim the same while simultaneously trying to put the lid back on what others have revealed to be the truth — that is, that Christ favored the poor and the marginalized over the mighty. Yet this message has been buried by some of our most prominent Christian leaders who seemingly have been seduced by the trappings of power, privilege, and prestige.\\n\\nGeorgia's runoff:Christianity is on the ballot in the Georgia Senate runoff between Warnock and Loeffler\\n\\nThose who suffered the most this year as their existence and rights were threatened helped us to recognize this truth. African-Americans, immigrants, those in the LGBTQ community, the poor, and the handicapped helped remind us for whom the gospel of Christ is meant, and when they voted in November, they showed that the power was truly in their hands, not the privileged.\\n\\nPress for justice and fix what's broken\\n\\nThose of us who claim to follow Christ have an opportunity, if not a responsibility, to fix what is broken and to help bring back a kind and just society that honors every person as a beloved child of God. Let us not use Christianity as a way to advance our own agenda, to fill a stadium or to raise money, but rather to be like Jesus in (and for) a broken world.\\n\\nAs Christians, we have a choice: We can either emerge from our quarantined lives wanting to return to pre-pandemic normalcy, or we can use the knowledge revealed during the pandemic months — of health care system failures, systemic racism, and transgender violence to name a few — to lift these groups and others up to Christ and saddle up next to them in solidarity.\\n\\nWe are therefore asking Christians of all denominations and sects to follow the call that we've all been given, and to fulfill the words of Isaiah to bring good news to the oppressed, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and release to the prisoners. To do this means calling out racism, homophobia, transphobia, sexism and ableism, and then doing something to eradicate those sins in our lives, in our churches, in our communities and, sometimes, even within our own families.\\n\\nCOVID and religion:When COVID-19 and religious freedom intersect, political partisans rush to take sides\\n\\nLet's then claim our faith unabashedly. Let's live out our calling, so that people will know we are Christians because of our love for others. Let's cry out for justice like John the Baptist and the prophets once cried out in the wilderness. Let's call upon both the newly-elected and incumbents in office alike and remind them that our faith compels us to advocate for the poor and marginalized, those who are impacted by climate change, and those who endure harassment and discrimination just to earn a paycheck.\\n\\nMaybe then, more will be revealed to us. Maybe then this apocalypse won't be something to fear, but necessary to bring our faith — and our faithfully-informed politics — back into line with the message of the gospel in which we claim.\\n\\nJerushah Duford (@jerushahruth) is a wife, mother, evangelical author, and a member of Lincoln Women, a coalition of women within the Lincoln Project.

He is also accused of hitting one of the women in the face during an altercation in his car.\\n\\nNeither woman is directly tied to Notre Dame and neither currently lives in Indiana.\\n\\nCharging documents say the St. Joseph County Cyber Crimes Unit recovered from Ayers' phone various images of naked women where they seem to be unaware that a photo was being taken of them. These images include the women in the shower, sleeping on a bed, or in a sexual position.\\n\\nOne woman told investigators she and Ayers got into a physical altercation while driving in St. Joseph County in July 2020, when she found messages from another woman on Ayers' phone. During the altercation, Ayers took the woman's phone and attempted to kick her out of the car, hitting her in the face in the process, documents say.\\n\\nThe woman also told investigators that she learned images of her, taken by Ayers in his South Bend home, had been shared by Ayers in a group chat with the guys, documents say.\\n\\nDetectives also interviewed a second woman who alleged that Ayers took a video of her without her consent.\\n\\nThe second woman said she had dated Ayers in early 2018. On one occasion at Ayers' house in South Bend in April of that year, she caught Ayers recording the two of them having sex on his phone, according to court documents. The woman complained and Ayers promised to erase the recording. He later apologized in an email exchange, court documents show.\\n\\nTwo of the voyeurism charges against Ayers are felonies, while the third voyeurism count and the domestic battery count are misdemeanors. A warrant for Ayers' arrest was issued Tuesday.\\n\\nOne of the accusers told The South Bend Tribune that she had known Ayers since he was a player at Notre Dame. She says they had a brief romantic relationship in 2007, when he was still a student, and started a new relationship years later, with her joining Ayers on summer recruiting stops and some games.\\n\\nShe said that one day in April 2018, she realized that Ayers was using a cellphone to videotape them having sex. She had turned down a request from him to do so months earlier, she said.\\n\\nTension over the cell phone incident remained the rest of that day and an argument ensued in the evening, at Ayers' home. She says she checked into a South Bend hotel in the early morning hours before flying out of town a few hours later. She did not file a police report at that time.\\n\\nHe messed with my life, she said. I was afraid to go forward.\\n\\nIn the weeks after the 2018 incident, the woman says, Ayers apologized and they stayed in touch, via text, phone calls and letters.\\n\\nShe says she came forward to authorities when she learned in August 2020 that there was a second accuser.\\n\\nIn a statement Tuesday night, South Bend attorney Peter J. Agostino said on behalf of Ayers, Ryan denies the allegations. His defense team is coming together and will vigorously defend him. Ryan looks forward to clearing his name of these false charges.\\n\\nAbrupt departure\\n\\nWhen the Irish men's basketball program announced in late September that Ayers, a 2008 graduate and former player, was no longer on staff, it left more questions than answers.\\n\\nWorkouts for the 2020-21 season already had started when Ayers left.\\n\\nAyers graduated from Notre Dame in 2009. A four-year letterman, he averaged 6.5 points and 2.4 rebounds in 117 career games. He also spent four seasons (2016-20) on Mike Brey's coaching staff. When a vacancy on his staff surfaced following the 2015-16 season, Brey's first call was to Ayers, then an assistant at Bucknell.\\n\\nNews of Ayers' departure from the program in September arrived in the form of a 19-word release from the basketball program. It said Ayers was no longer a member of the Notre Dame men's basketball program.\\n\\nIn a statement Tuesday, Brey said, The university and I decided that Ryan was unable to continue in his role to be a leader of young men, so it was necessary to make the staffing change a few months ago. This is a personal issue for Ryan and we won't elaborate any further."}

Elizabeth Warren added to her public comments about the U.S.-ordered airstrike that killed Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani after she was pressed by The View co-host Meghan McCain to acknowledge him as a terrorist.\\n\\nOf course he was, Warren said after a tense back-and-forth with McCain, who asked the question multiple times.\\n\\nThe Democratic top-tier presidential hopeful addressed recent criticism that her message on the Soleimani killing ordered by President Donald Trump appeared to have changed, because she referred to him once as a murderer and then later as a government official who was assassinated. Both are true, Warren said Tuesday.\\n\\nSoleimani was a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans, Warren tweeted after news of the airstrike surfaced. But this reckless move escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict. Our priority must be to avoid another costly war.\\n\\nWarren on the issues:The 2020 candidate shares her views on foreign policy, climate change, health care and more\\n\\nIn a later tweet, Warren said that Trump had escalated tensions with Iran. Now he's assassinated a senior foreign military official. He's been marching toward war with Iran since his first days in office—but the American people won't stand for it.\\n\\nI believe you respect the military and you respect our troops, McCain told Warren before reciting the multiple public statements. I don't understand the flip-flop. I don't understand why it was so hard to call him a terrorist.\\n\\nThis isn't a change. They're true, Warren said. The question is, what is the response that the president of the United States should make, and what advances the interests of the United States of America.\\n\\nMcCain interrupted to ask Warren whether Soleimani was a terrorist.\\n\\nHe's part of a group that's been designated--, Warren said before being interrupted.\\n\\nBut is he a terrorist? McCain interjected. Warren began giving the same response, when McCain again said, So he's not a terrorist?\\n\\nOf course he is, Warren said. He's part of a group that our federal government has designated as a terrorist. The question, though, is what's the right response? And the response that Donald Trump has picked is the most incendiary and has moved us to the edge of war.\\n\\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also a 2020 contender, used the word assassination to refer to Soleimani's killing in a statement. But another 2020 Democrat, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, called that characterization outrageous.\\n\\nThis is a guy who had an awful lot of American blood on his hands, Bloomberg said in response to Sanders' statement.\\n\\nCandidates respond:2020 presidential contenders react to killing of Iranian military leader Qasem Soleimani\\n\\nTrump ordered the killing of the influential Iranian figure late last week, which the Defense Department labeled a defensive action, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo explained it as preventing an imminent threat against American diplomats and soldiers.\\n\\nWarren has questioned the president's timing for the strike, suggesting it is a reasonable question to ask whether Trump is trying to distract from impeachment in an interview with CNN on Sunday. People are asking, why in this moment? Warren said.\\n\\nThe president of the United States could be facing an impeachment trial in the Senate. We know that he's deeply upset about that, she said.\\n\\nElection 2020:As Soleimani killing jolts presidential race, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders seize the moment\\n\\nMy take on this is, Soleimani was a bad guy, but the question is, what's the right response? Warren said on The View.\\n\\nWarren also hit Trump for his tweet suggesting the United States would target Iranian cultural sites if the regime retaliated for Soleimani's killing. It would be a war crime if the United States did that, Warren said.\\n\\nThe president has since backed off that statement, saying Tuesday, I like to obey the law.\\n\\nBut think of it: They kill our people, they blow up our people and then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions. But I'm OK with it, Trump said.\\n\\nHe has moved us close to the edge of war. He's put our country on the edge of going to war. We know that the Iranians are going to respond, Warren said. The job of the president of the United States is to keep America safe, to have a coherent, long-term strategy, not to make compulsive decisions.\\n\\nMore:Trump backs off threat to attack Iranian cultural sites amid rising tensions after Soleimani death"}
{"original": "ORLANDO, Fla. – Brian Kelly has been pounding away on this for weeks now.\\n\\nThe most important thing for Notre Dame in Monday's Citrus Bowl against LSU was get that elusive 10th win.\\n\\nWith their 21-17 victory over the Tigers, the Fighting Irish finally got it — one year after going 4-8.\\n\\nThe win also signifies the first time since 1994 that Notre Dame has won on New Year's Day.\\n\\nNow, with that accomplished, what does success look like heading into 2018?\\n\\nEvery year our mission is to play for a national championship, but we've built this to continue that process and work towards being one of those four teams that are part of the playoffs, Kelly said. But as I was reminded (Sunday), we hadn't won a New Year's game in like 752 years, so we've done that.\\n\\nWe won a close game, so we've done that. So there's strides that you make as you're building yourself toward being a playoff team, and today was a nice stride toward that.\\n\\nThere was a point in time during the regular season where that goal seemed within reach. Heading into November, Notre Dame was ranked in the top four by the College Football Playoff selection committee. But following a brutal road romp to Miami and another loss two weeks later to Stanford, Notre Dame was quickly out of the conversation. It still landed in a New Year's Day bowl game against a top-15 opponent from the SEC though.\\n\\nAnd the game came down to the final play. Notre Dame won on its final possession when backup quarterback Ian Book — who replaced first-year starter Brandon Wimbush in the second quarter — found Miles Boykin for a 55-yard touchdown bomb. Boykin, who hadn't gotten much playing time during the regular season but led his team with 102 receiving yards on Monday, made a one-handed grab to clinch the win.\\n\\nIt was not a moment Irish players had a chance to be part of a year ago.\\n\\nWe were in a bad spot last year, said senior left tackle Mike McGlinchey, who played his final game for the Irish on Monday. We all knew it. We decided that after the last game last year that wasn't going to happen again. It's not what Notre Dame deserves, it's not what our coaching staff deserves, it's not what our players deserve. We made a decision when we came back last January to make a change.\\n\\nI couldn't be prouder of the way our guys took that challenge and our senior class has been so great. We had such great leadership. I think we did a pretty good job laying the groundwork and I think the sky is the limit and I'm excited to see where it goes.\\n\\nWhen Notre Dame's season ended last year in a dreary Los Angeles Coliseum, Kelly's job status was under heavy national scrutiny and fans were unveiling ads blasting the coach and athletic director Jack Swarbrick in the local newspaper for an unacceptable year.\\n\\nFollowing one-on-one interviews with all 93 of his players and a brainstorming session with Swarbrick, Kelly gave his program a facelift. He made significant changes to himself and accepted failure, overhauled his staff and hired new offensive, defensive and special teams coordinators — plus a new strength and conditioning coach. And he shook up the culture — no one would earn playing time purely based on talent. They had to show necessary traits that Kelly laid out and repeated over the last 12 months.\\n\\nAfter all that, the Irish successfully completed the turnaround from the abominable 2016 season.\\n\\nMcGlinchey is a projected first-round NFL draft pick, but he could have left for the league last year. He came back for his fifth year to work on pass protection and become more dominant as a run blocker, but he also couldn't leave Notre Dame after a four-win season.\\n\\nHe won't be here to physically see things through, but has an idea of what success will look like for this program moving forward.\\n\\nI think it's just a building block, McGlinchey said. It went from more of a year to see the tangible results to, we really transformed this program. We had four wins a year ago and to go back from four wins and turn it into not only 10 wins, but we beat some really good football teams this year.\\n\\nObviously want to finish a little stronger down the stretch (in November), but I couldn't be prouder of our guys.\\n\\nFollow IndyStar Notre Dame Insider Laken Litman on Twitter and Instagram at @lakenlitman.\\n\\n► MORE: Kelly's prediction of Boykin winning Citrus MVP comes true\\n\\n► MORE: 3 reasons Notre Dame beat LSU in Citrus Bowl"}
{"original": "SAN JOSE – When Greg McElroy watches Alabama play these days – players spread all over the field, Tua Tagovailoa flinging the football with abandon – the former quarterback sometimes marvels.\\n\\nIt's totally different, he says.\\n\\nThe results, of course, are exactly the same. The Crimson Tide is still winning – up to five national titles now in the last 11 seasons, with a sixth in sight. But long gone are the days when the Crimson Tide pounded up the middle and sometimes let McElroy fake a handoff and throw it.\\n\\nIt'd be fun to play in that offense, absolutely, says McElroy, who's now an analyst for ESPN.\\n\\nIt's more fun to win. Or to keep winning – which is what all of this is about. As Alabama gets set to play Monday in the College Football Playoff national championship game against Clemson, the dynasty shows no signs of slipping. Nick Saban is increasingly hailed as perhaps the greatest coach in college football history. His ability and willingness to implement and embrace change might be the biggest reason for both.\\n\\nThe winning is constant. But how the Tide does it has been a matter of constant updates. As former Alabama assistant coach Mel Tucker puts it: Alabama – or more specifically, its coach – is like, well, an iPhone.\\n\\nAn iPhone is an iPhone, but every year it just gets better, says Tucker, who was recently hired as Colorado's head coach, because the competition is so fierce, if you don't improve on the product you get passed by. Nick is never satisfied. He's always looking to get better.\\n\\nSince Saban's arrival in Tuscaloosa, the Tide has undergone seismic shifts to combat and then to join the seismic shifts in college football. The defensive schemes and as important, the recruiting parameters, changed in order to combat the spread offenses that swept into the SEC.\\n\\nAlabama's offense eventually spread out, too. That grinding, ball-control attack gave way to a hurry-up. And then this year, to a full-on frenzy.\\n\\nDon't misunderstand. Saban does not always appear to enjoy the changes. Back in 2012, when uptempo offenses employed by Ole Miss and Auburn were causing all sorts of trouble to his defenses, Saban famously asked: Is this what we want football to be? – and he clearly did not want football to be that.\\n\\nIn a perfect world, Nick Saban wins 7-0, McElroy, who started at QB for Saban's first title team at Alabama in 2009, says. That's what he grew up with and is most comfortable doing. IF he had it his way, it would go back to old-school football. It's what he prefers.\\n\\nBut he prefers winning.\\n\\nAfter unsuccessfully pushing rule changes to slow down offenses and to limit how far offensive linemen could be downfield on passes, Saban joined in. As a defensive coach, the changes on that side came first. And as much as scheme, it began with recruiting. In 11 seasons, Alabama has morphed from a unit filled with huge, hulking players to a leaner, smaller bunch.\\n\\nFor comparison, consider two All-America defensive tackles from different eras. Back in 2009, Terrence Cody anchored the Alabama line – and we do mean anchored; he weighed in somewhere in the neighborhood of 360 pounds, and they called him Mount Cody. This season, Quinnen Williams won the Outland Trophy as the nation's best interior lineman. He weighs 295, and he's just the latest in an ever-shrinking line. The shrinkage is similar at linebacker; where Rolando McClain played at 255 or 260 pounds at 'Bama, the current models resemble the safeties of a decade back.\\n\\nHe's a great coach, says Mike Johnson, the former All-America offensive lineman. He's a great recruiter. But one of the most underrated things about Nick Saban and the dynasty is the ability to evolve. He has completely evolved what they do.\\n\\nOffensively, things began to change when Saban brought in Lane Kiffin as coordinator. The Tide began playing faster and faster and – especially this season – using the run-pass option (RPO). And now, with Tagovailoa at the helm, Alabama plays that style as well as any team.\\n\\nMcElroy says Alabama could have had similarly potent offenses in the past, but Saban wasn't ready to completely change his philosophy. Even a year ago against Clemson in the College Football Playoff semifinal, the Tide's preferred style with Jalen Hurts was to grind away and let the defense asphyxiate opponents. But now Saban has empowered the (quarterback) position, according to McElroy. And it's mostly because of Tagovailoa.\\n\\nTua makes them different, McElroy says. Tua is another level of anything they've ever had.\\n\\nTo make the point, Alabama ranks second this season in scoring at 47.1 points per game. None of Saban's previous 11 teams finished higher than 12th or averaged more than 39 points.\\n\\nIt all combines to create Alabama 3.0. But Tucker, who was a graduate assistant under Saban at Michigan State and an assistant with him for a season at LSU, then spent a decade in the NFL before returning to Alabama in 2015, says he's not surprised.\\n\\nThe philosophy hasn't changed, Tucker says. But he's perfected it. He's honed it and made it better and better as he goes, because he learns and he listens.\\n\\nAll of those coaches Alabama brings in as analysts or consultants or whatever? Their chief value might be how Saban picks their brains. Tucker describes Saban as someone who asks questions, listens and learns. That tracks with what Damien Harris described last summer, when Kobe Bryant spoke to the team: You see coach Saban down there taking notes.\\n\\nStill, it's the external changes – the stuff we all see – that's the most jarring for those who played earlier in the dynasty. Tagovailoa throwing the football all over the field to all those talented wide receivers seems like Saban throwing caution to the wind.\\n\\nIt was, 'We're gonna build a juggernaut on defense. Let's not turn the ball over. Let's convert on third down. And as many times as we can run the ball, we're gonna do it,' says Johnson, referring to the emphasis when he played during Saban's first few years at 'Bama. We would out-physical you, run it right down your throat, 4 or 5 yard a play, nothing you can do about it. Now, it's, 'Let's see if we can wear you out by going five wide and running past you.'\\n\\nIt's a whole different team, a whole different system. Every time I watch, I see just a different wrinkle.\\n\\nOutscoring opponents, getting a few more stops – see the Orange Bowl semifinal victory against Oklahoma – remains a difficult embrace.\\n\\nI know people like to play this way, Saban told USA TODAY Sports earlier this season. I understand. It's entertaining.\\n\\nBut he continued: There's still the old fundamental that good pitching beats good hitting. You've got to be able to keep from getting beat sometimes before you win.\\n\\nHe would rather win 7-0 – but if necessary, 55-45 is fine. Saban has evolved. And Alabama is not just different. It's better.\\n\\nIn a season when its defense is not quite as good as its lofty standard, the offense is exponentially more potent than ever before. And because of it, this might be Saban's best team – so far, that is. At 67, Saban shows no signs of slowing down – and he's still growing.\\n\\nWhat's the next update? Who knows, but it's coming.\\n\\nHe'll follow the bouncing ball, McElroy says. Wherever the game is going, he'll be there. He might be a year behind the others – like with the RPO – but he won't be behind for long.\\n\\nWhatever the next trend is, he'll win with talent and then adapt."}
{"original": "Get the hell out of our region!\\n\\nThat's what Azari Jahromi, a minister of telecommunications for the Iranian government, tweeted Tuesday night (early Wednesday in Iran), after Iran fired ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases that house U.S. soldiers.\\n\\nThat seemed to sum up the sentiment among Iranian media after the attacks, which Iranian TV said were in response to the U.S. killing of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qasem Soleimani. President Donald Trump isn't the only one wielding a Twitter account like a bludgeon.\\n\\nSo once again, on a January night, audiences watched as cable networks reported from the region. It was eerily reminiscent at times of Jan. 16, 1991, kicking off the first Gulf War when the U.S. bombed Iraq. CNN reporters Bernard Shaw, John Holliman and Peter Arnett hunkered under a table in a hotel room and reported on U.S. bombs falling on Baghdad – basically falling on them.\\n\\nWhy Tuesday's coverage was different\\n\\nYet there were striking differences, as well, in both the strikes and the coverage.\\n\\nFor one thing, U.S. troops Tuesday were being attacked. Also, the U.S. had a large coalition of countries supporting the 1991 bombings. Not so when it came to the strike on Soleimani.\\n\\nBut those things are obvious.\\n\\n'This was an act of war':Lawmakers react to Iran's missile strike on US military bases\\n\\nWhat we know:Trump once visited Iraq base attacked by Iran missiles\\n\\nOther differences revealed themselves over the course of watching CNN, Fox News and MSNBC report on Tuesday night. In 1991, CNN was the only 24-hour news network on the air. And the coverage was remarkably straightforward that night. There weren't attacks from politicians on each other, at least not then. The correspondents didn't offer opinions, other than sharing the opinion that they wanted to stay alive.\\n\\nAnd it was riveting.\\n\\nIt wouldn't last. The world, and the media, are a lot different now. The coverage of the Tuesday attacks showed how.\\n\\nMost striking, at least if you've watched enough of this kind of thing: During the early reporting, Fox News refrained from cheerleading.\\n\\nThat's typical. During the breaking-news portion of the cycle, the networks are often indistinguishable from one another. They all do a good job.\\n\\nWhen news commentators arrive, the tone shifts\\n\\nIt's when the story stalls and commentators start weighing in – or those annoying panels on CNN that would fill a city bus – that things turn ... different.\\n\\nChris Cuomo on CNN actually remained pretty civil, for him. Rachel Maddow on MSNBC, while there's no question where she stands politically, was mostly inquisitive in interviewing experts.\\n\\nThen there is Sean Hannity.\\n\\nTo the surprise of no one, Hannity immediately started making threats, saying bombers were on the way to the region and sounding like a schoolyard bully, gloating about how Mullahs better hide in their bunkers and refinery workers might want to change jobs pretty quick. He could not have sounded happier.\\n\\nThis is a problem.\\n\\nWhen it comes to reporting the news, and when reasonable people like Chris Wallace weigh in on Fox News, it actually contributes to the conversation. When Hannity brags about potential bloodshed it isn't just dispiriting in comparison. It's dangerous.\\n\\nIt's one thing to defend Trump's lies about the biggest inauguration in history or whatever. It's another to openly campaign for more attacks – and we know how Trump watches Hannity.\\n\\nCyberattack?:The risk of an Iran cyberattack is up after missile strike on Iraqi military bases\\n\\nChange to threat level?:US travel anxieties spike after Iran missile attack on Iraq bases\\n\\nNetworks started sending emails bragging that they broke the story first, but in an age of live-tweeting, does that even matter anymore? Tuesday night was a reminder that, for all of the technical advances, we are in uncharted territory, with Trump's fast and loose association with the truth. No matter what side of the aisle you support, healthy skepticism is crucial.\\n\\nBlind faith and willful ignorance are cancers on the media and society. We need to know the truth, report the truth – believe the truth.\\n\\nIt's harder than ever, which will make the next few days fascinating.\\n\\nFollow Bill Goodykoontz on Twitter: @goodyk"}
{"original": "Arthur Levine\\n\\nSpecial to USA TODAY\\n\\nNormally this time of year, we'd be shining a spotlight on all of the cool, new things that the Disney parks in Florida and California have planned for the coming year. But this year is anything but normal and, as with nearly everything else, the coronavirus pandemic has disrupted Disney's plans.\\n\\nThe year 2021 was supposed to have been a banner year for Walt Disney World. The Florida resort will mark its 50th anniversary in October, and there are some E-ticket attractions and more in the works that Disney had said would be ready for the big celebration. Now, the rollouts have been delayed, and their timelines are murky.\\n\\nLikewise, the original Disneyland and the adjoining Disney California Adventure Park have new features for visitors to experience. But the two theme parks still haven't reopened after shuttering in March, and it's unclear when state and local authorities will allow them to do so.\\n\\nThe company's 2021 plans, therefore, remain something of a mystery. As coronavirus vaccines begin to roll out though, there is every indication that the Disney resorts will likely debut some of what they have on tap.\\n\\nI'm incredibly optimistic about what 2021 and beyond is going to look like, says Josh D'Amaro, chairman, Disney parks, experiences, and products. Demand has been strong at Walt Disney World, which began to welcome guests back, albeit at reduced capacity, in July. You see people with tears in their eyes, he adds. These experiences are very meaningful – maybe even more meaningful now. When the world starts to open up and change, (visitors) will come back quickly, and we will be ready.\\n\\nThe first park to open at Walt Disney World in 1971 was the Magic Kingdom. But the focus of the resort's 50th anniversary appears to be on Epcot. The world's fair-like park is undergoing a major transformation. The company says that Remy's Ratatouille Adventure, a ride-through attraction at the France pavilion that will use trackless vehicles, will open in 2021. Based on Pixar's Ratatouille, passengers will shrink down to the size of Remy, the rodent who longs to be a gourmet chef, and join him for misadventures in Gusteau's restaurant. The World Showcase pavilion will also welcome an actual eatery, La Crêperie de Paris. It will offer both savory and sweet versions of the trés délicieux pancakes.\\n\\nMassive barges recently floated into position in the park's lagoon. They will be used as staging platforms from which to launch pyrotechnics, illuminate fountains, blast lasers and trigger all kinds of other effects for Epcot's new nighttime show, Harmonious. Delayed from 2020, it's likely the presentation, which Disney is touting as its largest-scale evening show ever, will debut in 2021. During the day, the platforms' fountains will bring energy and spectacle to the lagoon.\\n\\nThe front of the park, which has been known as Future World, will be divvied up into three lands: World Celebration, World Nature and World Discovery. For now, construction walls and temporary walkways abound. Disney recently unveiled a spiffy new fountain at the park's entrance.\\n\\nOne of the new projects under development is Space 220, a high-concept dining experience that purports to send guests 220 miles above the Earth for an, ahem, out-of-this-world meal. A space elevator will catapult patrons up to a space station outfitted with huge windows that will offer striking views of the solar system. The menu is supposed to feature modern American cuisine. Here's hoping Tang-inspired cocktails will be available.\\n\\nAmong other Epcot plans: Journey of Water, Inspired by Moana, which will probably open after 2021. The walk-through trail will be filled with interactive water effects and displays. The most anticipated new attraction at the park is Guardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind, an indoor storytelling coaster. It will feature cars that can turn 360 degrees and direct passengers' attention to the themed sets and scenes they will encounter in the enormous show building.\\n\\nAnother big-ticket, eagerly anticipated roller coaster, TRON Lightcycle / Run, is under construction next to Space Mountain in the Magic Kingdom's Tomorrowland. The launched ride, which will also include indoor scenes, will be themed to the Tron sci-fi movies. The coaster isn't expected to open during the park's 50th birthday year. But The Hall of Presidents, an opening day attraction, will likely be updated in 2021 to include President-elect Joe Biden.\\n\\nSmoked delicacies will be available at Disney's Hollywood Studios' new Roundup Rodeo BBQ, a table-service restaurant coming to the park's Toy Story Land. While it won't be new for 2021, the Studios' Mickey & Minnie's Runaway Railway, a delightful romp into the cartoon world of the iconic characters, will be new for most visitors since it opened a couple of weeks before the Florida resort shuttered amid the coronavirus outbreak.\\n\\nSince it was scheduled to open this past summer and is, by all appearances, finished and ready to welcome guests, it is presumed that Avengers Campus at Disney California Adventure Park will debut whenever the theme parks at Disneyland Resort can reopen and welcome a critical mass of visitors. The featured attraction at the new Marvel-themed land will be WEB SLINGERS: A Spider-Man Adventure. Recruits aboard tricked-out vehicles will sling their own webs and help the superhero collect Spider-Bots that are on the loose.\\n\\nA nimble Spidey will also swing high above the rooftops at Avengers Campus in the form of an autonomous stuntronic robot developed by Walt Disney Imagineering. Thanks to Pym Particles developed by Ant-Man and The Wasp, hungry guests will be able to order miniaturized and outsized food items at the new Pym Test Kitchen.\\n\\nThe classic Snow White ride-through attraction, which dates back to Disneyland Park's opening day, has been redesigned. Instead of subjecting guests to Snow White's Scary Adventures, as the ride was called, the newly dubbed Snow White's Enchanted Wish will be less ominous and sweeter in tone. It will include new scenes and new representations of the animated movie's characters.\\n\\nSpeaking via Zoom from Walt Disney's apartment above Disneyland's fire station, D'Amaro pointed out that the light continues to shine in the Main Street, U.S.A., window to honor the company's founder even though no guests are in the park. He sees it as a beacon of hope, a reminder of Disney's spirit and a clarion call for the future.\\n\\nI think back to 1955 when Disneyland opened. It was chaotic, and a lot of things didn't go right, D'Amaro says. But Walt did what he needed to do and reinvented the business. I can't help but think where we are now and the chaos of the moment. We are going to come out of the pandemic stronger – holding on to our legacy but pushing ourselves into new territories."}

The public would then have 90 days to weigh in on the change. Then the service expects to publish the final rule to reclassify within a year.\\n\\nBased on the best available scientific information, we believe the manatee is no longer in danger of extinction, Michael Oetker, deputy regional director for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife, said at a news conference Thursday at Miami Seaquarium.\\n\\nThe announcement comes after decades of studies and debate over whether Florida's most iconic creature should drop a peg from endangered, a status the marine mammal has held since America's original list of endangered species was created in 1967.\\n\\nEndangered means the species is at risk of going extinct. Threatened means they no longer are at imminent risk of extinction but could become so in the foreseeable future.\\n\\nWildlife officials took on a celebratory tone during Thursday's announcement, while assuring the change wouldn't dismantle slow-speed zones or lessen other manatee protections. But conservationists worry the reclassification would slide the manatee down a slippery slope of deregulation that would eventually gut vital protections before serious threats to the species have been addressed.\\n\\nIt's unclear what exactly the status change will mean, as boating and manatee advocacy groups continue to clash over what the rules on Florida's waters should be.\\n\\nThe manatee's listing status governs how state and federal and state agencies handle boating speed limits, dock and dredging permits and access to areas manatees frequent.\\n\\nThe Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission posted most of Brevard's manatee zones in the early 1990s, late 2002 and early 2003. The zones now cover 83 square miles — about a third — of the Indian River Lagoon and its tributaries in Brevard.\\n\\nThe zones require boats to go slow enough to prevent excessive wake, about 5 mph to 7 mph for most vessels.\\n\\nBoaters face a $92 ticket for speeding through the zones.\\n\\nFWC officials expressed support for the reclassification.\\n\\nBeyond the Endangered Species Act, manatees receive additional protections under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, making it difficult to undo boating, permitting and other rules that protect them, federal officials said."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – While urging Georgia voters to preserve Republican control of the U.S. Senate, President Donald Trump spent more time at a campaign rally Monday protesting his own election defeat – and putting pressure on Vice President Mike Pence to try and subvert Joe Biden's victory.\\n\\nI hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you, Trump told supporters in Dalton, Ga., one day before two pivotal Senate runoffs in Georgia and two days before Congress meets to count the Electoral College votes that elected Biden.\\n\\nSome Trump supporters falsely believe Pence, in his role as president of the Senate, can throw out electoral votes from Biden states after GOP lawmakers protest. Pence lacks that legal power, and is in the awkward position of having to announce Biden's electoral victory once the votes are counted.\\n\\nTrump called Pence a great guy, but also said: Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much.\\n\\nThe pressure on Pence came during a rally ostensibly devoted to a pair of Senate runoff elections Tuesday that will determine political control of the chamber.\\n\\nSome Republicans fear Trump's protests and attacks on the Georgia election process could dampen GOP turnout, putting both Senate seats at risk.\\n\\nTrump went into detail about his election complaints during the rally before a crowd that often seemed subdued during an 80-minute speech. Trump also attacked Republican leaders in Georgia, and at one point claimed he would campaign against Gov. Brian Kemp if he seeks re-election in 2022.\\n\\nOnce again, he made it about himself and not the candidates who need his support, said pollster Frank Luntz, who attended the rally in Georgia.\\n\\nTrump also made fleeting reference to Sunday's release of a tape in which Trump is heard pressuring Georgia officials to find votes to help him reverse his loss to Biden in the state, perhaps crossing a legal line.\\n\\nIn calling for an investigation, Democrats said Trump illegally demanded that Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger change the results of Georgia's election; Republicans generally defended the president, though some said the phone call also undercuts the party's chances on the eve of the pivotal Senate races.\\n\\nOne of the things I think that everyone has said is that this call was not a helpful call, said Sen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., a Trump ally appearing on Fox & Friends.\\n\\nSen.

Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, called it an egregious ploy that may enhance the political ambition of some, but dangerously threatens our Democratic Republic.\\n\\nIn urging Congress to block Biden's electoral victory, Trump used the rally in Georgia to echo his litany of lies and false allegations about the presidential election in several states. He did not mention his claims have been rejected by judges and elected officials across the country, though he did attack the U.S. Supreme Court for refusing to take up his case.\\n\\nAt a news conference earlier in the day, Georgia elections official Gabriel Sterling shot down president's claims one-by-one. This is all easily, provably false, yet the president persists, and by doing so undermines Georgians' faith in the election system, Sterling said.\\n\\nTrump also talked about the Georgia Republican Senate candidates, Sen. Kelly Loeffler and former Sen. David Perdue. Both face tough election fights against Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff.\\n\\nIf the Democratic candidates prevail, the new Senate would be split 50-50 between the parties, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to break the tie in favor of the Democrats.\\n\\nHarris visited Georgia on Sunday, while Biden held a rally in the state on Monday. Biden told Georgia voters that the power is literally in your hands to change the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nBiden also posted a tweet that seemed aimed at Trump's efforts to overturn the presidential election: In America, politicians can't assert, take, or seize power.

Democrats, however, have made steady gains in recent years, and have said Biden's win augurs more success in these two Senate races.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, even some Trump allies urged Republicans not to vote in the runoffs as a way to protest the presidential election.\\n\\nLuntz said Trump's repeated attacks on the Georgia electoral system won't help Republican turnout.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Jonathan Quick and Anze Kopitar have been teammates since they were drafted together 13½ years ago by the Los Angeles Kings, so the synchronicity of their milestone achievements Saturday night just felt right.\\n\\nAnd though 300 is a nice, round number, they were even more excited about a sharp win that propelled the Kings out of the NHL cellar.\\n\\nQuick earned his 300th victory and Kopitar scored his 300th goal while Los Angeles escaped last place in the overall league standings with a 4-0 win over the Edmonton Oilers.\\n\\nThe Kings' captain and their longtime starting goalie were the foundation of two Stanley Cup championship teams in Los Angeles, where they've been on the NHL roster together since late 2008.\\n\\nA few minutes after Kopitar got his milestone goal in the third period, Quick finished up his own landmark win along with his 51st career shutout.\\n\\nFeels pretty good, said Kopitar, the fifth player to score 300 goals for the Kings. I was hoping it was going to come a little bit earlier than that, but it's here, and I'm proud of that. ... It's great for Quickie. He's, in my mind, the best goalie in the world. It's very comforting to have him back there, and a privilege to play in front of him.\\n\\nQuick made 16 saves and combined with his defense to end the five-game scoring streaks of Edmonton stars Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl.\\n\\nAs far as 300 wins, it's just a group of guys that I've been lucky enough to play with, Quick said. Hopefully we keep going. We want to win some more games. For Kopi, that's awesome. He's more of a playmaker than a goal-scorer, so 300 goals, that's a lot.\\n\\nKyle Clifford, Tyler Toffoli and Jeff Carter scored during a dominant first period in the Kings' sixth win in nine games since mid-December.\\n\\nMikko Koskinen yielded three goals on eight Kings shots before Cam Talbot replaced him in the first period for the Oilers.\\n\\nEdmonton coach Ken Hitchcock castigated his team after its seventh loss in eight games.\\n\\nWe had one player show up and play, Hitchcock said. Darnell Nurse was our best player by a mile ... and that's all we had. We didn't compete. Their best players were their best players. We didn't compete. This is on everybody. When you have one player that competes at a high level in a game like this, it can't be acceptable. There's been too much of this go on in the first 41 games. We win one, and then we take our foot off the gas, and that's exactly what we did.\\n\\nThe poor first period was a rerun for the Oilers, who also struggled early against Arizona on Wednesday before rallying to win.\\n\\nWhat has to change for us (is) we're a situation-motivated team, Hitchcock said. I've only been here 20 games, and I see the situation motivates them. We lose, we get embarrassed, we get motivated, and that isn't a playoff team. That isn't a playoff attitude, and we have to change. But this can't be acceptable. ... I don't know what it is, but we'll figure it out.\\n\\nAll-Star Drew Doughty had two early assists for the Kings, who are on their first sustained stretch of strong play after languishing at the bottom of the league for much of the season.\\n\\nWith these two points, Los Angeles moved above Ottawa, Philadelphia and St. Louis while pulling even at the bottom of the Pacific Division with Arizona, albeit with more games played. They're small but vital movements for the Kings after a dismal first half of the season that included the firing of coach John Stevens.\\n\\nThe Kings ranked 30th in the 31-team NHL with only 22 first-period goals before they got three more past the Oilers.\\n\\nClifford put the Kings up just 3:15 in when he took a pass at mid-ice, skated around Caleb Jones and flipped in his sixth goal. Toffoli scored after Doughty kept an Oilers turnover in the zone and set up the forward for only his second goal in 25 games.\\n\\nCarter then chased Koskinen with his eighth goal of the season.\\n\\nNOTES: Kings F Carl Hagelin returned from a 20-game absence with a knee injury. The Swede played in only five games after Los Angeles acquired him from Pittsburgh in a trade for Tanner Pearson before getting hurt. ... Edmonton RW Alex Chiasson returned from a three-game absence with a sore knee. ... Oilers D Matt Benning was scratched for only the second time since Oct. 25. He left the road trip to attend his grandfather's funeral in Edmonton on Friday. Former Kings D Kevin Gravel took his spot in the Oilers' lineup.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nOilers: At Ducks on Sunday.\\n\\nKings: At Sharks on Monday.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NHL: www.apnews.com/NHL and www.twitter.com/AP_Sports"}
{"original": "David Jackson\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. — Other Republican candidates are eager to take on Donald Trump — but first they must get past each other.\\n\\nThat's why would-be contenders such as Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Jeb Bush, and John Kasich are spending as much or more time targeting each other as Trump, the front-runner in the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination.\\n\\nThe battle is to be seen as the best alternative to the front-runner, said Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union who watched some of the non-Trump candidates this weekend at an anti-poverty forum in the pivotal state of South Carolina.\\n\\nUsually, trailing candidates go straight for the top candidate. And, to be sure, many GOP candidates have attacked Trump over his temperament and lack of government experience. But aides and political analysts said the non-Trump candidates first have to winnow their own section of the field.\\n\\nAs caucuses and primaries take place, and more and more candidates drop from the race, there will eventually be a coalition of voters that are not Trump fans, Schlapp said. There will be an effort to try and stop Trump.\\n\\nEven Cruz, who has gone out of his way to avoid attacking Trump, has had to respond to the businessman's new habit of questioning whether Cruz's birth in Canada makes him ineligible for the presidency. Cruz himself has become the front-runner in Iowa, passing Trump in several polls ahead of the Feb. 1 caucuses that will open the Republican nomination process.\\n\\nU.S. Sen. Tim Scott — the South Carolina Republican whose endorsement is being sought ahead of that state's Feb. 20 primary — said GOP candidates have to be in the conversation, and one way to do that is to compare and contrast.\\n\\nWe'll see how well that works, Scott said after hosting the anti-poverty forum at a convention center near the University of South Carolina.\\n\\nPositioning for the Feb. 20 primary in South Carolina will change after results in Iowa and the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 9, creating what Scott called a window of opportunity for the survivors headed into the contest in the Palmetto State.\\n\\nWithin that window, we'll see who will emerge as the front-runner and, perhaps, the person in second place, Scott said after forum that featured non-Trump candidates like Rubio, Bush, Christie, Kasich, Ben Carson, and Mike Huckabee.\\n\\nAs the Republican race heads into its final months, many of those non-Trumpians are seeking to exploit the weaknesses they see in each other.\\n\\nFor Cruz, it is his own temperament and the feeling that he is disliked by so many Republican leaders, as well as his opposition to government surveillance programs.\\n\\nFor Rubio, it's his Senate absenteeism, as well as his past work with Democrats on a major immigration overhaul.\\n\\nBush? Given the son and brother of previous presidents, supporters of opponents say voters don't want a third Bush leading the party; opponents also criticized the former governor of Florida for going negative when his poll numbers dropped.\\n\\nChristie, the governor of New Jersey, has been hit over his past support of gun control measures as well as his state's economic problems.\\n\\nKasich, the governor of Ohio, has been criticized by some Republicans for his Medicaid expansion and over his own criticism of GOP members.\\n\\nIn many cases, analysts said, these candidates may feel they have little chance of attracting the kinds of iconoclastic, anti-establishment voters that go for Trump. At this point, they're probably better off scraping voters from the other non-Trumps, said Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C.\\n\\nHuffmon said there may be another reason that some candidates are leery of attacking Trump: Fear of retaliation from the businessman who has not hesitated to go on offense against his critics.\\n\\nThey may also be afraid of getting into Trump's cross-hairs, he said. Why subject yourself to abuse?\\n\\nAt the anti-poverty summit in Columbia, some Republicans said they are enjoying the battle.\\n\\nCarolyn Church, 69, who runs her own house cleaning business in Lexington, S.C., said the other candidates are trying to show they are more solid choices than the allegedly flaky Trump.\\n\\nChurch said she supports Cruz, but respects Trump for his seeming ability to attract new voters and draw attention to the Republican race.\\n\\nI like what Trump is doing, she said. Trump is stirring people up."}
{"original": "Rams lineman Rodger Saffold hears the pleas from fans whenever he's out in public. It comes at the grocery store, it comes when he's out with his kids, from fans on social media: Don't go to Los Angeles.\\n\\nEverybody's over there talking about 'please stay, please stay,' he said. And I just let them know it's really out of my hands, I definitely thank all the fans for everything they've given us and just whatever happens to continue to love the Rams. Because if it really is your team, you'll always show it, that's just how I feel.\\n\\nSaffold spoke to For The Win on Wednesday, shortly after Rams owner Stan Kroenke filed paperwork to move the team to Los Angeles, bashing their current city along the way. The Rams veteran said that other than the commercial he was plugging, he was focused on rehabbing from his shoulder injury and helping coach the younger guys on his team to fill in after the rash of injuries the team had this season. Which meant that he was too busy — or likely too media savvy really — to say if he opposed or was in favor of the move. After all, it's Stan Kroenke who signs his paychecks.\\n\\nSo when asked if he believed Kroenke was correct when saying that St. Louis wasn't a city that could support more than two sports teams, he demurred to the team owner.\\n\\nWe've got to leave this to the Kroenkes, he said. There's so much going on. You listen to the organization, you listen to the fans.\\n\\nMyself, I really need to focus on getting healthy and helping my team … you know whatever happens I have to be prepared for it because that's what life is in the NFL. You can get traded at any moment, things change and you have to roll with the punches, you just have to go with it.\\n\\nSaffold said the team heard about the possible move in a team meeting with Rams coach Jeff Fisher.\\n\\nI think I was just shocked at the possibility things could be changing, he said. I understand that this is [the Kroenkes'] team, I understand how the fans feel.\\n\\nThe Ohio native and Indiana graduate said he hadn't spent much time in California outside of when the team went for games and training camp. I really don't know much about the city, he said of Los Angeles. I'll just be as shocked and confused about everything that's going on. He did allow for one positive review, though.\\n\\nI will say that I love In-N-Out burger."}
{"original": "Jarrett Bell\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nHOUSTON – This was hardly the usual script for NFL business.\\n\\nYet in the end, the NFL's decision to select Rams owner Stan Kroenke's plan for a lavish, $1.7 billion domed stadium in Inglewood as its answer for the Los Angeles market felt a lot like a classic, two-minute drive to the finish line.\\n\\nA multi-billion dollar drive.\\n\\nOwners voted 30-2 on late Tuesday in favor of the Kroenke deal, despite a recommendation from its esteemed Los Angeles Opportunities committee to pick the stadium deal in Carson that was presented by the San Diego Chargers and Oakland Raiders.\\n\\nRams moving back to Los Angeles with Chargers given option to join\\n\\nIt almost never happens like that. Typically, when a committee – such as the six owners charged to evaluate the merits of the competing Los Angeles proposals – does the heavy lifting that leads to a recommendation, the rest of the owners follow suit.\\n\\nBut there was no rubber stamp here. This wasn't like tweaking instant replay.\\n\\nI've never been in a meeting where that many people voted against what the committee recommended, said Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, one of the most active owners – and not on the L.A. committee – in support of Kroenke's plan.\\n\\nWhat happened?\\n\\nIt was a case where the NFL's full body of ownership took ownership.\\n\\n'Greatest plan ever' in sports? Rams' vision for L.A. wows NFL owners\\n\\nAlthough the L.A. committee voted 5-1 in favor of the Carson project, it became evident quickly the majority of owners carried a different perspective. The votes for Carson, and 24 were needed for approval, weren't there.\\n\\nThe tide turned with the first tally, a secret ballot that resulted in 20 votes cast for Inglewood.\\n\\nSimply put, Kroenke's plan won the day because the prospect of a signature stadium, surrounded by extensive real estate development on a 300-acre site, presented more robust opportunity for revenue.\\n\\nNo surprise there. Cha-ching. Money talks. That much is indeed typical NFL business.\\n\\nOr, as New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch put it, It's a very important day for the NFL.\\n\\nThe deal – for which Jones said that Kroenke has committed $2.6 billion for the stadium slated to open by 2019 and as much as $15 billion for the real estate ventures -- includes a compromise that provides for the Chargers, or perhaps the Raiders, to partner with the Rams on the stadium.\\n\\nRams players react to leaving St. Louis for Los Angeles\\n\\nAt the same time, the measure allows Chargers chairman Dean Spanos a huge dose of leverage – and $100 million towards construction of a new stadium – if he decides to keep his franchise in San Diego with a taxpayer-supported project. Spanos will have a year to determine if he wants to partner with Kroenke. If he opts not to pursue L.A. – which I'd suspect is doubtful – Raiders owner Mark Davis would have a year to accept a similar offer.\\n\\nSpanos, whose Carson project enlisted a push from Disney CEO Bob Iger, may not have wound up with his desired option to win the market over Kroenke. But after pursuing a new stadium in San Diego for 14 years, he's obtained significantly more juice for a potential last-gasp effort. It's conceivable that the Chargers take the matter to voters on the November ballot, but public sentiment would have to change significantly given that polls indicated a 2-to-1 margin against taxpayer support for a Chargers stadium.\\n\\nStill, at least it's one of Spanos' options. And in a sense, it's typical NFL business to present communities with some sort of incentive to keep a team that could flee the market.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the twists and turns on the journey to L.A. seemed to reflect political mechanisms that come into play among team owners, if not the cold competition. That Kroenke announced his intent to build a stadium in Inglewood in December 2014 before even applying to relocate his franchise from St. Louis, was seemingly a threat to go rogue, and is said to have angered some fellow owners.\\n\\nUltimately, enough owners came around to support Kroenke's deal – and the compromise that involved the Chargers as a potential partner as Jones proposed in a resolution for owners last week.\\n\\nCompromise, for the sake of a bigger deal.\\n\\nIn the end, typical NFL business.\\n\\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell."}
{"original": "Melania Trump's first year as first lady is coming to an end and she remains as elusive and enigmatic as she was when she moved into the White House full time in June.\\n\\nWe will see more of her in 2018 if for no other reason than that she'll be a full-time first lady for a full year. And she's in the midst of planning her first big event, a state dinner sometime early in the year, although she's mum on details.\\n\\nBut it's an open question whether she'll exert more impact and influence in 2018, or if we'll get to know her even marginally better, say FLOTUS watchers.\\n\\nShe is more popular than her husband (most first ladies are), but not as popular as some past first ladies at this point in the administration, says Myra Gutin, a first lady historian at Rider University in New Jersey. No one knows the extent to which she influences her husband's decisions.\\n\\nThat's because Trump, 47, is not about letting it all hang out or preening in the blinding spotlight that comes with her position. Trump is first and foremost a reserved woman, accustomed as a former fashion model to affecting a neutral, even blank face at all times so as not to distract from the clothes or, now, husband President Trump.\\n\\nShe is approaching the unpaid, ill-defined job of first lady unlike any of her predecessors, recent or antique. But in her firm-but-unflashy manner, she is setting a marker: She's doing the whole FLOTUS thing her way — and she's still figuring out what that means.\\n\\nI think Mrs. Trump will continue to be true to herself as she said she would early on in the transition and soon after the election, says Anita McBride, who served as chief-of-staff to former first lady Laura Bush and now studies first ladies at American University in Washington. Her priority continues to be, as it should be, her young son Barron and his adjustment to life in Washington and the White House.\\n\\nAs a mom to an 11-year-old, Trump has been clear her primary focus is on him, making sure he's settled in at his new school and getting to soccer practice while including him in public events such as taking delivery of the official White House Christmas tree.\\n\\nBarron Trump settles in Washington:Barron Trump back in the spotlight for White House holiday events\\n\\nHer vision for her job in 2018 is still to be determined; Trump gives little away.\\n\\nShe is very self-possessed and I don't think she worries about pleasing people or meeting preconceived notions about what a first lady should or should not do, says Kate Andersen Brower, author of First Women: The Grace and Power of America's Modern First Ladies.\\n\\nWhile it is true English is not Trump's first language — that would be Slovenian; she is the first immigrant FLOTUS in 200 years — her command of English is good in more intimate, low-pressure settings.\\n\\nSo far, Trump has done no high-pressure, on-the-record interviews with print or TV media. She doesn't do social media that much, let alone let loose with strings of news-making tweets, as her husband does.\\n\\nMelania as Santa:First lady Melania Trump tweets Christmas greeting in Santa-hat filter\\n\\nShe's delivered few major speeches about substantive matters aside from an address at the United Nations in September during which she condemned bullying. She's been a decorative presence on multiple foreign trips but she seems happiest, judging from her relaxed and smiling pictures, in low-key encounters with children at hospitals or holiday events. And, of course, her fashion choices are avidly followed.\\n\\nThere was no political activity, almost no advocacy, observes Gutin. Mrs. Trump has been a ceremonial first lady. This probably sits well with half the country; the other half looks at the fact that she is not utilizing the White House podium to voice concerns or push an initiative.\\n\\nOr not yet, anyway. So far Trump's approach to her position has been methodical, careful and unobtrusive, informed by her own research and advice from experts and her small staff, and generally indifferent to the operatic hullabaloo and Twitter twaddle that often rages around her and POTUS.\\n\\nSocial-media warriors have used her to bash him, mocking her for not moving into the White House right away and making a viral video of her seeming to swat his hand away from hers on their first foreign trip. They criticized her for her choice of clothes, shoes and a gift of Dr. Seuss books to school libraries. They even at one point debated whether the woman standing next to him on the White House lawn was a body double. (She wasn't.)\\n\\nAs the two have often said, when he's hit, he hits back 10 times as hard. She shares her husband's disdain for the media; however, she is usually more subtle and thus maybe more effective.\\n\\nAfter Britain's The Daily Mail and a Slovenian magazine published false articles suggesting she worked as a high-end escort when she was a model, she sicced her lawyers on them — a first for a first lady. The publications capitulated, retracting, apologizing and paying up big bucks.\\n\\nI don't think that we're going to see a huge change in her over the next year — in fact, I think a lot of this has to do with her husband and her feeling that he is being unfairly persecuted, says Andersen Brower.\\n\\nThere is a bunker mentality that can develop in times like these and I think we'll be seeing her retreat to (Trump resorts in) Palm Beach and Bedminster quite often. She is very defensive of her husband and this is clearly weighing on her.\\n\\nTrump's plans for an anti-cyberbullying campaign are still on hold, either because she is being careful about launching an initiative or it's difficult to fight cyberbullying when her husband so often uses Twitter as a cudgel. Meanwhile, she's dived into the anti-opioid movement, decrying especially its often tragic effect on children and families.\\n\\nThis is an important way to use her unique platform and podium and with the right support, I believe her efforts and voice on this issue can make a difference, says McBride.\\n\\nAndersen Brower thinks Trump has been most effective, and happiest, when she has been out of the country. I think she should focus on her strengths in 2018: empathizing and spending time with children and doing more work to tackle the opioid crisis, and specifically how it impacts children, Andersen Brower says.\\n\\nGutin agrees Trump's best moments so far have been with children.\\n\\nAny (future) project that includes children might work well as these interactions seem to bring out her natural warmth, Gutin says. This could be a turnaround year if she increases her public presence and invites media in to discuss her concerns.\\n\\nGiven the Trump White House's loathing of the media, this is not likely. Still, Mrs. Trump has stepped up to center stage for traditional White House events and on foreign trips. We can expect more of the former and possibly more of the latter, McBride says.\\n\\nShe has successfully presided over major events in the White House that are traditionally the purview of FLOTUS — the Easter Egg Roll and Christmas — that are always highly anticipated, McBride says. She has also shown that she is comfortable on the world stage, traveling with the president on his foreign trips. Perhaps we will see her do some of this on her own as well.\\n\\nTrump did not carry out a traditional FLOTUS duty in her first year — planning and hosting a state dinner at the White House, a major diplomatic and social undertaking, and the first time in decades an administration did not hold such an important event during its first year.\\n\\nThe White House says the administration hopes to schedule a dinner early in 2018; neither Mrs. Trump nor White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders has said which foreign country will be the first to be fêted. But Trump and her social secretary, Anna Cristina Rickie Lloyd, are experienced party planners: Trump organized her own wedding to Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago in 2005, a million-dollar affair with more than 350 guests.\\n\\nSo far, has Trump put a Christian Louboutin-clad foot wrong? At least once, says Andersen Brower, in the awkward dustup with President Trump's first wife, Ivana Trump, who was in the midst of selling a memoir.\\n\\nAlso a non-native English-speaker, Czech-born Ivana joked in an interview that she was the real first lady (a claim she later walked back). More implausibly, she claimed to regularly talk to POTUS by phone but not when Melania was around. Stephanie Grisham, Melania Trump's spokeswoman, responded with a curt statement to USA TODAY on Trump's behalf, calling Ivana's remarks attention-seeking and self-serving noise aimed at selling books.\\n\\nAndersen Brower suggests Trump's staff should have talked FLOTUS out of this needless scrap.\\n\\nI think that she needs to get a larger staff so that she can avoid pitfalls, Andersen Brower says. If she had more people advising her I think she could have been convinced not to do this because it made her look so petty and only helped Ivana's book sales."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nBRISBANE, Australia (AP) — In the 12 months since her previous trip to the Brisbane International, Angelique Kerber won her first two Grand Slam titles and supplanted Serena Williams as No. 1 in women's tennis.\\n\\nFor two sets on Wednesday night, Kerber dominated as the top-seeded player should. Between those sets, she struggled with her serve against the gritty determination of local wild-card entry Ash Barty, the 2011 Wimbledon junior champion who spent nearly two years out of tennis pursuing a career in cricket following her previous appearance at the Brisbane International in 2014.\\n\\nKerber closed out a 6-3, 2-6, 6-3 win with an ace, her fifth of the match, to progress to a quarterfinal match against sixth-seeded Elina Svitolina — the only player who beat both the No. 1-ranked women (Kerber and Williams) in 2016.\\n\\nI'm so, so happy to be back in Australia — that was my breakthrough last year, Kerber said. I had a really tough offseason. I was trying to push myself to the limits, so It's nice to be back on court again.\\n\\nIt wasn't entirely smooth for Kerber, who launched her breakout season with a run to the Brisbane final last year and went on to win the Australian Open, the U.S. Open and reach the finals at Wimbledon and the Olympics.\\n\\nShe fended off three break points in the first set but, with five double-faults in the second, was broken twice and allowed Barty to even the match.\\n\\nKerber regained her rhythm in the third and cut down her errors, and Barty's challenge ran out of steam.\\n\\nFrustrated Serena Williams loses in second round at Auckland\\n\\nOn the men's side, second-seeded Stan Wawrinka and No. 3 Kei Nishikori advanced.\\n\\nWawrinka, the U.S. Open champion, beat Viktor Troicki 7-6 (5), 6-4 in his debut match at the tournament to move into the quarterfinals against Kyle Edmund.\\n\\nFrom 2014-16, Wawrinka won the Chennai tournament in India without dropping a set.\\n\\nFor sure it's a bit different conditions, but I don't think it will change much for the preparation for Australia, said Wawrinka, who won his first major title at Melbourne Park in 2014. When you've been on the tour for so long, to play some new tournaments, it makes you a little bit fresher mentally.\\n\\nHe extended his record to 7-0 against Troicki, recovering an early break to dominate the match.\\n\\nNishikori was rusty against Jared Donaldson but found enough to hold off the American qualifier 4-6, 6-4, 6-3.\\n\\nEighth-seeded David Ferrer didn't make it that far, saving four match points on serve late in the third set before losing to Australian wild-card entry Jordan Thompson 4-6, 7-5, 7-5.\\n\\nIn his first ATP quarterfinal match, Thompson will play Nishikori, a former U.S. Open finalist and a three-time semifinalist in Brisbane.\\n\\nSixth-seeded Lucas Pouille was trailing Edmund 6-3, 3-1 when he retired from their second-round match because of blisters.\\n\\nA day after becoming the first player born in the 2000s to win a main draw match at an elite WTA event, Destanee Aiava lost to two-time Grand Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova 6-4, 6-3 in the women's second round.\\n\\nIt's pretty scary (but) I learned a lot out of that match, said the 16-year-old Aiava, adding that she had gained confidence, maybe, in my game and myself, knowing that I do belong here.\\n\\nAiava will return to her hometown Melbourne, where she will play an exhibition tournament next week to continue preparations for her first Grand Slam event. She has a wild-card entry for the Australian Open, where she is set to be the first player born this millennium to play a Grand Slam main draw match.\\n\\nKuznetsova will play French Open champion and fourth-seeded Garbine Muguruza in the quarterfinals.\\n\\nSecond-seeded Dominika Cibulkova rallied from a set and a break down to beat Zhang Shuai 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 in her first competitive match since winning the season-ending WTA Finals."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nTORONTO (AP) — For the second time in two weeks, Kyle Lowry took down the Utah Jazz.\\n\\nThe Toronto point guard scored 16 of his 33 points in the fourth quarter to lead the Raptors to a come-from-behind 101-93 win over the Jazz on Thursday night.\\n\\nBack on Dec. 23, Lowry had 19 of a season-high 36 points in the final period of a comeback victory at Utah.\\n\\nKyle's been doing a great job, said Raptors forward DeMarre Carroll, who had eight points and four rebounds. He starts the game trying to get other guys involved and then he knows at the end either him or (DeMar DeRozan) have got to close it.\\n\\nKyle stepped in and really took it on his shoulders and kind of willed us to that win.\\n\\nLowry, who went 5 for 6 from the field in fourth quarter, including 2 for 2 from 3-point range, also made four of five free throws in the period and added six rebounds and five assists on the night for the Raptors (24-11).\\n\\nDeRozan had 23 points and seven rebounds, while Jonas Valanciunas added 18 points and 13 rebounds as Toronto rallied from a deficit of 11 points in the second quarter.\\n\\nThe Jazz (22-15), who led for the first 44-plus minutes, were paced by Rudy Gobert's 15 points and 16 rebounds. Shelvin Mack added 17 points and Gordon Hayward scored 16.\\n\\nIt was the second straight loss for Utah, which committed 19 turnovers that led to 27 Toronto points.\\n\\nThat was a huge part of the game — that and the offensive glass, Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. It's tough to win when you turn the ball over and that's what happened.\\n\\nWe weren't tough enough with the ball.\\n\\nDeRozan's 18-foot jumper with 3:44 left gave the Raptors their first lead, 89-88. It was an advantage they never relinquished.\\n\\nDeRozan then took Lowry's feed down the lane for a dunk to extend the lead to three. After a Jazz turnover, Lowry drilled a 3-pointer to put the Raptors ahead by six with 2:43 to go.\\n\\nI don't want to get into analyzing how we could guard Kyle Lowry differently. We have to do a better job on him, Snyder said. Same thing happened to us at home. He's good.\\n\\nHayward's 3 and a pair of foul shots by Gobert cut the lead to one before Lowry's driving layup widened the margin.\\n\\nLowry bounced back from a season-low six points in a 110-82 loss at San Antonio on Tuesday.\\n\\nI'll tell you what, if it's a loose ball down there, he's like a little pit bull, Raptors coach Dwane Casey said. That's why he's who he is. He's been that way since high school and that's not going to change.\\n\\nHe took over the game down the stretch.\\n\\nLowry hit a 3 with five minutes remaining to cut Utah's lead to 85-84. But on the next trip up the court, Rodney Hood answered with a 3 as the shot clock expired.\\n\\nUtah led 73-71 going into the fourth quarter as the defenses tightened at both ends in the third.\\n\\nEach team barely cracked 30 percent from the field in the quarter. Utah was 7 for 19, the Raptors 6 for 17 as Toronto tied the game for the first time since the opening period.\\n\\nThe Jazz took a 52-48 lead into halftime as Mack set the pace with 13 points on 6-for-7 shooting. Gobert added eight points and 10 rebounds in the half.\\n\\nUtah led by as many as 11 early in the second quarter but the Raptors took advantage of some sloppy Jazz play to score 13 points off seven turnovers in the period to cut the margin to 47-46. DeRozan scored Toronto's final six points of the half.\\n\\nThey got offensive rebounds, they did their job, everybody got in and people just hustled, Gobert said. We weren't playing good defense. They could just get loose balls and go.\\n\\nTIP-INS\\n\\nJazz: G George Hill missed his third straight game due to a lip laceration and concussion-like symptoms. ... Mack scored 10-plus points for the seventh time in his past 12 games. ... Gobert extended his franchise-record streak of games with at least 10 rebounds to 22.\\n\\nRaptors: F Lucas Nogueira had four points, six rebounds and three assists in 26 minutes. He made his second career start in place of rookie Pascal Siakam, who had started all 34 games this season. ... F Patrick Patterson missed his third straight game with a strained left knee. ... Valanciunas had his team-leading 13th double-double of the season and the 90th of his career.\\n\\nRUDY'S REJECTIONS\\n\\nGobert blocked three more shots to give him 95 this season, tops in the NBA.\\n\\nSCORING SALUTE\\n\\nRaptors fans gave DeRozan a standing ovation during the game's first TV timeout after a scoreboard video montage paid tribute to him surpassing Chris Bosh to become the team's career scoring leader during Toronto's recent six-game road trip.\\n\\nPAINT PRESENCE\\n\\nToronto outscored the Jazz 12-2 in the paint during the fourth quarter.\\n\\nHE SAID IT\\n\\nTurnovers aren't something you work on. You can't go to the gym and practice. We just have to be tougher and more secure with the ball, Snyder said.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nJazz: Utah continues a five-game road trip Saturday night by visiting Minnesota. The Jazz beat the Timberwolves 112-103 in November during their only meeting so far this season.\\n\\nRaptors: Toronto travels to Chicago for a Saturday night game against the Bulls, who have defeated the Raptors nine straight times dating to Dec. 31, 2013."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nTAMPA, Fla. (AP) — The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are searching for their fourth coach in seven years after deciding Lovie Smith wasn't the answer to making the franchise relevant again.\\n\\nGeneral manager Jason Licht said Thursday that offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter is a strong candidate to fill the vacancy after working with rookie quarterback Jameis Winston this season. Licht stressed the Bucs also will explore options outside the organization to try to transform the last-place team into a playoff contender.\\n\\nGreat coaches come in different shapes and sizes and personalities, the second-year GM said during a news conference not attended by members of the Glazer family, who own the club and made the decision to fire Smith on Wednesday.\\n\\nThere are a lot of quality football coaches that are going to be available. There's been a lot of interest already, just in the last few hours, Licht added. Dirk Koetter is definitely one of those to be a very strong candidate. He's got a strong resume.\\n\\nKoetter was hired last winter after spending the previous three seasons working with Matt Ryan as offensive coordinator in Atlanta. The Bucs ranked 30th among 32 teams in yards gained before his arrival, but jumped to No. 5 this season, with Winston throwing for 4,042 yards and 22 touchdowns.\\n\\nLicht declined to discuss specific reasons for Smith's dismissal after the coach compiled an 8-24 record over two seasons, saying it was a not a day to dissect failures but rather talk about the future.\\n\\nSmith learned of the firing by telephone before declining an opportunity to meet face to face with the Glazers. He had two seasons and $10 million remaining on his contract.\\n\\nWe came in together two years ago with a shared vision of winning, asking fans not to be patient, to win quickly, Licht said, And we've all shared in the blame of that not happening.\\n\\nThe Bucs improved by four victories to 6-10 this season. However, they finished on a four-game losing streak that left them out of the playoffs for the eighth straight year.\\n\\nThis is Tampa Bay's fourth coaching change since the end of 2008. The franchise last earned a postseason berth in 2007 and hasn't won a playoff game since the club's Super Bowl run 13 years ago.\\n\\nLicht defended the decision announced by team co-chairman Joel Glazer in a brief late-night statement by the team.\\n\\nI commend them on the fact they take their time, they think things through, they don't make emotional decisions, they don't make in-season decisions, Licht said. I think when you have eight wins in two years, three home wins in two years, I think they've been patient enough. It does take time, but I think while you're building a good football team, you can compete.\\n\\nIt's not the first time Smith was fired following a season when his team showed improvement. He led the Bears to an 81-63 record, three division titles, two NFC championship games and one Super Bowl appearance during a nine-season stint that ended with the coach being fired after going 10-6 but not making the playoffs in 2012.\\n\\nTwo days before his dismissal, the 57-year-old Smith said he believed the Bucs were on track to earn a postseason berth next season.\\n\\nI think the message is pretty clear for all of us, it is about next year: 'Guys, we're going to be a good football team. We've laid the foundation, now it's time for us to reap the benefits of that.' That's the message going forward, Smith said he told players during a final team meeting Monday.\\n\\nIf you believe in what we're doing right now, we all will do more and we're going to have better success next year, the coach added. Once we get to a point where it's a critical time, we're going to get over the hump next time. The culture of (not) having losing seasons is just a year away. Guys believe that.\\n\\nSmith's successor will inherit one of the youngest rosters in the NFL. Five drafted five players became immediate starters over the past two seasons, but also made a number of mistakes in free agency that set the club back.\\n\\nOn defense, the team spent generously to bolster an inconsistent pass rush and improve a porous secondary after releasing cornerback Darrelle Revis shortly after Smith and Licht took over. But opposing quarterbacks completed 70 percent of their passes and had a combined passer rating of 102.5 this season.\\n\\nThe Bucs also ranked 26th in scoring defense, allowing 24 or more in 10 games.\\n\\nLicht said there's no definitive timetable for hiring a replacement.\\n\\nWe'd like to be fairly quick with this, the GM said, but we're not going to sacrifice thoroughness for it.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

When the career path you'd been advised would lead to your desired job seems strewn with new obstacles?\\n\\nFor Allen Vaughan, the answer was to create a new path. As a sports journalist at the Springfield (Mo.) News-Leader, with designs on one day reaching his dream job as a sports columnist, Vaughan became discouraged by the state of his profession in 2009. That's when a combination of economic recession and digital disruption meant that the News-Leader was not filling the types of jobs that Vaughan thought were important to reaching new, younger audiences, and jobs at other news organizations were increasingly difficult to secure.\\n\\nSo Vaughan quit his job and, with three partners, launched his own media website in Springfield. Called TAG, the website focused on local sports, music, food, arts and culture.\\n\\nOn an episode of The Full Story, USA TODAY's new podcast about journalism, Vaughan tells the story about his startup adventure — his successes and struggles — and why he ultimately decided to return to the organization he once shunned. He now works as consumer experience director at the News-Leader and recently was named to Editor & Publisher's 25 Under 35 list of journalists to know.\\n\\nUSA TODAY's The Full Story podcast gives you first-person accounts from the people who cover the news.

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA Today's newsroom and any business incentives.\\n\\nWhether you're fulfilling a 2019 resolution or just looking to upgrade some old equipment, getting new fitness gear is always a good idea. Whatever it is, it'll look good, feel good, work well and hopefully, you'll want to use it often.\\n\\nIt's finding the right gear for you that's the real challenge (other than getting up at 6 a.m. to actually workout) and it can be make-or-break on a resolution or routine. You don't have the time to search through and test tons of products, but at Reviewed, we do.\\n\\nWhile we haven't tested every product out there, we've got some great recommendations on the basics like foam rollers and earbuds that'll get you in the gym mood, so get motivated and moving with the best fitness gear of 2019.\\n\\nThe best fitness tracker: The Fitbit Charge 3\\n\\nWe loved the Charge 3's predecessor the Charge 2 and so far, the new version has lived up to its billing. The fitness tracker is perfect for anyone who's trying to get more active, or monitor their activity better and was named our top fitness tracker of many that we tested. Fitbit's constant notifications to move, its massive battery life, its easy-to-use interface and app, and its community of users make it top-notch.\\n\\nA great feature is that all of the stats on your watch sync to the Fitbit app, so you can track it on your phone as well. The watch comes with both a small and large band, so sizing isn't a problem and since it's waterproof, it can do in a shower, pool or rainstorm with no problem. The battery life is also excellent, lasting 10 days after its first charge and can support texts, calendars, weather updates and other reminders too.\\n\\nOne of our favorite parts, though, is the sleep tracking function which can help you monitor your sleep habits and try to improve them.\\n\\nGet the Fitbit Charge 3 on Amazon for $149\\n\\nThe best earbuds for running/the gym: The JLab Audio Epic Sport wireless\\n\\nThe Epic Sport comes with JLab's signature bendable earhooks, multiple eartip sizes, and three types of cush fins to help the buds stay in place. The inline controls consist of a streamlined remote with three buttons.\\n\\nThe audio can still sound a bit tinny and lacking in bass, especially if the fit isn't perfect, but JLab Audio has really gone the extra mile by building in three sound profiles: one that augments vocals and bass, one that has a flat profile with no extra enhancements (best for those looking for studio-like audio), and one that boosts the bass notes.\\n\\nWith an IP66 rating (able to withstand both dust and powerful water jets), the Epic Sport should be able to withstand rigorous workouts. Another high point is the satisfyingly long battery life which, in our experience, clocks in at over 12 hours. The skinny wires may make it easy to break the headphones, so be sure to pack up these earbuds in their case when not in use.\\n\\nOverall, we were impressed by the JLab Audio Epic Sport earbuds-especially their ability to connect from the first floor to a phone on the second floor. A few customers didn't appreciate the proprietary charging cable (which cradles the remote and isn't merely a micro USB to USB cable), but we think that the Epic Sport is a solid choice whether you're walking in the woods or cranking through reps at the gym.\\n\\nGet the JLab Audio Epic Sport earbuds from Walmart for $84.99\\n\\nThe best water bottle: The Hydro Flask standard mouth with flex cap\\n\\nThe Hydro Flask checks off all of our boxes: It's portable, versatile, durable and well designed. And it was the top performer by far during our temperature tests. Ice deposited in the Hydro Flask one morning remained largely unmelted, well into the next day. Its patented double-wall vacuum enables the bottle to hold cold and hot beverages and prevents condensation from forming on the outside, keeping it slip-free, and safe to store in bags alongside papers and laptops.\\n\\nThough it's often a caveat with stainless steel, the bottle didn't transmit any funky flavors to our water. It's also crafted from recycled materials and comes with a lifetime guarantee (which definitely helps justify the price). The only downside we found is it's not dishwasher safe. The extra-wide mouth can fit any sized ice cube, and the bottle is compatible with a range of Hydro Flask caps, that lets you rotate between flex caps, sports caps, straw lids, flip lids and press-in lids, to suit your specific needs or activity.\\n\\nGet the Hydro Flask on Amazon for $29.95\\n\\nThe best yoga mat: The Lululemon Reversible Mat 5mm\\n\\nThe surface may seem hard at first, but it actually has just the right amount of softness for comfort without any wobbling on the user's part. It also boasts a completely flat, non-stick surface. We could can firmly plant our hands and feet on the mat without slipping while switching poses or trying to hold a plank. It's easy to wipe down after a workout, too, though it does take some time to fully dry. And while it's a bit on the heavy side, it rolls small, which is great for portability.\\n\\nThe biggest downside is the steep price point. So, we'd recommend this mat for either experienced or passionate yoga-goers, especially those who are going to stick with the sport. If you do a lot of yoga or bodyweight workouts and want that barely there but still comfortable yoga mat feel, this is an awesome option.\\n\\nGet the Lululemon Reversible Mat 5mm from Lululemon for $68\\n\\nThe best foam roller: The LuxFit Premium high density foam roller\\n\\nOur personal favorite of the bunch is the LuxFit Premium High Density Foam Roller. Not only is it incredibly simple to use, it works exceptionally well to massage out my sore muscles, as it's hard enough to be effective without being painful. The roller also offers a great stabilizer for planks and an effective aid for pushups and yoga moves (for those who are interested in multi-purposing their roller).\\n\\nSo while it doesn't offer the deepest massage, going too deep isn't always what you want. The LuxFit gives a worthy massage without inducing further pain, and we can see ourselves reaching for this one time and time again.\\n\\nGet the LuxFit foam roller on Amazon for $23.95\\n\\nFor those running with a buddy:\\n\\nThe best jogging stroller: The Graco FastAction fold jogger stroller\\n\\nWe tested this stroller and liked it for it's fast-action folding which, true to its name, breaks down the stroller very easily for storage and transport. It's price point among jogging strollers was also a plus for us and Amazon buyers like it too as it's the No. 1 selling jogger on the site.\\n\\nGet the Graco FastAction jogging stroller on Amazon for $99\\n\\nThe best dog leash: The Lead Mate and Leash combo\\n\\nDesigned specifically with arthritic or carpal tunnel-plagued owners in mind, the Lead Mate is an ergonomic attachment that ingeniously eliminates hazards that clutching at, tying knots in, or wrapping a leash around your wrist for greater control, can impose. When simply clipped on the desired portion of the leash, the lightweight, no-slip sphere—made of 100 percent recycled ABS plastic—provides superb grip and a thoroughly comfortable hand-hold, allowing walkers to effortlessly deal with pullers, and clearly transmit commands. The Lead Mate can also be used to couple two leashes together for a double dog walk, fasten a leash around your waist for a hands-free jaunt or jog, or used as a tether, for securing a leash to a table at an outdoor cafe.\\n\\nWhile you can purchase the Lead Mate with a 6-foot reflective nylon lead with padded neoprene handle, the Lead Mate attachment can be purchased separately and be used with any leash—magically transforming it into one pretty near perfect product.\\n\\nAnd as if this weren't already a strong enough sell for animal lovers, the company donates its products and 10 percent of all profits to animal shelters. Several shelters were also involved with development and initial prototype testing. The Lead Mate comes in five colors, and two models intended to fit either flat or rope leashes.\\n\\nGet the Lead Mate and leash combo on Amazon from multiple sellers\\n\\nThis article features excerpts of product reviews published on Reviewed.

{"original": "Jefferson Graham\\n\\nUSA Today\\n\\nLAS VEGAS — The world is one big round place, and the problem is, we've been looking at a cropped view of it for way too long.\\n\\nBut thanks to new technology advancements in cameras and online algorithms, we can now zap open our smartphones and see all around us — in front, back, to the left and right, above and below, in full spherical, 360 view.\\n\\nAt the Consumer Electronics Show, which ended Saturday, 360 video and virtual reality (VR) was the big talk of the show, from huge concerns like YouTube and corporate parent Google, to Facebook's Oculus Rift and camera makers GoPro, Ricoh and 360fly. VR and 360 are here — and set for bigger things in 2016.\\n\\nIt's like everything else, you want to see everything, you want to hear everything, says Matt Sailor, the CEO of ICrealtech.com, which introduced three ALLie-brand 360 cameras at CES.\\n\\nWith 360, viewers get to be completely engrossed, and go to places they've never been, adds Andy Peacock, product head at camera start-up 360fly. (360 is often used interchangeably with virtual reality, though the latter typically indicates you're using goggles for an immersive experience.)\\n\\nThe biggest news of the show was the introduction of the $599 Oculus Rift VR headset, which went on sale Wednesday with pre-orders that won't be filled until June. With the Rift, gamers will get a much wider and expansive view of their worlds than they've ever seen before.\\n\\nBeyond VR for gaming, much talk at CES also concerned 360 for photography.\\n\\nIn a speech Thursday night, YouTube's Chief Business Officer Robert Kyncl talked about how VR was going to dramatically change the mobile viewing experience.\\n\\nDigital video to surpass TV by 2020, says YouTube's Kyncl\\n\\nWe currently watch 1.5 hours a day of digital video, he said, compared to five hours daily for TV. But he sees digital video surpassing TV within four years, with VR being a huge driver for the shift.\\n\\nOn YouTube, we made a big, early bet on 360-degree video because it is the first type of video that actually gives you a better experience on mobile than you can have on desktop or on your TV, said Kyncl. And since we know mobile video is exploding, formats that lend themselves to mobile storytelling will grow along with them.\\n\\nWhat's been holding back both filmmakers and the average Joe from diving into 360 in a big way is the limitations of how 360 video gets made. To get the full view, you usually need to use a bunch of cameras tapped together, and then stitch or piece the views together in video editing. That process can take hours, days, even weeks.\\n\\nSeveral camera manufacturers looked to solve that issue here, with small, consumer-grade cameras that are easier to use, can be toted around, and promise to eliminate the stitching issues.\\n\\nThe Ricoh Theta S, released in late 2015, won the CES 2016 Innovation award, and the new 360fly company showed a new model at the show, a compact spherical camera in the shape of a little ball, that expands the category by shooting 360 video in 4K resolution.\\n\\nNo longer are you limited to these very expensive complicated rigs that use multiple cameras, says Jim Malcolm, president of Ricoh Imaging, which makes the Theta. Now you have a simple product you can put in your pocket and push a button and join the revolution.\\n\\nThe Theta costs $369, and is so popular, Ricoh is having a hard time keeping them in stock.\\n\\nThe 360fly 4K model hasn't announced pricing, but is expected to sell in the $500 range later this year. The company also showed up a new helmet cam for serious cyclists and motorcycle riders, with a built-in 360 camera. Longtime camera maker Nikon also announced a new 360 cam here at CES, the KeyMission 360, with two lenses. No pricing or availability was revealed.\\n\\nExperience the Blue Angels in 360-degree video\\n\\nThe cameras are easier than the multiple rig set-ups, but there are still editing issues and apps to download to process the files. They offer one-click instant uploads to Facebook and YouTube's 360 channel, where they can be viewed as is, with the user moving the image around to see more, or via a viewer, like Google's Cardboard.\\n\\nThese 360 cams have the potential of bringing VR to consumers sooner than later, says Tim Bajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies and allow anyone to create content for VR.\\n\\nHe sees real estate, sports, travel and advertising as great potential markets for 360.\\n\\nWith a 360 cam, a cruise line could shoot a room a person might want to book and put them in the room so that they can walk in the room, see what it looks like and perhaps even walk the ship to see how it looks and what amenities it offers. Real estate agents could offer virtual tours, and advertisers could use 360 to put customers directly into the action, or use it to explain a product or service more fully, he adds.\\n\\nGoPro CEO Nick Woodman spoke in the YouTube presentation, explaining how he saw 360 as the next chapter in GoPro's evolution.\\n\\nThe company will release a super rig aimed at pros this year. A 15-camera GoPro unit, the $16,000 Odyssey, in partnership with YouTube-owner Google, promises Jump software that will eliminate stitching.\\n\\nWoodman says he hopes to follow up shortly afterward with a consumer grade, one-camera GoPro 360 setup.\\n\\nVR is what's next, Woodman said. With VR you can teleport people into a new experience and blow their minds. It's not a question of if, but when it will become adopted by consumers. This is the same type of content that's made GoPro so successful. If we're not innovating, we cease to be relevant.\\n\\nIs 2016 the year virtual reality becomes a reality? You can bet on it.\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY tech columnist and #TalkingTech host Jefferson Graham on Twitter @jeffersongraham."}
{"original": "No genre of popular music is safe from politically-incorrect inclusions, with ill-conceived lyrics showing up in every kind of beloved musical category, from hip-hop and Top 40 pop to country and soul.\\n\\nYet, there's something about rock 'n' roll that lends itself to trouble. The genre has cultivated a racy reputation from day one, with its stars over the years indulging in its associated bad behavior, -- making it perhaps inevitable that inappropriate content would show up in their songwriting.\\n\\nAnd while plenty of eyebrow-raising rock songs exist that still maintain their decency, many rock 'n' roll classics that were beloved would almost certainly stoke controversy today for content that runs the gamut of tastelessness.\\n\\nFrom the one-hit-wonders to the biggest names in rock history -- the Beatles, Jimi Hendrix and especially the Rolling Stones -- we explore 20 rock hits with lyrics that, in retrospect, almost certainly should've been edited out.\\n\\nI Saw Her Standing There, The Beatles (1963)\\n\\nThe John Lennon-penned opening stanza of Well, she was just 17 / You know what I mean are among the more ill-advised lyrics in the band's songbook.\\n\\nRun for Your Life, The Beatles (1965)\\n\\nAnother questionable Lennon track, it's hard to overlook the song's most egregious lyric, I'd rather see you dead, little girl / Than to be with another man.\\n\\nSweet Little Sixteen, Chuck Berry (1958)\\n\\nRock stars of a certain generation seemed to love singing about 16-year-old girls, and Chuck Berry was no exception here, with the song including the very questionable lyrics, Sweet little sixteen, she's got the grown up blues / Tight dresses and lipstick, she's sporting high heel shoes.\\n\\nMore:20 politically incorrect songs that'd be wildly controversial today\\n\\nYou're Sixteen, Johnny Burnette (1960)\\n\\nBurnette's ode to an underage girl was less skeevy than Berry's -- which doesn't change the fact that it's still an ode to an underage girl, with the chorus, You're sixteen, you're beautiful and you're mine.\\n\\nHe Hit Me (And It Felt Like a Kiss), The Crystals (1962)\\n\\nThe Phil Spector-produced classic is famous for its loving depiction of domestic violence.\\n\\nMoney for Nothing, Dire Straits (1985)\\n\\nThis Dire Straits classic could've (and should've) existed without all the gay slurs ‎Mark Knopfler casually drops in the lyrics.\\n\\nAin't No Woman (Like the One I Got), The Four Tops (1972)\\n\\nThis Motown favorite is a straightforward love song until its male narrator starts getting possessive, with the demand, It's my word, my word she'll obey, now.\\n\\n\\n\\nBlack Licorice, Grand Funk Railroad (1974)\\n\\nThis Todd Rundgren-produced ode to a woman dubbed black licorice is several woeful minutes of fetish-ization, featuring the line, She wraps me up in her slender legs / Her hot black skin to mine.\\n\\nIllegal Alien, Genesis (1983)\\n\\nIts message and story are seemingly well-intentioned, detailing a Mexican immigrant's struggle to cross the border in search of a better life. But the racist video puts the song in a whole different light, with stereotypical imagery of mariachi horns, ponchos, sombreros and oversize mustaches.\\n\\nOne in a Million, Guns 'N Roses (1988)\\n\\nAxl Rose attempts to win our sympathy with his story of a small-town white boy feeling lost when he moves to Los Angeles. But using derogatory language for gay and black men certainly doesn't help his case, nor do his wildly xenophobic lyrics about immigrants. (They talk so many (expletive) ways / it's all Greek to me.)\\n\\nHey Joe, The Jimi Hendrix Experience (1966)\\n\\nHey Joe is simultaneously one of Hendrix' iconic tracks that nevertheless sees him threatening violence and death against an allegedly-cheating woman, with the lyrics, I'm going down to shoot my old lady / You know, I caught her messing around with another man.\\n\\nIf You Wanna Be Happy, Jimmy Soul (1963)\\n\\nJimmy Soul's biggest hit is almost hilarious in its bad taste, with its indelible chorus, If you wanna be happy for the rest of your life / Never make a pretty woman your wife / So from my personal point of view / Get an ugly girl to marry you.\\n\\nIsland Girl, Elton John (1975)\\n\\nThe borderline fetish-ization in John's chart-topping ode to a New York City prostitute who's black as coal but she burn like a fire is cringe-worthy.\\n\\nGoin' Blind, Kiss (1974)\\n\\nAnother rock song dedicated to a sixteen-year-old, Goin' Blind has a particularly creepy backstory, its lyrics co-written by former Kiss member Stephen Coronel, who was convicted in 2014 of possession of child pornography and is currently serving a six-year prison term.\\n\\nChristine Sixteen, Kiss (1977)\\n\\nReleased three years after Goin' Blind, Christine Sixteen takes the band's depravity a step further, about a sixteen-year-old who's young and clean, featuring a groaner of a spoken-word interlude: I don't usually say things like this to girls your age, but when I saw you coming out of school that day, that day I knew I've got to have you.\\n\\nIn the Summertime, Mungo Jerry (1970)\\n\\nThis one-hit wonder is mostly a swingy summer favorite, save for the unabashedly problematic line If her daddy's rich take her out for a meal / If her daddy's poor just do what you feel.\\n\\nYoung Girl, Gary Puckett & the Union Gap (1968)\\n\\nThis '60s hit endures as an oldies classic, despite the fact that it's about an adult man who finds out his paramour is underage, with the chorus, Better run girl / You're much too young girl.\\n\\nBrown Sugar, The Rolling Stones (1971)\\n\\nEven Mick Jagger knows these lyrics aged incredibly poorly; in recent years, he's changed the words when he performs the song live. Beyond the song's opening stanzas, the racism, misogyny and outright references to raping slaves make this a low point in the Stones' discography.\\n\\nStray Cat Blues, The Rolling Stones (1968)\\n\\nAbout a fifteen-year-old girl that Mick Jagger compares to the titular cat for how she screams and spits, the lyrics write statutory rape off as not a capital crime, as Jagger leers, I can see that you're 15 years old, no, I don't want your ID.\\n\\nUnder My Thumb, The Rolling Stones (1966)\\n\\nMaybe the most misguided track in the Stones' discography, the song about a woman who's been molded to talk when she's spoken to is a blemish on their legacy."}
{"original": "Dr. Patricia Quinlisk\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nIt has been a long tough 2020. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel! Every day we now have a little bit more daylight. Effective COVID vaccines are beginning to make their way into our communities, many people are wearing masks in public places to prevent virus transmission, effective treatments are being found with mortality rates going down, and (sigh) many of us curtailed travel and went without seeing family these holidays to lower the risk of anyone getting sick.\\n\\nI, like most of you, am tired of the darkness, the cold and the social distancing, and I really, really want my life to get back to normal. But the experts tell us (and my 30 years of working public health causes me to agree) we will not be back to any semblance of normal until this summer at least.\\n\\nSo, what do we do in the meantime? How do we deal with being in this long dark COVID tunnel for several more months? While the next months are not going to be anyone's idea of fun, there are things we all can do to make our lives, and the lives of those around us, better:\\n\\nFirst: Change our mindsets from this is going to be horrible to I'm not going to let this stop me from doing what I want to do (though these things might have to be achieved differently).\\n\\nSecond: Make a list of all those things you've always wanted to do or told yourself that you'd do when you get time. Then realize that this tunnel situation may have given you the time and opportunity to start working on them. (I would guess that right now most everyone is indoors more, and many have fewer interruptions these days — though this may not be true for some, like health care workers and families with young children, who have my sympathies in these hard times).\\n\\nThird: Look at that list and see if there is anything on it that could be done while waiting for that light at the end of the tunnel. Have you wanted to learn to paint with watercolors? Finish home projects that you just never seemed to have time for in the past? Learn to play the guitar? Get into better physical shape? Learn how to meditate and reduce stress? Work on eating a healthier diet (including trying out all those recipes that you collected over the years)? Learn something totally new (like the geology of the southwestern U.S. — my goal of 2020)? Investigate your family's history? Relearn to crochet (like my younger sister)? Or new ways of woodworking?\\n\\nThe possibilities are endless. You just have to pick something that sparks your interest and enthusiasm.\\n\\nFourth: Find a partner, a family member, a buddy to support you while you work on these goals. It's well known that we get more things done and stick to goals better when we are not alone. Even if this is only over the phone. (Knowing that my weightlifting buddy will be on that phone twice a week is often only thing that gets me to work out, and I'm sure anyone looking in my window, as I count out loud while doing those bicep curls, probably thinks I'm quite odd, but my arms are already getting stronger!)\\n\\nFifth: Gather the materials, websites, books, apps — whatever you need to accomplish these goals. Put them out on your kitchen table, next to your desk or your bed or wherever you will see them every day. Use them to remind you of the goals you want to work on. And when you finish a step toward accomplishing these goals, celebrate! (I celebrate by eating a piece of dark chocolate; which will not surprise anyone who knows me!)\\n\\nThus, don't hold your breath and just think this tunnel is something to be endured. Use it. You may be amazed at all you can accomplish in the next few months.\\n\\nMaking and working on new, old or unique goals for the next few tunnel months will mean coming out into that light at the tunnel's end with a sense of accomplishment and gratitude that you not only survived but you found the inner strength to thrive — despite everything!\\n\\nGood luck! And I'll see you next summer.\\n\\nDr. Patricia Quinlisk is Iowa state epidemiologist emeritus and a demential prevention instructor. This column originally appeared in the Des Moines Register."}
{"original": "Christopher Elliott\\n\\nSpecial to USA TODAY\\n\\nIf your airline ticket seems to come with fewer perks than it used to, it's not your imagination. The ability to reserve a seat, change your flight and even to carry a bag onto the plane have been quietly stripped away.\\n\\nSure, you can still get those perks. But you either have to pay extra for them or participate in the airline's habit-forming frequent flier program. The most recent indignity, a dustup over minimum seat size, has many travelers asking: Should there be other minimum standards, when it comes to flying?\\n\\nIt doesn't seem right, says Kathleen Crowley, a frequent flyer and fashion designer who lives in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. She recently booked a basic economy class seat on American Airlines, and it came without the ability to reserve a seat. That didn't sit well with her.\\n\\nWhen I buy a plane ticket, am I not buying a seat on that plane? she asks.\\n\\nBefore I detail the airline perks you've lost, let's spend a moment talking about how you lost them. Airlines didn't unbundle these amenities from your airfares, which would have suddenly lowered your cost of flying. Instead, they kept the ticket prices the same and just started charging more for these essentials. In other words, they raised prices.\\n\\nSo to those of you who claim the stripped-down basic fares give budget-conscious air travelers more choices, I have just one thing to say: Please stop parroting airline propaganda. Removing these perks was just a money grab that made the airline industry wildly profitable – and you a little poorer.\\n\\nHere's a brief list of the amenities you've lost:\\n\\nBasic amenities\\n\\nMaybe it seems frivolous, but items like pillows, blankets, drinks and food are important to passengers, especially on longer flights. Airlines used to include them as part of your fare because it was the right thing to do. They still do in business and first-class. But now they make passengers in the main cabin pay extra.\\n\\nWhat's more, the items for sale are disposable. Many budget airlines will sell you blankets and pillows, allowing you to keep them after the flight is over, Matt Woodley, a frequent hotel guest who writes a blog about international moving. This is terribly impractical because the blankets are generally of lower quality and nobody wants to lug around a large blanket emblazoned with JetBlue on it.\\n\\nA carry-on bag\\n\\nThis is another attempt to upsell on what used to be considered normal, says Jeffrey Tucker, a frequent air traveler who works for a nonprofit organization in Great Barrington, Massachusetts.\\n\\nWho travels without luggage? Actually, some travelers have started doing just that in response to the fees. They shouldn't have to. The ability to check a bag – or to carry it on a plane, for that matter – should be included in the price of your ticket. Period.\\n\\nA seat reservation\\n\\nThis is one of the stranger things the airlines have taken away. Until recently, you used to be able to make a seat reservation when you booked a flight. Now you have to pay for the privilege.\\n\\nThis one has hit families and people with special needs the hardest. If they don't pay even more for a seat reservation, they might be separated on a flight. Congress tried – but failed – to right this wrong.\\n\\nA lot of travelers still think the ability to reserve a seat should be standard, says Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir. No matter the fare.\\n\\nA printout of your boarding pass\\n\\nI'm not joking. Some low-fare airlines, such as Spirit, charge up to $10 to print your boarding pass. Ryanair asks passengers to fork over an eye-popping $25 for a hard copy of their boarding passes. That's absurd. Can we at least agree that boarding passes should be included in the price of your ticket?\\n\\nTicket changes\\n\\nIn the old days, you used to make a change to your ticket for a nominal fee (or even free). Today, ticket change fees can exceed the value of your ticket. Some basic fares can't even be changed.\\n\\nHere's an idea\\n\\nHow about instead of misrepresenting their fares, we get all of the airlines on the same page. Ask them, or require them, to quote ticket prices that include all of these essential items: a boarding pass printout, a seat reservation, a checked bag, basic amenities and the ability to change a ticket for a reasonable price. If you want to uncheck a box that removes these extras, fine. The cost of your flight will fall. But don't quote a bare fare and leave passengers with the impression they're getting a deal.\\n\\nFact is, on some low fare carriers, passengers are spending almost as much on fees as they are on their ticket. That's deceptive – and wrong. Every airline ticket should come with a basic level of service and amenities. Airlines know what those perks are because they're already giving them to their top customers. So do you.\\n\\nHow much money are airlines making by selling 'perks'?\\n\\nAirlines have made a fortune by removing amenities and then selling them back to you. In fact, some airlines wouldn't be profitable without revenue from so-called ancillary revenue.\\n\\nLuggage fees: According to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics, domestic airlines collected a record $4.9 billion in 2018, up from $4.6 billion the previous year. A decade earlier, they only collected $464 million.\\n\\nTicket change fees: Airlines collected $1.4 billion in ticket change fees in 2018, about the same as the previous year. A decade before, airlines charged just $915 million.\\n\\nOther fees: Airlines don't have to report income from other fees. But in 2018, the airline industry collected more than $90 billion – yes, that's with a b – from all ancillary revenues, which includes the sale of its frequent flyer miles.\\n\\nFlyers, beware: These 10 airlines made the most from in fees in 2017"}
{"original": "Kim Komando\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nTwitter isn't just a place where people post Throwback Thursday photos. With over 170 million active users, it has become a major source for news and real-time updates around the world. In 140 characters, or less, Twitter users are able to spread ideas and trends like wildfire.\\n\\nWhen you first start wading through your Twitter feed, there are certain aspects that can seem overwhelming. But thankfully, Twitter has been around long enough that some best practices have finally been established. So, here are five totally tweetable tips to help you use Twitter like a boss.\\n\\n1. Learn the lingo\\n\\nBeyond the basic navigation functions, Twitter is the place where a lot of new terminology was born. So, to communicate effectively, you'll need to understand it. Right of the top, you'll first need to know the following:\\n\\n— Tweet: Messages on Twitter are called tweets\\n\\n— Timeline: As you tweet, your messages will show on your timeline\\n\\n— Follow: Tweeting interesting and relevant content regularly will attract followers\\n\\nBeyond those basics, there also several symbols and acronyms you'll see often in Twitter. I've created a quick guide to help you understand them:\\n\\nAlthough these are some that you'll see most often, there are others that might stump you if you're not ready for them. Here are some extras to watch out for:\\n\\n— b/c = because\\n\\n— BFN = bye for now\\n\\n— BTW = by the way\\n\\n— EM = email\\n\\n— FB = Facebook\\n\\n— FTW = for the win\\n\\n— FWD = forward\\n\\n— FWIW - for what it's worth\\n\\n— HTH = hope that helps\\n\\n— IRL = in real life\\n\\n— J/K = just kidding\\n\\n— LMK = let me know\\n\\n— LOL = laugh out loud\\n\\n— OH = overheard\\n\\n— TMB = tweet me back\\n\\n— TMI = too much information\\n\\n— YW = you're welcome\\n\\n— CX = correction\\n\\n— TL;DR = too long, didn't read\\n\\n2. Customize your header to create your own brand\\n\\nYou don't have to own a business to create your own personal brand, and customizing your Twitter header is one of the easiest ways to do it. Use your header to show off your personality, but still look professional. And, if you don't feel comfortable creating your own graphics, use a site like Canva that has hundreds of designs that will work for you.\\n\\nTo update your header image, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Log in to your Twitter account.\\n\\n2. Click Edit profile\\n\\n3. Click Change your header photo\\n\\n4. Follow the prompts to upload your photo, click Open\\n\\n5. Adjust the position and scale of your photo, then click Apply\\n\\nIf you'd like to personalize your profile even more, be sure to include a profile photo, personal bio and a link to your personal website. You can also customize your theme (or Twitter background) in your profile settings.\\n\\n3. Search for things happening locally\\n\\nTwitter has so many users that it's now being used to report illness outbreaks, and even earthquakes. And while that's pretty impressive, it also means that on any given day, there are millions of tweets to sift through.\\n\\nBut you don't need to be a super computer to find out what's happening locally. You just need to use this clever search trick.\\n\\nTo find local content on Twitter, type the following when you search:\\n\\nnear: [city] [state] [search term]\\n\\nHere's an example: near: Phoenix Arizona music\\n\\nUsing this search trick will cause Twitter to return results of tweets from nearby Twitter users about the topic you've specified. The results from my search near: 'Phoenix Arizona' music pulled up local bands, event listings and even a musician looking for a new lead singer.\\n\\nYou can also search locally by typing in your search term, hitting Enter, then clicking on the More options drop down. There, you'll find the option to filter your search results by clicking Near you. It's a great way to stay on top of what's happening in your community.\\n\\n4. Use keyboard shortcuts to save time\\n\\nTo make navigating the site easier, Twitter has included several keyboard shortcuts for you. But, chances are, you haven't learned them all. Using these shortcuts reduces the amount of time it takes to complete tasks on Twitter, because you don't have to jump back and forth from your mouse to your keyboard.\\n\\nHere are some of the best keyboard shortcuts to use:\\n\\n— j = next tweet\\n\\n— k = previous tweet\\n\\n— Enter = drill down into, or close a selected tweet\\n\\n— Space bar = page down\\n\\n— Shift + Space bar = page up\\n\\n— / = jump to search box\\n\\n— . = jump to top of page\\n\\n— g + h = go home\\n\\n— g + r = go to your mentions\\n\\n— g + p = go to your profile\\n\\n— g + m = go to your direct messages\\n\\n— g + u (then search) = view any user's timeline\\n\\n— f = favorite a tweet\\n\\n— r = reply to a tweet\\n\\n— t = retweet a tweet\\n\\n— m = send a direct message\\n\\n— n = compose a new tweet\\n\\n— Escape = cancel\\n\\n— ? = pull up a cheat sheet with all of these keyboard commands\\n\\n5. Shorten links to save space in your tweets\\n\\nOne of Twitter's key features is the 140 character limit on all tweets, and while this limit does save us all from excessive Twitter rants, it also means there's not much space. And, if you'd like to share a link in one of your tweets, that means your character count is even lower.\\n\\nTo combat this, rather than copy and paste links directly into your tweet, paste links into a link shortener first. Link shorteners do exactly as they say, they take long links and shorten them. The links will still take you to the same place, they'll just be reworked into a compact form.\\n\\nHere's an example:\\n\\nFull URL: http://www.komando.com/tips/337309/top-5-money-tips-of-2015\\n\\nShortened: http://bit.ly/1mdVVIm\\n\\nTo create this link, I used a free link shortening site called Bitly.com. With Bitly, you simply paste your link into the shortener and a shorter link will be generated in seconds. You can also create a free account to keep track of each shortened link you create. This is beneficial because Bitly then tracks the traffic, and you can see how many people clicked your link.\\n\\nOther services like Bitly include Ow.ly and Google's URL shortener. And, even social media scheduling platforms, like Buffer, will shorten your links automatically.\\n\\nAlright, now you've learned how to use Twitter like a boss - but there's still one thing left to do. When you start using Twitter, before you get caught up in the tweets and the hashtags, take a few seconds to follow me @KimKomando.

{"original": "Ben Mutzabaugh\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nWOW Air will announce its schedule and fares for its new routes from California on Tuesday morning (Jan. 12). The discount carrier says it will sell seats on those routes for as little as $99 one-way to Iceland and for $199 on connections to Europe. Ahead of that news, WOW founder and CEO Skúli Mogensen took time for a phone interview with Today in the Sky editor Ben Mutzabaugh. Check out the main story from USA TODAY, or scroll down for an in-depth Q&A.\\n\\nBen Mutzabaugh: You are announcing fares for your two new California routes on Tuesday (Jan. 12). But WOW has now been flying to the United States since last year, when your airline launched service from Baltimore/Washington and Boston. What's your early take on how it's doing?\\n\\nSkúli Mogensen: It's exceeding our initial expectations, which were still very high. Since launching Boston and Washington, our load factors have been around 90% on every single flight, which is our goal. And of course it's a key element in enabling us to continue to offer these super-low fares, is to fill the planes.\\n\\nWill $99 fares to Europe become the new normal?\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Industry analysts now use the term ultra low-cost carrier to describe the new breed of discount airlines like WOW. How do you feel about that label?\\n\\nMogensen : We actually have started to use more of the ultra low-fare model. Because to talk about ultra low-cost, it might sound like you're compromising on some other elements. But we have the newest fleet. We're getting two brand new Airbus A330 for San Francisco and L.A. We believe that one of the reasons we can offer the lowest fares possible is that we have a new more-efficient fleet.\\n\\nAnother very important point comes to customer satisfaction. The ultra-low-cost carriers squeeze the pitch (a measure of leg room) as much as possible. And I think this is acceptable on short-haul flights.\\n\\nBut when you are flying nine hours between Iceland and L.A., I don't think you can get away with that in the long run. I've studied Spirit, and I think they're doing a great job on many fronts. We have studied Ryanair, and I think they're doing a great job on many fronts. But there are certain elements that if you apply … to the long haul, you need to do some changes.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: So you'll be offering extra-legroom then on your new flights from California?\\n\\nMogensen: It's from 35 to 30 (inches). The majority of seats will be between 32 and 35 inches. Of course, as is standard, you can purchase the extra legroom and purchase the preferred seating.\\n\\nWOW Air expands to Canada, rolls out $75 flights to Iceland\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Will WOW will add more U.S. destinations this year?\\n\\nMogensen: We expect to announce at least one more destination in 2016. Certainly there will be a lot more in '17 and going forward.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Talking about your U.S. flights that you launched in early 2015, you've said that WOW has seen more business traffic from Baltimore and Boston than you originally expected.\\n\\nMogensen: It's actually very interesting. Travel historically has often been a large-budget item for a lot of businesses. We see that small (and) medium-sized businesses where the owner is still involved, that there's an increasing demand among businesses to shop around for the best option. I think that makes sense. It's very hard for a business to justify to spend thousands of dollars on a ticket when they might be able to spend, say $300.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Fares that can be as low as $250 on trans-Atlantic flights have the potentially to be very disruptive in a market place that's currently dominated by traditional carriers like American, Delta, United, Lufthansa and so on. But you're also seeing Norwegian Air – another ultra low-cost carrier -- expand aggressively in the United States. Which side do you view as your bigger competitor?\\n\\nMogensen: There are two sides to this question. Of course we come in and we will compete against the existing airlines who are flying across the Atlantic. That's clear. However, what we're also seeing is (that we) enable a lot more people to fly. Flying 20 or 30 years ago was a luxury item.\\n\\nSince then, domestic flying became more affordable and allowed more people to fly domestically. International travel, still is a luxury today. That creates the opportunity for us and others to come in and do better.\\n\\nWe are really hoping to stimulate the market significantly. So, sure, while we will definitely have an impact on some of the legacy carriers, there's still significant room to grow the total pie. We will first and foremost do that. But I also think the legacy carriers will get smarter themselves over time and the gap will narrow.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: When you say legacy carriers will get smarter, do you mean that you think they'll figure out how to become more cost-effective and compete more on price?\\n\\nMogensen: I think over time they will have to. Some will obviously not be able to do that. But if you look domestically in Europe, the low-cost carriers now have some 30% to 40% market share. Currently the low-cost model has maybe 2% market share in trans-Atlantic airfares. Should it be 30% to 40%? I don't know. But it certainly should be 10% to 20%. I think the low-cost carriers will grab significant share in the next 5 to 10 years.\\n\\nI would expect a significant increase in travelers across the Atlantic with these reduced prices. So the impact on legacy carriers will not be as much as you would think, at least not during the initial years.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: When you entered into Baltimore and Boston, you began selling connecting itineraries to Europe that overlap with big players like American, Delta. United and the big European carriers. Have you noticed any competitive response?\\n\\nMogensen: I think fares to and from Iceland have definitely come down. So we have seen reaction on those routes. But trans-Atlantic routes, we have seen prices come down in some areas. Now is it a seasonal response? Or is it a response to us? We've been in the market for such a short period of time, it might be premature to say. But, overall, there is no huge reaction as of yet.\\n\\n\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Historically, attempts to add discount service across the Atlantic have failed. Do you see something different about the market today?\\n\\nMogensen: I think it's all about the Internet. Twenty or 30 years ago, you had to rely on intermediates to sell and interact with the customer. There's a huge change in how you currently market and sell yourself to your passengers, which is fascinating to me how you can really be selling up to the last minute prior to the flight. This is the key in filling up the planes.\\n\\nWe have load factors (that ...) go up to 100% loads on an incredible amount of flights. I think the selling, the pricing has changed dramatically from how it was a decade ago. It also means that your competitors have a much harder time in positioning themselves against you. Some of the legacy carriers are still relying on the old schemes, the old pricing structure, the old revenue model, the old class structure. This is one of the advantages that we have.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Customers may have gotten used to paying extra for luggage, food and other items on domestic discount flights. But, so far, that's been rare on long-haul trans-Atlantic flights. WOW will charge for carry-ons weighing more than 11 pounds, as well as for advance seat-assignments and other items. Have you had to educate customers in this market about how you are different than other airlines that fly across the Atlantic?\\n\\nMogensen: Not really. I've spent a lot of time in North America. I'm always fascinated by how efficient the U.S. market is. In many ways, North America was late into the ancillary revenue business model in charging for the extras. But today, even what we would call the legacy carriers – American, United, etc. – have become extremely efficient in selling and finding the extra charges.\\n\\nThis is really what has changed the North American airline industry, which is now again very profitable. I think in just the last five years there has been an incredible change in how they (the airlines) are interacting with the consumer. They are using every possible opportunity up until you board the flight to sell you that extra legroom, to upgrade your seat, to charge you for the bags and everything else along the way.\\n\\nI think the consumer has largely been educated already.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Your fares have obviously drawn a lot of attention among U.S. consumers, who are not used to seeing fares to Europe for as little as $99 one way. During a fare sale last year, flights from Baltimore and Boston were available to Europe for less than $250 round trip.What are the value of these rock-bottom fares? You can't make much money on them. Is it a marketing tool? Just a way to fill up the plane and sell seats that would otherwise go empty?\\n\\nMogensen: I think they are clearly a way for us to fill the planes up above 90% on average. And I think this is really one of the big differentiators from how the airline industry was operating a decade ago. (It) is something we can do because we are in a direct relationship with our customers. So instead of having planes flying at 70% utilization, we're now up to 90% plus. And these extra seats -- that otherwise would have been empty -- it is better to sell them at these kinds of prices than not at all.\\n\\nSo, it's a combination of many things. But I don't like to think (of it as) a marketing scheme as such because it is something that we consistently try to offer – these kind of low fares. I can't promise you that you will find such fares on every single flight. Clearly there's a difference between high and low season, week of the day, time to departure, etc. But overall, if you are willing to shop around a little bit – be a little bit flexible – book in advance, you should be able to get these super-low fares.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Obviously, you are bullish on WOW's hub in Reykjavik.\\n\\nMogensen: People ask us, Why would people want to stop in Iceland? One interesting statistic is that currently you have about 60 million annual passengers going across the Atlantic. And half of those already need to make one or more stops to get to their final destinations. So taking all that data into account, and we look at the competitive landscape. Based on that, we make our route selections.\\n\\nTo use an old technology comparison, we definitely see the network effect. We used to talk about the fax machine effect. You know, the more people that have it, the more valuable it becomes. So we certainly see that, as we have continued to grow frequency and more destinations in Europe, clearly our Iceland hub becomes more valuable for any North American destinations. And vice versa.\\n\\nThe more frequencies we can add into our network – the more destinations we can add – the stronger the whole network effect becomes. And it becomes increasingly easy for us to add a smaller destination.\\n\\nI can give you an example. We recently added Bristol in south England as a destination. It's a great destination in itself. It has a lot of great attractions. It has close proximity to Cardiff and Swansea and Wales. But there are no direct flights from Bristol to the U.S.\\n\\nSo anybody that wanted previously to go from Bristol would probably fly to London and then from London onward. What I think is a great opportunity for us to grow is to find more cities like that in Europe and North America that are interesting destinations in itself but might not be large enough to justify direct flights.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: Of course, there is already another airline – Icelandair – that has long ago made a big bet on having a hub in Reykjavik. How do you stack up to them?\\n\\nMogensen: They have been around for a long time. They have all the symptoms of a classical legacy carrier. Of course they are a competitor on the point-to-point. They are also using Iceland as a hub. They have some good people. But, overall, I don't really see them as a competitor. And I certainly do not see them as a long-term competitor.\\n\\nMutzabaugh: You don't see them as a long-term competitor?\\n\\nMogensen: I would not want to trade places with them."}

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said Thursday that means it will not have to repeat the devastating release of water from the Bird Point levee that destroyed thousands of acres of farmland in 2011.\\n\\nHighway crews around St. Louis on Friday cleaned up the remaining debris from Interstate 44 and reopened the critical highway that runs southwest across the state from the city.\\n\\nHigh water from the scenic Meramec River swamped both I-44 and, further south, I-55, which also reopened Friday. The river drove hundreds of people out of homes and businesses in the St. Louis suburbs of Pacific, Eureka, Valley Park and Arnold.\\n\\nThe rare winter flooding of the Mississippi River and its tributaries, driven by heavy rain over a three-day period last weekend, is blamed for at least 22 deaths. Four people remain missing — two teenagers in Illinois, one man in Missouri and country singer Craig Strickland in Oklahoma.\\n\\nOther southern Missouri and Illinois towns were gearing up as the high water flows south well into the new year. Floodwaters will move downstream over the next couple of weeks, with significant river flooding expected for the lower Mississippi into mid-January, the National Weather Service said Friday.\\n\\nAuthorities in southern Illinois urged residents living behind the Len Small levee to move to higher ground after Mississippi River water topped it. The levee in the far southwestern tip of Illinois protects the towns of Olive Branch, Hodges Park, Unity and rural homes. All told, about 500 people live behind the levee.\\n\\nFarther south, the Mississippi River is expected to crest in Memphis at 42 feet on Jan. 9. Although no major flooding is expected in the city, officials are moving to protect roads and a local airport.\\n\\nMeanwhile, other parts of Tennessee and western Kentucky face flood threats as the Army Corps of Engineers and Tennessee Valley Authority work to control water levels. The National Weather Service issued a flood advisory for the Cumberland River at Dover, Tenn., through Monday evening.\\n\\nThere were signs of relief in some areas, however. While the Mississippi River is expected to crest at a record 50 feet before noon Sunday in Cape Girardeau, Mo., that historic high will still fall four feet short of the levee system's limits.\\n\\nThe flood protection system is performing admirably well at the moment, said Stan Polivick of the city's public works department, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. I have cautious confidence. We expect that the levee system will perform well. We'll stay vigilant to make sure something doesn't change.\\n\\nIllinois Gov. Bruce Rauner issued a disaster declaration for seven counties. In addition, three historic sites have been closed by the flooding, according to the Associated Press. The state's Historic Preservation Agency said Fort de Chartres, Fort Kaskaskia and Pierre Menard Home were closed in Randolph County, about 40 miles south of St. Louis, because the flooding made the grounds unsafe.\\n\\nIn Cairo, Ill., where the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers join, forecasts of lower crests brought hope to local farmers and residents, the Southeast Missourian reported.\\n\\nMost important, Army Corps of Engineers Maj. Gen. Michael Wehrc, who met with local farmers at a library in Charleston, Mo., Thursday, said he does not anticipate having to open the Bird Point levee, as happened five years ago to ease pressure along the river.\\n\\nLocal farmer Milus Wallace told WPSD-TV that his 2,000 acres of farmland were devastated in 2011. All of it was. Plus my house, tool shed and grain bins, he said.\\n\\nIn Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency because of imminent flooding from the Mississippi and Red Rivers.\\n\\nIn Tunica County, Miss., southwest of Memphis, dozens of families already have evacuated their homes as rising water rolls down the mighty Mississippi toward them, WREG-TV reported.\\n\\nOh gosh.

McGloin suffered an injury to his left, non-throwing shoulder in the season finale last week.\\n\\nDespite poor quarterback play from Cook contributing significantly to the loss, Raiders coach Jack Del Rio never made the switch.\\n\\nI asked at halftime, Del Rio told reporters after the game. The coaches really felt like there were other things that were kind of contributing and that it wasn't going to be a big change with a change at quarterback. So we stayed the course with that.\\n\\nThat's partly true. Houston's pass rush toyed with Oakland's injury-decimated offensive line. The running game sputtered. And even when Cook delivered the ball to his receivers, many of them dropped the passes.\\n\\nMORE NFL:\\n\\nTexans' defense shuts down Raiders for wild-card playoff win\\n\\nHouston Texans owner Bob McNair said coach Bill O'Brien is safe\\n\\nHouston Texans now wait to see which team they play next in playoffs\\n\\nCook, who made his first career start on Saturday, completed only 18 of 45 passes (40%) for 161 yards, one touchdown and three interceptions in the loss.\\n\\nIt became clear early in Saturday's game, though, that the Raiders would have a difficult time competing with the Texans with Cook under center. Heading into halftime, Cook had completed just 4 of 14 attempts for 41 yards, with no touchdowns and one interception. Worse yet, the Raiders were down 20-7 at that point.\\n\\nAfter the game, McGloin said it doesn't really matter when asked if he lobbied to get in the game.\\n\\nIt's tough, McGloin told USA TODAY Sports. You work extremely hard and prepare, and you get ready for these opportunities. It's just a little injury here and a little injury there, and you're not healthy enough to go out and help your team. That's what makes it so difficult.\\n\\nWhen asked if Oakland's coaches gave McGloin any indication that he would not play, the fourth-year backup continued to remain diplomatic.\\n\\nThey shouldn't have to, McGloin said. It's our job to try to be as ready and as healthy as I can be. It's their decision if they wanted to put me in or not. I have no control over that. I try to prepare as best as I can and be as healthy as I can be.\\n\\nThe Raiders converted only 2 of 16 third-down conversion attempts. They punted 10 times, including a stretch of eight straight in the second and third quarters. They had six three-and-outs.\\n\\nHouston's defense routinely stacked eight and nine defenders in the box daring Cook to throw the ball.\\n\\nIt was his first start, on the road, in a playoff game, against the No. 1-ranked defense, Del Rio said.

{"original": "David Holahan\\n\\nSpecial to USA TODAY\\n\\nAndrew Bacevich's latest book poses penetrating questions that transcend its title: The Age of Illusions: How America Squandered Its Cold War Victory (Metropolitan Books, 256 pp., ★★★★ out of four stars). A quarter-century after the United States defeated the Soviet Union in the Cold War, where are the fruits of that great victory? Why is America still armed to the teeth and bogged down in the Middle East? Why are its citizens so discontented, angry and divided?\\n\\nBacevich – who is a combat veteran, an academic and bestselling author – is a most unusual commentator given his self-described conservative bent. He voted for Ronald Reagan but also for Barack Obama (twice), and in 2016 for neither Hillary Clinton nor Donald Trump; he describes the last as a mountebank of the first order.\\n\\nIndeed, the author skewers pols and their policies left, right and center with potent laser-guided prose. Of Obama, he writes that the Nobel Peace Prize winner delivered not Hope and Change upon inheriting George W. Bush's wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but rather, More of the Same. On globalization, he opines, (It) was supposed to lift all boats. Instead, it was leaving millions stranded.\\n\\nNew thriller:Fans of Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl will love Tarryn Fisher's The Wives\\n\\nIn Age of Illusions, Bacevich worries about what motivates and inspires Americans today following the stunning ideological win in 1989 over communism. Freedom is all well and good, but he is concerned about what has become of his fellow citizens' sense of duty – in light of the narcissistic inclinations of American culture.\\n\\nBacevich's overarching thesis is that after the Cold War ended, America's leaders, both Democrats and Republicans, decided that the world was their oyster, that they would crack it open through the continuing spread of unfettered capitalism and hegemonic military might. American-led globalization would make one world order a reality. What could go wrong?\\n\\nA lot, of course, and there is plenty of blame to go around, according to Bacevich. He refers to leaders of both political parties who pursued this brave new world as intoxicated elites. Of the Bush Doctrine of preventive war, he writes: The United States thereby arrogated to itself the authority to designate certain regimes as 'evil' and to wage preventive war to destroy them. International Law had hitherto condemned preventive war, the Nuremberg tribunal calling it the 'supreme crime.'\\n\\nReplacing the decades-long Cold War with the War on Terrorism was an exercise in misdirection, he writes because terrorism does not pose an existential threat to the United States.\\n\\nNot long after the author condemned the Iraq War in 2007 as immoral, illicit and imprudent in an opinion column in the Boston Globe, his son, a U.S. Army officer, was killed in action there.\\n\\nThrough all the compelling details and insightful commentary of his book, the author keeps the larger picture near at hand. He presses the reader to ponder existential questions, such as, What does it mean to be an American?\\n\\nHis answer – what he believes Americans' next crusade should be – is as surprising coming from a conservative as the sudden fall of the Berlin Wall. In the face of accelerating climate change, he urges an alternative to capitalism as usual: an economy based on stewardship rather than satisfying an ever-growing appetite for consumption."}
{"original": "HOUSTON – Frank Reich, Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts stumbled out of the gates.\\n\\nThe seemingly obvious recipe for success wasn't working. The first-year head coach, the star quarterback and the Colts owned a 1-5 record.\\n\\nSo with the season already on the brink and another 10 games left on the schedule, Reich changed course.\\n\\nHe couldn't keep having Luck go out and throw 40, 50 and 60 passes a game. Balance became his goal. And as far as the hole that he and his players found himself went, Reich stressed simplicity in this area, too.\\n\\nHow are we getting better this day, Reich challenged his players. How are we getting better this day, he asked the next day.\\n\\nOn game days, he preached them, Let's go 1-0 this week. A victory did come – a blowout over Buffalo in which Luck threw only 23 passes while the offense racked up 220 rushing yards. And the daily quest for improvement continued. Eight more wins over a nine-week span produced a 10-6 record and put the Colts in the playoffs for the first time in four years.\\n\\nNaturally, Reich didn't change a thing on Saturday as the Colts faced AFC South rival Houston in the wild-card round. And the results, too, remained the same. Indianapolis upset its hosts 21-7 thanks to a balanced effort that featured 222 passing yards and touchdowns from Luck as well as 200 rushing yards and a touchdown from the ground attack.\\n\\nWhat originally began as survival-mode approach now has the Colts well-conditioned for a postseason that will challenge them to win in a variety of ways.\\n\\nWe know that as an offense, when we can do that, we have a great balance, said Luck, who made his first playoff appearance since the 2014 season and improved his postseason record to 4-3. We can throw it a bunch. We can huddle up. We can go up-tempo. We can slow down the tempo. We can run it.\\n\\nThe margin of victory was only 14 points, and the Colts didn't score in the second half. But nothing about this game was close. Indianapolis held a 422-322 yardage advantage on Houston. The Colts racked up 26 first downs, including 20 in the first half, and converted on nine of 14 third downs. The Texans managed 20 first downs but went 3-for-13 on third downs.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most impressive factor of the Colts' win involved the way they neutralized Houston's vaunted pass-rushers, including J.J. Watt and Jadeveon Clowney. The Texans didn't register a single sack, and they surrendered 200 rushing yards for the first time this season.\\n\\nThe Colts knocked the Texans on their heels from the start of the game, scoring touchdowns on their first two possessions – a nine-play, 75-yard scoring drive, and a nine-play, 74-yard follow-up. After throwing six times and running three times on the first drive, they ran six times and passed three times on the second possession.\\n\\nBefore you know it, we're down 14-0, Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. We missed a third down – our first third-down of the game – then they got the ball back, went up 14-0. That just changes your whole offensive game plan. You're almost in somewhat of a two-minute mode at that point in time, because you've got to play catch-up. Give the Colts credit all the way around. They did a better job than we did, obviously.\\n\\nAlthough these teams had faced each other twice this season – splitting those contests by a combined six points – the Colts just had a different look to them from the start.\\n\\nLuck's playoff experience, and the overall confidence with which he infuses his teammates, appeared evident. Meanwhile, the Texans appeared tight and made uncharacteristic mistakes.\\n\\nI know it sounds cliché, center Ryan Kelly said, but ever since we were 1-5, every win has been so big because we've had the cards stacked against us the whole season because of the hole we dug ourselves in.\\n\\nAdded wide receiver Zach Pascal, Our coach always emphasizes going 1-0. … We've been in this mode since the Buffalo game, where we knew we couldn't lose. So, it was good to see us come out, play like we normally play and execute.\\n\\nUp next, the Colts travel to Kansas City to take on the prolific Patrick Mahomes-led Chiefs in the divisional round. For much of the season, they have flown under the radar despite their strong finish to the season. The Chiefs no doubt will be tabbed as favorites, but we don't care what anyone thinks of us on the outside, cornerback Pierre Desir said.\\n\\nAlthough they're following Reich's week-by-week mentality, the Colts believe they have what it takes for a deep postseason run. They have the elite-level quarterback and a diverse and well-rounded offense as well as an emerging defense. And they have the mental toughness that enabled them to become only the third team in league history to reach the playoffs after a 1-5 start. And at this point of the year, it's often the mental that elevates above the physical.\\n\\nEveryone has faith in each other, Desir said. Frank is a great coach, great leader. He brings everyone in and everyone believes in him and each other, and that's what got us to this point.\\n\\nFollow Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – Amid little progress in talks to end the partial government shutdown, President Donald Trump said Sunday he will continue to insist on billions for a U.S.-Mexico border wall – but is willing to settle for a steel structure rather than a concrete one.\\n\\nI informed my folks to say that we'll build a steel barrier, Trump told reporters after returning from a staff retreat at Camp David, casting the claim as a concession to Democrats. They don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, as he left for Camp David, Trump described the budget battle as a very important battle to win, saying national security is at the heart of the shutdown as it passed its 16th day.\\n\\nThe shutdown hit a milestone on Sunday, tying for the third longest on record.\\n\\nWhile Trump huddled with aides at Camp David, Vice President Mike Pence, other administration officials, and congressional staff members met at the White House complex for more negotiations to end the shutdown. There was no sign of a breakthrough.\\n\\nThis shutdown could end tomorrow or it also could go on for a long time, Trump said.\\n\\nTrump also repeated that he is considering some kind of national emergency declaration that would, in theory, allow him to use defense funds to start building a wall. We're looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency, he said.\\n\\nDemocrats denounced Trump for both his wall demands and his talk of declaring an emergency.\\n\\nThis would be a terrible use of department of defense dollars, said Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, the new chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, on ABC's This Week.\\n\\nSmith and other Democrats called on Trump to reopen the government and then negotiate border security, as well start paying our border patrol agents and the other 800,000 federal employees who are furloughed.\\n\\nHe also told ABC: The president really doesn't understand the issue.\\n\\nMore:The government shutdown is tied for third longest on record — with no end in sight\\n\\nMore:Government shutdown: Pence, congressional aides leave meeting without agreement on funding\\n\\nWith the parties unable to agree on a spending plan to fund about a quarter of the federal government, Trump is insisting on more than $5 billion for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border; Democrats, calling the wall expensive and impractical, want to reopen the government at least temporarily to provide space for more negotiations.\\n\\nIn speaking with reporters, Trump said he sympathizes with the hundreds of thousands of federal workers who have been furloughed or are working without pay, but they can adjust.\\n\\nOn other issues, Trump:\\n\\nConfirmed he will give his State of the Union address on Jan. 29, pursuant to an invitation sent Thursday by new House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\\n\\nSaid he hopes to meet again soon with North Korea leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear weapons program; Trump again claimed, with no evidence, that without his diplomacy the U.S. would be at war with Kim's nuclear-armed government.\\n\\nClaimed he is still withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, but won't necessarily do so quickly; earlier in the day, during a trip to Israel, National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. would not withdraw until Turkey pledges that it won't attack Kurdish forces in Syria.\\n\\nBefore his departure for Camp David, Trump taunted Democrats over the immigration, noting that luminaries like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton have expressed concern about illegal crossings.\\n\\nThe only reason they do not want to build a Wall is that Walls Work! Trump insisted in one tweet. 99% of our illegal Border crossings will end, crime in our Country will go way down and we will save billions of dollars a year!\\n\\nLike Trump, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said the administration is willing to give up plans for a concrete wall and focus instead on a fence composed of steel slats.\\n\\nWhat's driving this is the president's desire to change the conditions at the border, Mulvaney told NBC's Meet The Press. And if he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence in order to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction.\\n\\nMulvaney, however, suggested the end of the shutdown is not near, telling NBC: I think this is going to drag on a lot longer.\\n\\nDemocrats called the idea of a physical barrier across the entire border expensive and ineffective, and said the solution involves more personnel and detection technology.\\n\\nNow in control of the House, Democrats are focused a plan to reopen the government that would include temporary funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which handles border issues.\\n\\nFunding DHS until Feb. 8 would give the parties time to negotiate a new plan for border, said House Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats.\\n\\nWhile criticizing Trump for saying the shutdown could last months or years if Democrats don't agree to the wall, Pelosi said that the senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now."}
{"original": "Chris Truax\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nYou've got to give credit where credit is due. President Donald Trump is sparking the biggest reexamination of the nuts and bolts of our democracy since the Constitutional Convention in 1787. How many of us had contemplated the ins and outs of the Vacancies Act or the proper scope of presidential power during a national emergency before Trump came along? Unfortunately, all this is missing some of the dignity of the original discussion, and we've ended up with a sort of tabloid version of The Federalist Papers in which those of us concerned about American institutions don't so much engage in learned debate as in frantically attempting to head off the next pending scandal.\\n\\nWhich brings us to the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Until a few weeks ago, this was one of the most obscure pieces of legislation on the books. The ECA governs how Electoral College votes are counted. In short, during a joint session of Congress, the vice president opens the envelopes containing each state's Electoral College votes and hands them to two tellers from the House and two tellers from the Senate who read the votes aloud. Once all the votes have been read, the tellers add them up and announce the result. In 2013, the entire process took 23 minutes.\\n\\nRepublic hinges on the honor system\\n\\nThere is a little more to it than that. The ECA also includes procedures for challenging Electoral College votes. A challenge requires the support of at least one senator and at least one House member. The House and Senate then convene separately to debate and vote on the challenge. In order to be successful, the challenge must be upheld by both chambers.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the statute is not always a model of clarity. It contains multiple sentences more than 200 words long and it isn't clear how some scenarios would be handled. Fortunately, none of these scenarios has ever come up.\\n\\nIn the 133 years since the ECA was adopted, electoral votes have been challenged exactly twice: Once in 1969, which involved a challenge to an elector who was supposed to vote for Richard Nixon but voted for George Wallace instead, and once in 2005, when Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, joined to challenge Ohio's presidential electors. In both cases, these challenges were rejected by both the House and the Senate. In the case of the 2005 challenge, which is the closest we've come to the situation we're facing Wednesday, the challenge was rejected 267-31 in the House and 74-1 in the Senate.\\n\\nTrump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election are far more serious. Based on their public statements, at least a dozen senators and at least 140 House members will vote to reject Electoral College votes from various swing states. That shouldn't happen, and if these congressional Republicans followed the terms of the ECA, it wouldn't happen. All the election results have been certified, all the legal challenges resolved and all the Electoral College votes cast, certified by the governors and sent to the Archivist of the United States — just as the statute requires. Trump's grossly inappropriate and probably criminal last-minute attempt to get the Georgia Secretary of state to find 11,780 votes and recalculate the election results wouldn't change these facts even if it were successful.\\n\\nAnd none of that matters. If members of Congress vote to reject valid presidential electors for invalid reasons, there's nothing anyone can do about it. While we've never fully appreciated it until now, the ugly truth is that, despite a nationwide vote fenced with elaborate legal and technical safeguards, the president of the United States is actually elected on the honor system by 535 members of Congress.\\n\\nGOP Sen. Rob Portman: No proof of mass fraud that would change election result\\n\\nDespite the unprecedented number of Republicans willing to uphold a challenge, the House is controlled by Democrats; in the Senate, Republican Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, is trying to discourage the move, though his objections appear to be tactical rather than principled. At least four Senate Republicans have pledged to uphold the election result: Mitt Romney of Utah, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Ben Sasse of Nebraska.\\n\\nBlueprint for an overthrow\\n\\nSo Trump's effort to interfere with the Electoral College count is going to fail — this time. Nonetheless, this tawdry episode is dangerous because it provides a blueprint for the next time. And there will be a next time because it's now clear that under the system of counting Electoral College votes, a party that controls both chambers of Congress can install its candidate as president regardless of the election results if its members have the political will to do so.\\n\\nDenialism 2020: Trump and his fanatical allies are electoral terrorists. It's got to stop.\\n\\nToo many of the guardrails of democracy are little more than white lines painted on the road that depend on a sense of honor, duty and integrity that is simply no longer the norm. Republican senators and representatives who vote to uphold a challenge Wednesday will be putting their fear of Trump and his supporters ahead of their duty to the country. That's shameful and unworthy, but that's the political world in which we now find ourselves.\\n\\nOur system of checks and balances is inadequate for the challenges we face, and it isn't just the Electoral Count Act that needs updating and strengthening. The Guardrails of Democracy Project has identified dozens of cracks and holes in our constitutional infrastructure that require urgent repair. Don't let Trump's buffoonery lull you into a false sense of security.

(AP) — When three cornerbacks went down with injuries, the Green Bay Packers' safeties had to make a quick change.\\n\\nForced to play out of position in coverage late in the game against the Detroit Lions, safeties Morgan Burnett and Micah Hyde, for the most part, did the job.\\n\\nThe Packers finished atop the NFC North and in the playoffs after their defense withstood another tough game in the secondary.\\n\\nIt's a microcosm of the season. Guys are going down and the next one jumps in and you keep going, coach Mike McCarthy said Monday about the 31-24 victory over the Lions.\\n\\nWith that comes a lot of confidence with the fact that you just do whatever you have to do to win the game, McCarthy added. That's kind of the way we're wired this year and that's what we'll take into this contest Sunday.\\n\\nA depleted secondary is the last thing that the Packers need ahead of the playoff date at Lambeau Field against the New York Giants and star receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\\n\\nGreen Bay (10-6) lost cornerbacks Quinten Rollins, Damarious Randall and Makinton Dorleant during the Lions game.\\n\\nRollins, who was carted off the field with a neck injury after hitting his head on the turf on a scary play along the sideline, has returned to Lambeau Field. He walked through the locker room briefly on Monday.\\n\\nRollins still needs to undergo more tests, but everything is progressing in a positive manner, McCarthy said.\\n\\nRandall, who was already on the injury report with a shoulder injury, also hurt his knee against the Lions. Dorleant, a backup, had to be carted off with a knee injury.\\n\\nPass coverage at cornerback was already an issue the past couple of games before injuries again hit the position.\\n\\nOne of the Packers' top linebackers in coverage, Joe Thomas, also left the Lions game after a back injury flared up.\\n\\nAll the injuries forced McCarthy and defensive coordinator Dom Capers to scramble. Burnett and Hyde, who already have key roles on defense for their versatility, assumed different responsibilities.\\n\\nHyde, who plays safety and slot cornerback, moved to an outside cornerback position opposite the Packers' last remaining healthy cornerback, Ladarius Gunter.\\n\\nA fourth-year veteran, Hyde intercepted a pass at the goal line intended for Golden Tate with 1:35 left in the game.\\n\\nIt's real out there. It definitely is. It's real. That's why (cornerbacks) don't get enough credit, Hyde said about playing the position on the outside.\\n\\nIn his seventh year in the league, Burnett's role has also evolved. With the Packers deep at safety, Burnett at times has played a hybrid-inside linebacker role that gives the team a little more athleticism in coverage while not sacrificing run defense, which is one of Burnett's strengths.\\n\\nAnd while Burnett will cover a tight end or running back at times, covering slot receivers isn't his specialty.\\n\\nWhile players switch roles in practice to get the experience, using Burnett in that position is a last resort.\\n\\nAt this point, it's just all hands on deck, and doing whatever's needed to help the team win, Burnett said.\\n\\nMcCarthy needed more time on Monday to sort out the injury situation at cornerback.\\n\\nIt seems unlikely, at the least, that Rollins will play given the nature of his injury.\\n\\nBut the Packers have been through this before, with Rollins and Randall both missing some time at midseason with groin injuries.\\n\\nThe results weren't too good. Randall was sidelined during Green Bay's four-game losing streak, then returned for the six-game winning streak that lifted the Packers back atop the NFC North.\\n\\nBut the Packers can get a shot of confidence with how the versatile Hyde and Burnett helped patch up a secondary down the stretch against Detroit.\\n\\nIt's a challenge but it's nothing that we can't handle, Burnett said. It's something that we've been practicing, something that we're prepared for, so we've got to go out and get the job done.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Genaro Armas at: https://twitter.com/GArmasAP"}
{"original": "Fred Wertheimer and Norman Eisen\\n\\nOpinion contributors\\n\\nProsecutors triggered a national firestorm last month when they asserted that President Donald Trump conspired with his ex-fixer, Michael Cohen, to commit campaign finance crimes involving hush money payments to two women. But the discussion has overlooked another Trump campaign finance offense — one that is even easier to prove because it occurred in plain sight.\\n\\nOn July 27, 2016, Trump called on Russia to find presidential Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's missing emails. Russia, if you're listening, I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump proclaimed. He added, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.\\n\\nFederal campaign finance law prohibits any person from soliciting campaign contributions, defined as anything of value to be given to influence an election, from a foreign national, including a foreign government.\\n\\nIn asking Russia to find Clinton's emails, presidential candidate Trump violated this statutory prohibition on seeking help from a foreign country to influence an election. Trump in essence called on a foreign adversary to locate and release something that was of great value to him and his campaign.\\n\\nRead more commentary:\\n\\nNo exit: America's not only trapped in Trump's legal reality show, we're paying for it\\n\\nTrump's lies and corruption disgrace presidential legacies of Lincoln and Washington\\n\\nHow House Democrats can save democracy and the rule of law: Impeach Trump ASAP\\n\\nThe law provides that such a solicitation is illegal regardless of whether the person soliciting the help receives anything in return. The risks of foreign intrusion in our elections are so great that even asking for help from foreigners without consummation is a crime. But in this case, on or about the same day that Trump solicited help from Russia, Russia made its first attempt to break into servers that Hillary Clinton's personal office used. That event is laid out in detail in an indictment of Russian hackers obtained by special counsel Robert Mueller.\\n\\nTrump can hardly claim he could not have seen that coming. Suspected Russian election-related hacking was already much in evidence at the time. Nor can he plead ignorance of the law. Trump has given sworn affidavits and made other statements that he has deep understanding of campaign finance laws.\\n\\nTrump was warned about foreign solicitation\\n\\nIndeed, before his July 27, 2016, request of Russia, Trump had been put on notice that it was illegal for his presidential campaign to solicit support from foreign interests. On June 29 and July 22, 2016, watchdog groups (including one led by one of the authors) filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department, respectively, against Trump's presidential campaign committee for illegally soliciting financial support from parliamentarians in countries around the world, including Iceland, Scotland, Australia and Great Britain. Multiple news organizations had reported that Trump's campaign was violating the ban on foreign solicitations by emailing fundraising solicitations to foreign nationals. The Trump campaign did not respond to press requests for comments on the FEC complaint.\\n\\nThen-candidate Trump, self-described as deeply familiar with campaign finance laws and on notice that his campaign committee was illegally soliciting foreign support, nonetheless proceeded to publicly request assistance from Russia to find information to hurt Clinton and help his campaign.\\n\\nSome may say Trump's invitation was merely campaign rhetoric or hyperbole, which should not be criminalized. But that is to ignore the plain language of the law and its purpose: to protect the United States from the influence of foreign countries in our elections. The statute says, It shall be unlawful for … a person to solicit, accept or receive a contribution or donation … from a foreign national.\\n\\nIn using the word or, the statute makes plain that the act of solicitation in and of itself is a violation. The danger of Trump's words can be seen in the fact that Russia took them both seriously and literally.\\n\\nJustice Department says Trump can't be indicted\\n\\nIf this were an isolated incident, that would be one thing. But the Cohen revelations expose a pattern of campaign finance law violations by Trump, complete with a tape of him discussing the cover-up: evidence he knew what he was doing was wrong. Then there are the many other allegations of illegal conduct, including substantial evidence of obstruction of justice. The president appears to operate with blatant disdain for the nation's laws, and his alleged violation in soliciting campaign help from Russia is only one instance.\\n\\nThe president should not be immune from accountability for this alleged misconduct. Federal prosecutors should be free to charge him for any campaign finance offenses grounded in probable cause, including, if they see fit, the July 27 solicitation of Russia. Unfortunately, they are currently blocked from doing so by opinions from the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel that a sitting president may not be indicted. We join eminent experts in disagreeing with those opinions, and this latest possible offense should be one more nail in his coffin.\\n\\nTrump campaign and business could be charged\\n\\nEven though Justice is unlikely to change its mind on charging Trump, next best options are available. The Trump campaign is legally responsible under principles of vicarious liability for the statements of its head and so could be indicted. The Russia solicitation could be included in an indictment featuring other counts, such as charging the campaign and the Trump Organization for the separate alleged hush money violations described by Cohen.\\n\\nNo Justice Department policy prohibits prosecutors from naming the president as an unindicted co-conspirator in such an indictment. And with a five-year statute of limitations, he could still be prosecuted for these alleged knowing and willful 2016 offenses should he fail to seek or secure re-election in 2020.\\n\\nCampaign finance laws are enacted to protect the American people. They do not exist for candidates to choose whether to comply with the laws or not as they see fit. No one is above the law — not an ordinary citizen and not the president of the United States. President Trump must be held accountable for his allegedly illegal activities — for his apparently knowing and willful violations of the nation's campaign finance laws.\\n\\nFred Wertheimer is founder and president of Democracy 21.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nOAKLAND, Calif. (AP) — Stephen Curry pumped his fists and flexed his biceps. He dangled that signature mouthpiece from his teeth in sheer delight.\\n\\nOh, and he knocked down some of those familiar way-back 3-pointers, too.\\n\\nYes, Golden State's sharp-shooting star is feeling it again, and he's proud to be, in his words, that presence that kind of gets us going. Yet Curry was ruled out for Wednesday night's game against the Clippers after he slipped during the morning shootaround and tweaked his troublesome right ankle.\\n\\nIn a 32-point, nine-assist performance against Denver on Monday, Curry wound up 9 for 17 overall while making 5 of 10 3-pointers. He remains a menace for opposing defenses even without his best shot.\\n\\nCurry's mere existence on the court makes every Warrior better. Teammate Draymond Green shot 42.1 percent from the field while Curry missed 11 games with a sprained right ankle. In the five games since Curry's return, Green has hit 55.6 percent. Klay Thompson and Andre Iguodala have also shot better since Curry came back.\\n\\nThat's why he's a two-time MVP in this league, that's why we have two championships, Green said. He's become the superstar that he has even on a night where it wasn't quite his night, he filled the stat sheet up like that and impacted the game. Even if he didn't have 32 points and nine assists, what he brings to our offense and all the attention that he draws that gets me open shots ... he creates a lot of mismatches on the floor for the defense.\\n\\nThe reigning Western Conference player of the week, Curry has scored 29 or more points in seven straight games. He has scored 30 or more points in six of those seven games and 12 times overall this season.\\n\\nCurry had been practically unstoppable in those five games since returning from the initial ankle injury, averaging 35.2 points over that span as well as 5.6 rebounds, 5.6 assists and 1.4 steals in 32.4 minutes. He also has four or more 3-pointers in seven straight games.\\n\\nThe Warriors have needed his steady hand with playmaking sidekick and Finals MVP Kevin Durant sitting out the past three games with a strained right calf. Durant was expected back Wednesday night while Curry won't play.\\n\\nConsidering Curry also had six turnovers Monday night, coach Steve Kerr hardly considered it one of his star's best games.\\n\\nThat's fine with the two-time MVP.\\n\\nEvery game's not going to be pretty. I love being held to that high standard. That's what kind of keeps me motivated, Curry said. When you can look at that line and find things that I can do better, which nobody needs to tell me that I already know.\\n\\nCurry's footwork is something that impresses teammates Green and David West, even if it's not the showiest talent for him.\\n\\nI think people get caught up in the flashy stuff, but his footwork is incredible, West said. I think that's the one thing that kind of gets lost in it. If you're a basketball person you understand that footwork is sort of the foundation. I don't think we've seen the type of footwork he has. He gets his feet set on every single shot, he's never out of range.\\n\\nCurry works hard on that footwork in the offseason. It's what allows him to have such a quick release, even if he's catching the ball on the move or with his body facing half-court.\\n\\nIf you've got slow feet or shaky balance, it throws your rhythm off and your consistency, he said. I wouldn't say I have like wide-receiver feet, where they've got the quick jabs and they can change direction up like that. I just feel like I'm always in balance, and that's what helps me get my shot off quick and stay in a solid rhythm through my shot and be able to handle the ball and try to be creative.\\n\\nCurry will look to dazzle again soon for the Warriors, who will try Wednesday to extend their winning streak to six games while playing without him.\\n\\nHe's fast with the ball but he's not the fastest guy in the world. He's pretty strong but he's not the strongest guy in the world, but his footwork is so good that for what speed he may not have, it makes him way faster because of how good his footwork is, Green said. He's probably faster than someone that may be faster than him because he kind of dances. He should go on Dancing with the Stars.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball"}

Holloway went on to defeat Jose Aldo by third-round TKO at UFC 218 in a rematch of their June title fight, which ended in the same manner.\\n\\nIn the grand scheme of things, veteran MMA oddsmaker Joey Oddessa sees this bout as a matchup of two underdogs.\\n\\nPeople have been betting against both Edgar and Max their entire careers, the told MMAjunkie, and now they're forced to pick between the two.\\n\\nWhile that might be true, Oddessa believes the choice is clear as the Oddessa Line has set Holloway at -300 and Edgar at +235, making the champion a sizeable favorite.\\n\\nThat means a winning $100 bet on Holloway would result in a net profit of $33.33 (with an implied win probability of 75 percent). A winning $100 bet on Edgar would come with a profit of $235 (win probability 30 percent).\\n\\nIt's not hard to see why the odds are this way. Holloway, MMAjunkie's 2017 Male Fighter of the Year, is on a phenomenal 12-fight winning streak, just the fifth fighter in UFC history have a streak that long. He hasn't lost since 2013, and he has the most overall wins and stoppage wins in UFC featherweight history at 14 and nine, respectively.\\n\\nThere's also the fact that Holloway twice dominated Aldo last year to win the title and in his first defense. Aldo, of course, twice defeated Edgar by unanimous decision in title fights, most recently in July 2016 at UFC 200.\\n\\nMax has shined in the underdog roll and steamrolled recent opponents as a betting favorite, Oddessa said. He was a 3-to-1 favorite against two-time Edgar conqueror Jose Aldo. If Edgar doesn't put the younger Holloway on his back and keep him there during the five rounds, it's going to be a long night for him. People who lay the 3-to-1 on the champ should get the money.\\n\\nBut then again …\\n\\nFrankie has been left for dead throughout his career, Oddessa said, and turned out to be maybe the biggest overachiever who is still active on the UFC roster.\\n\\nFor more on UFC 222, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site."}

(AP) — Don't look for any drama to engulf Clemson's offense with co-coordinators Tony Elliott and Jeff Scott running the show.\\n\\nThese smooth operators have been together since they were Tiger teammates, and they have history. In a joint effort some 15 years ago they kept one of Jeff's dad's Jet Skis from sinking at a lake outing.\\n\\nI want to say we got a rope caught up in the intake valve and it almost sunk, Elliott said, smiling.\\n\\nElliott and Scott also have kept Clemson's offense afloat since taking over two years ago from the Tigers' frenetic coordinator Chad Morris , who brought in Clemson's quick-strike, fast-pace attack until becoming SMU's head coach after the 2014 season.\\n\\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney said he had about 1,000 texts from people telling him who he should hire. Instead, Swinney picked his guys.\\n\\nAfter all, I raised them, Swinney quipped.\\n\\nThe partnership has worked extremely well these past two seasons considering Clemson is playing for the national championship for a second straight year. The third-ranked Tigers (13-1) get a rematch with defending champ No. 1 Alabama (14-0) on Monday night in Tampa, Florida.\\n\\nScott said he and Elliott work well together because neither one's worried about the spotlight or grabbing credit.\\n\\nWe don't have one guy that's up there, trying to get all the attention and be in the national news, Scott said.\\n\\nAlabama received lots of attention this week for its high-profile coordinator change on offense. Three-year Crimson Tide offensive guru Lane Kiffin left to start his new head coaching job at Florida Atlantic. Steve Sarkisian, like Kiffin a former Southern Cal head coach, will step in immediately instead of taking over coordinator duties next season.\\n\\nCrimson Tide coach Nick Saban has done his best to quash any drama, saying Sarkisian has complete knowledge of the offense.\\n\\nHe knows the system inside and out, Saban said Wednesday.\\n\\nFew know the Clemson culture like Elliott and Scott.\\n\\nThe two were walk-on receivers under Tommy Bowden starting in 2000. Elliott started four of 44 games in his career and rose to team captain in 2003. Scott spent his time largely on special teams as a holder who was occasionally called for fake kicks.\\n\\nElliott and Scott grew close as teammates because of their similar circumstances, although their paths diverted after graduation. While Elliott began an corporate track as an industrial engineer at Michelin North America, Scott took up the family business — father Brad Scott was South Carolina's head coach from 1994-98 and was an assistant for Bobby Bowden at Florida State and son Tommy at Clemson.\\n\\nThey reconnected with the Tigers when Elliott, whose last receivers coach at Clemson was Swinney, felt the coaching tug while at Michelin. Swinney counseled him to do what his heart told him and Elliott became an assistant coach at South Carolina State in 2006.\\n\\nElliott joined Clemson as running backs coach in 2011. He and Scott, at Clemson since 2008 as receivers coach at recruiting coordinator, soaked up as much as Morris gave them about playing-calling.\\n\\nSo once Morris left, Swinney quickly filled the void from within.\\n\\nThere was an unknown, Scott acknowledged. It's like whenever you get married, you love your spouse, but what's this going to look like.\\n\\nThe two have a game-week routine. They meet together and come up with plan, then share it with the rest of the staff. They meet soon after and share information from the rest of the offensive staff, then are in lock step the rest of the week.\\n\\nOn game day, Elliott is in the press box calling plays with input from all staffers. Scott is on the sidelines as a point of contact for players. So far, the Tigers are 27-2 with that system in place.\\n\\nOf course, the timing for success coincides with Clemson having once-in-generation talent like quarterback Deshaun Watson, single-season rushing leader Wayne Gallman and Artavis Scott, the Tigers' all-time leader in pass receptions.\\n\\nAll three led the Tigers to a 31-0 victory over Ohio State in the Fiesta Bowl last week.\\n\\nThey are cutting edge. They're innovative, ESPN analyst Kirk Herbstreit said. I thought the game they had against Ohio State is a classic example of what they've been able to do in attacking a team's weaknesses.\\n\\nElliott believes his comfort and friendship with Scott have kept Clemson on track for its goals.

(AP) — When the New York Giants signed Damon Harrison as a free agent in the offseason, they got more than one of the NFL's top defensive tackles.\\n\\nThe 343-pounder who is known to teammates as Snacks is somewhat of a character. He will hang around with the defensive backs as much as he does with the lineman.\\n\\nThat was the case Friday as the Giants (11-5) started wrapping up preparations for this weekend's wild-card game against the Packers (10-6) in Green Bay on Sunday.\\n\\nOn a day he was honored as an All Pro for the first time, Harrison couldn't help but tell a story about how he walked up to cornerback Janoris Jenkins and managed to take an NYPD Football hat from a box that the New York police had sent to the defensive backs.\\n\\nThe unit was nicknamed NYPD by Newsday Giants beat writer Tom Rock about a month ago — New York Pass Defense — and the NYPD football team sent over the hats on Thursday.\\n\\nHarrison liked them and took one, despite objections from Jenkins.\\n\\nWhat Harrison wants this weekend is a win in his first playoff game, and he will be playing a big part for a Giants' defense that is playing as well as any group in football at this point.\\n\\nThe goal for the unit will be to limit Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who has not thrown an interception in the six-game winning streak that carried Green Bay to the NFC North title.\\n\\nThe keys for the defense will be to keep Rodgers in the pocket, not letting him run or extend plays.\\n\\nThe other goal is to make him one-dimensional: take away his running game, and that's where Harrison comes in.\\n\\nHe has been stuffing the middle all season for the Giants, with one of the few exceptions being the game against Green Bay in October. The Packers rushed for 147 yards.\\n\\nHarrison remembers. The Giants did not tackle well.\\n\\nI have a chip on my shoulder about everything. Not just that, Harrison said. That's something to add to it, but we didn't do a good job. Like I said yesterday, I think a lot of their yards came after contact. We just didn't tackle well and they were able to get out and make some plays.\\n\\nHarrison called Rodgers one of the greatest to play the game, noting he makes a lot of good plays with his legs. That requires the defenders to focus on their technique and do the little things.\\n\\nWhen Rodgers makes a pump fake, don't leave your feet. Keep your lane on the rush and hit him when you get the chance.\\n\\nGuys are focused, Harrison said. I don't know how often you're in here, but you can see the locker room is the same now in Week 18 as it was in Week 1. No one is stressing and everyone knows the importance of this game.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, we don't play the game until Sunday. Just keep your preparation the same. Maybe change some other things, but don't change who you are.\\n\\nThe Giants have not been to the playoffs since 2011, so there are not a lot of players with postseason experience.\\n\\nThose who have it have spoken to the team: Eli Manning, Zak DeOssie, Jonathan Casillas, Victor Cruz and some of the coaches.\\n\\nThe basic message is that the intensity picks up so you have to raise your game.\\n\\nA guy like myself who is a younger-older guy, I listen. I soak everything up like a sponge, Harrison said. I'm always picking brains and trying to get an idea of what something is like.\\n\\nOf course, Harrison then joked about his playoff experience, saying he has been to the postseason every year in video games.\\n\\nI just won a Super Bowl last night on Madden with the Green Bay Packers, he quipped.\\n\\nWhen asked if the defense was thinking Super Bowl on Friday, Harrison said no way.\\n\\nWe're talking about the Green Bay Packers. That's it, he said.\\n\\nNOTES: Jason Pierre-Paul (sports hernia) was ruled out for the game while fellow DE Owa Odighizuwa (hamstring) is doubtful. ... Giants coach Ben McAdoo refused to say whether Bobby Hart or Marshall Newhouse would start at RT on Sunday. Hart has played there almost the whole season, but he missed the final game of the regular season with a forearm injury. ... Rookie RB Paul Perkins, who had his first 100-yard game last week, has never started a game in freezing temperatures. The forecast for Sunday at Lambeau Field is for 16 degrees. That's a lot warmer than the temperatures in 1967 when his uncle Don Perkins played for Dallas in the Ice Bowl against the Packers.

{"original": "There's been more than enough talk about what needs to be done to close the NFL's racial hiring gap.\\n\\nIt's time to make it happen.\\n\\nSix NFL teams were already looking for new coaches as of Monday, and there could be another opening or two still to come. Four of those teams also are in the market for a new general manager, as are the Denver Broncos and the Washington Football Team.\\n\\nHow many of those teams will hire someone of color? One? Three? Or will NFL owners, a group that is almost exclusively white, continue a hiring record that too often looks like a relic from the Antebellum era?\\n\\nA holistic approach was taken toward hiring practices that have raised expectations for promoting equity, opportunity and inclusion during this hiring cycle and beyond, Troy Vincent, the NFL's executive vice president of football operations, said on Twitter on Monday.\\n\\nExpectations are no longer good enough, however. And neither are empty gestures.\\n\\nYes, it is encouraging that Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy is in high demand. He met with the Atlanta Falcons on Monday, and Chiefs coach Andy Reid said he has two more interviews scheduled this week.\\n\\nCHIEF EXECUTIVE:Eric Bieniemy is ready to be a head coach. Which NFL team will finally take him?\\n\\nHELP WANTED:Ranking NFL's six open head coaching jobs in 2021 from worst to first\\n\\nBut we've seen this shell game before.\\n\\nBieniemy directs one of the NFL's most prolific, and entertaining, offenses, and has been integral in the development of Patrick Mahomes. If he was white, Bieniemy would already be a head coach. But he is Black, and so he is not, having been passed over for seven jobs in the past two hiring cycles.\\n\\nOne of those teams that decided Bieniemy wasn't the right fit, the New York Jets, is in the market for a new coach once again. Another four failed to make the playoffs.\\n\\nHe's ready to make the move, said Reid, who cited Bieniemy's people, organizational and tactical skills. But it's got to be a fit for an owner. Somebody has to have … that picture in their mind that Eric Bieniemy can go lead their organization and they're comfortable with that.\\n\\nAs Vincent noted, the NFL has taken steps to level the playing field. The Rooney Rule was expanded so teams are now required to interview two minority candidates for head coaching vacancies and one for coordinator openings.\\n\\nThe league has also given teams incentive to get more Black and brown candidates in the pipeline, awarding compensatory picks for minority assistants and personnel executives hired away as head coaches and general managers.\\n\\nBut the NFL is not the problem. The owners are. They are the ones doing the hiring. They are the ones who have to overlook their biases – implicit and otherwise – about the face of their franchise being Black or brown.\\n\\nAnd too few have shown the courage to do so.\\n\\nAnthony Lynn's firing by the Los Angeles Chargers left Mike Tomlin, Brian Flores and Ron Rivera as the NFL's only minority coaches. (Raheem Morris and Romeo Crennel are interim coaches.) In each of the past three hiring cycles, only one man of color has been hired as a head coach.\\n\\nThe NFL, many owners included, made a big show of championing diversity and racial equality after the horrific death of George Floyd. They promised to do better, and be more aware of the privilege that has allowed white coaches to advance while Black and brown coaches with more experience – and, frankly in some cases, more talent – remain stymied.\\n\\nBut those promises cannot be trusted, not with the NFL's sorry track record. Not when this is a recurring topic of conversation every offseason, only for nothing to actually change. Not when Urban Meyer could be as hot a commodity as Bieniemy or Robert Saleh or Pep Hamilton.\\n\\nNot when the NFL has found a multitude of words to address the problem except the two that matter:\\n\\nYou're hired.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour."}
{"original": "USA TODAY Sports\\n\\nCalifornia fired coach Sonny Dykes in a surprise move Sunday after four seasons that produced just one bowl appearance.\\n\\nThe Golden Bears were 5-7 this season, 3-6 in the Pac-12. Dykes was 19-30 in four years at Cal (10-26 in the Pac-12) and 41-45 overall with the Golden Bears and Louisiana Tech (22-15).\\n\\nThe Bears ranked fourth nationally in passing offense and 10th in total offense, but were 125th in total defense and 127th in scoring defense.\\n\\nThis was an extremely difficult decision and one that we take very seriously, athletic director Mike Williams said in a statement. There was no rush to judgment; we wanted to be thorough and thoughtful. Ultimately, it was a combination of factors that brought us to this outcome. We are continuously evaluating our program and looking for ways to make it better — whether that's through additional academic support, recruiting, facilities, staffing, culture, leadership or anything else that can help our football program succeed. Primarily, we want what's best for our student-athletes and have a head coach in place who is fully committed to our program and our university.\\n\\n\\n\\nCoach Dykes clearly built up our program — both on the field and in the classroom — and he leaves Cal in a stronger position than when he arrived. For that alone, he deserves credit and our thanks. After our bowl win last season, we showed our commitment to him with a contract extension. But after looking at a number of factors after the end of this season, I felt that we needed a change of direction for the good of our student-athletes and our program.\\n\\nDykes said he was surprised and disappointed by the move and called Cal a special place.\\n\\nI am comforted, however, that I leave this program in much better shape than when I arrived four years ago, he said in a statement. I am confident Cal will find a great coach to lead these great young men, they deserve nothing less. As for me, change is unfortunately a constant in this profession. I have great passion for what I do and how I do it. I look forward to the next chapter.\\n\\nOffensive coordinator Jake Spavital will serve as interim coach.\\n\\nDykes interviewed for multiple head coaching jobs after the 2015 season, despite having the contract with Cal. He was given a four-year contract extension in March and had just started the second year of that deal on Jan. 1. According to the terms of his contract, he is owed $5.88 million.\\n\\nA search for a new head coach will begin immediately with the idea that a new coach could be in place by the end of the week as recruiting heats up. College football signing day is Feb. 1.\\n\\nSpeculation will now turns to Dykes' successor, with former Oregon and San Francisco 49ers coach Chip Kelly's name likely to be linked to the job. After a dominant run at Oregon, Kelly had less success in the NFL and was fired earlier this month by the 49ers, a year after being dismissed by the Philadelphia Eagles."}
{"original": "Matt Krantz\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nQ: Are market-linked CDs a good idea?\\n\\nA: Savers looking for decent interest rates on their money need to search far and wide. That search is unearthing somewhat unusual investments like the market-linked certificate of deposit (CD).\\n\\nThe market-linked CD blends the potential upside of stock market returns with the stability of a certificate of deposit. These are somewhat unusual savings vehicles created by banks, hamstrung with offering low savings rates, to lure savers looking for more upside. As with a standard CD, consumers deposit their money in a market-linked CD with the understanding the cash cannot be accessed for some time without paying an early withdrawal fee. Both market-linked CDs and traditional CDs promise the saver will at least get their original principal back. Both market-linked and traditional CDs are guaranteed by the FDIC.\\n\\nBut that's where the similarities end. Most market-linked CDs have much longer terms than some traditional CDs, usually spanning many years. Returns on market-linked CDs rise or fall based on the performance of a benchmark, such as a broad market index like the Standard & Poor's 500. Some market-linked CDs offer a minimum return, others don't. Traditional CDs, on the other hand, promise a set interest rate. Market-linked CDs can be an option for investors who are risk-adverse, don't need current liquidity and want higher returns offered by CDs.\\n\\nUSA TODAY markets reporter Matt Krantz answers a different reader question twice a week.

{"original": "Gregory Korte\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nWASHINGTON — President Obama will announce a series of executive actions to curb gun violence Tuesday, focusing on businesses that buy and sell guns at gun shows, flea markets and online without a license — thus allowing buyers to evade the criminal background check required at brick-and-mortar gun stores.\\n\\nThe initiative stops far short of completely closing what's been called the gun show loophole. Instead, the Justice Department will clarify an existing law that gun sellers who market firearms through gun shows and online can be engaged in the business of dealing in guns and require a federal license. That's important because under the law, gun sales by hobbyists and collectors do not require background checks, but licensed gun dealers do.\\n\\nAttorney General Loretta Lynch said gun sellers would no longer be able to hide behind the exception to claim they're not a dealer simply because they sell at gun shows.\\n\\nLet me be clear: It's not where you are located but what you are doing that determines whether you are engaged in the business of dealing in firearms, Lynch told reporters Monday. But she emphasized that the new initiative does not change any laws or regulations, and that the exception for legitimate hobbyists and collectors remains in the law.\\n\\nThe new guidance, which will be issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives this week, also stops short of setting any numerical threshold of gun sales that would require a federal license.\\n\\nWhile the numbers are relevant, White House Senior Adviser Valerie Jarrett said the ATF will consider all the facts and circumstances of the gun seller: Whether he or she has business cards, accepts credit card payments, makes a profit or sells guns in their original packaging or shortly after acquiring them.\\n\\nLynch noted that courts have held that as few as two sales could trigger the requirement.\\n\\nThe Obama administration will also hire more examiners to conduct gun background checks, clarify rules on lost and stolen guns, upgrade its criminal history and ballistics databases, and urge states to report more domestic violence convictions to the federal government. The Social Security Administration is also exploring a process that would submit information about beneficiaries with mental health disabilities to the background check system.\\n\\nAnd in a presidential memorandum Monday, Obama directed the departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security to study smart gun technology to prevent accidental gunshots and allow better tracking of lost and stolen guns — with the idea of using the federal government's purchasing power to encourage gun makers to market safer firearms.\\n\\nThrough executive orders, Obama tests power as purchaser-in-chief\\n\\nEven before formally announcing the new actions, Obama promised Monday that the steps would be both within his legal authority and supported by the overwhelming majority of the American people, including gun owners.\\n\\nBut he also acknowledged the limitations on his strategy of acting without congressional legislation. It is my strong belief that for us to get our complete arm around the problem, Congress needs to act, he told reporters in the Oval Office after meeting with top law enforcement officials.\\n\\nWe'll be making sure that people have a very clear understanding of what can make a difference and what we can do, he said. We have to be very clear that this is not going to solve every violent crime in this country. It's not going to prevent every mass shooting. It's not going to keep every gun out of the hands of a criminal.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan said Monday that anything Obama proposes would be a dangerous level of executive overreach and predicted a public backlash. But the National Rifle Association offered a restrained assessment of the White House actions.\\n\\nThere is nothing in this set of proposals that would improve public safety, NRA spokeswoman Jennifer Baker said Monday. President Obama is distracting the American people from his inability to keep us safe. This underscores the lack of seriousness the president has placed on this issue.\\n\\nRyan sees 'overreach' in Obama gun action\\n\\nObama will announce the new measures at the White House on Tuesday morning, with families of gun violence victims invited to the event.\\n\\nGun control advocates called the move historic.\\n\\nPresident Obama has taken the bold and meaningful action that Brady and its millions of supporters have been calling for, said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence.\\n\\nWhite House Press Secretary Josh Earnest pointed to recent polls showing 89% of Americans — and 84% of gun owners — support universal background checks.\\n\\nThis is not a partisan endeavor. And this is not just something that is being advanced by people who are strong advocates of gun control. Gun owners and Republicans overwhelmingly support at least this common-sense step, closing the gun show loophole, he said.\\n\\nObama described the problem of gun violence as including both the headline-grabbing mass shootings and the everyday homicides, suicides and accidents that claim tens of thousands of lives a year.\\n\\nObama met Monday with Lynch, Jarrett, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates, FBI Director James Comey, Acting Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Director Thomas Brandon and White House Counsel Neil Eggleston.\\n\\nHe also met Monday with Democrats in Congress who have been pushing gun legislation.\\n\\nContributing: Kevin Johnson"}
{"original": "Jon Jones has big plans to stay active as light heavyweight champion in 2019, and he's already booked his first title defense against Anthony Smith at UFC 235 in March. So why do fans keep dreaming about him moving to heavyweight? Retired UFC and WEC fighter Danny Downes joins MMAjunkie columnist Ben Fowlkes to discuss in this week's Trading Shots.\\n\\n* * * *\\n\\nDownes: UFC light heavyweight champion Jon Jones isn't wasting any time, Ben. No, not just in trolling Daniel Cormier (although he did do that), but in booking his next fight.\\n\\nLate Saturday night, Dana White confirmed with TMZ that Jones will come back March 2 to headline UFC 235. His opponent will be (checks notes) Anthony Smith.\\n\\nI'll admit that I was a bit underwhelmed by the news. Based on a quick look at reactions around the internet, a lot of other people felt similarly. How did you feel when you heard the news?\\n\\nBased on Jones' comments the last couple weeks, he seems content to remain at light heavyweight and own the division. In the era of the champ-champ, is it a refreshing idea or too simplistic? Do we want daddy to stay home, or would we prefer it if papa were a rolling stone?\\n\\nFowlkes: If you think I'm going to complain about Jones turning right around after his win at UFC 232 and booking a title defense three months later, you're dead wrong.\\n\\nThis is what we wanted, isn't it? For Jones to get serious and stay busy? He might very well be the best fighter in the history of this sport, and he's fought just three times since 2016. That's a travesty, is what that is. Even if it is pretty much entirely self-inflicted.\\n\\nHonestly, when I saw Jones' Instagram post about putting his nose to the grindstone and really getting after it in 2019, I was cautiously optimistic. This is what I've wanted to see from him. Stop frittering away your own talent like it's some inexhaustible resource. If the fight game has taught us anything, it's that time eventually catches up with everyone, so you better make yours count.\\n\\nNow he seems to be intent on doing just that, and people are … disappointed?\\n\\nWe can't have it both ways, Danny. We can't complain about every champ skipping out on his own weight class to chase the increasingly hollow double champ dream, but then also complain about a champ who stays put to clean out his division.\\n\\nI really don't see the problem. Is it Smith? People just can't imagine him as real competition for Jones?\\n\\nBecause he's unbeaten at light heavyweight and just finished a guy who's been hanging around the top of the division for a little while. As he put it himself, at some point people just might have to entertain the possibility that he's actually a good fighter. I'm already there. Are you still refusing to get on board?\\n\\nDownes: Like you, I'm excited to see Jones compete. It would be nice to see him compete more than once a year, something he hasn't done since 2013.\\n\\nAt the same time, you're kidding yourself if you think Jones vs. Smith is the fight to make. Yes, part of this feeling is a knock against Smith, but it's about much more. Jones has beaten Cormier twice (although one was technically a no-contest), but it's still the fight everyone wants to see. Heavyweight would be ideal, but even at 205 it would be must-see TV.\\n\\nNormally, MMA fans just want something new (hence the distaste for immediate rematches), but Jones vs. Cormier is one of those situations where what we've seen before is what we want. Booking Jones against Smith is like when Cris Cyborg fought Yana Kunitskaya at UFC 222. It's filler until the fight everyone wants gets booked.\\n\\nIt's also disingenuous for you to compare Jones' potential move to heavyweight to the other hollow champ-champs (and potential cc's) we have out there.\\n\\nCormier was never viewed as the true light heavyweight champion, and he never defended that belt in the first place. Conor McGregor hasn't fought at featherweight since beating Jose Aldo, and he was stripped of the lightweight title before failing to regain it from Khabib Nurmagomedov.\\n\\nHenry Cejudo could be another two-division champion, but his division is about to be eliminated. Amanda Nunes could be the first legit one, and everyone wants her to be able to compete in both divisions and not be forced to give one title up.\\n\\nJust because you're excited to have any Jones fight, it doesn't mean Jones vs. Smith is the best or even ideal fight. I think you know as well as I do that Cormier isn't going to ride off into the sunset before he faces Jones again. Dana White and the UFC just have to open up the checkbook. I look forward to the Trading Shots column on March 3 when I can ask you how excited you were to watch Jones fight Smith. What do you think you'll say?\\n\\nFowlkes: If Jones smashes Smith, which you seem to take for granted, I think I'll say, once again, that he's the best there is. I don't think I'll say that I regret ever sitting down to watch it.\\n\\nLike you, I also want to see Jones and Cormier dance a third time, preferably at heavyweight. But the realist in me understands that it's probably not going to happen any time in the next three months, so I'm not going to complain about seeing Jones defend his title against a credible challenger who at least offers something new.\\n\\nI know light heavyweight is thin. I also know Jones has already beaten all but a few people who really matter in the division. I think a move up is in his future eventually, and I think he knows it too. But in the meantime, it's actually kind of refreshing to see someone win a UFC belt and then get really excited about sticking around to defend it against all comers.\\n\\nMaybe I'll change my mind if it's late 2019, and the UFC is asking me to pay 65 bucks to see Jones vs. Corey Anderson. Maybe by then I'll be in the mood for more of that champ-champ action. For now, though? A boring old Jon Jones title defense feels rare enough to be exciting.\\n\\nBen Fowlkes is MMAjunkie and USA TODAY's MMA columnist.

Here's how to make them safer.\\n\\nNew Jersey's written policy has acknowledged for decades that most chases start with traffic violations.

But you take into consideration, an officer that follows the guidelines, and the officers that do the job, it's the behavior of the person that they're pursuing that's creating that type of environment.\\n\\nThe president of the state's largest police union declined to comment on pursuits when presented with the Network's key findings.\\n\\nWhen he was Milwaukee police chief, Edward Flynn saw a spike in police car chase deaths. To curb the deaths, in 2010 he limited the reasons his officers could go on chases.\\n\\nAll the data indicates that it's never worth it, almost never, Flynn, said about police pursuits. He's a former Jersey City officer with law enforcement experience in several states.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the issue of when police pursuits are appropriate, and for how long and at what level of risk, our moral obligation is to limit that potential for a bad outcome, Flynn said.

They're not achieving the goal of a police department, whose job is to protect and serve the individuals in their jurisdiction. And it's providing a very specific group of individuals a reason to fear the police.\\n\\nI miss him. Friend recalls Umar King, who was killed by a fleeing driver King gave up his time to teach sign language to his community. Kevin R. Wexler and Andrew Ford, Asbury Park Press\\n\\nLooking just at the cars police are choosing to chase, New Jersey still leads the nation for racial disparity in police pursuits.\\n\\nIn the last 20 years, New Jersey police pursuits took the lives of 38 people who were riding in the car police were chasing, the data shows. Twenty-three of them were black. Six were white.\\n\\nThat's a larger disparity than any other state.\\n\\nSet aside passengers who were killed and the gap remains.\\n\\nTwelve of the fleeing drivers were black, five were white.\\n\\nThat's a larger disparity than any other state.\\n\\nIt suggests there's a kind of devaluing of the lives of people of color in those communities, without — I don't think — broad public conversation from the police department saying: listen folks, this is for your own safety, Alex Shalom, senior supervising attorney for the ACLU in New Jersey, said of the Network's findings.\\n\\nI don't think there would be buy-in in those communities for policies of the widespread use of police chases if people knew that which you reveal in these data, he added. Which is that most folks are not going to be arrested. When they are arresting people, it's seldom for violent crimes. That suggests that police should be thinking through wholesale changes to the way they conduct chases and frankly whether they're conducting them at all in many instances.\\n\\nNew Jersey's top rank for racial disparity in police chase deaths doesn't appear to be explained by the time of day of chases, crime rates, population demographics or density.\\n\\nNewark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people. Murder victims and suspects were black more than 90 percent of the time.\\n\\nIn 49 states, including New Jersey, most pursuit deaths happened before 6 a.m. or after 6 p.m. — overnight hours when it might be hard to judge the race of a fleeing driver. New Jersey's share of overnight pursuit deaths is lower than most states.\\n\\nNew Jersey's police pursuit deaths cluster in cities like Newark, which has a large black population and a higher crime rate than the state. But compared to other cities since 2009, Newark leads the nation, with a pursuit death racial disparity bigger than Atlanta, Birmingham, Cleveland or Detroit, cities with higher violent crime rates and a larger percentage of black residents.\\n\\nFive ways to address deadly police chases Read more\\n\\nNewark is densely populated, but there's little mathematic correlation between density and racial disparity in police chase deaths, a sample of 100 cities shows.\\n\\nSetting aside cities where all the people killed were black, there appears to be some correlation between cities with large black populations and disparity in the police pursuit deaths, the 100-city sample shows.\\n\\nBut Newark isn't the city with the greatest proportion of black residents.\\n\\nSo why does Newark lead the nation for racial disparity in police pursuits?\\n\\nFormer Milwaukee chief Edward Flynn and Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose urged a reporter to consider the demographics of the victims of crime.\\n\\nNewark provided figures that show in 2019, the victims and suspects of murders, aggravated assaults and robberies were usually black people, who make up just under half the city's population.\\n\\nThe standard forms New Jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death.\\n\\nMurder victims were 92 percent black people and 97 percent of murder suspects were black. At least 60 percent of aggravated assault victims and suspects were black. Robbery victims were more evenly split — 40 percent black to 37 percent white. Robbery suspects were black 70 percent of the time.\\n\\nNewark isn't the only city where crime disproportionately involves black people.\\n\\nData provided by Atlanta Police Department — a city with a proportion of black residents two percentage points greater than Newark— shows a rate similar to Newark for black murder victims (87 percent) and suspects (94 percent) and a higher percentage of black people involved in aggravated assaults in 2019. Atlanta aggravated assault victims were 87 percent black, and 94 percent of the people arrested for assault were black.\\n\\nAtlanta's violent crime numbers are similar to Detroit, a city with a black population 28 percentage points greater than Newark. More than 90 percent of the victims and perpetrators of aggravated assault and murder were black in 2019, data provided by Detroit shows.\\n\\nYet those cities with comparable 2019 crime demographics and more black residents have a lower rate for killing black people in police car chases since 2009: Atlanta at 86 percent and Detroit at 78 percent compared to Newark's 100 percent.\\n\\nAt least four of Newark's deaths took place in the city's South Ward, one as recently as 2018. South Ward Councilman John Sharpe James said he wasn't aware of the city's pursuit death racial disparity and called the police chase deaths random and rare.\\n\\nAs a police officer, you can't control every scenario, every situation, he said.\\n\\nThe standard forms New Jersey police use to track pursuits don't record the race of a suspect, making it difficult to know if there's a racial disparity in the pursuits that don't end with a death.\\n\\nMembers of the Newark Police Division do not arrest for race, Ambrose said in an emailed statement. We make arrests to equally protect the citizens of Newark, without consideration of the race of the perpetrator.\\n\\nData compiled by the Network shows that on top of a huge racial disparity in pursuit deaths, Newark's chases in the last decade are among the least effective in the state: just under half the pursuits ended with arrests, about 40 percent caused crashes and about 18 percent caused injuries.\\n\\nA 10-year look at police pursuits does not paint an accurate picture of our policies over the last few years, when we changed strategies to protect the public, Ambrose said in the statement.\\n\\nNewark's policy on pursuits was last updated in 2017, adding restrictions on the reasons officers can chase cars — no chasing stolen cars and no chasing people just because they fled from police.\\n\\nNewark cops initiated many fewer pursuits in 2017 and 2018 compared to years before. There were fewer crashes and injuries, but still at least three deaths.\\n\\nThe pursuits also became less effective, ending with more crashed cars than arrested suspects.\\n\\nLet's also be mindful that every pursuit begins with actions of the suspect to evade police, putting the public at immediate risk, whether we pursue or not, Ambrose said in the statement.\\n\\nKilled before his daughter's eyes\\n\\nFamily photo featuring James Walsh, who was killed by a suspect fleeing police.

She said she suffered post-traumatic stress disorder, a condition sometimes associated with returning soldiers. She said she began to drink.

Andrew Ford, USA Today Network\\n\\nThe driver of the Honda, Frank Bradley Jr., then a 29-year-old man from Newark, was chased after he ran a red light, then sped away when police tried to pull him over, according to a federal judge's ruling that struck down a lawsuit alleging wrongdoing by cops in the pursuit.\\n\\nBradley was charged with driving on a suspended license and endangering children he had in his car during the chase, in addition to crimes for the crash that killed Erin's father, Essex County Prosecutor's Office announced at the time. He pleaded guilty to aggravated manslaughter and vehicular homicide. He's scheduled to be released from prison in February.\\n\\nErin called Bradley a coward at his sentencing nine years ago.\\n\\nNow she forgives him.\\n\\nHe was my age when he killed my dad, I can't even begin to think of what was going through his head besides fear and panic, she said in an online message. It is what it is, and I hope he finds the support and peace he needs once he gets out.\\n\\nErin said she doesn't blame the cops for what happened to her father. But she does think New Jersey can do more to limit pursuits and keep bystanders safe.\\n\\nI definitely don't think minor traffic violations need to be ending in a high-speed police pursuit, she said.\\n\\nNew Jersey policy has gaps\\n\\nNew Jersey is among a handful of states with rules for police pursuits and New Jersey's guidelines are the most detailed, according to a 50-state review by undergraduate researchers from The College of New Jersey working in cooperation with the Network. Authorities in two states didn't confirm the student's findings but don't appear to have a statewide policy on pursuits.\\n\\nThe New Jersey guidelines obligate a cop to consider 10 factors while racing after a fleeing suspect — like chances of success, whether the suspect is known and can be captured later, how much risk is involved, and the officer's driving skills.\\n\\nOnce the chase is on, cops are supposed to radio in details like the reason for the chase, the direction, speed and information about the fleeing vehicle.\\n\\nSupervisors play a huge role in pursuits, said Joseph Blaettler, former Union City deputy chief. And that's part of the reason why cops, as soon as they get into a pursuit, they have to call it out. The supervisor has to monitor the pursuit.\\n\\nBut that doesn't always happen. Jackson Patrolman Cherrick Daniels, involved in the pursuit that ended with the death of motorcyclist Anthony Griffin and pizza delivery driver Eric Larson, didn't call in the pursuit until after the crash, his police report shows. That means a supervisor didn't have a chance to weigh whether the chase was a good idea.\\n\\nWhen a police car crashes in a pursuit, New Jersey's policy calls for departments to review whether the collision could have been prevented and make a copy of that report available to their county prosecutor's office.\\n\\nNone of the 21 prosecutor's offices produced these records in response to a Network request, saying they couldn't be easily located and in one case denying access to a report as a confidential internal affairs record. Police cars were involved in more than 1,300 crashes since 2009, records from each town show.\\n\\nPolice internal investigations are closely guarded secrets in New Jersey, making it difficult to know whether a department took action against a cop involved in a chase.\\n\\nThis year, the state attorney general was tasked with investigating police-involved deaths and his office announced an investigation related to a police pursuit in August. A spokesman for the office said in December the investigation is ongoing.\\n\\nRaw video: Fatal crash after Bernards township police chase car for suspended registration A 19-year-old passenger was killed in Bernards Township in Somerset County in 2015 after he was thrown from a car in a crash.

Andrew Ford, @AndrewFordNews\\n\\nFamilies aren't finding help in court\\n\\nLawsuits claiming police misconduct have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars in recent years, the Network found. But these claims appear to yield little for people hurt in police car chases or their loved ones.\\n\\nData from the largest municipal insurer in the state, which covers at least 240 towns, show they closed 30 cases related to police chases in the last five years, 15 of which cost nothing, the remainder cost a total of $116,088, including the town's attorney fees.\\n\\nTo win a lawsuit filed against the cops, the law requires an aggrieved relative to show that police engaged in willful misconduct, which means an officer knowingly violated a superior's command or a specific standing order.\\n\\nIt's easy to show wrongdoing in court when an officer used excessive force against a citizen.\\n\\nBut it's hard to convince a judge or jury of a police officer's liability when a bystander was injured by a bad guy racing away from police, according to Gregg L. Zeff, a Mount Laurel attorney who has sued cops and defended them.\\n\\nIt's so hard to prove a claim of wrongdoing when the eluding driver is the injured person that Zeff said he's reviewed such cases, but he hasn't taken one.\\n\\nEven if I thought that what was done was wrong, it's just too hard to persuade people in a case like that, he said.\\n\\n'It can happen to anybody'\\n\\nTaylor Bromberg, 26, visited the grave of her fiancé Eric Larson with her daughters, Adriana Nicole, 5, and Mikayla Grace, 2.

Kempny's winner came with 3:52 remaining. It was his fifth goal of the season, and Boyd scored his fourth.\\n\\nThrough the first two, it was a slow and sloppy game, Boyd said. We came together here in between the second and the third and just said if we put together 20 good minutes here, we could walk away with the win.

Anthony Mantha and Filip Hronek scored for the Red Wings.\\n\\nThe Capitals trailed 2-1 heading into the final period, but Boyd tied it off a pass from Alex Ovechkin. Goalie Jimmy Howard nearly made the save sliding from right to left, but the puck made it through.\\n\\nKempny's winner came on a wrist shot from the blue line that sailed through traffic and past Howard. The shot appeared to take a deflection off Detroit's Tyler Bertuzzi, who was trying to pressure Kempny.\\n\\nWe felt like our forwards were really fighting hard to get to the front of the net, and we didn't deliver enough pucks there.

{"original": "Maureen Groppe and Bill Theobald\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nWASHINGTON – Having taken control of the House on Thursday, Democrats will move to immediately set a different direction through new rules.\\n\\nThe package of changes ranges from those encouraging diversity – such as allowing religious head scarves to be worn on the House floor – to tougher ethics rules and tweaked legislative procedures that will make it easier to raise taxes.\\n\\nRep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was elected speaker, helped secure the votes she needed by agreeing to changes sought by moderates aimed at easing the passage of bills with broad bipartisan support. That provision even earned the package the support of one Republican, Rep. Tom Reed of New York, who said Wednesday he will take the rare step of crossing party lines to vote for it.\\n\\nThe changes face opposition from some liberal members who argued new budget rules would make it harder to expand social programs.\\n\\nBecause most Republicans – who set their own rules when they were in charge – are likely to oppose the changes, Democrats probably can't lose more than 18 votes to enact the package.\\n\\nHere's a look at some of the proposed changes:\\n\\nMaking it easier to raise taxes but still hard to increase spending\\n\\nDemocrats want to end a GOP rule that required supermajority support from three-fifths of House members to raise taxes. They want to reinstate a pay as you go – or PAYGO – rule requiring tax cuts or new spending programs be offset with new taxes or spending cuts. (Republicans required that only new spending to be offset.) A few Democrats said they will vote against the entire package, arguing PAYGO would keep Democrats from expanding health care coverage and making other critical investments in education and infrastructure.\\n\\nPAYGO isn't only bad economics ... it's also a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg, tweeted Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\\n\\nMarc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said that if Democrats want to pay for such programs by raising taxes on the rich or on corporations, as some have suggested, PAYGO would help them do that.\\n\\nGoldwein called the budget rule changes sensible but said they will matter only if lawmakers follow them. They can waive them at any point, he said.\\n\\nCombating climate change\\n\\nCombating climate change was a campaign issue for Democrats in 2018, and Pelosi responded by relaunching a special House panel to shine a light on the issue.\\n\\nThe 15-member bipartisan panel, to be headed by Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla., will have at least six Republicans and have until March 31, 2020, to issue policy recommendations.\\n\\nThe panel has limitations. It won't have the power to subpoena documents or depose witnesses. It could get caught up in a turf war with some of the standing congressional committees that oversee the environment. And it will have to submit its recommendations to those congressional committees, which will decide whether to act on them.\\n\\nToughening ethics\\n\\nThe Democratic House proposal would toughen some rules governing the conduct of members – and may lead to further tightening down the line.\\n\\nMajor provisions include a requirement that House members reimburse taxpayers for any settlements that are the result of discrimination by that member based on race, religion, sex, national origin or disability, among others. The change is in reaction to revelations in recent years that taxpayers paid out hundreds of thousands of dollars to settle such claims.\\n\\nAll House members would be required to go through annual ethics training, under another provision. Previously, only new members were required to take the training.\\n\\nLawmakers would be banned from serving as an officer or director at a public company. Craig Holman, with the good government group Public Citizen, said this provision is the result of the indictment of Rep. Chris Collins, R-N.Y., for alleged insider trading involving a pharmaceutical company on whose board he sat. No other members serve on the boards of public companies, Holman said, but about 190 House members hold other positions involving public or private firms.\\n\\nThe same provision calls for the House ethics committee to develop regulations by the end of 2019 to address other involvement by members in companies that could pose a conflict of interest. Holman said he would like to see a ban on members trading stock in companies that do business that falls under the oversight of their committees.\\n\\nDefending Obamacare\\n\\nThe changes allow Democrats to get involved in the pending challenge to the Affordable Care Act after a federal judge in Texas ruled the landmark health care law unconstitutional. The Trump administration is not defending parts of the law, including its popular protections for people with pre-existing conditions. A group of Democratic states and congressional Democrats plans to appeal the ruling, which will head to the 5th Circuit.\\n\\nFighting food stamp changes\\n\\nAfter House Republicans failed last year to enact an expansion of work requirements for food stamp recipients, the Trump administration announced in December plans to tighten rules on its own. Democrats' rule package directs the House to explore ways to respond to the administration's proposed changes.\\n\\nPromoting, protecting diversity\\n\\nThe rules ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. An Office of Diversity and Inclusion would be created to increase diversity in the congressional workforce. The Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a nonprofit group that attempts to improve the socioeconomic status and civic engagement of African-Americans, issued a series of reports highlighting the lack of diversity among congressional staffs.\\n\\nOne issued last fall that looked at the staff makeup of the congressional delegations in six states found, for example, that none of the senators had a top black staffer. In December, the group launched an online tool to track newly hired top staff of new and returning members.\\n\\nWhat's in a name?\\n\\nDemocrats want to honor our commitment to workers by putting labor back in the Committee on Education and Labor. The Republicans called the panel the Committee on Education and the Workforce.\\n\\nThe word government would be dropped from the name of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The change is intended to emphasize that the investigative panel's jurisdiction covers both government and the private sector. Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., who will chair the committee, said he plans to examine the opioid crisis and the cost of prescription drugs and to investigate the Trump administration.\\n\\nContributing: Ledyard King"}

This season, that still leaves us with Sleepy Hollow — the only one that worked, at least for awhile — and the upcoming Lucifer, a decent effort that may suffer from guilt-by-association with head-scratcher Second Chance (Wednesday, 9 p.m. ET/PT, * 1/2 out of four, 9 ET/PT).\\n\\nThe hero in this Frankenstein update is Jimmy Pritchard, a corrupt old hard-living L.A.

He does not, however, come back to life as a 75-year-old man. Instead, he's the best version of his genetic self (Rob Kazinsky), a man who no longer resembles either his younger or older self but now has super-human strength and recuperative powers.\\n\\nFrankenstein a favorite topic on TV, but not always a monster hit\\n\\nIf you're wondering why Mary and Otto resurrected Jimmy, it's to use his blood to cure her terminal disease. As for the how they did it, that boils down to an all-too-common TV answer: They have unlimited resources and super-computers, which they use for everything from finding Jimmy to hacking public records and, as absurd as it sounds, police-issued tasers. And yes, the computer interacts with them through a cute little stick figure, because of course it does.\\n\\nHaving brought Jimmy back to life, you'd think they'd do everything in their considerable power to keep him away from the one person most likely to figure out who he is: Jimmy's by-the-books FBI agent son Duvall (White Collar's Tim DeKay).

There are simply too many times you're unable to believe his reactions to the situation, or other people's reactions to him.\\n\\nIt all leaves you rooting for Mary and Otto, a positive testament to the actors' charms and a negative testament to the writers' tendency to gloss over the consequences of what they've done.

{"original": "Aaron David Miller\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nIran now presents Donald Trump with the first real-time crisis of his presidency, illustrated in stark terms Tuesday when Iran launched ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases hosting U.S. and Iraqi troops. And not surprisingly, he is handling it in a way that embodies all the worst elements of his management of national security issues. Unfortunately, Trump also seems to have abandoned one of the more positive aspects of his approach to foreign policy: a reluctance to get into new and unwinnable conflicts in the Middle East.\\n\\nA major war with Iran is by no means inevitable. But the killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani is a roll of the dice that just might take us there.\\n\\nThe external signs of crisis mismanagement are already apparent. The president's threats against Iran have inflamed an Iranian public already at fever pitch against the United States. His promise — twice — to attack Iran's cultural sites should it respond violently against the United States was not only a provocation, it was also a potential war crime. Trump belatedly recognized that, but no statement did as much to undermine the American narrative that it's at war with the Iranian regime, not the Iranian people.\\n\\nTrump has fared no better with the Iraqi government by threatening sanctions if it moves to force U.S. troops out of Iraq. U.S.-Iraqi relations are at an all-time low, with additional confusion over the leak of a Defense Department letter that appears to set the stage for repositioning American forces in anticipation of withdrawal. That's even though many Iraqis, primarily among Sunnis and Kurdish constituencies, want them to stay.\\n\\nTrump has also alienated America's most important ally on Iraq — Britain. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is unhappy that the United States did not coordinate with him before targeting Soleimani.\\n\\nSoleimani killing weakens US influence\\n\\nBut behind these headlines, the dysfunction in U.S. policy reflects trend lines that have been clear since Trump took office. First, the killing of Soleimani is emblematic of Trump's tendency to come up with solutions to problems America didn't necessarily have. He did this by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord; recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria; and exiting a flawed but still highly functional Iran nuclear accord — arguably the reason we are now in this crisis with Iran.\\n\\nTaking Soleimani off the battlefield may have been morally justified and a tactical success. But it has created any number of second-order consequences that have weakened rather than strengthened U.S. influence in region. Americans are less secure, not more; Iran's regional influence, especially in Iraq, has been boosted, not weakened; and U.S. influence is at its lowest ebb in a decade and a half.\\n\\nNor is there real certainty that we can control events in the wake of an Iranian retaliation. Killing Soleimani may have been a tactical success, but so far it appears to be a strategic failure.\\n\\nKilling Soleimani also highlights yet another Trump tendency — taking actions that are untethered from any broader strategic goal. One example is recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, with no apparent correlation to promoting serious negotiations or selling the administration's own Middle East peace plan.\\n\\nAnd this sort of haphazard approach driven by Trump's moods, ego or domestic politics doubly pertains to the way his Iran policy has played out. His maximum pressure campaign of sanctions against Iran has been effective in squeezing Iran's economy. But it has never been clear what the goal is: To fracture the regime, weaken it and lay the basis for regime change? Or to pressure Iran into returning to the negotiating table to reach a new deal more favorable to Washington?\\n\\nWhen you don't know where you're going, the old saw opines, then any road will get you there. And right now it looks as if the administration really has no idea where it's going or what it wants to achieve with Iran.\\n\\nDecisions tied to moods and cable TV\\n\\nThen there's the matter of Trump's decision-making — a style that seems free of any methodical or consistent process of weighing options in a deliberative manner and thinking through the implications and consequences before actions are undertaken. Instead, the decisions seem tied to Trump's likes, dislikes, moods, personal views and what he watches on cable news.\\n\\nThe decision to target Soleimani was reportedly taken after Trump had decided on a more moderate response. But after watching the images of the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad under attack, Trump changed his mind and stunned his advisers with the decision to kill Soleimani.\\n\\nEditorial Board:Iran crisis demands Donald Trump spell out endgame after killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani\\n\\nOther reports suggest that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been pushing to hit Soleimani for months and took advantage of Trump's moment of risk-readiness to argue for the more extreme option.\\n\\nThere's no way of knowing what motivated the president. The administration has still not released the intelligence that purported to show the imminent nature of the attacks Soleimani was planning.\\n\\nEither way, we are seeing an administration taking a dramatic course of action that was not well thought through either on the front end (why Soleimani was killed) or on the back end (how would this impact U.S. interests in a volatile region). And a president driven by any number of motives that are still opaque — from anger over pictures on cable news, to frustration with impeachment, to a desire to appear tough and bold in the wake of Iran's rocket attacks that killed an American contractor and wounded U.S. servicemen.\\n\\nUS interests devastated:Attack on US Embassy in Iraq shows Trump is failing. He walked into Iran's trap.\\n\\nFinally, above all it suggests drift in U.S. policy and an administration that doesn't know its own mind or the region. Like some modern day Gulliver, Trump is wandering around in the Middle East tied up by small and larger powers whose interests are not his own, and by his own illusions sliding toward a confrontation with Iran. His is an administration inhabited by regime changers, sanctions imposers, chicken hawks and real ones who are looking for a fight with Iran.\\n\\nWhat the president lacks, however, is what he could most use — a realistic and sustainable approach to avoid a war with Iran that America neither wants nor needs.\\n\\nAaron David Miller, a senior fellow for American Diplomacy and U.S. Foreign Policy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department adviser and Middle East negotiator, is the author of The End of Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great President.

U.S. exports of goods and services were up 2.3% to an all-time high of $200.2 billion. Imports rose an even faster 2.5% to a record $250.7 billion.\\n\\nA rising trade deficit, which reduces economic growth, means that the United States is buying more goods and services from other countries than it is selling them. President Donald Trump views America's massive trade deficits as a sign of economic weakness. He blames them on bad trade deals and abusive practices by China and other trade partners.\\n\\nThe politically sensitive deficit with China rose to $35.4 billion in November, the biggest goods deficit that the United States runs with any country and the largest monthly deficit with China since September 2015.\\n\\nThe overall deficit in November in goods and services was the largest since January 2012. Through the first 11 months of 2017, the monthly deficits total $513.6 billion, 11.6% above the deficit total for the same period in 2016.

He has also vowed tougher enforcement of U.S. trade laws by imposing penalty tariffs on foreign goods from countries that are using unfair practices to compete against American workers and companies.\\n\\nTrump has pledged to renegotiate what he sees as bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and go after countries he believes have rigged the global trade system to their advantage. But many private economists argue that trade deficits are largely caused not by flawed trade agreements or cheating by particular countries but by a bigger economic force — Americans spend more than they produce, and imports have to fill in the gap.\\n\\nFor November, the United States saw petroleum imports rise 10.1% to $17 billion, as the average price of a barrel of imported crude oil rose to $50.10, up from $47.26 in October.\\n\\nU.S. exports of commercial aircraft, telecommunications equipment and American-made autos and auto parts were all up in November.

New quarterbacks: Both teams are making late-season adjustments at quarterback. Houston is turning back to Osweiler, who was previously benched for Savage in Week 15. But Savage suffered a concussion in the regular-season finale and now will only serve as a backup if he clears the league's protocol. For the Raiders, the quarterback switch is the second in as many weeks. Rookie quarterback Connor Cook will become the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to make his first start in the playoffs. Matt McGloin suffered a left shoulder injury in the regular-season finale while filling in for MVP candidate Derek Carr, who suffered a broken fibula in Week 16. Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said McGloin could be healthy enough to be back up Cook on Saturday.\\n\\n2. Mack vs. Clowney: In 2014, the Texans made Jadaveon Clowney the No. 1 overall pick. But maybe they should have taken Khalil Mack instead. While Clowney has finally emerged this year after two injury-plagued seasons, Mack has already developed into one of the NFL's best pass rushers and is a leading candidate to win defensive player of the year. With questions on offense for both teams, this is a chance for both pass rushers to have big days – and their teams are certainly counting on it. Clowney could capitalize with Penn out.\\n\\n3. O'Brien hot seat: The Texans are seeking some playoff redemption after a 30-0 blowout loss to the Kansas City Chiefs at NRG Stadium last year. That flop, combined with the failure of Osweiler, has put plenty of pressure on head coach Bill O'Brien. It's rare that a coach gets fired after consecutive playoff appearances, but the Texans might be at the point where change could come with another early postseason exit.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFollow Lindsay H.

In 2018, Swift made her unofficial debut in taking a political stance when she shared a lengthy Instagram post about her hometown Tennessee Senate race, denouncing Republican incumbent Marsha Blackburn for her anti-LGBTQ stance.\\n\\nYou Need To Calm Down, her 2019 candy-colored, star-studded song about celebrating Pride, name-dropped the organization honoring her: Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? she sang. The music video featured a laundry list of major LGBTQ stars, including Ellen DeGeneres, Laverne Cox, RuPaul, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, Billy Porter and the cast of Queer Eye.\\n\\nTaylor Swift proudly uses her unique ability to influence pop culture to promote LGBTQ acceptance, GLAAD President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis said in a media release. In a time of political and cultural division, Taylor creates music that unites and calls on her massive fan following to speak up and call for change.\\n\\nThe Stephen F. Kolzak Award, given to an LGBTQ media professional who has made a significant difference in promoting acceptance, will go to Mock, most recently known as a wearer of many hats for FX's Pose. Previous recipients include Laverne Cox, Ellen DeGeneres, Wanda Sykes and Sir Ian McKellen.\\n\\nMock, 36, made history as the first trans woman of color to write and direct an episode of television, according to GLAAD. She previously produced the HBO documentary The Trans List, has written two memoirs and was named to Time's 2018 list of the 100 most influential people.\\n\\nEllis called Mock a trailblazing force for diverse and inclusive storytelling who has raised the bar for LGBTQ representation in Hollywood.\\n\\nEllis added: She tells stories that need to be told, including those of transgender people and people of color, in revolutionary and eye-opening ways that inspire and enrich. Her passion for inclusive storytelling, combined with her undeniable talents in writing, directing, and producing, will continue to create a Hollywood where voices and stories that have been left out of the conversation are placed front and center where they belong.\\n\\nThe annual award show will take place in Los Angeles on April 16. Nominees will be announced Wednesday."}
{"original": "Chris Rock has spent his time in quarantine reflecting on his past through therapy, he revealed.\\n\\nSpeaking to CBS Sunday Morning's Gayle King in a new interview, the 55-year-old comedian said he is in a happy and optimistic place now, now going to about seven hours of therapy sessions a week.\\n\\nYou have to tell the truth, Rock said. Sometimes I wasn't kind, and sometimes I wasn't listening. Sometimes I was selfish. And ultimately, who do you want to be? On the outside, it looks like I'm this daring person, but, boy, can I play it safe. I need to jump in the pool a little bit.\\n\\nRock had been to therapy before, but he didn't really jump into it until the pandemic hit. He says he still feels damage from the bullying he suffered as a child growing up in Brooklyn, but he has forgiven those who were unkind and acknowledges that the experiences made me who I am and hopes his bullies have become better people.\\n\\nPeople get better and people change, he said. Right now, we're going through this thing where we're punishing people for thinking and feeling and saying things 20, 30 years ago. Do you know how easy it would be for me in one of my specials to name a name, or show a picture of someone and say, 'This person called me (expletive)' and ruin someone's life? ... I'm going to hope that what they did to me shames them in some way and they teach their kids better. That's my wish for them.\\n\\nChris Rock talks: Changing his humor for 'Fargo' Season 4 and the 'surreal' 'SNL' with Eddie Murphy\\n\\nIn his upcoming Netflix special, an extended cut of his 2018 stand-up special Tambourine, Rock includes a bit about how law enforcement is a profession that can't have any bad apples, like pilots. Speaking to King, he opened up about his own experiences with police officers.\\n\\nSome jobs, you have to be totally accountable, he said. You have to have a zero tolerance for any shenanigans. Most of my dealings with the police are good. But ... a couple years ago there was a cop who was like: 'What are you driving around here for? You don't live around here, do you?' And I'm looking at him like, 'You don't live around here.' \\n\\nKing noted that some members of the Black community felt trepidation about getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Rock said he can't wait until he is able to get one.\\n\\nLet me put it this way: Do I take Tylenol when I get a headache? Yes, he said. Do I know what's in Tylenol? I don't know what's in Tylenol, Gayle. I just know my headache's gone. Do I know what's in a Big Mac, Gayle? No. I just know it's delicious.\\n\\n'My heart goes out to COVID':Chris Rock addresses Trump COVID diagnosis in 'SNL' monologue\\n\\nKing also observed that Rock clearly takes COVID very seriously, given that they were sitting outside his New Jersey home in the winter like human Popsicles. Rock tallied the various production team members sitting off camera, noting that it was much safer to sit outside than to bring about 15 people he didn't know inside his home.\\n\\nOutside of therapy, quarantine has brought more new lessons for the comedian. Rock learned how to swim in 2020, he revealed.\\n\\nI grew up in a 'hood, and you can't swim in a fire hydrant, he joked. There was something in my head that said, 'If I can learn to swim, I can do anything.' If I can conquer this in my 50s, I can do anything."}
{"original": "The freezers at his Georgia home are full after a few successful hunting trips. Now Brian Harman is out looking to add to his trophy shelf.\\n\\nWhether he's in a blind, tracking through woods or on the first tee, hunting is in Harman's DNA. The singular pursuit, the solidarity of preparation, the satisfaction of success, the sense of providing for his family. For the former Georgia Bulldog, only the venues and targets change in his mind, and after offseason trips to Texas, where he bagged a 13-point, 162-inch buck, and to Florida where he got some ducks, this week's locale is by the Pacific Ocean in the Sony Open in Hawaii.\\n\\nOur winter gathering went well, Harman said. We have meat for the year.\\n\\nAnd he has a plan for the upcoming year on the PGA Tour. It's quite simple, really. In so many words, it comes down to this – keep it simple. The lefty, who turns 31 next week, will concentrate on his preparation and staying in the moment despite coming off the best season of his career.\\n\\nWhether he's out hunting for deer or ducks or fishing, his livelihood is never far off from his thoughts.\\n\\nMore:Dustin Johnson wins Sentry Tournament of Champions\\n\\nMore:Tiger Woods to start season at Torrey Pines followed by Genesis Open\\n\\nI've always got golf on my mind, he said. I'm always thinking about what I can do as far as practicing, what I can do on certain courses. I sort of use hunting to unwind from the season and clear my head and figure out what I want to do going forward with my game. It's very important for me.\\n\\nEverything needs fine tuning. There's always something bothering you that makes you want to get better.\\n\\nHe was never better on the PGA Tour than in the 2016-17 wraparound season, when he had seven top-10s, was the 54-hole leader before finishing in a tie for second at the U.S. Open and won his second Tour title at the Wells Fargo Championship, where he nailed a 30-foot putt for birdie on the 72nd hole to topple world No. 1 Dustin Johnson and Pat Perez by one shot.\\n\\nObviously, the natural response is to say, 'Yeah, I'm excited. I'm going to have a big year,' Harman said. But I'm not able to predict any of those things. The only thing I'm worried about is going through my routine and getting ready for Hawaii and prepare as well as I can for the next tournament.\\n\\nI've always had pretty high expectations of myself. But I wouldn't say that my expectations are any higher. I've learned that super high expectations lead to big disappointments. So if I can just stay focused on what I want to do, that helps me to stay in the present.\\n\\nIt's working so far. Armed with new weapons – his bag is full of Titleist clubs and golf balls after an equipment switch – Harman has started his 2017-18 campaign with four top-10s in as many starts, including third in last week's Sentry Tournament of Champions in Maui. He's moved to a career-high of 23rd in the official world golf rankings.\\n\\nWhile Harman has always adopted the role of underdog and feeds off it – he goes about 5-foot-7 and his college coach once said Harman would rather eat nails than lose – there is one thing in his sights that will further fuel his pursuit this upcoming year: the Ryder Cup.\\n\\nHarman finished 12th in the Presidents Cup standings last year and was bypassed as a captain's pick. He's represented the red, white and blue in the Walker Cup and hungers to put the colors on again.\\n\\nI was disappointed I didn't make the Presidents Cup team. That one definitely stung, he said. But I'll use that going forward. That's definitely motivation.\\n\\nHe'll do so one hunting trip – he's going after turkeys in April – one practice session and one tournament at a time."}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nThere was a coaching clinic in Berlin back in 2014, when San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich paced along the sideline for a while and talked about his various philosophies and keys to basketball success.\\n\\nIt didn't take him long to mention his disdain for the 3-point shot, which is no secret.\\n\\nSo imagine this irony: His Spurs, this season, are shooting the 3 as well as just about any team in league history.\\n\\nOverlooked, perhaps, in their 30-7 start this season is this. The Spurs are connecting on 41.3 percent of their 3s — on pace to be the third-best success rate since the shot was added to the NBA game nearly four decades ago. Only the 1996-97 Charlotte Hornets (42.8 percent) and last season's Golden State Warriors (41.6) shot it better than San Antonio has to this point.\\n\\nI hate it, Popovich said that day in Berlin. It's not real basketball.\\n\\nAh, but it can be part of smart basketball, as the Spurs keep showing.\\n\\nHouston has missed more 3s this season than the Spurs have taken — by a lot, too. Entering Sunday, only Chicago was averaging fewer 3-point attempts per game than San Antonio.\\n\\nBut the Spurs take good ones.\\n\\nThey're making 45 percent of their corner 3s, 40 percent of ones taken from above the break. And the Spurs are on pace to be the first team in NBA history to shoot better than .400 from 3-point range and .800 from the foul line.\\n\\n___\\n\\nCONFUSING HAWKS\\n\\nKyle Korver has now been traded to the Cavaliers and Paul Millsap will likely be next to leave Atlanta. So if (or when) the Millsap deal happens, the entire starting lineup from the Hawks team that won 60 games just two seasons ago will be gone.\\n\\nAnd amid all this change and rumor, the Hawks keep winning.\\n\\nAtlanta plays at Brooklyn on Tuesday night. Should the Hawks win there, it would be seven straight victories for Atlanta — the longest streak by any team in the Eastern Conference so far this season.\\n\\nIt also would make the Hawks the first team this season to have both a seven-game winning streak and a seven-game losing streak. The Clippers came close, winning seven in a row once and later losing six straight.\\n\\n___\\n\\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\\n\\nA look at some of the games to watch this week:\\n\\n— Oklahoma City at Chicago, Monday. Jimmy Butler's last six games for the Bulls — 34.2 points, 8.7 rebounds, 5.7 assists, 72 for 83 from the foul line.\\n\\n— Boston at Toronto, Tuesday. Celtics have scored 100 or more in 11 straight games, one away from matching their longest such streak under Brad Stevens.\\n\\n— Indiana vs. Denver in London, Thursday. The NBA hits London for the seventh time. A 3 p.m. weekday start for fans in Indiana, 1 p.m. for those in Denver.\\n\\n— Memphis at Houston, Friday. Hard to find two coaches who have done better so far than the Rockets' Mike D'Antoni and the Grizzlies' David Fizdale.\\n\\n— Minnesota at Dallas, Sunday. The Mavs moved up the start, so this game should end about the same time the Cowboys-Packers playoff game kicks off.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSTAT LINE OF THE WEEK\\n\\nJimmy Butler, Chicago. As if the 52 points, 12 rebounds and 21-for-22 show at the foul line wasn't enough last Monday against Charlotte, gander at these: He had 17 points in a fourth-quarter span of 3 minutes, 53 seconds, and his 21 made free throws were more than the Hawks, Pistons, Pacers, Grizzlies, Heat and Magic all totaled in their first two games against the Hornets this season."}
{"original": "For Bachelor Nation, 2021 is starting off with a monumental bang: the arrival of the first Black Bachelor, Matt James.\\n\\nWhenever you're the first to do something, then you're kind of setting the standard, James tells USA TODAY in a Zoom interview on Monday from his New York apartment. But what I try to remind myself of is that my experience is my own.\\n\\nJames' season, filmed at Nemacolin Resort in Farmington, Pennsylvania, premieres Monday on ABC (8 EST/PST) – and host Chris Harrison says it's been a long time coming.\\n\\n(James) is going to be more of a lightbulb lightning moment because he is a Black lead. But the change has been happening for quite some time, he says in a separate interview. I'm glad that more and more people are seeing themselves represented on the show. That's the most important thing, is that you are seeing these people fall in love and these people represent you.\\n\\nJames has never appeared on The Bachelorette, the usual gateway to Bachelor-hood, but he's a good friend of previous Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron, and was supposed to appear on Clare Crawley's delayed season that ended Dec. 22; the pandemic thwarted those plans but paved the way for his casting in the new Bachelor season.\\n\\nDetails on James' casting:Matt James will be the first Black 'Bachelor' in ABC series history; Rachel Lindsay reacts\\n\\nWhen filming couldn't move forward as planned, we were given the benefit of time to get to know (James) and all agreed he would make a perfect Bachelor, then-ABC Entertainment president Karey Burke said in a statement last June.\\n\\nHarrison adds: We had to roll with the punches as everybody else had, but it was definitely the right choice. And it was the right time. Tayshia Adams took over as Bachelorette after Crawley's quick engagement, and later got engaged herself.\\n\\nThe James announcement came shortly after a group of fans known as The Bachelor Diversity Campaign asked ABC and producer Warner Bros. to diversify the franchise. This happened amid the racial protests around the country last summer following the death of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck.\\n\\nProducers of the franchise in September said they would remove racist comments on its social media.\\n\\nThe Bachelor Diversity Campaign honored James' casting ahead of the premiere Monday on Instagram.\\n\\nHopefully, me being in this position normalizes this for other people of color, James says. And in the future, when there is a Black Bachelor, it's not like, 'Oh, welcome, Keith, the next Black Bachelor.' It's, 'Welcome, Keith, who happens to be Black' or 'Welcome, Keith, who happens to be Asian.'\\n\\nHarrison respects those who've lamented the show's lack of diversity in the past but cautions against badgering those making good-faith efforts to change.\\n\\nWhen you do see (change), give people the grace, the understanding, the compassion in the room to change, he says. No movement's going to work if you also don't give them the opportunity to make those changes. And that is something that gets lost in this cancel culture, in this culture to want to be the most woke and demand more.\\n\\nJames adds: This was definitely a step in the right direction in terms of what change looks like from an entertainment perspective. It was an honor to be a part of that, because I've seen how and what Rachel (Lindsay, the first Black Bachelorette) went through, when she was the first. And I couldn't have imagined someone like that trailblazing something like this for myself. And I'm hoping to be that for the next person.\\n\\nMore from Rachel Lindsay:'Bachelor,' 'Bachelorette' star Rachel Lindsay says hit ABC shows need to work harder to be more diverse\\n\\nAs for Harrison, he's not a big fan of reflecting on whether the franchise moved fast enough: There is this amazing culture of change going on. But there's also this culture of, how can I ruin that? How can I say, well, you're not woke enough? What is woke enough for you?\\n\\nDuring Adams' stint on Bachelorette the show tackled addiction, mental health and the Black Lives Matter movement. Viewers will see these conversations continue during James' season.\\n\\nJames says kids are going to have to deal with conversations about race in the future, so it's something that should be discussed and talked about. He believes the show has taken steps in the right direction, but hopes that going forward, they continue to be as inclusive as they can. And we saw what that looks like this year.\\n\\nHarrison knows the show isn't all the way there when it comes to diversity and inclusion, despite the landmark casting (not to mention casting its first deaf contestant, Abigail). Are we all the way there? No. Are we going to continue? Absolutely. Will we continue to be criticized? Of course we will. But that's part of it. And I relish that. If this raises the level of debate, hey, I don't mind being that lightning rod. That's fine. Bring it on.\\n\\nIn case you missed this from the summer:'Bachelor' alums, fans call on ABC to diversify contestants in wake of Black Lives Matter protests\\n\\nHow did that 'Bachelorette' finale go?

{"original": "PORTLAND, Ore. — As Rabbi Ken Brodkin watched the news trickle in from Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017 — 26 killed and 20 wounded after a shooter opened fire during Sunday morning services, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history — he felt a jolt of realization. Seeing a house of worship become a hunting ground for shooters in real-time told him everything was about to change.\\n\\nBrodkin, 44, has been the rabbi at Congregation Kesser Israel, Oregon's largest and longest-established Orthodox synagogue for 14 years. His congregations totals about 130 families in the Portland area, a sliver of the small Jewish population in Portland, where roughly 40,000 Jews live in a city of almost 650,000.\\n\\nBrodkin's always known the Jewish community is vulnerable to hate crimes — anti-Semitism, he says, is an eternal force — but that reality crystallized in fall 2018, when his congregation decided the best way to protect itself was to hire an armed guard to patrol the synagogue during weekend services.\\n\\nHis situation isn't unique. As anti-Semitic attacks become more frequent across the country, Jewish leaders are grappling with how to straddle the line of creating open environments while keeping their congregation safe from hateful outsiders.\\n\\nThe challenges can be particularly steep for smaller communities, which often find themselves with fewer financial resources and isolated geographically. Paying for security measures like cameras, panic buttons, bulletproof glass, metal detectors or armed guards can add up quickly, and isn't in every synagogue's budget.\\n\\nIt's the million-dollar question, Brodkin says. We can't allow the fact that there are crazy people in the world to stop us from our mission of building a welcoming community. Those things aren't mutually exclusive — but the attention to detail has to be thorough.\\n\\nIn recent weeks, Jewish people across the U.S. have come together to show support for their community. Shortly after a stabbing attack at a Hannukkah party last week in Monsey, New York, hundreds of Jews rallied in the streets, and hundreds of thousands are expected this Sunday at a march in New York City.\\n\\n'Nothing is going to stop us being Jewish':New York community rallies after anti-Semitic 'terrorism' attack\\n\\nAnti-Semitism is on the rise in the U.S. There were 780 anti-Semitic incidents — assaults, vandalism and harassment — in the first half of 2019, according to the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\nIn contrast, in 2018 there were 775 in the first half of the year. The deadliest came in Pittsburgh in October 2018, when 11 people were murdered by a white supremacist gunman. During the Monsey attack on Dec. 29, a man stabbed five people with a machete at the home of a rabbi. That attack came shortly after two shooters killed four people at a Jersey City, New Jersey, kosher market earlier in December.\\n\\nMost congregations pride themselves on being a welcoming place, and none of us want to practice our religion inside a fortress, says Aaron Ahlquist, 43, an Anti-Defamation League regional director based in New Orleans who oversees Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.\\n\\nAhlquist works directly with smaller communities in his region to make sure they're connecting with local law enforcement to discuss security procedures. His office also identifies and tracks hate groups and individuals who have clearly expressed hate motives toward the Jewish community.\\n\\nWe're reeling from all these attacks, Ahlquist says. And one of the realities is that for the Jewish community in particular, but really all faith communities, a passive approach to security is no longer an option.\\n\\nMost Jewish communities in the U.S. also work directly with the Secure Community Network, a national organization headquartered in Chicago. Staffed with law enforcement and homeland security experts, the Secure Community Network works with the FBI and Jewish leaders to identify potential threats and train communities on how to handle them, from helping them establish communication networks, to spreading news of potential threats, to practicing active shooter drills.\\n\\nMichael Masters, 41, the CEO and national director, took over his position two years ago, shortly after the Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. After the neo-Nazi protests, when white nationalists marched through the streets chanting, Jews will not replace us, Masters spent time with Alan Zimmerman, president of Congregation Beth Israel, the only synagogue in Charlottesville, which serves more than 800 families in a city of about 48,000. The synagogue was a block away from the riot that killed one person.\\n\\nAlan described standing on the steps of the synagogue, looking across the street and seeing individuals with assault rifles, waving Nazi and Confederate flags and told me, 'We felt so alone,' Masters recalls.\\n\\nMy response was, 'Shame on us as a community if any Jew, anywhere in this country, feels alone.'\\n\\nOne of the biggest realizations for Masters after Charlottesville was that we needed to figure how to expand a security umbrella, particularly to those communities that have less resources.\\n\\nIt's not realistic, security experts say, for every congregation to spend money on facility hardening like cameras, bulletproof glass and metal detectors. Those measures become cost prohibitive very quickly. Instead, experts recommend and emphasize training and relationship building — with both local law enforcement and the synagogue's neighbors.\\n\\nSynagogue president: A straight line from Charlottesville to Pittsburgh shooting\\n\\nIn Bozeman, Montana, Rabbi Chaim Bruk is the co-CEO of Chabad Lubavitch, a Hasidic Jewish community. He and his wife, Chavie, moved out West 13 years ago to open the first Orthodox synagogue in Montana in 100 years.\\n\\nBruk estimates that within a 50-mile radius of Bozeman, a Southern Montana city of just under 47,000 there are 800 households that have a Jew in them, though the synagogue typically only sees 30 to 40 people at its weekly service. Within the congregation, members devised ways to communicate quickly with Bruk when someone unfamiliar enters the synagogue so he can let them know if they should worry. (Bruk declined to give details on their procedures for security purposes.)\\n\\nTaking more drastic measures — like hiring an armed guard or installing metal detectors — would be a financial strain for the congregation, Bruk says, but he's committed to figuring out how to do right by our community if that's what's needed based on expert assessment.\\n\\nBruk says it's only recently that he's started to look over his shoulder — and that hasn't happened in Montana, a reliably red state known for its staunch support of the Second Amendment. It happened in his native Brooklyn in New York City when Bruk recently went back to visit family.\\n\\nThere's been something like 20 attacks just in Crown Heights, where I grew up, he says of the Brooklyn neighborhood known for its active Jewish community. The fact that I have to look over my shoulder in Brooklyn, what does that say about America in 2020?\\n\\nIn Bozeman, Bruk says he and his family — he and Chavie have five children — feel welcome every day, and frequently interact with non-Jews at major events, like at their annual Menorah lighting, which has been attended in the past by both U.S. senators from Montana.\\n\\nWithin the walls of his synagogue, he wants both his congregants to feel safe and outsiders to feel welcome. I don't want to alienate them or have us turn into Europe, he says, a sentiment felt by many within the Jewish community as Jews flee France and England in response to rising anti-Semitism.\\n\\nBruk says that as a student years ago, he had a five-hour layover in Barcelona, Spain, and decided to visit a synagogue to pray. Getting inside took a ridiculous amount of time, he says.\\n\\nWe knock on the door and it's, 'Who are you? Do you have your passport to prove it? Why didn't you call ahead of time?' He recalls. I don't want my synagogue — or America — to turn into that.\\n\\nBruk also rejects the idea because the Jewish community is under attack, it should back into the shadows. He said that in the face of anti-Semitism, Jews need to lean into their Jewishness even more, embracing their culture and faith — especially in smaller communities.\\n\\nThe natural response would be to hide, to take off our yarmulkes and stop shopping in the kosher section of the grocery store, he says. But we're not going to cower or run away. We're going to continue celebrating, even if they're going to make it a little harder.\\n\\nAlmost 800 miles away in Portland, Brodkin echoes that sentiment. He points out that Jews all over the planet just concluded Hanukkah, a celebration that emphasizes bringing more light into the world.\\n\\nI still feel confident and hopeful, Brodkin says. The Jewish people have been here for 4,000 years — and we've already survived and thrived so many difficult things."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nIt looks like it's a good year to be a wild card in the NFL playoffs.\\n\\nThe oddsmakers certainly think so, making Kansas City (3 points), Pittsburgh (2 1-2), and Seattle (5 1-2) favorites on the road in the opening round of the postseason. The only wild card that is an underdog is slumping Green Bay, and by only a point at Washington.\\n\\nThose wise guys also have made the sixth-seeded Seahawks the third choice to win the NFC at 9-4, behind Arizona and Carolina, each at 2-1 odds. The AFC's sixth seed, the Steelers, also are the third choice behind division winners Denver and New England.\\n\\nAs for the upcoming weekend, what they are thinking in Las Vegas is that none of the division winners — Redskins, Texans, Bengals or Vikings — is impressive.\\n\\nIndeed, much of the talk the past few weeks around the league was about which opponent was a must to avoid, with the Seahawks, Chiefs and Steelers the front-runners in that race.\\n\\nYou know what, I could honestly care less about what anybody says outside of this locker room, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce said. We know that we line up against anybody that we're confident that we're going to get the job done.\\n\\nThey have done what's necessary in 10 straight games for one of the great turnarounds in NFL history. The Chiefs rank first in the AFC with a plus-14 turnover margin. The defense is formidable and might get back its best player, linebacker Justin Houston (knee). They're 5-3 on the road and already have won at the Texans, in the season opener, when KC wasn't nearly so strong.\\n\\nFirst of all they have a lot of good players and they have a really good coaching staff. That combination is tough, Texans coach Bill O'Brien said.\\n\\nOn defense they've got really good pass rushers with (Tamba) Hali and Houston and they've got a good secondary playing at a high level, their linebackers fly around, their front seven is really, really good.\\n\\nOffensively Alex Smith's had a good year, receivers, (Jeremy) Maclin. I know Jamaal Charles is on IR now, but they've still got running backs, Kelce the tight end, a really good offensive line. So it's a big challenge.\\n\\nAlthough Pittsburgh stumbled badly in Week 16 with its loss at the Ravens, it got another chance when the moment proved too big for the Jets in Buffalo. Considering how the Steelers can ring up points on anyone, plus their strong postseason pedigree with leaders such as Ben Roethlisberger, Heath Miller, Cam Heyward, revitalized James Harrison and coach Mike Tomlin, the Bengals can't be thrilled with Saturday night's matchup.\\n\\nAlso remember the Steelers won in Cincinnati 33-20 a month ago, are 18-7 overall against their AFC North rivals since 2004, have won 21 of 26 at Riverfront or Paul Brown stadiums, and Cincy hasn't won a playoff game since the 1990 season.\\n\\nThe postseason is a different season, Roethlisberger said. You're going to have to do your best, throw out all of the records, throw out where you are playing. Everybody has to step up and be ready to go.\\n\\nSteelers fans expect their team to be ready: Saturday's prime-time affair is sold out and you can bet plenty of Terrible Towels will be waving in Cincinnati.\\n\\nConsidering how Minnesota has closed the schedule, winning three straight to grab the NFC North and also with a close defeat at Arizona before that, some might be surprised to see the Seahawks so heavily favored. If so, those folks have forgotten the shellacking Seattle handed the Vikings in Minneapolis in early December.\\n\\nFor further emphasis, this is a more balanced Seahawks team than the squads that reached the past two Super Bowls. Its defense might not be quite as dynamic, but its offense is vastly superior to 2013 and '14.\\n\\nAnd there is this: Seattle fears no one.\\n\\nI think people can sometimes forget who we are, star cornerback Richard Sherman said. We let a few penalties, weird calls or miscues change their perception, and then we come back and remind them.\\n\\nOnly the Packers among the wild cards don't seem fearsome, mainly because their offense has frozen. Yet they play the perceived weakest of the division champions, so no one is counting out Aaron Rodgers and company. Also the Redskins (9-7) didn't beat a team that finished with a winning record.\\n\\nThis could be one of those years when being on the road in January matters little. Visitors went 118-138 this season, and the wild cards were a collective 19-13 away from home.\\n\\nPlus, it's not as if non-division champions can't win Super Bowls. Indeed, the Steelers, Chiefs and Packers all have done it.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nTUSCON, Ariz. (AP) — Freshman Brandon Williams started at a new position Thursday, and he made it look old hat.\\n\\nWilliams had 14 points and six assists while opening at point guard in place of injured regular Justin Coleman, helping to lead Arizona to 64-56 victory over Colorado in the Pac-12 opener for both.\\n\\nI just had to step up, said Williams, who usually plays off guard.\\n\\nJust being that vocal leader, being the quarterback of the team. Just making smart decisions. That's pretty much it. Coach always says next guy up has to be ready.\\n\\nBrandon Randolph had 11 points and freshman Devonaire Doutrive tied a season high with eight for the Wildcats. Chase Jeter had seven points and eight rebounds.\\n\\nColeman, who came in averaging 10.1 points and was second on the team with 41 assists, suffered a dislocated shoulder in practice Monday and played only four minutes in the first half, missing his only field goal attempt.\\n\\nWilliams and Coleman often play point guard opposite each other in practice.\\n\\nThat's not an easy situation that (Williams) walked into, Arizona coach Sean Miller said. First Pac-12 game. He's predominantly played off the ball.\\n\\nTo throw him to the fire like that, he did a really good job. When we practice, he always plays the point guard, for his own development and to protect our team . in case of an injury, because that can always change everything.\\n\\nMcKinley Wright IV had 17 points and six rebounds and Lucas Siewert had 11 points for the Buffaloes (9-4, 0-1), who have lost three of their last four. Tyler Bey had 11 rebounds.\\n\\nArizona (10-4, 1-0) did not lead for the first nine minutes before rallying. Williams had seven points and Doutrive had six as the Wildcats closed the first half on a 26-13 run for a 39-24 halftime lead and never again trailed.\\n\\nColorado trimmed a 17-point deficit to 57-50 on D'Shawn Schwartz's 3-pointer with 2:47 remaining before Randolph hit a layup and Williams made a jumper as the shot clock expired to half the rally.\\n\\nThe first 20 minutes of the game was among our best basketball of the year, Miller said. We moved the ball really well. We played good defense, good offense.\\n\\nDoutrive had played seven of the first 13 games, and with Coleman out of the rotation played a season-high 12 minutes Thursday.\\n\\nI'm just ready whenever my number is called, Doutrive said.\\n\\nMiller: He makes us a deeper team. He's clever. He understands when to pass, when not to. I was excited to see it, because that is kind of the way things are supposed to go, where a young guy fights, scratches and claws his way into the lineup.\\n\\nColorado had not played since Dec. 25 and Arizona had not played since Dec. 22. The rust seemed to show at the offensive end as Colorado shot 35.8 percent with 17 turnovers and Arizona shot 43.1 percent.\\n\\nOur inefficiencies on offense are putting a lot of pressure on our defense, Colorado coach Tad Boyle said. If you come into this building and turn it over 17 times, you are not going to win.\\n\\nArizona's Ira Lee had five points and three rebounds in 13 minutes. He spent Dec. 23 in jail after pleading guilty to driving under the influence last summer.\\n\\nRING OF HONOR\\n\\nFormer Arizona center Deandre Ayton was inducted into the Wildcats' Ring of Honor in a halftime ceremony. Ayton was the Pac-12 player of the year in 2018, his only college season.\\n\\nHe was in our locker room, almost like he was ready to play in the game, Miller said. He brings a smile to everybody's face. As great of a talent as he is, he has an incredible mind and personality. That will prove itself out over his NBA career. What he did in his year here speaks for itself.\\n\\nAyton, taken by Phoenix with the first pick in the 2018 NBA draft, is averaging 17.0 points and 10.9 rebounds with the Suns, second among rookies in scoring and first in rebounds.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nArizona: A perennial favorite to win the Pac-12, the Wildcats were the first conference team to 10 wins this season and have won eight of nine at home, which bodes well in what appears to be a wide-open league race, especially now that Oregon top freshman Bol Bol is out for the season.\\n\\nColorado: The Buffaloes have not played a Top-25 team this season, and they did not play well in the Pac-12 opener. At the same time, they are the only team in the league with as many two true road victories in nonconference play.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nArizona will play host to Utah at noon Saturday after the Utes made 16 threes in overcoming a 17-point deficit to beat Arizona State on Thursday. Arizona is 12-1 against the Utes since they joined the Pac-12 in 2011, including a victory on its way 2018 Pac-12 tournament title, and is 6-0 at McKale Center.\\n\\nColorado will make the 110-mile trip up I-10 to face Arizona State on Saturday. Colorado won two of three against the Sun Devils last season, winning in Tempe and again in the Pac-12 tournament, where a late dunk after the game was decided led to an on-court scuffle."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nWASHINGTON (AP) — Washington coach Barry Trotz wasn't surprised his squad started the season slow. Pain from another playoff flameout lingered. Trotz and the coaching staff gave the players space to emotionally mend on their own, anticipating the team's culture would eventually help find a winning path. That approach proved wise.\\n\\nNicklas Backstrom scored at 4:17 of overtime and Alex Ovechkin had a power-play goal and an assist to help the Capitals beat the St. Louis Blues 4-3 on Sunday.\\n\\nThe Capitals have won four in a row overall and nine consecutive home games, the longest active streak in the NHL. Since Nov. 22, the Metropolitan Division leaders are 15-3-2.\\n\\nWe had to get through the misery of how we finished last year, Trotz said in reference to the Game 7 loss at home to Pittsburgh in the second round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.\\n\\nWashington hasn't advanced beyond the second round of the postseason since reaching the 1998 Stanley Cup Finals despite several impressive teams. The Capitals won 55 and 56 games the previous two seasons.\\n\\nWe had high expectations. We have expectations to do well every year, especially the last couple of years, Trotz said. There's a lot of hurt. Our expectations are higher than some other teams because we feel like we can get there.

They have lost two in a row and six of their last seven road games.\\n\\nRecognizing a change of possession in Washington's end late in overtime, Backstrom headed down ice, received a long pass from T.J. Oshie and beat goalie Carter Hutton for his ninth goal of the season.\\n\\nTied up there on the boards, I was just going. I knew the pass was coming, Backstrom said. Nice to get a breakaway for once. Nice to score too.\\n\\nBackstrom scored his 197th goal to tie Alexander Semin for fifth on the Capitals' goals list.

{"original": "When a handful of NFL players first approached NFL owners in the fall of 2017 about enlisting their services in the fight for social justice, none of them knew exactly how things would play out. They didn't even have a clear vision of how to tackle the problems plaguing people of color in communities across the country. But the players knew something had to be done.\\n\\nFormer San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick had started the conversation about the need to combat systematic oppression on people of color. And players received backlash from fans, NFL owners and President Donald Trump for supporting Kaepernick, and in some cases joining him, in protesting during the national anthem.\\n\\nBut players like Anquan Boldin and Malcolm Jenkins wanted to do more than protest. Peers like Doug Baldwin, Kelvin Beachum, Demario Davis, Chris Long, Devin McCourty, Josh McCown, Rodney McLeod, Josh Norman, Torrey Smith and Benjamin Watson agreed and began looking for ways to make an impact. They believed NFL owners could actually help further their reach.\\n\\nEventually, that group became the Players Coalition, and they formed a partnership with the NFL and its owners, who the following spring agreed to donate close to $90 million for programs to combat social inequality.\\n\\nTo be honest with you, we didn't know what to expect going in, Boldin, who a year earlier had retired abruptly to focus on the fight for social justice, told USA TODAY Sports in a telephone conversation this week. But I can tell you we've been pleasantly surprised. Some people were skeptical of us going into it, especially with us doing the partnership with the NFL. I don't know, for whatever reason, people didn't think it was genuine.\\n\\nAt the time, some critics wrote off word of the players' efforts as a PR stunt. Others believed the league's owners were simply trying to pacify players in order to stop them from protesting during the anthem. Others, including Kaepernick and close friend and former teammate Eric Reid, accused members of the Players Coalition of selling out.\\n\\nBut now entering the third year of their union, the members of the Players Coalition and fellow socially active NFL players are seeing tangible proof of their intentions and efforts.\\n\\nI can tell you over the three years, the work we've been doing, the partnerships we've made in this space, people can see these guys aren't in it for a PR stunt, Boldin continued. We're in it to see our country change for the better … These communities have welcomed us. We've worked with a lot of grass-roots organizations, and they've been able to see our hearts, as well as us seeing theirs. We didn't know what to expect going into it. But I'm proud of the relationships we've built over the last three years.\\n\\nSince the forming of the partnership in 2018, the NFL has awarded social justice organizations more than $25 million in grants. More than 500 grants have been given to current and former players to support nonprofits across the country. The primary focus: education, police and community relations and criminal justice reform.\\n\\nThe NFL on Tuesday announced a relaunch of the Inspire Change initiative running from now until the Super Bowl that will highlight the work players and teams are doing in their communities.\\n\\nAdditionally, the NFL and Players Coalition are awarding six new grants and two grant renewals, totaling roughly $3 million, which brings the total number of national social justice grant recipients to 18.\\n\\nThe six new community organizations: Alabama Appleseed, City Year, Community Justice Exchange, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, Metropolitan Family Services, and the National Urban League. They all focus on strengthening education and community/police relationships and criminal justice reform. The organizations were selected after going through the Players Coalition and NFL's submission, vetting and voting process, Boldin explained.\\n\\nWe've got 18 different organizations that are receiving (national) grants right now, and that's something we're proud of, Boldin said. It's a constant communication when it comes to the Players Coalition and the NFL. Like I said, any time you have a working relationship like that, you have to learn each other and grow in trust, and we're at that point where the NFL trusts us and we trust the NFL as well, and the work we've been able to do is a result of that relationship coming together: us being able to go directly to owners and let them know what we're passionate about, them telling us what they're passionate about and us partnering with them. I'm thinking of the Haslams in Cleveland, us doing an education initiative with them, us doing work with Mr. Blank in Atlanta. Mr. Kraft working with us on Raise the Age in Boston, so I feel like the relationship has been pretty fruitful.\\n\\nThe fight against racial and social inequality is never-ending, and at times progress is hard to physically measure. But Boldin said he and his fellow former and current NFL players heavily involved in the work – a number that the Players Coalition says now tops 100 – do have tangible results to point to: legislation that has been passed in certain states the last two years to restore voter's rights to individuals who have completed probation, to raise the age of juvenile jurisdiction, the programs that they see being implemented in the schools that they frequently visit.\\n\\nThere are definitely wins that you can point to that guys have put sweat equity into and are seeing results from it, and that encourages guys to go out and do even more, he explained. One of the things that we've been fortunate enough to do is actually go out and spend time with grant recipients. For example, me and (New York Jets offensive lineman) Kelvin Beachum had a grant recipient at a school in Brooklyn and being able to go in and talk to a teacher and students, it gives you that real-life experience, not just cutting a check and not knowing what it was going to.\\n\\nOne thing we always get is people are appreciative for the NFL players who stand up and give their voices for them. Lots of times, they feel helpless. They feel like nobody cares about what they're going through, but to see guys they see on TV speak up for them and go to bat for them, they're encouraged by us using our platform.\\n\\nThat's all Boldin and his brethren need to hear to know that their efforts are not in vain.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Mike Jones on Twitter @ByMikeJones and listen to the Football Jones podcast on iTunes."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — Jordan Todman and Fitzgerald Toussaint have spent their respective NFL careers finding work where they could get it, quietly doing their business on the scout team or second string, never wavering in their belief they could be difference makers if given the chance.\\n\\nIn the rain on the road with the season in the balance, the two Pittsburgh Steelers reserves did more than just serve as placeholders for injured starter DeAngelo Williams. They proved they can make it in the unforgiving crucible of the playoffs.\\n\\nTodman ran for a game-high 65 yards while Toussaint had 118 yards of total offense in Pittsburgh's 18-16 wild-card win over the Bengals on Saturday. Though Williams is hopeful his injured right foot will be good enough to go for next weekend's trip to Denver, the Steelers running game appears to be in good hands either way.\\n\\nIt's still unbelievable man, Toussaint said.\\n\\nKinda.\\n\\nPittsburgh signed Todman on Sept. 6 after he failed to make the final 53-man roster in Carolina (despite a 49-yard touchdown sprint against the Steelers in the preseason finale) and added Toussaint to the practice squad a day later. They worked most of the year as in case of emergency, break glass options behind Williams and Le'Veon Bell. Then Bell tore a ligament in his right knee on Nov. 1 and Williams had his right foot crunched while facing Cleveland in Week 17.\\n\\nSo much for being afterthoughts.\\n\\nYet Todman and Toussaint (already being dubbed TNT in some social media circles) hardly seemed overcome by the stage or facing the league's seventh-ranked run defense. Toussaint's first carry lost a yard but his second was an authoritative burst over left tackle for nine. Todman entered late in the first quarter and darted for 23 yards on consecutive carries.\\n\\nI felt like we were pretty good, pretty consistent, Todman said. We had a little rhythm.\\n\\nThey began the night with all of 76 yards rushing on the season — about 1,460 yards less than the two guys they were replacing. Yet Todman and Toussaint kept finding room and taking some of the pressure off quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who had trouble facing an occasional downpour and a Cincinnati pass rush that rarely let him get comfortable.\\n\\nAt 5-foot-10, 200 pounds, Toussaint lacks Bell's quick feet or subtlety. He was checked for a concussion when a collision sent the top of his helmet crashing onto the bridge of his nose, creating a gash that made him look like a stunt double in Creed.\\n\\nThey ran some tests on me, had me say a couple things, Toussaint said. The finger test, I passed it with flying colors and I was good.\\n\\nThe Steelers needed him to be. The player who came in with three receptions in his brief career played a vital role in Pittsburgh's last-gasp drive. Trailing by two with less than 90 seconds to go and with Roethlisberger's range limited thanks to a throbbing right shoulder, Toussaint suddenly became the most dangerous player on the field.\\n\\nHe caught consecutive lobs of seven and 10 yards to push the Steelers toward midfield and only Cincinnati defensive end Michael Johnson's outstretched arm prevented a surprise draw play from the Pittsburgh 37 from turning into a big gainer.\\n\\nWhen you can go out there and got both guys out there, both making plays (it shows) they have confidence in both of us, Toussaint said.\\n\\nA confidence Pittsburgh expects to carry over to Denver. Even if Williams can play, it's almost a given that Toussaint and Todman will be on the field at some point as the Steelers try to earn a trip to the AFC championship game for the first time in five years.\\n\\nWhatever jitters they may have carried with them into the postseason are now a distant memory. Todman, who bounced from Minnesota to San Diego to Jacksonville to Carolina before winding up in Pittsburgh, had to wait five years to be indoctrinated into the playoffs. It proved to be well worth it.\\n\\nThat was probably the most stressful one, the most ups and downs, highs and lows, he said. It's amazing how one little thing can change the outcome of the game.\\n\\nOr maybe not so little. The Steelers are still playing thanks in part to contributions from two players who heard head coach Mike Tomlin repeat his next man up mantra ad nauseam all season and took it to heart. Sure, there was a lot of chaos in the final seconds. That was new. The Steelers finding a way to win in January was not, no matter who is on the field.\\n\\nI just believe in the guys in this room and the way we prepare all week long, Toussaint said. That gets us out of stadiums like that.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

But establishing that a base editor can correct a mutation that causes a systemic and devastating genetic disease in an animal, rescuing many of the symptoms of the disease and greatly extending lifespan is a good start!\\n\\nIn this case, Liu and his colleagues repaired a gene that, when mutated, causes progeria, an ultra-rare disease leading to premature aging.

But treating most genetic diseases requires precise correction of the mutation rather than disrupting the gene, says Liu, vice chair of the faculty at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, a biomedical and genomic research center.\\n\\nFor the vast majority of known genetic mutations that cause disease, it's difficult to understand how destroying the gene is going to benefit patients, he says.\\n\\nInstead, a base editor tool works like a pencil, capable of erasing and rewriting a single letter mistake.\\n\\nCorrecting the genetic error in the mice is a huge scientific achievement, says Fyodor Urnov, a gene editing expert at the University of California-Berkeley, who was not involved in the new research.\\n\\nAlthough there is a long way to go before a similar error is fixed in a person, Urnov likens the findings to climbing halfway up Yosemite's El Capitan without ropes.\\n\\nIt's such a cause for celebration, Urnov says enthusiastically. There's a lot of climbing that lies ahead and a lot of danger and a lot of unpredictability, but the part they just traversed, first, is a breathtaking achievement and second, is the riskiest.\\n\\nThe field of genetic engineering has moved forward in fits and starts for three decades, pocked with tragedies, such as the death of teenager Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, and crises such as the revelation in 2018 that Chinese scientist He Jiankui gene edited embryos leading to the birth of three babies. He is behind bars, and no other scientist has reported editing viable human embryos.\\n\\nHe used a gene editing tool called CRISPR-Cas9, developed earlier in the decade by two women, Jennifer Doudna of Berkeley and French scientist Emmanuelle Charpentier, who won the 2020 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their achievement.\\n\\nCRISPR has been shown in the past year to work effectively in people.\\n\\nIn March, a paper revealed it had been used in the eye to treat a genetic form of blindness. Last month, researchers showed a patient with sickle cell disease and another with the blood disorder beta thalassemia were able to stop regular transfusions in the year since their blood cells were gene edited, and the sickle cell patient has avoided pain crises.\\n\\nCRISPR-Cas9 was used as a starting point for the new base editors developed in Liu's lab by then-graduate students Alexis Komor and Nicole M. Gaudelli, though not all base editors rely on CRISPR technology.\\n\\nThe base editor used in the new study changes one DNA letter to another using a protein that took years of work to evolve. Then it nicks the opposite strand – the unedited one – so the cell's repair mechanism fixes the DNA letter on that strand, too.\\n\\nDNA is shaped like a double helix, a twisted ladder made up of pairs of nucleotides, abbreviated as letters. A always pairs with T, and C pairs with G. The tool is called an A base editor, or ABE, because it changes an A-T pair to a G-C pair.\\n\\nNearly half of the thousands of diseases caused by single-letter mistakes could be corrected by making this type of change.\\n\\nProgeria is one of those diseases.\\n\\nLeslie Gordon, a pediatric researcher at the Alpert Medical School of Brown University, and a co-author on the new paper, has been trying to effectively treat progeria since her son Sam Berns was diagnosed with the condition at age 2 in 1998. He died in 2014.\\n\\nThere are 19 people in the USA and about 400 worldwide with progeria, which is also called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.\\n\\nIn November, the Food and Drug Administration approved the first treatment for the disease, Zokinvy (lonafarnib), from a class of drugs usually used to treat cancer. A 13-year study showed the drug can provide an extra 2.5 years of life for a child with progeria – an improvement but far from a cure.\\n\\nIt's sort of a beacon that says we really can help these kids, says Gordon, who co-founded the Progeria Research Foundation and serves as its volunteer Medical Director.\\n\\nGene editing offers the prospect of even more improvement, because it addresses the underlying cause of the disease, she says.\\n\\nThe progeria mice used in the study were specially developed to have the same gene that's mutated in humans. That work was led by Dr. Francis Collins, the head of the National Institutes of Health and a co-author on the paper.\\n\\nThe fast-moving mice treated with the base editor were in that second plastic tub. They were healthier, much more active and lived a median of 510 days, compared with 215 days for the mice with progeria. That's the cusp of old age, Liu says.\\n\\nThe results were much better than we expected, Liu says.\\n\\nThe mice that received the one-time treatment with the gene editor when they were 14 days old fared better than those treated at 3 days old. The gene editor was delivered by a virus modified to be harmless, though it can cause liver problems in mice.\\n\\nLiu, whose lab developed a C-to-T base editor that can correct 14% of all single-letter gene mutations, is working to address the remaining types of tiny genetic errors.\\n\\nSeveral more years of research will be needed before the technique can be tested in children with the disease, including safety studies and testing in monkeys.\\n\\nThere's more to be done, Gordon says. This is the initial big, beautiful hit on those disease features in the animal model. That's very important.\\n\\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com\\n\\nHealth and patient safety coverage at USA TODAY is made possible in part by a grant from the Masimo Foundation for Ethics, Innovation and Competition in Healthcare.

Qasem Soleimani's killing\\n\\nThe attack on the compound involved indirect and small arms fire. After an initial penetration of the perimeter, Kenya Defense Forces and U.S. Africa Command repelled the al-Shabaab attack, said the AFRICOM statement. Reports indicate that six contractor-operated civilian aircraft were damaged to some degree. Manda Bay Airfield is utilized by U.S. forces whose missions include providing training to our African partners, responding to crises, and protecting U.S. interests in this strategically important area.\\n\\nAl-Shabab claimed that there were 17 U.S. casualties, nine Kenyan soldiers killed and seven aircraft destroyed. The U.S. Africa Command dismissed the al-Shabab claims as exaggerated and said U.S. and Kenyan forces repelled the attack.\\n\\nKenya is a key base for fighting al-Shabab, one of the world's most resilient extremist organizations. A large plume of black smoke rose above the airfield Sunday and residents said a car bomb had exploded. Lamu county commissioner Irungu Macharia told The Associated Press that five suspects were arrested and were being interrogated.\\n\\nAn internal Kenyan police report seen by the AP said two fixed-wing aircraft, a U.S. Cessna and a Kenyan one, were destroyed along with two U.S. helicopters and multiple U.S. vehicles at the Manda Bay military airstrip. The report said explosions were heard at around 5:30 a.m. from the direction of the airstrip. The scene, now secured, indicated that al-Shabab likely entered to conduct targeted attacks, the report said.\\n\\nThe U.S. military said only that initial reports reflect damage to infrastructure and equipment. The Kenya Civil Aviation Authority said the airstrip was closed for all operations.\\n\\nThe military's Camp Simba in Lamu county, established more than a decade ago, has under 100 U.S. personnel, according to Pentagon figures. U.S. forces at the adjoining Manda Bay airfield train and give counterterror support to East African partners. A U.S. flag-raising at the camp in August signaled its change from tactical to enduring operations, the Air Force said at the time.\\n\\nAccording to another internal Kenyan police report seen by the AP, dated Friday, a villager that day said he had spotted 11 suspected al-Shabab members entering Lamu's Boni forest, which the extremists have used as a hideout. The report said Kenyan authorities didn't find them.\\n\\nAl-Shabab has launched a number of attacks inside Kenya, including against civilian targets such as buses, schools and shopping malls. The group has been the target of a growing number of U.S. airstrikes inside Somalia during President Donald Trump's administration.\\n\\nBe on alert:Department of Homeland Security sends out new terrorism threat bulletin in wake of Soleimani killing\\n\\nThe latest attack comes just over a week after an al-Shabab truck bomb in Somalia's capital killed at least 79 people and U.S. airstrikes killed seven al-Shabab fighters in response.\\n\\nLast year, al-Shabab attacked a U.S. military base inside Somalia, Baledogle, that is used to launch drone strikes but reportedly failed to make their way inside. The extremist group also has carried out multiple attacks against Kenyan troops in the past in retaliation for Kenya sending troops to Somalia to fight it.\\n\\nThis attack marks a significant escalation of al-Shabab's campaign of attacks inside Kenya, said analyst Andrew Franklin, a former U.S. Marine and longtime Kenya resident.\\n\\nLaunching a deliberate assault of this type against a well-defended permanent base occupied by (Kenya Defence Forces), contractors and U.S. military personnel required a great deal of planning, rehearsals, logistics and operational capability, he said. Previous attacks against security forces have mainly been ambushes on Kenyan army or police patrols.\\n\\nThe early Sunday attack comes days after a U.S. airstrike killed Iran's top military commander and Iran vowed retaliation, but al-Shabab is a Sunni Muslim group and there is no sign of links to Shiite Iran or proxies.\\n\\nNo, this attack was no way related to that incident in the Middle East, an al-Shabab spokesman told the AP on condition of anonymity for security reasons."}

For one, these communities are often within commuting distance of a major metropolitan area. This is no coincidence, as close proximity to a major city provides residents with access to more job opportunities, which in turn can help lower unemployment and improve financial security.\\n\\nThe best cities to live in include ones just outside of Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City, Oklahoma City, Pittsburgh and Washington.\\n\\n1. Valley, Alabama\\n\\n• Population: 9,439\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: -0.8 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $82,900\\n\\n• Median household income: $39,387\\n\\nThe majority of the cities on this list are relatively wealthy. Valley, Alabama, is an exception. The typical household in Valley earns just $39,387 a year, about $5,000 less than the typical Alabama household. Still, serious financial hardship is less common in Valley than in Alabama as a whole as 15.7 percent of area residents live below the poverty line, well below the 18.4 percent state poverty rate. Valley residents also benefit from a low cost of living as goods and services are about 6 percent less expensive in the city than they are nationwide on average.\\n\\nValley is a pilot city for the Alabama Communities of Excellence program, a non-profit that partners with governments, businesses, and universities to prepare participating communities for a more vibrant future.\\n\\n2. Ketchikan, Alaska\\n\\n• Population: 8,189\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +2.3 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $232,500\\n\\n• Median household income: $53,937\\n\\nHealth outcomes are an important factor in the overall quality of life in a given area. In Ketchikan, Alaska, the mortality rate of people admitted to the hospital is 12.2 per 100,000 hospital admissions within 30 days. That figure is the lowest of any major metropolitan area in the state. Ketchikan is the only metro area in Alaska with a mortality rate lower than the U.S. mortality rate of 12.9 per 100,000.\\n\\nThanks to its scenery along the southeastern coast of Alaska and proximity to the continental United States, Ketchikan is a popular tourist destination, especially on cruises. Though much of Alaska is isolated and rural, Ketchikan offers residents and visitors access to many more entertainment options than most parts of the state – which can be important during the long, dark winters. Ketchikan has more bars, restaurants, and movie theaters than almost anywhere else in the state.\\n\\n3. Paradise Valley, Arizona\\n\\n• Population: 13,833\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +5.6 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $1,332,600\\n\\n• Median household income: $173,487\\n\\nMost houses in Paradise Valley, Arizona, are worth over $1.3 million, more than seven times the U.S. median home value. Paradise Valley residents are able to afford such expensive houses because of their relatively high incomes. The typical household in the city earns $173,487 a year, one of the highest median household incomes in the country.\\n\\nParadise Valley lives up to its name as a popular destination to relax. The town is home to several resorts and a number of golf courses. Located just north of Phoenix and Scottsdale, it is also known for its high-end dining and nightlife.\\n\\n4. Batesville, Arkansas\\n\\n• Population: 10,579\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +4.5 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $120,400\\n\\n• Median household income: $42,143\\n\\nBatesville, Arkansas, ranks among the best U.S. cities to live largely due to its affordability and community attractions and amenities. Most homeowners in Batesville pay less than $1,000 a year in property taxes, less than half the amount the typical American homeowner pays. Overall annual housing costs typically come to about $7,500 a year, roughly $4,600 less than the median costs nationwide. Goods and services are 16 percent less expensive on average in Batesville than they are nationwide.\\n\\nWith roots as far back as 1804, Batesville is the second oldest city in Arkansas. The city, which avoided destruction in the Civil War, has a number of historic buildings and sites. There are attractions in the area for nearly every taste and preference, including antique stores, art galleries, an annual film festival, and the Batesville Motor Speedway.\\n\\n5. Palos Verdes Estates, California\\n\\n• Population: 13,582\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +1.3 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $1,609,500\\n\\n• Median household income: $200,766\\n\\nLocated along the Pacific Coast less than 30 miles from Los Angeles, Palos Verdes Estates is the best place in California to live. One of the wealthiest neighborhoods in the country, the typical household earns over $200,000 a year, more than triple the national median household income of $55,322. Crime is virtually unheard of in Palos Verdes Estates as its violent crime rate of 22 incidents per 100,000 people is a small fraction of the national rate of 383 per 100,000.\\n\\nThe high ranking may not come as a surprise to those familiar with it, as it is a master-planned city, designed by the Olmsted Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted – architect of New York City's Central Park and the Stanford University campus.\\n\\n6. Frederick, Colorado\\n\\n• Population: 10,791\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +32.2 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $261,500\\n\\n• Median household income: $90,321\\n\\nFrederick, a small town about a half hour north of Denver, ranks as Colorado's best city to live in. The town boasts a number of amenities that make it an attractive place to live, including a museum, a golf course, over 20 community parks, 25 skiing areas in driving distance, and over 300 sunny days a year.\\n\\nLike many communities on this list, Frederick is relatively affluent and fast growing. The typical area household earns $90,321 a year, about $27,800 more than the median income across Colorado as a whole. Additionally, in the last five years, the number of people living in Frederick climbed 32.2 percent. For reference, the U.S. population grew by just 3.9 percent over the same period.\\n\\n7. Darien, Connecticut\\n\\n• Population: 21,519\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +4.6 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $1,248,200\\n\\n• Median household income: $208,125\\n\\nDarien, Connecticut is home to one of the wealthiest and best educated populations in the country. Well over half of all households in Darien earn at least $200,000 a year and about four out of five adults in Darien have a bachelor's degree or higher. Nationwide, fewer than one in three adults have a bachelor's degree. A high median income is bolstered not only by high educational attainment, but also by a strong job market. Just 3.6 percent of workers in Darien were unemployed in 2017, below the 4.7 percent state and 4.4 percent national 2017 unemployment rates.\\n\\nDarien is also one of the safest communities in the country. There were just 14 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2017, a fraction of the 383 violent crimes per 100,000 people nationwide.\\n\\n8. Middletown, Delaware\\n\\n• Population: 20,045\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +13.8 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $274,400\\n\\n• Median household income: $87,250\\n\\nMiddletown ranks as the best community in Delaware to live in. The town boasts several public parks with a range of amenities, including tennis and basketball courts, soccer and baseball fields, pavilions, a track, and a pool. A relatively affluent area, Middletown has a median income of $87,250, about $26,200 more than the median income in Delaware as a whole. Home values are also about 18 percent higher than the average across the state and over half of all homes in Middletown are worth over a quarter-million dollars.\\n\\nLike many of the cities and towns on this list, Middletown is growing rapidly. In the last five years, Middletown's population climbed 13.8 percent.\\n\\n9. Pinecrest, Florida\\n\\n• Population: 19,272\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +5.2 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $840,900\\n\\n• Median household income: $130,900\\n\\nPinecrest is by far the wealthiest place in Florida, and one of the wealthiest in the entire country. With a median household income of $130,900, most Pinecrest households earn more than double what the typical Florida household earns, which is $48,900. Partially because of the area's relatively high income, the typical home in Pinecrest costs more than $840,000 – more than four times the median Florida home.\\n\\nA Miami suburb just off Biscayne Bay, Pinecrest is also one of the best educated areas of the state. Among adults 25 and older, 61.7 percent have at least a bachelor's degree. Statewide, just 27.9 percent of adults finished college.\\n\\n10. Milton, Georgia\\n\\n• Population: 36,755\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +19.1 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $475,300\\n\\n• Median household income: $109,784\\n\\nA planned community incorporated in 2006, Milton is one of the most rapidly growing cities in Georgia. Now home to nearly 37,000 people, Milton's population more than doubled since 2009 and is projected to reach 43,000 by 2030. In commuting distance of Atlanta, many Milton residents likely commute to high paying jobs in the state's largest city. The typical household in Milton earns $109,784 a year, more than double the median income of $51,037 across the state as a whole. Similarly, Milton's poverty rate of 5.5 percent is less than a third of the 17.8 percent statewide poverty rate.\\n\\nMilton is also a safe city. There were just 23 violent crimes for every 100,000 residents in 2017, a fraction of the 383 per 100,000 national rate.\\n\\n11. Urban Honolulu, Hawaii\\n\\n• Population: 349,597\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +4.3 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $601,500\\n\\n• Median household income: $63,361\\n\\nEducation can be an important factor in the health and well being of a population. In addition to being more financial stable, college graduates tend to live longer and healthier lives than those who did not obtain at least a bachelor's degree. A high level of education helps make Urban Honolulu the best city to live in Hawaii. Among Honolulu adults, 36 percent have at least a bachelor's degree, the highest rate in Hawaii.\\n\\nLong commutes by car can have a negative effect on physical and mental health. Honolulu residents utilize alternative methods of getting to and from work. Roughly one in every eight residents takes public transportation to work, while many others walk or ride their bicycles. Altogether, 22.9 percent of commuters do not drive themselves to their jobs, over five times more than the next closest city in Hawaii.\\n\\n12. Hailey, Idaho\\n\\n• Population: 8,058\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +2.6 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $266,500\\n\\n• Median household income: $56,522\\n\\nHailey is situated in Idaho's Wood River Valley in the Rocky Mountains. The city is surrounded by public land and forests where residents and visitors can hike, bike, ski, fish, and horseback ride, and is a short drive from Ketchum and Sun Valley, two resort towns.\\n\\nQuality of life for residents is boosted by lower than average crime, poverty, and unemployment rates. While the median household income of $56,522 in Hailey is only about $1,000 higher than the national median income, a dollar goes further in Hailey than in much of the rest of the country. Goods and services are about 4 percent less expensive than they are nationwide on average.\\n\\n13. Winnetka, Illinois\\n\\n• Population: 12,437\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +2.3 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $989,600\\n\\n• Median household income: $207,857\\n\\nWinnetka is a small village that sits on the shores of Lake Michigan about 15 miles north of downtown Chicago. One of the wealthiest cities in the state, the typical Winnetka household earns $207,857 a year. Winnetka residents working in Chicago have options when it comes to transit, as over one quarter of commuters use public transportation – an alternative most Americans do not have.\\n\\nIn the village, downtown shops were described by the Chicago Tribune in 2012 as reminiscent of the Hamptons on Long Island in New York, without the celebrities. Winnetka boasts four beaches, a boat launch, several parks, a tennis club, a golf course, an ice rink, and forest preserve areas, all open to the public.\\n\\n14. Jasper, Indiana\\n\\n• Population: 15,790\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +6.6 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $148,200\\n\\n• Median household income: $55,209\\n\\nJasper is one of the most affordable places to live in Indiana. The cost of living in the city is just 83.6 percent of what the typical American pays. The median household income in Jasper of $55,209 is higher than Indiana's median of $50,433. The combination of relatively high income and low costs, as compared to the rest of the state, makes Jasper residents more able to afford homes compared to those in most other areas of Indiana. The median home price in Jasper is $148,200, compared to Indiana's median home price of $126,500.\\n\\nJasper residents are much less likely to struggle with money than the average Indiana resident. Statewide, 15 percent of Indiana residents live in poverty. In Jasper, the poverty rate is less than half that, at 7.1 percent.\\n\\n15. Le Mars, Iowa\\n\\n• Population: 9,826\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +1.0 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $139,400\\n\\n• Median household income: $56,851\\n\\nLe Mars, Iowa, is among the most affordable cities in the United States. Goods and services in the city cost about 15 percent less on average than they do nationwide. Housing is particularly inexpensive, with the typical household spending $8,124 a year, about $4,000 less than the average annual housing cost nationwide.\\n\\nThe city also has its share of attractions. Home to a Blue Bunny ice cream manufacturing plant, Le Mars churns out more ice cream from a single company than any other city, earning the nickname The Ice Cream Capital of the World. The city and surrounding area also boast a history museum, an art museum, a golf course, a campground, and of course, an ice cream museum.\\n\\n16. McPherson, Kansas\\n\\n• Population: 13,212\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +0.0 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $135,800\\n\\n• Median household income: $54,057\\n\\nThe median household income in McPherson, Kansas of $54,057 a year is just below the national median of $55,322. However, a dollar goes a long way in McPherson as goods and services are 14 percent less expensive than they are on average nationwide. Indeed, extreme financial hardship is relatively rare in the city. Just 7.3 percent of residents live in poverty compared to 13.3 percent of the Kansas population.\\n\\nMcPherson residents also have many options when it comes to entertainment and recreation. The city has a far greater than typical concentration of restaurants, fitness centers, museums, golf courses, and movie theatres.\\n\\n17. Edgewood, Kentucky\\n\\n• Population: 8,703\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +0.5 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $204,300\\n\\n• Median household income: $89,073\\n\\nThe best city to live in in Kentucky, Edgewood is both wealthy and affordable. The typical household in Edgewood earns $89,073, nearly double the $44,811 median income across the state as a whole. Additionally, goods and services are about 11 percent less expensive in Edgewood than they are nationwide on average.\\n\\nOverall quality of life in Edgewood is boosted by two large public parks and an easily accessible hospital and medical care center within city limits. Located about seven miles south of Cincinnati across the Ohio River, Edgewood – like many cities on this list – is in commuting distance of a major metropolitan area.\\n\\n18. Youngsville, Louisiana\\n\\n• Population: 10,878\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +41.5 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $222,300\\n\\n• Median household income: $94,564\\n\\nYoungsville is a relatively prosperous city in one of the poorest states in the country. The typical Youngsville household earns about $95,000 a year and just 5.5 percent of the population live in poverty. Meanwhile, the typical Louisiana household earns less than $46,000 a year and nearly one in five state residents live in poverty. A dollar also goes farther than typical in Youngsville, as goods and services are about 7 percent less expensive than they are on average nationwide.\\n\\nYoungsville residents have benefitted from a 70 acre, multimillion dollar sports complex since its completion in 2014 and a recreation center that opened in 2016. The facility boasts 10 tennis courts, six soccer fields, five baseball fields, batting cages, a fishing pond, a one-mile walking path, and a playground.\\n\\n19. Bath, Maine\\n\\n• Population: 8,334\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: -3.6 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $164,600\\n\\n• Median household income: $42,275\\n\\nBath is the best place to live in Maine. Bolstered largely by Bath Iron Works, a shipbuilding plant operated by defense giant General Dynamics, the city's job market is relatively strong. Annual unemployment in the city, located near the mouth of the Kennebec River, stands at 3.2 percent, well below the 4.4 percent national rate. Many residents also benefit from the city's walkability as more than one in 10 commuters in Bath walk to work, more than triple the comparable national share. The city is also relatively safe, and also has a high concentration of restaurants, fitness centers, museums, and libraries.\\n\\nDespite its advantages, Bath is one of only a handful of cities on this list to be shrinking in size. Over the last five years, Bath's population declined by 3.6 percent, even as the total U.S. population grew 3.9 percent.\\n\\n20. Bowie, Maryland\\n\\n• Population: 57,633\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +5.7 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $303,900\\n\\n• Median household income: $106,098\\n\\nJust a short commute from Washington, D.C., Bowie, Maryland, provides easy access to high-paying jobs in and around the nation's capital.

Its poverty rate is just 3.3 percent, just one-third of the state's poverty rate.\\n\\nIn order to qualify for these high-level jobs, many of Bowie's residents are well-educated. Nearly half of all adults living in Bowie hold at least a college degree, as compared to 38.4 percent of Maryland residents overall.\\n\\n21. Winchester, Massachusetts\\n\\n• Population: 22,491\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +6.1 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $796,500\\n\\n• Median household income: $149,321\\n\\nWinchester is the best-educated place in Massachusetts and one of the most highly-educated in the entire country. Nearly three-quarters of adults in the area have at least a bachelor's degree. This college degree attainment rate is well above that of Massachusetts, which sits at 41.2 percent.\\n\\nThis high level of education, coupled with the fact that Winchester is just outside of Boston, can make it easier for residents to find jobs. Winchester has the lowest unemployment rate, at 2.7 percent, of anywhere in the state. Massachusetts' unemployment rate is a full percentage point higher. This high level of employment likely helps drive down the poverty rate in Winchester. Just 2.4 percent of Winchester residents live below the poverty line, the lowest share in Massachusetts.\\n\\n22.

Jackson, Wyoming\\n\\n• Population: 10,279\\n\\n• 5 yr. population change: +7.6 percent\\n\\n• Median home value: $573,400\\n\\n• Median household income: $70,517\\n\\nThe resort town of Jackson ranks as the best place to live in Wyoming. Jackson boasts a high concentration of restaurants, bars, museums, and movie theatres, as well as access to Jackson Hole, one of the most famous ski resorts in the United States.\\n\\nIncomes are relatively high in Jackson. The typical area household earns $70,517 a year, about $11,000 more than the typical Wyoming household. Higher incomes are not enough to offset the area's high cost of living, however, as goods and services are about 35 percent more expensive in Jackson than they are on average nationwide. Housing is particularly expensive as most area homes are worth over half a million dollars.\\n\\nMethodology\\n\\nTo identify the best cities to live in every state, 24/7 Wall St. created a weighted index of 26 measures that fall into one of four categories: affordability, economy, quality of life, and community.\\n\\nIn the affordability category, the ratio of the median home value to the median income was given full weight. Cities where the median home value is closer to the median household income were rewarded. Cost of living, as determined by the average cost of goods and services in an area relative to the nation as a whole, was given a full weight. Property taxes are largely levied at the local level, and cities where residents pay more property taxes as a percentage of their home value were penalized. Property taxes were given a one-quarter weighting.\\n\\nIn the economy category, we gave median household income full weighting. The unemployment rate was also given a full weight. We used five-year average unemployment due to lack of comparable annual data at local levels. Two-year employment growth and share of the total working age population with a job were each given a half weight, favoring areas with more and growing jobs opportunities.\\n\\nIn the quality of life category, the poverty rate was given a full weight, penalizing cities where serious financial hardship is more common. The share of the population that struggles to put food on the table either due to low income or distance from a grocery store, known as the food insecurity rate, was given full weight. A city's mortality rate, calculated as the number of people who died while in hospital care per hospital by city, was also given full weight. In cases where city-level data was not available, mortality rates were imputed from county-level data.\\n\\nThe drug overdose mortality rate was given a one-quarter weighting, as was the hospital readmission rate, or the share of those released from the hospital who were readmitted within 30 days. Distance from the center of the city to the nearest hospital was given full weight.\\n\\nMeasures used in the community category include the average travel time to work, which was given full weight.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES — The words still resonate with Lakers controlling owner Jeanie Buss.\\n\\nAs her late father and former Lakers owner Jerry Buss groomed her to have a larger role with the franchise, he counseled Jeanie on how to ease that transition. At some point during those conversations, Jerry Buss offered advice that involved former NBA Commissioner David Stern.\\n\\nMy dad told me that if I ever needed help in the future that David would be somebody I could count on, Jeanie Buss told USA TODAY Sports. He always was there for me.\\n\\nJeanie Buss fought back tears when she said those words. She said her heart is heavy after Stern died at age 77 on Wednesday, three weeks after suffering a brain hemorrhage and then having surgery. Not only did Buss consider Stern a great leader for how he helped the NBA expand its global popularity, she considered Stern to be a wonderful human being and close friend of our family amid his ongoing help publicly and privately.\\n\\nLEBRON JAMES ON DAVID STERN:'He definitely should have something named after him'\\n\\nTRADE BUZZ HEATS UP:Suns included in Timberwolves speculation around Karl-Anthony Towns\\n\\n'DON'T COUNT ME OUT':LeBron James has no plans to slow down at 35\\n\\nOne of the most notable examples: Stern supported Lakers star Magic Johnson after he announced he was HIV-positive on Nov. 7, 1991. Not only did Stern stand near Johnson's side during his press conference. Stern also paved the way for Johnson's return in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game, the 1992 Olympics, the 1992-93 season and the 1995-96 season. Because of Stern's support, Johnson tweeted that we were able to change the world.\\n\\nHe stood up when everybody else didn't know what to do, Buss said of Stern. We were all scared, concerned and uninformed because it was all happening in real time. But he didn't flinch. He stood up and allowed Magic to come back into the league. He squashed the fears of spreading the virus through hugging and shaking hands, He really led us into an area that nobody really knew we were going. But he never blinked an eye. He stayed as a leader.\\n\\nStern once joked that his ideal matchup would be the Lakers vs. the Lakers because of the franchise's star power and global appeal. When Stern became NBA commissioner in 1984, the Lakers were in the midst of their Showtime Era in which they won five championships out of eight Finals appearances with Johnson. The Lakers won eight of their 16 NBA championships during Stern's tenure. Yet during various labor deals, Stern often advocated for revenue sharing and spending restrictions to help small-market teams.\\n\\nThough the Lakers benefited from their large market and deep pocketbooks, the late Jerry Buss often adhered to Stern's vision.\\n\\nHe always praised my father for putting the league's interest ahead of the Lakers' interest, Jeanie Buss said. Sometimes maybe things weren't the best for the Lakers individually. But my dad always sided for what was best for the league overall.\\n\\nThe Lakers hardly agreed with Stern, however, when he nixed a trade in 2011 that would have landed them Chris Paul. The Lakers would've sent Pau Gasol to Houston and Lamar Odom to New Orleans. Serving as the owners' representative for the New Orleans franchise that did not have an actual owner, Stern nixed the deal for basketball reasons. New Orleans eventually dealt Paul to the Los Angeles Clippers, a move that shaped both L.A. franchises dramatically.\\n\\nThe Lakers traded Odom to Dallas amid concerns about his emotional state, while Gasol's role reduced for the next three years. The following season, the Lakers experienced debilitating injuries to Steve Nash and Kobe Bryant as well as Dwight Howard's free agency departure. The Lakers have now missed the playoffs for six consecutive seasons. Once considered one of the NBA's worst franchises, the Clippers made the playoffs for seven consecutive years with Paul, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.\\n\\nI don't want to talk about that right now, Jeanie Buss said of the nixed Paul deal. Maybe in a while, I can talk about that. But I want to savor all the important things and what he was able to create. Without David Stern, we would probably still have 22 teams and be just a niche kind of sport.\\n\\nAnd without David Stern, Buss does not believe she would be the Lakers owner she is today. Her father died a year before Stern's retirement in 2014. But his advice resonated with Buss amid subsequent events that included a front-office shakeup involving her brother (2017) and shuffling through their fifth coach in the last eight years (2019).\\n\\nHe always told me I shouldn't take things so literally and to let things roll off my back, Buss said of Stern. Those words really resonated this past offseason for me: 'Don't get stuck in the negativity or the distraction of the voices. Keep doing what you're doing.' He was always so supportive when I would ask him about that. He always had very clear advice — very succinct and no BS.\\n\\nSo Buss offered her own succinct summation of Stern's legacy.\\n\\nHe really was very clear in what he believed in, Buss said. It was always for a purpose, and not because he had power. He did things for the right reasons.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) — Russell Wilson isn't running like he used to.\\n\\nDue in part to knee and ankle injuries, Seattle's quarterback has been slowed on the ground.\\n\\nThe Detroit Lions , though, are preparing for him to be at his best on his feet Saturday night in an NFC wild-card game .\\n\\nWilson has played in two Super Bowls, winning one, by being one of the NFL's most mobile quarterbacks. He escapes the grasp of defenders, steps up in collapsing pockets and moves out of them to throw to an open receiver. And if has more space to roam than a receiver has separation, he can run up the field on his own.\\n\\nHe just hasn't been running past the line of scrimmage much this season.\\n\\nWilson had career lows in carries (72), yards rushing (259) and yards per rush (3.6) this season after averaging more than 700 yards rushing and 6-plus yards a carry over the previous two years.\\n\\nWhen I was kind of dinged up I had to hang in (the pocket) a little bit longer than sometimes I normally would maybe and I couldn't really extend those plays as much, he said Wednesday. But we were able to do a lot of great things.\\n\\nDetroit isn't buying into Wilson's potential demise as a threat with his feet.\\n\\nI just finished watching a whole bunch of games and he may be judicious with how much he runs, but he's still running and he still can run, Lions coach Jim Caldwell said. I don't see any real changes in that. I know maybe the stats show that, but I'm watching the film and I know what I see. I see a guy that's still very, very capable. He can hurt you inside and outside of the pocket.\\n\\nControlling Wilson's ability to move in, around and out of the pocket might be a little easier due to injuries that have lingered since the season started. Wilson hurt his right ankle in Week 1 and two weeks sprained a ligament in his left knee, an injury that potentially could have knocked him out of the lineup for several weeks.\\n\\nI haven't really ever been injured before, dating back to high school and college so I've been fortunate in that way, Wilson said. The great thing is I've been able to get through all the injuries and be able to get through to this moment. We have a great chance to do what we want to do.\\n\\nDetroit desperately wanted to win the NFC North this season, ending a division title drought that has dragged on since 1993. The Lions set themselves up to do it by winning eight of nine games to hold a two-game lead over the Green Bay Packers with three games to go. The Lions lost the championship and a home playoff game that would've come with it in because they couldn't get to Aaron Rodgers often enough in Sunday night's setback against Green Bay.\\n\\nOn one of four touchdown passes, Rodgers had nearly 9 seconds to throw by spinning to his left away from defensive end Kerry Hyder, setting his feet and dipping his right shoulder to move to the left again on a throw to Geronimo Allison. Rodgers ran by design at least once and at other times because he took advantage of opportunities to move the ball with his feet against the Lions.\\n\\nWe need to hold the edge longer than we did against the Packers, Hyder said. Give A-Rod credit, he did what he does to a lot of teams. Wilson can do the same thing, too. We have to rush him under control. If we get too far up field to get him, he'll step up in the pocket to throw or run.\\n\\nWilson has played through his knee sprain, but Seattle has had to change its offense in its first season retired running back Marshawn Lynch. The Seahawks aren't using Wilson as an option with the zone-read run game, trying to limit the number of times he is exposed to take a hit.\\n\\nHe's not maybe running down the field or for as long runs, but he's still able to buy time, get out of the pocket and create some plays outside of the pocket, Lions defensive coordinator Teryl Austin said. I think that's the most important thing. It's not that he runs for 100 yards a game, but that he can get out of the pocket and still see down the field and still make plays. You still see that.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Larry Lage at http://www.twitter.com/larrylage"}
{"original": "Kaila White\\n\\nThe Arizona Republic\\n\\nPHOENIX — It was hard enough when he was diagnosed with leukemia in June 2014 and went through radiation, chemotherapy, a bone-marrow transplant and eight months of isolation.\\n\\nStephen Dwyer said his first sense of relief came when he was healthy enough to go back to school for his senior year. The second, a month later, came when he began swimming again.\\n\\nBut then there was another blow. Dwyer was the student-body president for the Class of 2016 at Dobson High School in Mesa, Ariz., when school officials refused to let him participate in graduation in May because he was 2.5 credits short of graduation requirements.\\n\\nNow, six months later after finishing an extra semester, he's finally graduated and closing the door on the most challenging 2 ½ years of his life.\\n\\nLast semester was very difficult, Dwyer said Tuesday morning before an appointment at Phoenix Children's Hospital. It's been nice to feel like that chapter's over.\\n\\nStudent leader with leukemia views graduation from afar\\n\\nIsolated once, then again\\n\\nWhen Dwyer returned to school in August 2015, he was on the varsity swim team, a member of the National Honor Society, and earning a 4.2 GPA his first semester back. He added an A-hour class before first period to help catch up, but it wasn't enough.\\n\\nIn May, district officials allowed Dwyer only to usher his classmates onto the football field and then watch from the stands. The incident drew national outrage and debate on his behalf.\\n\\nDwyer said being left out of graduation felt like medical isolation all over again, leaving him alone to watch the fun through social media.\\n\\nI still have a lot of anger, said his mother, Trish Dwyer. I've watched just these awful things happen to him and how he fought and fought and fought, and to have some adults make a decision to isolate him again, it's pretty hard, as a mom, to take.\\n\\nMaking up for lost experiences\\n\\nTo replace the graduation ceremony he lost, family and friends gathered for a small celebration Friday. Arizona Diamondbacks player Paul Goldschmidt spoke at the ceremony.\\n\\nDwyer's bone-marrow donor, James Doyle, flew in from Wisconsin to meet him for the first time.\\n\\nIt was really cool ... it felt like we all knew him, Dwyer said.\\n\\nNow, he and his family are waiting to hear on a district committee's report at the end of the month that could change school policy to allow students like him to participate in graduation.\\n\\nAdvocating for others\\n\\nThe district set up a commencement ceremony task force that has been meeting regularly during the fall semester. Membership included principals, advisers, parents and students. Its recommendation/report to the board should be ready by the end of January, said Mesa Public Schools spokeswoman Helen Hollands on Monday.\\n\\nTrish Dwyer said, We can't change what happened, but I don't want it to happen to anyone else.\\n\\nStudent leader with leukemia barred from graduation walk\\n\\nHer husband, Rick, was on the committee, and she said she hopes the district will change its policy to reviewing students' situations case by case and make exceptions when necessary.\\n\\nI just know a lot of other teens that are not in school right now and some of them aren't student-body presidents, some of them don't have a social-media presence like Stephen did and so I think, 'What's going to happen to those kids?' \\n\\nLooking forward to college\\n\\nStephen Dwyer's road to normalcy has gotten smoother along the way. In August, he was well enough to travel to Hawaii with his family to learn how to surf with the pros, courtesy of Make-A-Wish Arizona.\\n\\nIt was the first time the five of us did something together where we really didn't have a care in the world, Trish Dwyer said. For Rick and I as parents, we saw a lot of healing take place for our three kids.\\n\\nIn October he celebrated, cancer-free, his second rebirthday, the day he received his transplant. In November, he swam in the state swimming and diving championships.\\n\\nAnd in December, just before graduating, he was admitted and earned a scholarship to Lake Forest College, a private liberal-arts college 30 miles north of Chicago.\\n\\nThere he hopes to swim competitively and major in business. One day, he wants to start an organization to help athletes return to competitive health, both physically and emotionally, after setbacks such as cancer.\\n\\nI'm more just looking forward to starting a new chapter, and I think part of that is going to college out of state because I don't have to be the cancer survivor, he said. I can just be who I am, so I'm excited for that.\\n\\nFollow Kaila White on Twitter: @kailawhite"}
{"original": "The past decade was a time of great evolution and change in MMA, much of which even the most diehard fight fans couldn't have seen coming. What will the first year of the next decade bring? Here are 10 bold predictions as the 2020 schedule gets set to kick off.\\n\\nWithout further ado …\\n\\n* * * *\\n\\nKhabib Nurmagomedov retires 30-0\\n\\nUFC lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov has made no secret that he doesn't intend to have an extended career. His body has gone through the ringer due to various injuries over the years.\\n\\nMoreover, Nurmagomedov already has etched out an undeniable legacy. If he can add a few more layers to that, he honestly doesn't have much reason to keep going. If Nurmagomedov can get through what many believe to be his biggest obstacle in Tony Ferguson at UFC 249 in April, then there really aren't many true challenges left for The Eagle. Another win after that would bring his career record to 30-0, and if that fight is a massive one, like his long-desired Georges St-Pierre superfight – or perhaps a Conor McGregor rematch – he pretty much will have done it all.\\n\\nThe only reason for Nurmagomedov to stick around beyond that would be to reap the benefits of being a massive star (far bigger than now), and that money is hard to walk away from. Everyone around Nurmagomedov has long said financial security is of no concern to him, though. If that's true, it elevates the chances of this happening.\\n\\nFour current UFC title reigns end prior to a successful defense\\n\\nOf the UFC's current crop of champions, the following have yet to register a successful title defense during their current reign: Stipe Miocic (heavyweight), Israel Adesanya (middleweight), Alexander Volkanovski (featherweight), Henry Cejudo (bantamweight), Amanda Nunes (women's featherweight), and Zhang Weili (strawweight).\\n\\nMore than half of those title reigns will go down as a flash in the pan.\\n\\nJon Jones' UFC title record gets broken\\n\\nFor more than eight years, Jon Jones' record for youngest champion in UFC history has gone largely unchallenged. Rose Namajunas had an opportunity to break his mark back in December 2014, but she fell short of winning the inaugural strawweight title.\\n\\n2020, however, is the year Jones will be bumped from the history books. 21-year-old Maycee Barber (women's flyweight or strawweight), 22-year-old Edmen Shahbazyan (middleweight) and 22-year-old Song Yadong (bantamweight) are all on the rise, and have already secured ranked positions in their respective weight classes.\\n\\nThey all have challenging paths, but one will claim UFC gold in the next 12 months.\\n\\nA.J. McKee becomes champion and Bellator's biggest star\\n\\nBellator has received criticism for the way its slow-played many of its prospects, but going into 2020, it's difficult to look at A.J. McKee and argue Scott Coker mishandled the development of a young man who will soon be the face of the organization.\\n\\nAt just 24, McKee already holds a plethora of Bellator records. He's validated himself in a big way over his past few fights, advancing to the semifinals of the ongoing Bellator featherweight grand prix. In order to win that tournament (and the featherweight belt), he's going to have to go through some real tough competition, but if he comes out the other end on top – watch out.\\n\\nMcKee has spent his entire career with Bellator. His fighting style is tremendously entertaining to watch, and he has personality for days. If he adds a belt to all that, there's no reason Bellator shouldn't push him to the moon.\\n\\nUFC disbands at least one weight class\\n\\nThe UFC flyweight division and women's featherweight division have been on shaky ground essentially since their inceptions, and 2020 could be the year one – or both of them – finally go.\\n\\nYes, Henry Cejudo saved the flyweight division, and there is a vacant title fight between Joseph Benavidez and Deiveson Figueiredo lined up for Feb. 29, but what comes next? As fun as the weight class can be, there's just not a lot of money-making fights at 125 pounds.\\n\\nIn comparison to the women's featherweight division, though, flyweight is a thriving wonderland. Champion Amanda Nunes hasn't defended her belt since winning it in December 2018, and although the promotion has signed a few new fighters to the weight class, there's still not much going on. Nunes really wants to defend that 145 title for her legacy, but once that happens, the UFC could finally decide to pull the plug.\\n\\n(Next page: PFL's future, UFC vs. Bellator, and more)"}
{"original": "Rory MacDonald's name carries weight.\\n\\nWhile he came up short in his one UFC title challenge, MacDonald made it a memorable war – one that earned him and then-champion Robbie Lawler an extra $50,000 and some damage to their faces. MacDonald beat some of the toughest men in the division, including current champ Tyron Woodley, on his way there.\\n\\nDespite a two-fight skid then, MacDonald was one of the hottest free agents in recent MMA history when he left the UFC. And once Bellator picked him up, he served a reminder of his skills by making easy work of Paul Daley in his debut.\\n\\nAll in all, one wouldn't be wrong in assessing that Bellator champion Douglas Lima (29-6 MMA, 11-2 BMMA) won't have just any challenger in front of him when he meets MacDonald (19-4 MMA, 1-0 BMMA) on Jan. 20 at Bellator 192, which takes place at The Forum in Inglewood, Calif., and airs on Paramount.\\n\\nBut that's not how Lima is going about it.\\n\\nIt's the fight I wanted, Lima told MMAjunkie. He's a tough guy but no big deal. To me, he's an opponent like any other. He's got his strengths. He's been in many wars. But after the first hand lands, he'll change his plan, for sure.\\n\\nHe's very sure of himself. He's saying he's one step ahead of everyone in the division, right? But let him be. He's very confident, and that will change as soon as the first hand connects.\\n\\nOf course, it's not like Lima doesn't bring a few accomplishments of his own into the headliner. The Brazilian titleholder hasn't lost an MMA bout since July 2015, when Andrey Koreshkov put an end to Lima's first Bellator reign with a clear-cut unanimous decision. Since then, Lima has racked up three consecutive wins, including the Bellator 164 knockout over Koreshkov to reclaim the title.\\n\\nSure, momentum helps. But Lima's confidence leading up to the bout finds support in yet another factor. Unlike what happened in the lead-up to his last loss in the cage, which he entered off nightmarish knee injuries, his body is on his side this time.\\n\\nI'm healthy and injury-free, Lima said. And that is a win in itself. Because I've been training since I beat Larkin. I was expecting to fight Rory in November. I was ready, but they scheduled it for January.\\n\\nSo I'm about this: I have no injuries, I've been training nonstop, improving on what I can. Let's go. Let's get this guy, let's knock this guy out to prove to everyone that I belong in the top five.\\n\\nLima is ranked No. 8 in the USA TODAY Sports/MMAjunkie MMA welterweight rankings, while MacDonald sits at No. 3.\\n\\nIn somewhat atypical behavior compared to a lot of his fellow big-time champions, who use their leverage to become more selective and often space out their title defenses, Lima craves activity. In fact, he'd fight four or five times a year if it were up to him.\\n\\nStill, despite his desire, Lima hasn't fought since last June, when he spoiled UFC vet Lorenz Larkin's Bellator debut with an unanimous decision to retain the 170-pound belt.\\n\\nI had a surgery early (last year), but after that I was fine, Lima said. If it were up to me, I'd have fought in November.\\n\\nThat ended up not being too much of a hassle; Lima ultimately managed to stay healthy and at least gets to headline a big card a couple of weeks from now. But he's hoping for a different 2018.\\n\\nI want to fight three or four times, Lima said.\\n\\nFor more on Bellator 192, check out the MMA Rumors section of the site."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The depth scoring that has been missing most of the season for the San Jose Sharks finally showed up in a big way.\\n\\nTomas Hertl scored twice and Matt Nieto, Melker Karlsson and Joonas Donskoi also snapped goal-scoring droughts to help the Sharks beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 7-0 Saturday for their most lopsided shutout since 2001.\\n\\nIt has certainly been lacking, said Tommy Wingels, who assisted on the goals by Nieto and Donskoi for his second multipoint game of the season. There's a lot of prideful guys in here and guys that think they can do more. There's a lot of guys, myself included, who need to do more. That's the only way this team is going to have success.\\n\\nBrent Burns started a four-goal, second-period outburst with a highlight-reel move and Joe Pavelski also scored to help the Sharks end a lackluster homestand on a bright note. San Jose went 2-3 during a two-week stretch at the Shark Tank and has the worst home record in the league at 6-12-0.\\n\\nToronto Maple Leafs at San Jose Sharks\\n\\nMartin Jones made 28 saves for his fourth shutout of the season and San Jose won its seventh straight against Toronto. The Sharks' last 7-0 win was over Chicago on Feb. 14, 2001.\\n\\nCan't ask for much more, said defenseman Justin Braun, who had a career-high three assists. Scoring, goalie played great. It was one of those games that you draw up, and it works out that way.\\n\\nJonathan Bernier made 24 saves for the Maple Leafs and Toronto lost the final two games of its three-game California swing. Bernier had allowed just three goals in winning his past three starts before struggling against San Jose.\\n\\nThe way we got beat tonight I don't know how you want me to explain it, defenseman Dion Phaneuf said. We got beat handily in their building. We started out fine. I thought we were skating. They seemed to turn the tide in the second period and we couldn't respond.\\n\\nIt started with Burns' impressive individual effort. He passed himself the puck at center ice and then skated by Phaneuf in the Toronto zone before beating Bernier high to the glove side for his 17th goal.\\n\\nIt looked as if Toronto had a chance to get even on the power play, but a bad change did the Maple Leafs in. Burns cleared the puck from the defensive zone and the Leafs started to change thinking the puck would go back to Bernier.\\n\\nBut the puck stopped halfway into the Toronto zone along the boards. Tommy Wingels retrieved it and fed Nieto for the easy tap-in goal that made it 2-0.\\n\\nSharks' Brent Burns dangles, dekes Leafs on way to gorgeous goal\\n\\nWe should have changed earlier instead of trying to milk it one more time and they caught us, coach Mike Babcock said. Until then, I thought we were still good. We got off kilter and they came at us.\\n\\nHertl then set up Pavelski from behind the net for the third goal and knocked in a rebound of Justin Braun's point shot later in the period to make it 4-0 and match San Jose's highest-scoring period of the season. The Sharks also scored four times in the third in a 5-3 win at Columbus on Nov. 22, with the final goal coming into an empty net.\\n\\nThe Sharks turned it into a laugher in the third with goals from Karlsson, Donskoi and Hertl.

{"original": "ALBANY, N.Y. – On Wednesday morning, Sen. Chuck Schumer declared Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock as the winners of the Georgia runoff after both candidates claimed victory in the Senate races. Media outlets also named Warnock the victor, while most outlets deemed Ossoff's race too close to call.\\n\\nIf Ossoff wins, it would make Schumer, a Brooklyn native who started his political career at age 23 in the state assembly, the first Jewish Senate majority leader and the first from New York. This at a time when neo-Nazis have been charged in terrorism plots nearing the election and attack ads against Ossoff were called anti-Semitic.\\n\\nIt feels like a brand new day. For the first time in six years, Democrats will operate a majority in the United States Senate – and that will be very good for the American people, Schumer said in a statement.\\n\\nIf Schumer, 70, becomes majority leader, it would be no smooth ride. Even if Democrats are the winners of the Georgia seats, it will be a 50-50 split with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote.\\n\\nAnd Schumer would have to balance the political ideologies in his own party between moderates and liberals as Democrats would be emboldened if they can control the House, the presidency and the Senate.\\n\\nBut Schumer has long operated as a moderate Democrat while trying to stay ahead of the progressive political winds within his own party in New York and the nation.\\n\\nEven in New York, he may be pushed left: progressive firebrand Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been rumored as a potential primary challenger to Schumer in 2020, potentially setting up a heavyweight matchup of two national Democratic stars. Ocasio-Cortez has not given an indication she's considering a run.\\n\\nI'm still very much in a place where I'm trying to decide what is the most effective thing I can do to help our Congress, our (political) process, and our country actually address the issues of climate change, health care, wage inequality, etc., she told the site Punchbowl on Jan. 4.\\n\\nFor now, though, Schumer will look to forge a coalition with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and President-elect Joe Biden, whom he long served within the chamber.\\n\\nHe may also need to build support for any initiatives with Republicans in the Senate and their leader Mitch McConnell, who will still be a major force.\\n\\nThat agenda will likely include broader benefits for unemployed Americans due to the COVID-19 pandemic, an overhaul of how the pandemic and the vaccine distribution is handled and a larger economic agenda.\\n\\nAmerica is experiencing one of the greatest crises we have ever faced, and the Senate Democratic Majority is committed to delivering the bold change and help Americans need and demand.

{"original": "PHILADELPHIA – Doug Pederson apparently is in playoff mode, so his answers at his press conference Tuesday were mostly curt and without elaboration.\\n\\nIn other words, it was straight out of Bill Belichick.\\n\\nThere's nothing wrong with what a coach reveals or doesn't reveal to the media ... unless Pederson is feeling the heat from a team that is trying to find a way to win a playoff game with Nick Foles as the quarterback after two straight games in which Foles struggled against two non-playoff teams.\\n\\nBelichick can get away with it because he has won five Super Bowls coaching the Patriots, and is a favorite for another this season with a Hall of Fame quarterback in Tom Brady. So it comes across as authoritative when Belichick famously says, We're on to Cincinnati, like he did a few years ago.\\n\\nWith Pederson, it sounds like defensiveness as the Eagles prepare for their Divisional Round playoff game against the Atlanta Falcons this Saturday at Lincoln Financial Field.\\n\\nSo what was Pederson's message to Foles and the team heading into this week?\\n\\nListen, we have a great opportunity, Pederson said. Let's go be Nick. Let's go play. Let's go execute the offense. And to the team: same thing. We have a great opportunity. Backs against the wall. Let's come out swinging and let's see what happens.\\n\\nIs there a confidence issue with Foles, who is 23 of 49 for 202 yards the last two games with a touchdown and two interceptions?\\n\\nI don't think there's a confidence issue, no, Pederson said.\\n\\nSure, Pederson didn't want to answer that kind of question. But it doesn't exactly sound like a vote of confidence, either, when he answers that way.\\n\\nNaturally, Foles was asked the same question about his confidence and what it means to be Nick.\\n\\nI think me, it's just going out there and staying in the zone and just trusting my instinct, he said. I think that's the big thing. I've played this game a long time ... When I play my best and I'm comfortable, I just go out there and play. That's the big message, and that's being me on the playing field.\\n\\nThe players have said Pederson is still his same, stoic self in front of them. And that's the most important thing.\\n\\nStill, it was somewhat odd when Pederson refused to divulge to the media who wouldn't be practicing Tuesday, something he always has done in the past.\\n\\nInstead, he replied: I'm going to have an injury report at the end of the day. I'll let you know.\\n\\nAgain, no big deal. And when was the last time Belichick divulged player injuries? Probably never.\\n\\nEAGLES: Falcons are favored, and players don't mind\\n\\nNFL: Ex-UD star Matt Nagy named Bears head coach\\n\\nBut why change now? And besides, the first part of practice is open to the media and it's easy enough to see who's practicing and who isn't. That was the case Tuesday as defensive end Brandon Graham (ankle) and left tackle Halapoulivaati Vaitai (knee) both returned to practice, while middle linebacker Dannell Ellerbe sat out with a hamstring injury.\\n\\nWould the Falcons have gotten a competitive advantage by knowing two hours earlier than they did? Hardly. Falcons coach Dan Quinn announced early in the day that star receiver Julio Jones missed practice, mostly to rest.\\n\\nAnd on and on it went.\\n\\nWill rookie cornerback Sidney Jones have a role in the game?\\n\\nWe'll work today and see what happens, Pederson replied.\\n\\nWhat about relying on the running game against the Falcons after the Eagles rushed for 208 yards against them in the Eagles' 24-15 win during the 2016 season?\\n\\nWell, I'm not going to, obviously, give you my game plan today, Pederson said. But that worked for us last year, obviously, a different year and a different set of circumstances. Is it something to build off of? Yeah. We can look at it and learn from it, for sure.\\n\\nOK, that was something. And Pederson later said that the bye last weekend helped his running backs Jay Ajayi and LeGarrette Blount rest up and get ready for the Falcons defense.\\n\\nYeah, we're going to have to rely on them, obviously, Pederson said.\\n\\nYes, that is obvious, if for no other reason than to ease the burden on Foles. The Falcons certainly know that. They also know that at some point, Foles is going to have to make a play for the Eagles to win.\\n\\nCarson Wentz was able to do that until a torn ACL ended his season on Dec. 10. Wentz's ability to escape pressure and complete passes fueled the Eagles' confidence, and was a big reason why they were 11-2 and the highest scoring team in the NFL when he was hurt.\\n\\nSo perhaps this was Pederson's most revealing answer, when he was asked whether he wonders how his younger players will react to their first playoff experience.\\n\\nOh yeah, you always wonder, he said. Do you wonder? There's going to be wonder. I'm going to tell you, these guys are football players. I think sometimes the outside, whether it be the media or the fans, can make it bigger than it really is.\\n\\nWhen you boil it down, it's football at the end of the day. Just go do your job. Do what you've been coached to do all week long. And give it your best effort on Saturday. If it's good enough, great. If it's not, you know, then we focus on next season.\\n\\nBelichick couldn't have said it better himself.\\n\\nPederson excited for Nagy\\n\\nPederson said he is happy for Matt Nagy, the former University of Delaware quarterback who was named the Bears' head coach on Monday. Pederson worked with Nagy for several years. Nagy started with the Eagles in 2009 as a coaching intern, the same year Pederson began as offensive quality control coach. Pederson was the Eagles' QB coach in 2011-12, with Nagy as the offensive quality control coach. Then when both went with Andy Reid to Kansas City, Pederson became the offensive coordinator and Nagy the QB coach. Nagy succeeded Pederson as co-offensive coordinator in 2016 when Pederson became the Eagles head cocach.\\n\\nI wished him congratulations, obviously, yesterday, Pederson said. It's a great opportunity for him. It's great for the Chicago Bears, and I'm excited to watch his career take off.\\n\\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nThere will be a familiar feel to the NFL playoffs next weekend: Every divisional-round game will be a rematch from the regular season, the first time that's happened in six years.\\n\\nIn the NFC, it's the Green Bay Packers at the Dallas Cowboys, and the Seattle Seahawks at Atlanta. In the AFC, it's the Houston Texans playing as huge underdogs at New England, and the Pittsburgh Steelers at Kansas City.\\n\\nThe first times around, Dallas beat Green Bay 30-16 in Week 6 , Seattle beat Atlanta 26-24 in Week 6 , New England beat Houston 27-0 in Week 3 with Jacoby Brissett at quarterback, and Pittsburgh beat Kansas City 43-14 in Week 4 .\\n\\nNot that those results necessarily mean much now, especially because none was more recent than October.\\n\\nThe Steelers know how much things can change.\\n\\nAfter all, they lost to the Dolphins by 15 points during the regular season, then advanced Sunday with a 30-12 victory over Miami in the wild-card round, their eighth victory in a row.\\n\\nWe're not trying to settle vendettas and things of that nature. They beat us fair and square in Week 6. You tip your cap to them for that performance, Pittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin said. Today was today. And it's going to be the same going forward. What happened during the regular season is of little importance.\\n\\nHere's a closer look at next weekend, when each game features one starting QB who has won the Super Bowl (Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers, Seattle's Russell Wilson, New England's Tom Brady, Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger):\\n\\nPACKERS at COWBOYS, Sunday, 4:40 p.m. EST, Fox (opening line: Cowboys, -4)\\n\\nThat loss to Dallas nearly three months ago was part of Green Bay's 4-6 start. But ever since Rodgers spoke about trying to run the table, NFC North champion Green Bay has won seven consecutive games, including 38-13 over the New York Giants in the wild-card round.\\n\\nRodgers has 19 TD passes and zero interceptions during the unbeaten run, but one question now is whether favorite target Jordy Nelson, hurt against New York, will be available.\\n\\nGreen Bay's pass defense, shaky and beset by injuries, might not have an easy time against Dallas QB Dak Prescott, a preternaturally poised rookie who threw for three TDs in the October matchup. The No. 1-seeded Cowboys' other first-year sensation, Ezekiel Elliott, gained 157 yards in his first game against the NFL's eighth-best run defense.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSEAHAWKS at FALCONS, Saturday, 4:35 p.m. EST, Fox (opening line: Falcons, -4)\\n\\nAll-Pro quarterback Matt Ryan, a leading MVP contender, and wideout Julio Jones put up NFC South champion Atlanta's high-powered offense against NFC West champion Seattle's Legion of Boom defense, which is missing injured safety Earl Thomas but still features Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor.\\n\\nIn the first meeting, Ryan threw for three TDs, while Jones finished with seven catches for 139 yards and a score. But most memorable was an incompletion on fourth down with 90 seconds left, when Sherman grabbed Jones' arm on a deep pass. Definitely a 1-on-1 matchup to keep an eye on this time.\\n\\nAlso worth monitoring: How Atlanta's so-so defense deals with Seattle's offense, which seemed reborn as Thomas Rawls ran for 161 yards in a 26-6 win over Detroit in the wild-card round. Falcons head coach Dan Quinn used to be Seattle's defensive coordinator.\\n\\nSuch a hard-nosed, tough coach, and his team embodies him out there, Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett said. It's like playing ourselves.\\n\\n___\\n\\nTEXANS at PATRIOTS, Saturday, 8:15 p.m., CBS (opening line: Patriots, -16)\\n\\nNew England is one of the biggest betting favorites in a playoff game, and here's why: Bill Belichick's Patriots have outscored protege Bill O'Brien's Texans by a combined 54-6 in their past two head-to-head games.\\n\\nAs good as Houston's top-ranked defense has been — Jadeveon Clowney's interception set the tone for a 27-14 win over Oakland in the wild-card round — there is a world of difference between facing a rookie QB making his first NFL start (Oakland's Connor Cook) and a three-time Super Bowl MVP (Brady). And Belichick will surely dream up some schemes to bedevil Texans QB Brock Osweiler.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSTEELERS at CHIEFS, Sunday, 1:05 p.m., NBC (opening line: even)\\n\\nWhat might matter and might not: Steelers QB Roethlisberger needed a walking boot after hurting his right foot against Miami. If he's fine next week, it will be fun to watch him, WR Antonio Brown and RB Le'Veon Bell take on Marcus Peters, Eric Berry and the rest of Kansas City's formidable defense. On the other side of the ball, Steelers LB James Harrison and Co. should be able to handle Chiefs QB Alex Smith, but the question is how Pittsburgh's defense and special teams will corral rookie speedster Tyreek Hill.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Sports Writers Tim Booth in Seattle and Will Graves in Pittsburgh contributed to this report.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Howard Fendrich on Twitter at http://twitter.com/HowardFendrich"}

Other posts on Facebook and Twitter, in particular, circulated falsehoods about the attack, using images from unrelated events to suggest a horrifying outcome.\\n\\nIt turned out there were no casualties from the Iranian attack on two Iraqi bases in retaliation for a U.S. strike that killed a top Iranian general.\\n\\nThe barrage of misinformation underscores that despite the pledges and efforts by big tech companies to crack down on falsehoods, fabricated or misleading content remains a significant threat.\\n\\nIs your location on the list?:Macy's is reportedly closing more than two dozen stores.\\n\\nMore store closings:Pier 1 Imports to close up to 450 stores, nearly half of its locations\\n\\nYou have a system where the potential for people to spread misinformation that gets believed on a wide landscape is huge, said Josh Pasek, an associate professor of communication, media and political science at the University of Michigan, who has studied the issue.\\n\\nThe topic of war, long known as a haven for propaganda, is especially ripe for spreading false reports.\\n\\nThis is the type of story that incites an emotional response from people, so it is a prime target for misinformation and disinformation and bad actors, said Katy Byron, editor and manager of MediaWise, a program from the journalism training nonprofit group Poynter that educates youth about how to sort fact from fiction online.\\n\\nSome government officials have misled Americans. Rep. Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., shared a doctored photo appearing to show President Barack Obama shaking hands with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani.\\n\\nThe world is a better place without these guys in power, he tweeted.\\n\\nAfter the photo was flagged as a fabrication, he called reporters dim witted and wrote, No one said this wasn't photoshopped.\\n\\nFalse rumors about the prospect of the draft being reinstated circulated widely among young people on social platforms such as TikTok and Twitter, where users shared videos with the hashtag #WWIII. (The reality is that the draft is extremely unlikely to be reinstated, even in the event of war.)\\n\\nThe U.S. Selective Service System's website temporarily crashed Friday after a surge of traffic following the killing of Iran's Gen. Qasem Soleimani. False information reported online about the draft suggested that gay Americans are exempt and left the impression that felons can't be drafted, according to an analysis by fact-checking site PolitiFact.\\n\\nIt's particularly challenging to fact-check information about war, said Aaron Sharockman, executive director of PolitiFact.\\n\\nIn situations like this, where you have to rely more and more on official government information, it becomes more difficult for us to fact-check, he said. In many cases, we'll be able to help a little less because we're not on the ground and we can't see things with our own eyes.\\n\\nSince he took office, President Donald Trump has made more than 15,400 false or misleading claims, according to The Washington Post's Fact Checker database.\\n\\nThe fact that there's just not a lot of credibility in what this administration says (means) people are searching for what the real story is here, Pasek said. You have something ripe for conspiracy theories, misinformation and the like to spread.\\n\\nThe bottom line: Anyone with a social media account can mislead – and people in power can do it on a grand scale.\\n\\nIt's unlikely to change anytime soon. There are simply too many users of social media for platforms such as Facebook, YouTube and Twitter to monitor or block all misinformation, absent some form of artificial intelligence or outright censorship that poses its own set of challenges.\\n\\nEach outlet has instituted policies to excise certain forms of false information from their platforms, while allowing others. None of it is enough to stamp out falsehoods altogether.\\n\\nWhen assessing the situation, it helps to take a step back and look at how quickly things have changed. In the pre-social media age, journalists, who are trained on source validation and fact authentication, largely controlled the information that people encountered.\\n\\nToday, social media algorithms have become the new gatekeepers for many people. The algorithms filter information, typically presenting material based on a benchmark for engagement predicated on clicks, shares and likes.\\n\\nPaired with the human nature for confirmation bias – our tendency to seek out information that validates preexisting beliefs and ignore disconfirming material – it's a recipe for political polarization and the spread of misinformation.\\n\\nWhat's apparent is information spreads pretty quickly whether it's right or wrong – and seemingly particularly if it's wrong because it has that additional novelty bonus, Pasek said.\\n\\nThe democratic nature of social media, which provides a platform to anyone and everyone, empowers the spread of falsehoods masquerading as insight.\\n\\nAll of a sudden everyone's an expert on Iran, Sharockman said. So you have moments where the publishing platforms – Facebook and Twitter and Reddit – allow anyone to claim expertise on the subject.\\n\\nHere are tips on how to validate information you encounter online:\\n\\nVisit primary sources whenever possible. Do a little digging and seek out the original source of the information to ensure that people aren't misconstruing it online, Byron said.\\n\\nCross-reference information from different sources. Stanford History Education Group's Sam Wineburg, who conducted research for MediaWise on how young people navigate the internet, recommends lateral reading. That means navigating to unrelated sites to authenticate or disprove information from the original source. One tip to get started is to visit sources listed at the bottom of Wikipedia entries.\\n\\nDon't reflexively trust people in authority. Be skeptical. Just because someone has a big blue checkmark next to their name on social media doesn't mean they're an expert on that topic, Byron said, referring to the logo that verifies a user's identity. We always really push people to go to that key question of who's behind the information.\\n\\nBe wary of photos, video and audio. The rising likelihood of fabricated or misleadingly edited video, photos and audio is a source of serious trouble. Known as deepfakes, this technology is enabled by artificial intelligence and will allow people to create content that makes it look like people did things they never did and said things they never said.\\n\\nA lot of people manipulate images for disinformation and negative purposes, Byron said.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.

She transformed her personal health in her 50s, retired in her 60s and, now, in the midst of a pandemic that has disproportionately isolated older adults, the 73-year-old has launched her first business: online workout classes and weight loss support.\\n\\nI wanted to offer the same to other women, said Rawles, who is based in the San Francisco Bay Area. You can still change; it's never too late.\\n\\nRawles said she has long had entrepreneurial aspirations, but she didn't have the confidence or foresight to pursue them.\\n\\nI used to think of aging as a period of decline, Rawles said. For me, so far, the 70s are the most exciting decade I've lived. I have more time because I'm not raising kids and I'm retired, so I have a little bit of economic security. Because of that, it's a time where I can really grow.\\n\\nOver the past several years, the number of women-owned businesses climbed to nearly 13 million — 42% of all U.S. businesses — and grew at double the rate of all U.S. businesses, according to the 2019 State of Women-Owned Business Report, which is based on U.S. census data.\\n\\nAnd researchers found an increase in entrepreneurial activity among older people in the United Kingdom, specifically. When asked why they wanted to set up a business later in life, twice as many women than men said they wanted to realize a long-held ambition, according to the report, published in 2020.\\n\\nFor some, starting a business later in life is a matter of financial necessity. According to a 2018 survey published by SCORE, a mentor network for small businesses, women 65 and older are more likely to do so because they've lost a job or need more income. More than 28% of those surveyed said they became entrepreneurs because they had to.\\n\\nLeigh Estes, 61, consults and coaches women who want to rethink, relaunch or reinvent their lives. Estes, who earned an MBA and worked at JP Morgan and Wells Fargo, said she noticed that women were often expected to offer services for free.\\n\\nThat's something we're sometimes expected to do because we're the nurturing and loving types, Estes said. But as part of a generational shift, we can actually charge for these services — both enriching our lives and our own pocketbooks.\\n\\nAngel Cornelius, 60, started her business making and selling beauty products as a side hustle while still working as a clinic manager at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston. At first, she only intended to make products for herself in her kitchen — she had a hard time finding products that worked for her silver hair. Then her friends started asking to buy her homemade body butters and soaps.\\n\\nFor about 2½ years, Cornelius worked all day, came home to work out and eat dinner and then made beauty products until 2 a.m. She retired at the end of 2017 and then focused solely on her business, Maison 276, which has since been featured in O Magazine and Essence.\\n\\nI consider my age a strength, because I understand the maturing process, what women need, how we want to be spoken to and how we want to be viewed, Cornelius said.\\n\\nCornelius acknowledges that she wouldn't have been able to start a business — one of the hardest things she said she's ever done — while she was raising her two kids.

The group meets monthly to share tips, including how to get a business off the ground, hire lawyers and acquire venture capital.\\n\\nOne member, 76-year-old Ellen Curtis, was a longtime psychiatric nurse based in Los Angeles who recently pivoted to retail. Curtis was doing at-home detoxes for the rich and famous when her doctor told her last year that her blood pressure was too high and encouraged her to consider a career change. Now, Curtis sells upcycled jean jackets and hand-sewn face masks. Eileen Spitalny, a 54-year-old Revel member, runs a bakery in Phoenix. And 52-year-old Kelley Nayo Jahi recently launched her third business in November, a group gift service that offers products from Black and Latino small-business owners.\\n\\nI had three young kids at home, my oldest was just 11 and I was newly divorced when I started my first business, said Nayo Jahi, who is based in Oakland, California.

{"original": "New questions surrounding a controversial study urging people to continue eating red and processed meat are being raised, after the scientific journal that published it issued a correction concerning funding the author received for other research.\\n\\nThe paper, a set of guidelines based on analyses of existing research, suggested adults continue current unprocessed red meat … (and) processed meat consumption.\\n\\nThe conclusion drew an outcry from some medical and nutritional researchers who said the guidelines misrepresented studies that show a connection between eating red and processed meats and adverse health outcomes, such as heart disease, cancer or Type 2 diabetes.\\n\\nBradley Johnston, the study's lead author, and Dr. Christine Laine, the editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine, which published the paper in October, defended the research as an independent and transparent look at existing data.\\n\\nHowever, on Dec. 31, the journal published a correction that Johnston did not disclose grant funding he received from Texas A&M AgriLife Research for other research on saturated and polyunsaturated fats.\\n\\nTexas A&M AgriLife Research is an official state agency that works on agricultural research with private companies and the Texas A&M University system.\\n\\nShould you keep eating red meat? Controversial study says well-known health risks are just bad science\\n\\nThis funding is for work in the field of nutrition and the start of (the) funding period was within the 36-month reporting period required in disclosure forms, the correction said.\\n\\nHolly Shive, a spokesperson for Texas A&M AgriLife, said there is no connection between the study on meat and the study on fats.\\n\\nDr. Johnston is committed to full transparency. It is incorrect to suggest he had any conflicts of interest, Shive said in an email to USA TODAY. As documented in the revised disclosure, no industry funds were used to fund the red and processed meat studies published in the Annals.\\n\\nIn addition to the grant, Johnston accepted a position at Texas A&M AgriLife Research as a professor in the department of nutrition and food science before the paper was published, however he started the job after its publication, Shive said.\\n\\nThe funding for the fats study from AgriLife was provided as part of Dr. Johnston's recruitment, Shive said.\\n\\nIn 2019, Texas A&M AgriLife received $11.4 million for research on beef. Most of the money came from non-sponsored state and federal appropriations, but more than $4 million was noncorporate or corporate sponsored, Texas A&M AgriLife spokesperson Katie Hancock said.\\n\\nDr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, was critical of the connection between an organization receiving funding from beef industry groups and a researcher publishing work on red meat.\\n\\nMore on nutritional studies:Drinking tea regularly may help you live longer and healthier, new study finds\\n\\nBarnard, who advocates for plant-based diets, said in a letter to the Annals editor those ties should have been included in the journal's correction. It mentioned Johnston's funding for the research on fats and past funding from a group affiliated with other food industry companies, including Coca-Cola, Hershey and Kraft Heinz.\\n\\nThe decision to publish the articles in the first place raised major scientific concerns. But the failure to address the ethical issues in publishing regarding conflict of interest aggravates the situation, Barnard wrote.\\n\\nThe content of the Annals article was not changed with the Dec. 31 correction, which Barnard also criticized.\\n\\nThe big theme here is science is supposed to clarify issues, he said. More and more there are scientist being paid for hire to muddy the issues.\\n\\nLaine, the Annals editor, said corrections are not uncommon in medical research and the journal became aware of the Texas A&M AgriLife funding in December.\\n\\nThe grant was from Texas A&M AgriLife institutional funds, not a sponsoring organization, industry or company, she said. The beef industry is not listed as a source of this funding because it was not a source of this funding.\\n\\nWhile the guidelines published in the Annals were never an official statement from a health organization and didn't change existing international recommendations on red and processed meat, others said the conflicting statements were a reminder that diet is complex and personal part of our lives.\\n\\nIf you really want to look at the bottom line, nutrition is more about eating patterns and lifestyle than it is about a single, particular food, Dr. Jeffrey Mechanick, medical director of the Marie-Josée and Henry R. Kravis Center for Cardiovascular Health at Mount Sinai Heart said at the time.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY's Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller"}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nLINCOLN, Neb. (AP) — Nebraska created buzz across the Big Ten and nationally with road wins over Indiana and Maryland, teams that were a combined 23-3 at the time.\\n\\nMake no mistake, a 2-0 start in conference play is a big deal at Nebraska. The program has finished 11th and 12th the last two years, previously won its first two in league play in 2005-06 and less than three weeks ago was beaten at home by Gardner-Webb.\\n\\nWe can't get overconfident, forward Michael Jacobson said Wednesday. I know it's two good wins on the road, but it's only two wins. We have 16 games left in the conference, so there's a lot ahead of us and a lot of work to be done. We have to keep that mindset and that chip on our shoulder.\\n\\nThe challenge is for Nebraska (8-6, 2-0) to carry the momentum to its home court. The Cornhuskers, who host Iowa (9-6, 1-1) on Thursday night and Northwestern (12-3, 1-1) on Sunday, are 25-16 overall and 8-10 in Big Ten games at Pinnacle Bank Arena since 2014-15. They were 15-1 and 8-1 there in 2013-14, the building's inaugural season.\\n\\nWe want to make Pinnacle Bank 'The Vault' like it was year one. We haven't done that as well since, coach Tim Miles said. That's really its own goal, and really we've concentrated on that more than being 2-0 in the league because it's such a long season.\\n\\nGlynn Watson Jr. and Tai Webster have led the Huskers' recent surge. Watson combined for 43 points against Indiana and Maryland and is averaging 13.9 for the season. Webster, a 6.1-point career scorer entering his senior season, scored crucial baskets against Maryland and is averaging a team-leading 17.4 points.\\n\\nJacobson and Ed Morrow Jr. have played with toughness on the inside, and freshman forward Jeriah Horne emerged in the nonconference finale against Southern with 18 points and followed that with 11 against Indiana.\\n\\nThe Huskers are improving offensively since Miles eliminated a significant portion of the playbook in a quality-over-quantity move. They still aren't much to look at, though. They average 14 turnovers, shoot 42 percent overall and 31 percent from 3-point range.\\n\\nBut they've been aggressive rebounding on the offensive end and have held strong defensively. They limited then-No. 16 Indiana to 43-percent shooting and forced 19 turnovers in a 87-83 victory that broke the Hoosiers' 26-game win streak at Assembly Hall. They outscored Maryland 14-0 over the final 6:43 and flummoxed the Terrapins with a 1-3-1 zone defense in a 67-65 win .\\n\\nThe sweep of Indiana and Maryland on the road was more than Miles had hoped for initially.\\n\\nQuite frankly, I told the guys before, 'We've got to get a split. We can get a split.' I was thinking we could beat Maryland. I thought that was a better matchup for us. Then we beat Indiana and I had to change my mind, Miles said.\\n\\nTo keep the good times rolling, Nebraska must end a five-game losing streak to Iowa. The Huskers' biggest task will be defending Peter Jok, who leads the Big Ten with 22.1 points a game, and slowing one of the most up-tempo offenses in the country.\\n\\nThey also must stay level-headed.\\n\\nWhen you have a week like we did, that's one of the biggest things — maybe you get comfortable or stop doing something you did because you think, 'Oh, we're good,'  Jacobson said. We talk about it, and the coaches bring it to our attention if they feel something is a little different, and we do a pretty good job of self-monitoring as well.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: http://collegebasketball.ap.org"}

{"original": "Takeo Spikes\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nSince the November election, attention has been rightfully paid to the role of Black voters — and Black organizers — in flipping Georgia for President-elect Joe Biden. This attention is warranted, and long overdue, but often overlooked is the role of rural Black voters in particular. After decades of political neglect, emboldened rural Georgian voters are turning out in droves and forcing themselves into the political conversation. Rural Black voters played a central role in helping Biden win Georgia, and now have the chance to decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.\\n\\nPeople tend to see Georgia as made up of Atlanta and Not Atlanta, with a lot of Democratic (Black) voters in urban Atlanta and heavily Republican (white) voters in the rural rest of the state — and when people hear rural, they almost always think white. But that's just not what Georgia is like. A third of rural Georgians are people of color and one in four voters outside the Atlanta metro area are Black. In fact, most of the 20 majority-Black counties in Georgia are in rural areas — including Washington County, where I grew up.\\n\\nVictims of suppression and exclusion\\n\\nBeing overlooked and excluded from politics is not new for Black rural Georgians. I saw this firsthand growing up. Politicians ignored us, so we ignored them. They rarely came to our communities or tried to earn our votes. And so many of us didn't vote. People usually wouldn't even talk about it and if they did, the mentality was always: Man, those folks gonna do what they gonna do anyway.\\n\\nGrowing up, we were victims of decades of voter suppression. The legacy of the Jim Crow laws that disenfranchised my grandparents' generation did not fade quickly. In many ways, it was passed on down to my own generation. In small towns especially, there was even a fear of what would happen to you if you did vote. We were conditioned to believe that our votes did not matter and that nothing would ever change. Between the fear and the feeling of hopelessness in voting, many Black rural Georgians didn't vote.\\n\\nDespite this deep history of disenfranchisement, Black rural Georgians delivered the state for Biden. So what has changed?\\n\\nWhile it did not start in 2018, Stacey Abrams' near-win that year showed the country that Georgia is purple, and it showed rural Georgians their political power. Abrams went all across the state, including to rural areas like where I grew up. She showed rural Georgians that they could make a difference and be heard by their leaders. Rural Black voters saw that Georgia was winnable for Democrats and that they could be a part of it.\\n\\nAs a competitor myself, I could understand the urge to fade into the background after a tough loss like that. But Abrams refused. She has returned to these communities, and continued to register and engage rural Georgians.\\n\\nReligion in the runoff:Christianity is on the ballot in the Georgia Senate runoff between Warnock and Loeffler\\n\\nThe 2018 election was transformative for me, not just because of Stacey Abrams' campaign, but because I saw the impact of modern-day voter suppression up close. I went to vote in Mechanicsville, but they only had five voting machines, and one of them broke. We waited three hours to cast our ballots. I knew this was wrong. I wanted to make sure no one in my community — at a time when so many of us finally felt engaged in the system – would be discouraged to come out and vote. I got together with a few other former NFL players, including Warrick Dunn, Adalius Thomas and Alge Crumpler. We served pizzas and water to people waiting to vote. We were doing anything we could to convince them to stay in line. I just remember thinking, I can't let these people go home without voting.\\n\\nFired up to make history again\\n\\nBlack Georgians have come out and said we are sick and tired of being sick and tired. The COVID pandemic only heightened this feeling. Between painful job losses and disproportionate death rates among Black rural Georgians, voters were willing to put everything on the line to vote, even if that meant putting themselves at risk during a pandemic. The same Georgians who grew up fearing what would happen if they cast a ballot, are now scared of what could happen if they don't.\\n\\nRural Black voters are more emboldened than ever. There's a saying that you can't be what you can't see. Well, they no longer need to look far for proof that their votes can make a difference. Just last month they saw up close the role they played in voting President Donald Trump out of office, and now they're fired up to make history again this week. With margins that could be even narrower in the runoff than they were in November, rural Black voters know the power they wield. They know they can decide the election.\\n\\nSenate and Georgia:Georgia, if you're listening, ignore conservatives peddling socialist Senate hallucinations\\n\\nThe new political power of rural Georgia is proof of the strategy of groups like the New Georgia Project and New South Super PAC has worked. If we invest in young people and people of color, and engage them on issues they care about, we can create real enthusiasm and lasting support for Democrats.\\n\\nEspecially in the Central Savannah River area where I grew up, groups like New South are working to grow this electorate. Black voters have long been the most loyal voting bloc for Democrats — 88% backed Biden in Georgia — and the party shouldn't take us for granted. Democrats need to earn our votes and build political power in Black communities year-round, instead of seeing us as targets for last-minute get out the vote efforts.\\n\\nFor the first time, back in my hometown, and in towns like it all across the state, there is a feeling of hope. People I grew up with are feeling empowered. They know that their vote can make a difference, and they are doing everything they can to make sure their voice is heard Jan. 5.\\n\\nTakeo Spikes is a former NFL linebacker and a Georgia native.

{"original": "Jason Hall\\n\\nThe Motley Fool\\n\\nThe oldest Baby Boomers are now in retirement age, while the youngest are in their 50s. Considering that many Baby Boomers don't have substantial retirement savings, Social Security is set to remain a critically important source of income for millions of that generation as they retire over the next couple of decades.\\n\\nHere's a closer look at three important facts that play a big role in how well Social Security will work for you and how much income you'll get. Whether you're ready to retire soon or still a decade or more away, these three facts about Social Security will affect you.\\n\\nFull retirement age is set to change soon\\n\\nOnce you turn 62, you become eligible for Social Security retirement, but at a reduction to your full benefit, which you become eligible for at full retirement age. For anyone born in 1943-1954, the full retirement age is 66. But for anyone born in 1955 or later, you should know that full retirement age is set to increase.\\n\\nStarting in 2020, anyone born in 1955 will reach full retirement age at 66 years, two months. For those born in 1956, they'll have to wait another two months, to 66 years, four months. This two-month increase will continue until people born in 1960 or later reach the new full retirement age of 67 in 2027.\\n\\nWhy does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. For instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for Social Security at a reduced level. Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.\\n\\nBut someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. It may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments.\\n\\nIn other words, it's very important to know what your full retirement age is, no matter what age you plan to retire. A few months' difference could make thousands of dollars in difference in how much money you get.\\n\\nThis affects your spouse, too\\n\\nWhether your spouse plans to retire on their own work record or on yours, the rules still apply when it comes to full retirement age and what their benefit will be. In other words, if your spouse is younger than you, it may be necessary for them to continue to work – or at least delay filing for Social Security if they don't work – in order to make sure the monthly benefit will be sufficient to cover your expenses.\\n\\nThis is particularly important to consider if your spouse will file on your work record, and is likely to outlive you. Here's what the Social Security Administration says about the survivor's benefit and how it could be lower if you retire before full retirement age.\\n\\nIf your spouse started receiving retirement benefits before their full retirement age, we cannot pay you the full retirement age benefit amount from their record. The maximum survivors benefit is limited to what they would receive if they were still alive.\\n\\nIn other words, before you decide to take Social Security early, you may want to consider how it would impact your surviving spouse's income if they are likely to outlive you and would receive the survivor's benefit.\\n\\nIf you're likely to live very long or die very early, it may affect when you should take Social Security\\n\\nSocial Security is structured to provide a lot of flexibility, since you can take benefits as early as age 62 or as late as age 70, depending on what works for your situation. And while the monthly benefit is significantly lower if you file early and much higher if you delay, the total dollars paid to someone who lives the average lifespan wouldn't be that much different.\\n\\nBut if you're an outlier with a significant chance of either living much longer than average or dying younger, that could affect what makes the most sense for you. Here's a table that breaks down where you would maximize your total benefit, based on filing age and age of death:\\n\\nThis table is based on a full retirement age of 66 and a full retirement age benefit of $1,000 per month. And as you can see, if you aren't likely to live beyond your mid-70s, it's almost certainly in your best interest to file at age 62 (with the caveat that you should consider how that would affect your surviving spouse). On the other end of the spectrum, if you're fortunate enough that you'll probably live well into your 80s or beyond, delaying Social Security will almost certainly mean more total income, not to mention a bigger check later in life when your ability to earn a wage is far more limited.\\n\\nTake a balanced approach and consider all the repercussions\\n\\nThe facts above are largely about the financial impact of when you take Social Security. And while the financial part should play a primary role in when you file, it's not the only thing that matters. We must each also consider what kind of retirement we want, the value of other retirement assets and what we want to do with the time we have before we die.\\n\\nAnd the more you understand about Social Security before you retire, the more time you'll have to plan and prepare. If you want to maximize the quality and quantity of your retirement years, start today – no matter how far from retirement you are.\\n\\nTry any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

{"original": "AUSTIN, Indiana — A hard rain had just ended. Austin's streets were still wet as I walked alongside residents marching to protest the drugs that overwhelmed their tiny rural city.\\n\\nSome held hands. Some draped arms around each other. Some pushed strollers. All walked with purpose past Morgan Foods, the ice cream cone-shaped sign for the Dairy Queen and the recovery wall of names outside H2O Church on Mann Avenue.\\n\\nI knew many of the 200 marchers from more than three years of covering their town of just over 4,000 people, epicenter of rural America's worst HIV outbreak caused by IV drug use. I met some during their struggles with addiction. But on the late-August evening of the Fed Up! march, everyone was celebrating recovery.\\n\\nIn a larger sense, I thought, all of Austin is recovering, helped along by its angels, people working to heal the community and themselves. Among them are a mother, a preacher and a teacher.\\n\\nMy tears fell as I felt Austin's hope rising.\\n\\nRead more commentary:\\n\\nI didn't want heavy painkillers after surgery — but my hospital pushed opioids on me anyway\\n\\nIt took a village to kill my brother: How families, hospitals and government fail alcoholics\\n\\nI lost a sister and a brother to opioid addiction. I nearly lost my own life, too.\\n\\nAlmost on cue, a faint rainbow appeared in the still-threatening sky. The woman next to me, Sabina Adams, looked up and said: That's God's promise.\\n\\nNever again, it seemed to portend, would their world be devastated like it was in 2015.\\n\\nAn unexpected, deadly outbreak\\n\\nBack then, Laura Nowling, a respected second-grade teacher and mother of three, hid a secret meth addiction. Pastor Jacob Howell roamed the streets of his hometown high on heroin. And choir director Kathy Risk-Sego helped her students cope with other kids' unfounded concerns that they had AIDS.\\n\\nThat's when I first visited Austin. In February of that year, I learned that Indiana state health officials were alarmed about tests showing 26 confirmed and four preliminary positive cases of HIV. Most had been caused by shooting up Opana, an opioid painkiller. Before that, the county had never had more than a handful of cases.\\n\\nIn less than a month, cases more than doubled. Eventually, HIV would sicken 235 people, and Austin's HIV rate would rival countries in sub-Saharan Africa. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention researchers would identify 220 counties nationally that are vulnerable to becoming the next Austin because they contain the same combustible mixture of problems tied to injecting drugs, such as overdose deaths, prescription opioid sales and unemployment. Many are in this region, which has been especially hard hit by drugs. In 2017, federal data shows, drug overdoses killed 1,566 people in Kentucky and 1,852 in Indiana.\\n\\nIn those first few months after the outbreak, despair was palpable. I remember watching haggard-looking young men walking past rundown homes on Rural Street, the most notorious stretch for drugs. Locals told me about women who sold their bodies to get money for drugs, sometimes to truckers who made a quick stop off the I-65 Austin exit.\\n\\nLongtime residents pined for better days. They described growing up in a close-knit manufacturing town full of salt-of-the-earth people, a safe place where kids could ride their bikes without concern.\\n\\nI could see the faded remnants of those Norman Rockwell days. Outside of the sketchy areas, this town 37 miles from Louisville was still that picture of rural America, with stubble-filled cornfields and a one-stoplight Main Street lined by churches, shops and sidewalks. There were plenty of tidy, well-kept houses, some not far from dilapidated ones. Lots of people pitched in to help their neighbors. I sensed a deep love among many for their hometown.\\n\\nI saw a small-town soul trapped in chaos.\\n\\nAt the intersection of hope and despair\\n\\nOf course some of the things that make small towns so wonderful can make disease outbreaks worse. When everyone knows each other, stigma can fester, discouraging people from getting tested or treated for HIV or seeking help for addiction. Disease can spread quickly when people share needles in close-knit groups. In some Austin families, three generations shared needles — young adults, their parents and their grandparents.\\n\\nDuring those years, I described Austin as a place at the intersection of hope and despair.\\n\\nBut the desperate needs of the community — laid bare so starkly by the outbreak — seemed to strengthen others' generosity, love, and faith. It reminded me of what happens during natural disasters — such as floods or tornadoes — when neighbors share food and electricity and help each other rebuild homes. For many in Austin, saving themselves and the town brought out their best.\\n\\nConsider Nowling, the second-grade teacher who struggled with meth. In February 2016, police led her out of Austin Elementary School in handcuffs after her arrest for having meth in her classroom and endangering her students. She hung her head, platinum blonde hair falling across her face, as new crews captured her walk to a waiting police car. Less than a year later, she was arrested again for dealing meth.\\n\\nBut she found freedom from addiction while locked in Scott County Jail. She took a faith-based class that tied the 12 steps of addiction recovery to Biblical teachings. She pored over her Celebrate Recovery bible so often it became dog-eared and tattered, and she fastened it together with the label from a VO5 shampoo bottle because there was no tape in the jail.\\n\\nWhen she got out, Nowling, 50, fastened her life together in much the same way. She got a job in a factory, went to church whenever she could and became an enthusiastic member of Austin's growing recovery community. She now runs a Celebrate Recovery meeting, speaks to others struggling with addiction and shares her story within her community. She's teaching again, in a new way.\\n\\nI want people to look at me and see hope, she said.\\n\\nPreacher Jacob Howell does, too. Addiction consumed him for nearly half his 35 years. At his lowest point, his constant quest for heroin replaced even things he loved, like fishing trips with his boys. He lost his job and blew through savings. Water and electricity to his trailer were cut off and he couldn't flush the toilet. Mold grew on the carpets. Bugs crawled on the furniture.\\n\\nBut when Howell surrendered to God, the light of faith and community began pulling him up. He found a new calling as a pastor, then a new wife and family. He learned how to serve at the foot of his mentor, Paul Thomas, whose willingness to befriend, teach and guide a stranger changed both of their lives.\\n\\nHowell is now a community leader, preaching the gospel and helping feed the hungry, clothe the poor and minister to the troubled at a church known for service. His very life is an example to those still living in desperation — that hope and transformation are real. Howell is now on a mission to save others still caught in that life, by bringing them to God and helping them into recovery. By saving souls and saving lives.\\n\\nA community shares the burdens and blessings\\n\\nAnd he has. Brian LaFever feels he was reborn when Howell baptized and befriended him. From that day on, LaFever vowed to get sober — and did. He saved my life, LaFever said.\\n\\nKathy Risk-Sego, a teacher who directs the show choir at Austin High School, is on a mission to nurture young voices at the impressionable cusp of adulthood. She's a role model who gives hugs, directions and dreams. She applies, in equal measures, silliness, discipline and tenderness.\\n\\nHer husband calls her a wellspring of hope. The kids just call her mom.\\n\\nMany students endure serious hardships along with the usual trials of growing up. Former student Kasey Brandenburg, 19, lost both her parents to overdoses. Her mother was a singer, her father a drummer, and the music inside Brandenburg could have died with them if not for the people who stepped in to keep it alive. Risk-Sego was one. She keeps the music alive in all her kids.\\n\\nIn 2017, Risk-Sego's choir, Dimensions, competed in a national championship in Chicago. It was the first time they'd ever made it that far. A big-budget California team beat them, but just being in the same league showed the kids what was possible. The theme of the show was overcoming obstacles; the closing number: Unstoppable.\\n\\nKids are vulnerable here but I don't dwell on it. I don't let them dwell on it, Risk-Sego said. If you can't move beyond that, you're always going to be stuck.\\n\\nThanks to people like these, Austin is recovering. More kids are graduating high school; graduation rates now exceed 90 percent. Cases of HIV have leveled off and the disease is well-controlled in most people. Needle sharing has plummeted and attendance at recovery meetings has risen tenfold.\\n\\nPeople can change communities, one life at a time. When we help one another, we can create a chain of love that, over time, can transform even the most troubled place.\\n\\nWe're all in this together. If our neighbors suffer, we suffer too.\\n\\nFor Austin, the suffering isn't over. On the day of that Fed Up! march, the rain started tapping on my windshield as I pulled out of Austin.\\n\\nLike so many communities, Austin still faces formidable challenges.\\n\\nThere is still addiction.\\n\\nThere are still deaths caused by the scourge of opioids.\\n\\nThere's still poverty and despair.\\n\\nBut at that intersection of despair and hope, Austin is now taking a different direction.\\n\\nIt is moving down the path of hope.\\n\\nLaura Ungar is an investigative and enterprise reporter with the Courier Journal, where this column originally appeared.

And many people who are feeling lucky have been flocking to convenience stores across the USA to grab their 1-in-292 million chance as the clock ticked down to Wednesday's 10:59 p.m ET drawing.\\n\\nAt Max's Food and Fuel in Phoenix, about 600 Powerball tickets were sold in one day, with evenings generating the most eager customers, clerk Michael Eka said. People often have been buying 10 $2 tickets to improve their odds.\\n\\nI've been in here when two people have bought $500 worth of tickets, he said. You never know what they'll get.\\n\\nAs jumbo jackpot nears, what you should know\\n\\nThe new estimated jackpot, $275.4 million if the winner decides on a one-time payout rather than a 30-year annuity, would rank as the fourth largest in Powerball history — if someone lands the lucky numbers. Before the addition of 10 white balls to the pool of numbers in October, the chance of winning was a much more realistic 1 in 175 million.\\n\\nNo one has won the grand prize in Powerball's twice-a-week drawing since Nov. 7.\\n\\nIt's surreal for people when they win, said Tony Bouie, executive director of the Arizona Lottery. Then they see that it's real, and we see how their lives are transformed.\\n\\nA Florida woman won the largest Powerball pot, $590.5 million with a cash value of $370.9 million, in May 2013. The second- and third-largest prizes, awarded in November 2012 and February 2015, were split among two and three people.\\n\\nThe largest U.S. lottery prize ever was for a Mega Millions game, a $656 million jackpot split among three winning tickets in March 2012. Back then, the odds of picking the correct numbers were more than 1 in 175 million.\\n\\nI don't ever miss. You don't ever change. You play consistent, said Charles Rush, owner of Carpet Discount Warehouse in Charlotte, N.C. I almost got it twice.\\n\\nIn the past two years, Rush and nine other workers have played Powerball every week spending $12 each. Twice they hit it big: once with a $10,000 winner and in the summer with a cool $1 million check. After taxes, they each took home $70,000.\\n\\nYou're going to play $12 a week. Just consider that gone and you can afford to do it, Rush said. And don't worry about it until they hit. Don't sit and sweat it every damn week.\\n\\nNo winners sets up frenzy for $400M Powerball\\n\\nThe players in Rush's pool each pick numbers significant to themselves and give them to Rush. He chooses the Powerball then carries the forms next door to a convenience store where he buys 10 weeks of tickets at a time.\\n\\nI play my parents' birthdays, my grandmother's birthday, and my mother's house address, said Michael Grier of Pensacola, Fla. I just won on that one yesterday.\\n\\nHe buys $5 or $6 of lottery tickets a day — usually the twice-a-week Florida Lotto or twice-a-day Cash 3, both of which have better chances of winning. Wednesday, he'll play Powerball.\\n\\n12 things not to do if you win the lottery\\n\\nGrier, like many players, has a list of things he would do if he were to win: Give money to his church, pay for his nephew's upcoming wedding, pay off his sister's house, help his friends who are struggling.\\n\\nJonathon Knight of Port St. John, Fla., said he would start out practical but then make his dream come true.\\n\\nI would pay off my mortgage along with my family's bills and then buy a big piece of land and have a massive car collection, Knight said.

Some have been spending $100 for 50 Powerball tickets and more for scratch-off games.\\n\\nPeople need the money more these days, he said. The retired people who come in, they want to retire again.\\n\\nOdds are, you won't like this Powerball story\\n\\nHe claims he can feel when he sells a winning scratch-off ticket but said Powerball is different.\\n\\nIf you win the Powerball, you'll win by mistake, he said.

{"original": "WASHINGTON — U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci plans to run for U.S. Senate after President Trump's political team urged the Republican to do so.\\n\\nThat means Renacci will jump out of the Ohio governor's race, according to Republicans with knowledge of the decision. An announcement is expected Thursday morning.\\n\\nWhite House political staff sat down with Renacci on Wednesday and encouraged him to run for the Senate. They cited Renacci's support for Trump's initiatives in Congress and their desire to have another GOP vote in the Senate, a person close to the White House told The Cincinnati Enquirer.\\n\\nRenacci's move comes after a day of intense jockeying in the Ohio race, which unfolded behind closed doors. Hillbilly Elegy author J.D. Vance met with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Sen. Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican who is chairman of the Senate GOP's campaign committee.\\n\\nThere are a number of people both in-state and out-of-state who are urging J.D. to run, said Jai Chabria, an adviser to Vance who accompanied him to his Washington meetings Wednesday. He's taking these overtures seriously.\\n\\nMore:Trump says 'I'll beat Oprah' if she runs in 2020\\n\\nMore:Controversial former sheriff in Arizona says he is running for Senate\\n\\nChabria said Vance met with potential donors as well as the two Senate GOP leaders. Renacci's announcement didn't change Vance's plans, Chabria told The Enquirer.\\n\\nThe two separate courting sessions could make the Ohio race a replay of the battle between McConnell and Trump — and the broader fight within the GOP between establishment Republicans and hardline insurgents. That played out most recently in the Alabama Senate race, where Trump endorsed Roy Moore despite allegations of sexual misconduct.\\n\\nMcConnell endorsed incumbent and establishment contender Luther Strange in the GOP primary. A Democrat eventually won the seat in a stunning upset.\\n\\nThe Ohio Senate race was thrown into flux last week when the presumed front-runner for the GOP nomination, Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel, dropped out, citing his wife's health. He did not disclose her specific illness.\\n\\nThe Republican nominee will face Democratic incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown in the general election. Brown's campaign announced Wednesday that he had raised more than $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and he ended the year with almost $10 million in the bank.\\n\\nOne Republican was already in the race even before Mandel quit: Cleveland banker Mike Gibbons, who has committed to spending an additional $5 million of his own for his campaign.\\n\\nBut Gibbons has pledged to try to oust McConnell as the Senate's GOP leader, a move that Trump's allies have pushed. So it's no wonder McConnell is looking for an alternative.\\n\\nMandel's decision prompted Renacci to reconsider his gubernatorial bid, where he was immersed in a competitive primary, and he agreed to switch after Wednesday's White House meeting.\\n\\nRenacci had $285,000 in his House re-election account at the end of September, according to his most recent campaign account. He can transfer those funds to a Senate campaign account. In the governor's race, Renacci loaned his campaign $4 million, and he may dip into his own pocket again for the Senate race.\\n\\nSome Republicans see Vance as an appealing candidate because of his roots in Appalachia and his ties to the white working-class voters who helped catapult Trump to the White House.\\n\\nVance would like to do it, but I think he's trying to figure out who else is going to get in, said a lawmaker who has spoken with the Hillbilly Elegy author about his plans.\\n\\nHe has a phenomenal life story, said Rep. Brad Wenstrup, R-Columbia Tusculum. There's certainly a large part of America that can relate to him. He's achieved a lot from nothing. We always like those stories.\\n\\nStill, Vance did not vote for Trump — a fact that could hurt him in a Republican primary.\\n\\nJ.D. Vance effectively voted for Hillary Clinton when he voted against President Trump, said Mike Biundo, Gibbons' general consultant. Biundo also reminded reporters Wednesday that Gibbons served as a co-chair for Trump's Ohio campaign and said he never wavered in his support for the president.\\n\\nRenacci was already heavily courting those voters in his gubernatorial bid — billing himself as the Trump candidate in the race and touting his endorsement of Trump early in the 2016 presidential race.\\n\\nIf Republicans are eager to find a nominee who can connect with blue-collar Ohioans, it's no wonder. Brown has long embraced a populist economic agenda, railing against Wall Street greed and the free trade agreements that he says ship American jobs overseas.\\n\\nBrown declined to speculate Wednesday about who his opponent might be or how that might change the dynamic of the race.\\n\\nMitch McConnell can pick his candidate. Donald Trump can pick his candidate, Brown said in a call with Ohio reporters. The Republican primary voters will actually make that decision.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Brown said, he would focus on his fight for working families.\\n\\nFollow Deirdre Shesgreen and Jessie Balmert on Twitter: @dshesgreen and @jbalmert"}
{"original": "WILMINGTON, Del. – Every year, at least one person goes to city officials complaining about something in Middletown's Hummers Parade.\\n\\nThis year, that number has grown.\\n\\nYou always offend a couple of people, but nothing like what happened this year, said Michael Wipf, who has performed in more than a dozen of the Delaware town's parades, which began as a spoof of Philadelphia's Mummers Parade. This has been a big firestorm.\\n\\nOn New Year's Day, a float portraying children in cages at border detention sparked outrage online, as former political candidates, community activists and others questioned how such displays were permitted.\\n\\nThis went more than close to the edge. It went over the edge and it has to be called out, said Democratic state Senator Stephanie Hansen, who saw the display in person. The irreverent and satirical humor is fine and it's expected every year, but I think some of the displays took a mean and nasty turn. The antidote to that is more speech redirecting the public discourse and saying, 'This was wrong, you crossed a line.'\\n\\nThe annual Hummers Parade started in 1971 and is known for its controversial displays of the previous year's political, cultural and social issues.\\n\\nThe Mummers also have historically been criticized for racist leanings, particularly with the use of blackface, which caused some confusion at this year's parade when a black man was accused of wearing blackface during a controversial skit, as reported by BillyPenn.com.\\n\\nGroups marching in the Mummers Parade spend thousands of hours and tens of thousands of dollars each year and there is a governing body overseeing them. The Hummers have no such organization.\\n\\nPeople are supposed to start making their floats on New Year's Day and assemble one hour before the procession's start.\\n\\nMost participants and people in the crowd cheered and laughed at the displays.\\n\\nDelaware's Senate Democrats have called out the event for crossing a line from tongue-in-cheek irreverence to poor taste.\\n\\nIt is fine – even healthy – to poke fun at politicians, ideologies, and celebrities, but satire is best when it is aimed at the prominent and powerful; jokes about children in cages and the humanitarian crisis at the border are simply 'punching down,' the caucus posted on Facebook. The tenor of these displays is divisive, mean-spirited, and entirely counter to our state's values.\\n\\nWipf, who hid baby dolls taped to his chest under a blanket and walked alongside signs reading Not Mexican I'm Russian Let Me In, during the parade, said he is being called out as responsible for the float with the cages. He said he was not.\\n\\nThat's a line I probably wouldn't have crossed, but that's his prerogative to do what he wants, said Wipf. No one made a comment when they drug the cooler down the street with Ann Marie Fahey's arm hanging out. When I dressed up as Michael Vick, no one commented about that. If you don't like it, don't show up.\\n\\nAnne Marie Fahey was the former scheduling secretary for then-Gov. Tom Carper and killed by her former boyfriend Thomas J. Capano, who stuffed her into an ice chest in 1996. Her remains were never found.\\n\\nIn 2007, NFL quarterback Michael Vick pleaded guilty to his part in a criminal dogfighting enterprise, leading to jail time and suspension from the league.\\n\\nMore:14-year-old charged with murder after throwing eggs in fatal crash, police say\\n\\nCommunity advocate and former U.S. Senate candidate Kerri Evelyn Harris said that she and others are not calling for an end to the parade, but that hateful and hurtful displays shouldn't be the way to celebrate the new year.\\n\\nI don't condone taking away a person's right to free speech, but that doesn't mean that I sit silently when I disagree with content, she said. Somebody has to take responsibility.\\n\\nSo far, town officials have distanced themselves from the event.\\n\\nThe town doesn't have anything to do with the parade other than to provide police for traffic control, said Middletown Mayor Kenneth Branner.\\n\\nBranner said this is not the first time a float in this parade has caused an outcry. He also said he thought the controversial float was pretty offensive.\\n\\nThere have been floats in previous years that have been offensive, but the bottom line is we don't have anything to do with the parade, he said. You can't stop anybody from assembling and walking down the street. Freedom of speech is the other side of this and we pay close attention to that.\\n\\nA Townsend native spearheaded the display. It was clear during the line-up that their display revolved around the border detention centers where an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy recently died of the flu, as reported by USA Today. John Bingham, who said he and his family drove from Virginia just for the parade, hinted that the dog cages on a trailer were not all they had in store.\\n\\nIt's a tradition, his family said about 20 minutes before one in the group dressed up in soiled underpants, curled up in a cage and was marched down the streets of Middletown. Light-hearted fun.\\n\\nJack Schreppler, the parade's self-proclaimed disorganizer, said the parade has been spoofing current events since 1971. He started rollerskating at the head of the parade the following year.\\n\\nI lead the parade but I have neither the ability nor the desire to regulate its content, he said in an email on Thursday. I have no further comment.\\n\\nFollow Maddy Lauria on Twitter @MaddyinMilford."}

Ilhan Omar responded to critics who attacked her for her assertion the talk of a potential war with Iran caused her to experience post-traumatic stress disorder.\\n\\nOmar made the PTSD comment Wednesday during a news conference with fellow members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus calling for Congress to stop President Donald Trump from taking action that could lead to open conflict with Iran.\\n\\nI feel ill a little bit because of everything that is taking place and I think every time I hear conversations around war, I find myself being stricken with PTSD, Omar said.\\n\\nCritics mocked and derided Omar's remark on social media.\\n\\nThis is a disgrace and offensive to our nation's veterans who really do have PTSD after putting their life on the line to keep America safe, tweeted Rep.

I survived war as a child and deal with post-traumatic stress disorder – much like many who have served or lived through war. It's shameful that you as a member of Congress would erase the PTSD of survivors.\\n\\nOmar also retweeted a post from the anti-Trump veterans group Common Defense in response to Banks.\\n\\nThis is a tremendously ignorant thing to say. Veterans like us know that people wearing uniforms aren't the only ones impacted by war. @Ilhan is a refugee. We stand with her against hawkish elites like you, the group said.\\n\\nOmar did not directly address Ingraham's attack, but retweeted two House members who did.\\n\\n8 yrs old.

I know you think war's a for profit video game @IngrahamAngle but you'd be wise to take a seat and take your cues from folks like Ilhan who actually know what they're talking about.\\n\\nThis is despicable. Have you ever been forced to live and suffer through a war before your 10th birthday, Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., asked Ingraham. Neither you or I can understand the trauma @IlhanMN has faced, so it's best for you to stick to what you know: Trump & racism.\\n\\nBanks and Ingraham were unpersuaded, however. Both posted tweets accusing Omar of disrespecting U.S. service members because she appeared to share a joke with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., when Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, discussed American casualties in Iraq.\\n\\nYou can't change the subject, Banks tweeted back at Omar.\\n\\nYour words and actions at today's press conference reveal your feelings toward our soldiers serving abroad and the video speaks for itself, Banks said. His tweet shared a post from Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., who shared a clip from the news conference and accused Omar of making light of American lives lost overseas.\\n\\nOur brave men and women in uniform deserve our utmost respect and applause for their service and sacrifice – not mockery and laughter, Hice said.\\n\\nSeveral right-wing websites posted stories accusing Omar of laughing during a discussion of U.S. casualties Trump's 2020 campaign secretary Kayleigh McEnany also tore into Omar for her laugher.\\n\\nHow low will Ilhan Omar go? Watch her giggle and joke as Rep. Lee talks about American troops who lost their lives in Iraq, McEnany said.\\n\\nOmar's defenders pointed out that her conversation with Tlaib began before Jackson Lee mentioned casualties.\\n\\nBoth you & Hice are pathetically dishonest frauds trying to use mention of the troops to score cheap political points, tweeted Omar Baddar, the deputy director of the Arab American Institute, in response to Banks. She clearly didn't mock the troops, her side convo started before they were mentioned. You, on the other hand, did trivialize the pain of war survivors. Shame!"}

Bigger fish to fry. #TwoPaths, Weaver wrote, referencing a speech Kasich made during his presidential bid.\\n\\nRudin said Kasich would not be a good fit for Senate as polls show he's not very popular with the national Republican Party. And it might serve as a distraction for any 2020 plans Kasich might have to challenge Trump.\\n\\nBut anything is possible.\\n\\nThe fact that Trump is president was a shock, Rudin said.

For as long as that takes, whether it is months or years, it is important that I heed my dad's advice and be there for my wife and our kids.\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter recent discussions with our family and healthcare professionals, it has become clear to us that it's no longer possible for me to be away from home and on the campaign trail for the time needed to run a US Senate race.\\n\\n\\n\\nTherefore, I'm writing today to let you know that I am ending my campaign for US Senate in order to be there for my wife and our three children. This was a difficult decision for us, but it's the right one.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile unexpected, I accept that this changeof course is what God has in store for our family at this time. As we read in the Book of Proverbs, Many are the plans in a person's heart, but it's God's purpose that prevails.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe issues facing our country are profound and I believe we had a voice and perspective better than the current one in the office. At the same time, I think it's important to acknowledge the respect I have for Senator Brown for having the passion to advocate for his beliefs and, as Teddy Roosevelt once aptly said, the courage to be The Man in the Arena.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will continue to serve out the remainder of my term as State Treasurer and hope to have the opportunity to serve my state and country again in the future. But in the meantime, I must put my family first. I'm grateful for your understanding.\\n\\n\\n\\nJosh"}
{"original": "Human-caused climate change is worsening the wildfires scorching Australia, experts say.\\n\\nClimate change is increasing bushfire risk in Australia by lengthening the fire season, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology.\\n\\nThe unprecedented fires, which have killed at least 25 people and destroyed 2,000 homes, have been burning since September. In all, about 15 million acres have burned across the country, an area roughly the size of West Virginia.\\n\\nWhile climate change might not ignite the fires, it is giving them the chance to turn into catastrophic blazes by creating warmer temperatures, increasing the amount of fuel (dried vegetation) available and reducing water availability because of higher evaporation, according to Climate Signals.\\n\\n'Scale of disaster is enormous': Bush fires, politics intensify as Australia burns\\n\\nClimate change:Here's where the 2020 Democratic candidates stand on climate change\\n\\nThere are many drivers of wildfires, but its increasingly clear that hotter, drier conditions play a big role in making them worse, said Zeke Hausfather, a climate scientist at Berkeley Earth, a climate research organization, in a tweet.\\n\\nSouthern Australia has seen rapid warming of around 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since 1950, making conditions ripe for devastating fires, he said.\\n\\nRecent extremely hot, dry conditions have also fueled the fires. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, 2019 was both the hottest and driest year ever measured in Australia.\\n\\nUnder these conditions, it is not at all surprising that extreme wildfires have been running out of control, said Robert Rohde, a lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, in a tweet.\\n\\nDecember was particularly harsh in Australia: It was one of the top two hottest months on record for the nation.\\n\\nEarly start to season:Australia's bushfire season begins early and forcefully as its politicians differ over climate change\\n\\nAustralia has warmed by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit) since records began in 1910, tweeted Columbia University climate scientist Kate Marvel. This makes heat waves and fires more likely. It's not the sun. It's not volcanoes. It's not 'natural cycles.'\\n\\nThere is no explanation for this – none – that makes sense besides emissions of heat-trapping gases, Marvel said.\\n\\nClimate change is also making droughts more likely to occur – and more severe when they do – in Australia. While Australia is no stranger to drought, climate change has exacerbated drought conditions so that when droughts occur, the conditions are in a much hotter climate and, in some cases, with lower precipitation, according to Climate Signals.\\n\\nThe Climate Reality Project also reports that making the connection between global temperature rise and wildfires is also pretty simple science: Droughts dry out the land, killing plant life – which then also dries out itself, becoming far easier to ignite.\\n\\nIndeed, winter rainfall has been decreasing in southeastern Australia, while the country has been becoming hotter with more extreme heatwaves – ideal conditions for bushfires.\\n\\nAnimals at risk:Bindi Irwin says her family's animal hospital is 'busier than ever' amid wildfires\\n\\nIf anyone tells you, 'This is part of a normal cycle' or 'we've had fires like this before,' smile politely and walk away, because they don't know what they're talking about, Greg Mullins, former Fire and Rescue commissioner of New South Wales, told the Sydney Morning Herald.\\n\\nClimate change is super-charging our natural disaster risks, Mullins said. I wish we were wrong, but we're not.\\n\\nTexas Tech climate scientist Katharine Hayhoe explained in a tweet that human-induced climate change is a threat multiplier. It takes existing risks and amplifies them beyond imagining, affecting every living thing on this planet, including us."}
{"original": "Sarah Skidmore Sell\\n\\nThe Associated Press\\n\\nIt's inevitable. As we age, our bodies and our brains change, and not always like fine wine. Cognitive skills decline as part of the normal aging process and in turn, so do some of our financial management skills.\\n\\nResearch shows that financial decision-making peaks around age 53, and by age 60 our ability to process new information starts to slow. The shift happens at a different pace for everyone, and it can be accelerated by medical conditions such as Alzheimer's and dementia. While some people are capable of managing their own finances throughout their lifetime, others may find their skills suffering.\\n\\nThe impact could be as benign as paying a utility bill twice, or something worse, like falling prey to a scam.\\n\\nExperts say there are signs that children or spouses can watch out for that will help them know when it's time to step in and help an older relative with their finances.\\n\\nThis will probably happen to someone you love or to you, said Bill Hensley, director of education at the National Endowment for Financial Education. The way to deal with it is to plan ahead. Plan ahead, prepare for the worst, put those safeguards in place.\\n\\nA new study from the University of Alabama, with support from the NEFE, has identified five signs that aging may be impacting someone's financial decision making.\\n\\nThe study looked at up to seven years of financial skill performance among cognitively normal older adults. The warning signs of financial decline it found are:\\n\\n— Taking longer to complete everyday financial tasks;\\n\\n— Missing key details in financial documents;\\n\\n— Having difficulty with everyday math;\\n\\n— Showing decreased understanding of common financial concepts;\\n\\n— Having difficulty identifying risks in an investment opportunity.\\n\\nSeeing any of these signs doesn't mean an elderly relative needs to have their checkbook taken away immediately. But they can be a warning that decline is occurring. And that can be a sign that help is needed.\\n\\nHopefully we are helping people understand the importance of planning ahead so that you are not the victim of your own cognitive decline, or someone else taking advantage of that, Hensley said.\\n\\nMake a plan to improve your finances in 2017\\n\\nUnfortunately, this planning often doesn't occur until after an illness, death or other unfortunate event. But ideally, people should be putting plans and documents into place to protect themselves by midlife or earlier.\\n\\nHere are a few tips on how to prepare:\\n\\nSTART THE CONVERSATION\\n\\nIf possible, begin talking about how you want your financial matters handled early, before things go awry. Talk to your spouse, your children and other loved ones about your preferences and game plan.\\n\\nIf initiating the conversation about someone else, do so gently. Ask them where basic documents such as a will are stored, or if they even exist. Another effective tactic is to start by saying I'm thinking of doing X, Y or Z for myself, what have you done?\\n\\nExperts also suggest pointing to a loved one's death or something in popular culture as a starting point. Financial planners say requests for medical directives jumped after the 2005 death of Terri Schiavo, the brain-damaged Florida woman whose family fought a years-long right-to-die case.\\n\\nThis isn't a conversation that will, or should, happen in one sitting.\\n\\nAssure them we aren't taking over your finances, but we want to make sure you are protected, said Amy Florian, whose business specializes in teaching people how to support and interact with those going through life-changing events.\\n\\nPeople often avoid these conversations because they are uncomfortable talking about money or thinking about death. Florian says to be clear that this isn't about dying, it's about living and taking the burdens off your family.\\n\\nIt's about living the way you want to until you take your last breath, she said. There are things you can't control, but control what you can.\\n\\nESTABLISH YOUR TEAM\\n\\nPick a team to help monitor and potentially step in if your financial skills start to deteriorate. This can include family, friends or others you trust.\\n\\nAssign roles to everyone involved: name someone to serve as your medical decision maker should you need one, and someone to act as your financial power of attorney. And consider whether you want one person in charge, or if you want some checks and balances in place.\\n\\nTalk to everyone involved to make sure they are comfortable with their role.\\n\\nCREATE ESSENTIAL DOCUMENTS\\n\\nGet some basic legal documents in place to ensure your wishes can be carried out.\\n\\nAt a minimum, write a will, a medical directive and a financial inventory listing all your financial accounts, assets and insurance policies. Keep these documents in a safe place and let your team know where to access them.\\n\\nSeek professional assistance from a lawyer, estate planner or financial planner along the way if needed.\\n\\nFive doable strategies for financial success in 2017\\n\\nFlorian also suggests that people prepare a diminishing capacity letter giving permission to a financial planner or other professional to contact loved ones if they believe their mental capacity is weakening.\\n\\nMANAGE YOUR PLAN\\n\\nIt's important for families to be in sync about what needs to happen if it becomes necessary to take over a loved one's financial decisions, said Suzanne Schmitt, vice president of family engagement at Fidelity Investments.\\n\\nFinancial interdependence is often a gradual process. Some people may want early intervention, such as setting up alerts for their kids if their accounts show unusual activity. Others do not want any help unless their mental capacity is dramatically diminished. Respect those preferences.\\n\\nBe proactive, plan as if this will happen, even if it never does, have a plan in case it does, Hensley said."}

{"original": "Jon Swartz\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO — Apple is no longer the undisputed head of the K-12 class.\\n\\nFor the first time, Chromebook sales surpassed 51% in the K-12 market nationwide in the third quarter, according to a recent report by market researcher Futuresource Consulting. The surge reflects a fundamental shift in how American schools are buying tech in bulk and assessing students online, placing an emphasis on low-cost, easy-to-manage machines.\\n\\nIt's a tidal wave: Chrome is the clear U.S. market leader now, says Mike Fisher, associate director of education technology at Futuresource. He says districts are drawn to the Chromebook's Web-based operating system, ease of use, IT manageability and $200 to $300 price range.\\n\\nChromebooks — laptops running Google's Chrome OS as their operating systems — made significant strides, year over year. Chromebooks' market share jumped to 51% from 40%. Apple products, mostly iPads but also laptops and Mac desktops, declined to 24% from 32%. Windows-based machines remained steady at 23%.\\n\\nAnd Chrome's growth is accelerating, says Rajen Sheth, director of product management, Chrome and Android, for work and education, at Google. We were at 1% to 2% (in 2012), Sheth says. He was at the Consumer Electronics Show last week, where OEMs were launching new Chromebooks, many of which will find their way into schools. This has been trending for three years.\\n\\nMicrosoft, through national contracts and Windows-based machines, remains on top for the K-12 market worldwide, with a 47% share. Chromebooks follows at 19% and Apple at 13%, Futuresource says.\\n\\nWinning students at an early age is considered crucial for tech companies in the approximately $15 billion K-12 market in the U.S.\\n\\nApple, through its dominance of the education market during the Steve Jobs years, helped establish its strong brand and shaped the computing habits of millions of young Americans.\\n\\nAPPLE UPDATES IOS\\n\\nThe trend away from Apple products hasn't gone unnoticed by the Cupertino, Calif., company now run by Tim Cook. Monday, it released education updates to its mobile operating system, version iOS 9.3 — namely, a simplified login and the ability to more easily share and manage iPads in schools securely — in hopes of wresting back market share. It also has shaved iPad prices.\\n\\nApple is still big in education. There are about 170,000 education apps on the App Store, and the company maintains a large installed base of iPads and MacBooks in schools. It has sold 15 million iPads into educational institutions worldwide.\\n\\nBut its position has changed. While Apple's dominance in K-12 has played an essential role in its success, it no longer is a leader but a player in the space, says Brian Blau, lead Apple analyst at market researcher Gartner.\\n\\nThe recent movement toward lower-priced, manageable devices reflects a sea change in the education market, Fisher says. Districts need more volume (in technology equipment), and they need to deploy for the online assessment of students, he says. Chromebooks offer the answer for now.\\n\\nAt many school districts nationwide, computer use increasingly is being segmented between iPads and tablets for younger students and Chromebooks and notebooks for middle grades and up, Fisher says.\\n\\n'COST AND BENEFIT'\\n\\nIts inexpensive price tag and free apps made Chromebooks an easy choice for Matt Smith, director of technology at Central School District 301 in Burlington, Ill., where 3,800 K-12 students primarily use Chromebook. Cost and benefit makes it the best product, says Smith, who wanted each student to have access to a computing device.\\n\\nAt Aurora City Schools in Ohio, most of the 3,000 K-12 students use Chromebooks, school superintendent Pat Ciccantelli says.\\n\\nIt is a powerful tool for $150 that opens up the world to kids, says Dayna Steele, CEO of yourdailysuccesstip.com, an advice website. Over the past two years, she has donated 135 Chromebooks to schools in Houston, Atlanta and Miami.\\n\\nChromebooks may soon find more competition in the low-price range.\\n\\nMicrosoft is partnering with software firm Lightspeed to better manage a range of devices at schools, and it is helping bring to market new devices that are likely to compete head-on with Google in the sub-$300 range.\\n\\nWe recognize that schools have different uses, at a variety of price points, for the learning of subjects, says Anthony Salcito, vice president of worldwide education for Microsoft.\\n\\nCarl Hooker, director of innovation and digital learning at Eanes Independent School District in Austin, where 8,000 K-12 students are enrolled, says he's likely to stick with iPads after four years and the district is considering options other than Chromebooks. We looked at Chromebooks but felt it was limited in innovation and creativity, he says.\\n\\nApple can still rely on its education bona fides, but given its rivals' growth, likely not for long.\\n\\nTablets have banner 2015, thanks to lesser-known labels\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz"}

{"original": "They call them Herb stories, wacky encounters with zany Herb Kelleher, the co-founder of Southwest Airlines, who died Thursday at age 87.\\n\\nThe countless times he lit up a cigarette in public places, no smoking signs be damned, including a packed Phoenix resort ballroom where he was receiving a leader of the year award in 2005.\\n\\nThe times he had to be tracked down by other Southwest executives after too many shots of Wild Turkey, his well-documented drink of choice.\\n\\nThe time he joked to a reporter that he loved the tufted buttons on his attorney's leather couch because it gives me a big thrill.'' Or the time he wore a bag over his head in a commercial years ago after a rival suggested travelers should be embarrassed to fly no-frills Southwest.\\n\\nAirline investor Bill Franke's favorite Herb story happened on a ranch in Wyoming. It was around 2000 and the two were attending an annual gathering of top industry honchos, bunking together for the first time. They were the unlikeliest of roommates, Mutt and Jeff as they came to call themselves.\\n\\nFranke was the all-business CEO of America West Airlines, a longtime Southwest competitor. Kelleher offered to pick him up from the tiny airport in Saratoga, Wyoming, but didn't show. An airport manager told Franke that Kelleher had decided to go into town for a drink. Franke ended up paying the manager $75 to drive him to the ranch.\\n\\nWhen he got to the room, Franke found cigarette butts and clothes strewn about. He declared an imaginary line of demarcation down the middle of the room.\\n\\nI said to him, 'Herb, lets just get something totally straight here: If I ever find anything of yours past the midline of the room, I'm throwing it in the fireplace.' He said, 'You wouldn't do that.' ''\\n\\nIt worked.\\n\\nIn the 15 years we were roommates (at the conference), he kept everything on his side of the room, and he never smoked,'' Franke said.\\n\\nHe also didn't let his friend Franke forget the scolding. He called him Nanny Nurse from that point and razzed him late at night when Kelleher came back to the room after Franke was long asleep.\\n\\nHe would gather up a lung full of smoke and lean over and blow the smoke on me,'' Franke said.\\n\\nFor all his hilarity, Kelleher was a shrewd businessman who came to every battle determined to win, Franke said.\\n\\nI referred to him as General Patton: He was hard-charging, get in the tank and go.''\\n\\nAmerican Airlines CEO Doug Parker said he has a gazillion'' Herb stories.\\n\\nEveryone has Herb stories,'' Parker said.\\n\\nRather than sharing a prank or joke Kelleher pulled on him, Parker said he will most remember two things about Kelleher.\\n\\nFirst: His phenomenal'' listening skills.\\n\\nHe was the best listener I've ever met in my life,'' Parker said. You tell people that and they're kind of surprised (because) he always talks so much.''\\n\\nHis attention was always focused on the conversation. It didn't matter who else was in the room or walked into the room, Parker said.\\n\\nHe was intently listening,'' Parker said. That was really helpful to me. What I realized is that's how he learned so much. And he really cared about what people had to say and their thoughts and where they came from. … I think that's how he go so well in touch with his people (at Southwest). That's how he got to know what was going on at his airline.''\\n\\nParker said the other thing that struck him about Kelleher was that he eschewed typical CEO speak when discussing Southwest's success. Rather than brag about Southwest's plentiful profits and strong stock market performance, he always focused on the airline's people.\\n\\nIf anybody could be in the shareholder hall of fame, it's Herb,'' Parker said. At these dinners where he'd sit and talk about business, he would never talk about his business in those terms; it was always about his people.''\\n\\nParker, who called Kelleher a really good friend,'' said Thursday was a sad, sad day.''\\n\\nHe was just a remarkable guy who cared so much about his team and about people in general.''\\n\\nAlong with co-founder Rollin King, Kelleher launched Southwest in 1971 with service from Dallas Love Field to Houston and San Antonio. Southwest currently serves 99 cities in the USA and abroad with 742 aircraft. It is the country's largest carrier by domestic passengers and earns strong marks for customer service.\\n\\nContinuing Kelleher's maverick ways, Southwest is known today as the only carrier to offer two free checked bags and no reservation change fees, and it does not assign seats. And while other airlines are carving up their planes into sections where the more you pay the more you get, Southwest maintains an egalitarian approach. Current CEO Gary Kelly likes to say there is no second class on Southwest.\\n\\nMORE: Southwest Airlines users guide.\\n\\nSouthwest announced Kelleher's death on social media.\\n\\nHerb was a pioneer, a maverick, and an innovator. His vision revolutionized commercial aviation and democratized the skies. Herb's passion, zest for life, and insatiable investment in relationships made lasting and immeasurable impressions on all who knew him and will forever be the bedrock and esprit de corps of Southwest Airlines, the airline said in a statement. The entire Southwest Family extends our deepest sympathies to Herb's wife, Joan, and his entire family."}

But, in the grand scheme of things, the number represents about 1% of the feral population.\\n\\nKing called the cull a last resort.\\n\\nWe can't sustain the level that we've got out there without doing something drastic to give us some breathing space, really, King said.\\n\\nHe added, Traditional animals – the kangaroos and wallabies and other quite endangered species – are being put under pressure by the significant numbers as they compete for food and water.\\n\\nTemperatures in the region have reached more than 120 degrees, King said.\\n\\nWhat (the camels) are doing is, they're looking for moisture in the air wherever they can get it, King said. You've got traditional people living out there. Some of them have got air conditioners. Some of them have evaporative coolers. When the camels smell that, they push and push until they get to the source.\\n\\nA Department for Environment spokesperson told CBS News the camels have caused significant damage to infrastructure, danger to families and communities and that some of the camels have died of thirst or trampled one another trying to get to water.\\n\\nThere are an estimated 1 million feral camels in Australia, and the population is growing at a rate of 8% a year, PestSmart Connect, which provides information about invasive vertebrate pests in Australia, according to its website.\\n\\nCelebrities help:Chris Hemsworth, Elton John donate $1M to fight Australia's wildfires, more celebs rally\\n\\nThe organization also reports the aerial shooting of camels from a helicopter is used for large scale population reductions in remote and/or inaccessible areas.\\n\\nKing said officials have been moving camels for the last year and a half.\\n\\nWe have one facility that can take them, he said.

{"original": "WASHINGTON – John Bolton, President Donald Trump's former national security adviser, said Monday that he is prepared to testify in a Senate impeachment trial – if he's subpoenaed by the Republican-controlled chamber.\\n\\nI have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify, Bolton said in a statement Monday.\\n\\nBolton's unexpected statement – coming after he's played coy for weeks about what he knows and whether he would dish on Trump – plays into the hands of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Democrats.\\n\\nIf Senate Republicans now refuse to subpoena Bolton and other witnesses, they would make absolutely clear they are participating in a cover-up, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said shortly after Bolton issued his statement.\\n\\nDemocrats want Bolton to testify, hoping he would be a bombshell witness in their case against Trump, which accuses the president of soliciting interference from Ukraine in the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nBolton has hinted that he could offer new details about the Ukraine pressure campaign.\\n\\nHe was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations about which you have already received testimony, his lawyer said in a November letter to House Democrats, as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far.\\n\\nOn Monday, Bolton said he's tried to balance his obligations as a citizen and as former National Security Adviser, portraying himself as torn between a presidential directive not to testify and a desire to comply with a congressional request for information.\\n\\nBut skeptics questioned the sincerity of Bolton's offer, saying the Republican-run Senate is unlikely to call any witnesses.\\n\\nThe House impeached Trump for abuse of power and obstructing Congress in a historic vote on Dec. 18. Pelosi has not yet sent the two articles of impeachment to the Senate for a trial; she's holding them back as leverage in her effort to pressure Republicans to call new witnesses during a Senate trial.\\n\\nIn November, Bolton defied a request from Democrats leading the House impeachment inquiry to testify. At the time, Bolton's lawyer told lawmakers he would take the impeachment committee to court if it subpoenaed him.\\n\\nHouse Democrats decided not to subpoena Bolton during their probe, arguing it would delay their investigation with a protracted court battle; instead, they labeled Bolton's refusal to appear as evidence of obstruction.\\n\\nSince the House vote, Schumer has pushed for summoning four witnesses who did not testify during the House inquiry, including Bolton and acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney.\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has balked at calling any witnesses, pushing for a quick trial that would lead to Trump's acquittal. Republicans have criticized Pelosi for refusing to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate, saying they have not yet been able to organize the trial.\\n\\nMcConnell did not mention Bolton by name during a Senate floor speech on Monday, but said he wants the House impeachment prosecutors and Trump's defense attorneys to present their cases before the Senate decides whether to call witnesses.\\n\\nThere's no question Bolton, who clashed with Trump repeatedly and left the White House on acrimonious terms, could provide an insider's account of Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, for political favors.\\n\\nAccording to Fiona Hill, one of Bolton's former deputies, Bolton was alarmed by the Ukraine pressure campaign, particularly the role of Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, played in carrying out that shadow foreign policy agenda. Hill said Bolton called Giuliani a hand grenade and referred to the Ukraine effort as a drug deal that would backfire on the White House.\\n\\nImpeachment supporters welcomed the prospect of Bolton's testimony, saying he can shed light on the president's decision to temporarily block aid to Ukraine as he and others pressing Zelensky to open two investigations that would benefit Trump in his 2020 reelection campaign.\\n\\nGood for you @AmbJohnBolton, tweeted Neal Katyal, former acting solicitor general and author of a book on impeachment. We are all Americans, united in our pursuit of the truth.\\n\\nKatyal added; I hope your White House colleagues, including President Trump, follow your lead and testify as well. The American people deserve no less.\\n\\nBut Barb McQuade, a former federal prosecutor, described Bolton's new statement as a PR move designed to help the former national security adviser sell copies of his forthcoming book.\\n\\nHe is currently in a bad spot because he looks like he was willing to tell his story only for money, not for country, said McQuade, a law professor at the University of Michigan. He is gambling that the Senate will not demand his testimony.\\n\\nIf McConnell does subpoena him, Bolton could always change his mind, citing executive privilege, McQuade said.\\n\\nOthers said that, depending on how the Senate trial's rules are written, a simple majority of senators could approve a subpoena – and a few GOP senators may want to hear from Bolton and others.\\n\\nEveryone saying 'yeah but the Senate won't subpoena Bolton' ... just chill for a moment, tweeted national security lawyer Bradley P. Moss. Let the president stew with this new cycle for a few hours.\\n\\nMoss told USA TODAY that all eyes would now be trained first on Trump, to see how he reacts to Bolton's statement, and then on a handful of moderate GOP senators who could potentially break with McConnell to demand testimony from Bolton and other witnesses.\\n\\nSchumer said Sunday it would take only four Republican senators to join Democrats in the push for witnesses, and possibly new documents.\\n\\nWe have the ability to require votes on the four witnesses we've asked for, whether there's agreement or not, Schumer said on ABC's This Week. We have the ability to ask for the documents and I hope, pray, and believe there's a decent chance that four Republicans will join us.\\n\\nThe White House declined to comment on Bolton's statement."}

{"original": "Jarrett Bell\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nTom Coughlin's era is officially over, but the New York Giants have a huge incentive to keep one of his top lieutenants in the fold.\\n\\nThere's no reason to blow up the offense that Ben McAdoo has developed in his two years as coordinator. The scheme, in which quarterback Eli Manning has thrived, is the best thing the Giants have going for them after another dismal 6-10 finish.\\n\\nSure, McAdoo is associated with the Giants failure to a degree. But his top 10-ranked unit can't be blamed for the collapse of the league's worst-ranked defense, or the game-management mishaps that too often doomed New York.\\n\\nEli Manning gets emotional on day Giants coach Tom Coughlin steps down\\n\\nKeeping the continuity of that McAdoo's system – and building around that scheme – needs to count for a lot about now. And it may be now or never to hand the reins over to McAdoo as Coughlin's successor.\\n\\nMcAdoo's name is on the rather expansive list of candidates lined to the Philadelphia Eagles' in the search to replace Chip Kelly, so the risk of losing a valuable intellectual property to a division rival is staring the Giants' brain trust square in the face.\\n\\nOf course, the decision-makers – including co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch, and general manager Jerry Reese – owe it to themselves and their supporters to carry out due diligence.\\n\\nNew Orleans Saints coach Sean Payton, a former Giants assistant, would undoubtedly represent an attractive alternative should he become available.\\n\\nMcAdoo, 38, hasn't been a head coach before, so there's that bit of uncertainty.\\n\\nNFL coaching carousel: Breaking down every hire\\n\\nYet the lack of head coaching experience can't be the defining factor. Payton was never a head coach before joining the Saints a decade ago. Back in the '80s, Bill Parcells was a first-time coach when promoted from defensive coordinator. Like Coughlin, Parcells won two Super Bowls with the Giants.\\n\\nThe essential factor in McAdoo's case should be this: the Giants have had two years to get a sense of how he will interact with the players, management and personnel staff. There's been ample opportunity to get a feel on how he'll handle stress and adversity, which New York had plenty of this season in blowing so many games in crunch time. They should know whether he is truly worthy of the praise he enjoys as an up-and-coming head coach of the future.\\n\\nAnd look at his work, reflected by the quarterback. Manning threw a career-high 35 TD passes this season, and had the highest passer rating (93.6) of his career. He had the two seasons with the highest number of passing attempts in his career, and in each of the past two seasons had his lowest interception rate (2.3%) since 2008.\\n\\nHe has a level of comfort and efficiency in the offense that works. It's logical to keep Manning, 35, in the same system, rather than putting him in another new scheme.\\n\\nSomething had to change. Since the Giants stung the Patriots in Super Bowl XLVI, they've missed the playoffs for four consecutive seasons.\\n\\nBut not everything needs to change for the Giants.\\n\\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell.\\n\\nPHOTOS: NFL coaching carousel"}
{"original": "As another Miller child is diagnosed with a lethal disease, Nemours doctors open clinic to help sick Amish children Nemours doctors open a clinic to help sick Amish children – hoping it will serve as a blueprint for all Delaware children.\\n\\nRead Part I of Saving Grace: Over the course of two decades, three children of a Dover Amish family have died of a rare disease that doctors, at the time, did not have a name for. When their cousin Grace Miller is born in 2016, doctors realize she has the same condition — yet will she have the same fate?\\n\\nA memorial to John David sits outside Laura and Toby Miller's bedroom door.\\n\\nHis crib.\\n\\nIn it are the yellow flyswatter and red mini-football that were his favorite toys. A traditional Amish outfit — turquoise shirt, black pants and suspenders — is laid out on the mattress.\\n\\nA wind chime with John David's name etched on it sings in the breeze outside the family's front door, a gift from Nemours doctors and nurses.\\n\\nLaura and Toby don't yet have a tombstone for their son's grave. But make no mistake, John David is in almost every room of this Dover home.\\n\\nIt's four months since John David's January 2015 death when the Millers receive a handwritten letter from the Clinic for Special Children. A geneticist expresses her condolences and writes that she might have some insight into what killed their son.\\n\\nWhen the Millers are ready, she'd like to talk to them.\\n\\nWeeks later, Laura and Toby, accompanied by their Uncle Ervin and Aunt Betsy, make the trip to Strasburg, Pennsylvania, to hear the news.\\n\\nMonths before John David died at the age of 25 months, the family had taken him to the clinic for genetic testing, hoping doctors would find a mutation to explain the toddler's failing health.\\n\\nBut researchers didn't know what they were looking for. And the chance of finding a single mutation is like trying to find one misspelled word in a lengthy novel.\\n\\nAfter several months, geneticists narrowed John David's disease to three mutations. Thanks to preserved tissue samples of his cousins Carolyn and Martha Ann — who died in 1997 and 2005 — doctors found all three Miller babies shared the same mutation, called YARS, after the gene involved.\\n\\nThis mutation prevented their bodies from correctly building proteins, affecting the function of all of their organs.\\n\\nSome in the Amish community thought the Miller families put their babies through too much — too much testing, too much medication, too much time in the hospital.\\n\\nNothing the doctors tried could save Carolyn or Martha Ann or John David.\\n\\nBut could it save cousin Grace?\\n\\nSaving Grace: How precision medicine is helping Grace Miller Grace Miller was born with a condition that three of her cousins died from. Yet she's reaching milestones her cousins never had. Jennifer Corbett, Delaware News Journal\\n\\nThe diagnosis Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nBaby Grace has spent the first four months of her life in the intensive care unit at Nemours/A.I. duPont Hospital for Children. Born nine weeks premature, she needs round-the-clock care.\\n\\nIt's here that doctors notice she isn't gaining weight or developing as expected. To figure out what's wrong, Grace needs to undergo genetic testing. As Thelma signs the consent papers at the hospital, she sees the word YARS on the form.\\n\\nIs this one of the genetic mutations they were testing for?\\n\\nThe doctors nod.\\n\\nThelma's stomach drops. She knows instantly her daughter has the same disease that killed other Amish babies. A phone call a few weeks later confirms it.\\n\\nGrace is the fifth baby in the Miller family — and only the seventh in the country — to be diagnosed with a disease now called YARSopathy. Her cousin Mary Beth was diagnosed a few months earlier.\\n\\nWhen it's time for Thelma and Buddy to take Grace home, Thelma is overwhelmed, remembering what Laura went through with John David. Constant care. Memorizing dosages of as many as 16 medications at one time. Very little sleep.\\n\\nBut her experience with Grace is different, partly because Nemours doctors feel more confident about taking a wait-and-see attitude. There is no rushing to the emergency room, no stays in the intensive care unit. Grace does have surgery for a feeding tube. Slowly, she begins to gain weight.\\n\\nThe baby soon starts physical therapy. Therapist Cindy Burritt realizes Grace is strong-willed as she works with her to become comfortable lying on her tummy.\\n\\nWhile Thelma sees Grace developing more than John David did as an infant, it's still unclear how much time her daughter has.\\n\\nIt's early 2017, Nemours doctors believe children with YARS likely won't live beyond their second birthday.\\n\\nThat's about to change.\\n\\n'We wouldn't know anything without John David' Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nGrace is transfixed by the Apple Watch.\\n\\nShe's 16 months old now, and her narrow eyes stare at the black screen as gray text message bubbles pop up. She reaches out with her pointer finger to tap the black screen.\\n\\nShe's oblivious to the adults around her. They are talking about how her eyes seem more steady, how her belly seems chubbier — a result of her gaining 2 pounds.\\n\\nThis is all good, Dr. Matt Demczko tells her mother, Thelma. Really good.\\n\\nGrace and her mother are here, at the Nemours' Kinder Clinic in Dover, on this warm February 2018 day for a regular checkup.\\n\\nThe toddler, dressed only in a diaper, is still focused on the watch when her physical therapist lifts Grace from her lap and onto the exam table. Grace tucks in her knees and rolls.\\n\\nHoly smokes, Demczko blurts out. I'm getting teary eyed. I never saw her do that before.\\n\\nRolling over. A milestone most babies hit around 4 to 6 months. Some of Grace's cousins never hit this milestone. They never heard their mothers' voices; they never took their own steps. They died by age 2.\\n\\nSmall moments such as these matter to Demczko and Thelma.\\n\\nI'm over the moon, Demczko says.\\n\\nThelma's response isn't about her own daughter.\\n\\nWe wouldn't know anything without John David, she says.\\n\\nThe perfect medical home\\n\\nThe Clinic for Special Children, located in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, has treated sick Amish and Mennonite children for almost three decades. It has served as an inspiration for the Nemours Kinder Clinic Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nNemours doctors have long wanted to create the perfect medical home. A place where a team of doctors provide patients the best kind of primary care, yet the cost is as inexpensive as possible to patients' families.\\n\\nTwo years ago, they realized the Amish are the key to learning how to build it.\\n\\nFor years, the hospital has worked with the Clinic for Special Children, which has cared for sick Amish and Mennonite children in Lancaster County for three decades.\\n\\nIn that time, this small clinic has learned to look at a child's genetics when providing care, in some cases giving children better lives by preventing them from needing a wheelchair or suffering from severe brain trauma.\\n\\nThis kind of care, which the clinic offers at low costs, is expected to be the future of medicine. It's often called precision medicine.\\n\\nAn Amish mother and her two young children walk through a hallway in the Clinic for Special Children in Strasburg, Pennsylvania. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nBecause Plain communities are so insular, the genetic diseases seen in the Amish of Lancaster County aren't typically seen in the Dover Amish. It's also often a challenge for Delaware families to travel to Strasburg because it's more than two hours away.\\n\\nNemours saw an opportunity: They wanted to emulate the work of the Clinic for Special Children, as well as increase their reach in Dover. Fortunately, the hospital had the physical space.\\n\\nIn August of 2017, the Nemours Kinder Clinic opened in Dover. The space also serves non-Amish patients, with separate waiting and exam rooms for the Amish. Wood accents frame the walls, which are dotted with paintings of the countryside and farm animals.\\n\\nDr. Jay Greenspan, the chair of the pediatrics department at Nemours, hopes to apply the clinic model of medicine to all children in Delaware.\\n\\nMy dream of where this is going is we take this model in Dover and use it as a way to say, 'Look, we can save a lot of money and heartache by understanding the genetics,' he says. If you mapped out Delaware, there's less than a million people.\\n\\nYou can use Delaware to become the next step for the medical home.\\n\\nMedicine, in a whole new light\\n\\nDr. Matt Demczko, a doctor who helps run the Nemours Kinder Clinic in Dover, examines a young Amish boy. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nEnter Drs. Michael Fox and Matt Demczko.\\n\\nThey are college buddies. Both graduated from Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster County. They grew up in central Pennsylvania. During their undergrad, both spent time at the Clinic for Special Children.\\n\\nDemczko, who became a chief resident at Nemours, is one of the young doctors who helped treat John David Miller during the child's last month. The experience helped open his eyes to the kind of medicine he wanted to practice: helping medically complex children.\\n\\nNemours asks Demczko to run the Dover clinic shortly after he completed his residency. Demczko suggests his good friend Mike join him.\\n\\nDr. Michael Fox is one of the two doctors who run Nemours Kinder Clinic in Dover. He specializes in diagnosing and caring for medically complex children. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nBoth Fox and Demczko spend six months, at different times, at the Clinic for Special Children in unofficial fellowships. Under medical director Dr. Kevin Strauss, they learn how to care for Amish and Mennonite families. Nemours rents a house for them, so they can be embedded in the community.\\n\\nIt was one of those experiences that changes you as a physician, I think, Demczko says. It makes you see medicine in a whole different light.\\n\\nA discovery and a new sense of hope\\n\\nAfter its official founding, Nemours joins the Plain Community Health Consortium. The members include the Clinic for Special Children and similar clinics from Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin.\\n\\nEvery quarter, the doctors meet via conference call to share cases that they are having difficulty diagnosing. In spring 2017, Dr. Olivia Wenger, medical director of the New Leaf Center in Ohio, presents a case that has puzzled her for years.\\n\\nHer patient, a 5-year-old Amish girl, has kidney problems, developmental delays and early-stage liver failure. She has seen specialists throughout Ohio and at the Mayo Clinic. She has undergone millions of dollars of genetic testing — yet no one can pinpoint a diagnosis.\\n\\nAs the Ohio doctor began listing her patient's symptoms, Fox and Dr. Katie Williams, then a geneticist at the Clinic for Special Children, look at each other and mouth the words:\\n\\nThis is YARS.\\n\\nAlmost immediately, the girl's blood sample is sent to the Clinic for Special Children.\\n\\nTwo days later, the geneticist confirms the 5-year-old has YARS. The test cost $50.\\n\\nThe Ohio girl is the oldest known living person in the country with this disease. She can walk and talk. She's learning numbers and letters. She has cochlear implants and shares physical features, such as deep-set eyes, with Grace and Mary Beth, the other Delaware child with YARS.\\n\\nWhen Fox and Demczko tell Grace and MaryBeth's parents about the girl, tears well in Thelma's and Mary's eyes.\\n\\nBoth mothers expected months, not years, with their daughters.\\n\\nAfter meeting with the doctors, Mary — curious about the genetic links between Delaware and Ohio — collects church directories and family histories that detail information about members and their children.\\n\\nOn scratch paper, she maps a family tree and shows how the children with YARS are related.\\n\\nFox says it takes genetic counselors years to learn how to do this correctly.\\n\\nDoctors still use Mary's family tree in their research.\\n\\nA Miller family relative created a family tree after learning there was a child in Ohio with the same rare genetic condition. Courtesy of Mike Fox\\n\\nThelma and her husband, Buddy, meet the Ohio girl a few months later when they are nearby for a family reunion. Thelma is struck by how much she looks like an older version of Grace, complete with a halo of gold hair.\\n\\nIt gave me a lot of hope, she says, that Grace has a chance for a normal life.\\n\\nWhen less, is more\\n\\nThelma Miller holds the poem she wrote for John David Miller, who died of a condition that her daughter Grace has. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nIn Thelma and Buddy's Dover home, just above Grace's pink polka dot changing table, hangs a name verse poem Thelma wrote in honor of John David. It's the same one Toby and Laura have in their home.\\n\\nD...Decisions Mom and Dad had to make A...A.I. duPont a familiar place V… Veins They were so hard to find I…Intensive care you needed sometimes D...Dear parents and sisters so kind.\\n\\nFrom the beginning of her life, Grace has a distinct advantage over John David. She is diagnosed much earlier, at a time when doctors have a better understanding of how patients' bodies adapt to the changes the mutation causes.\\n\\nJohn David's lab tests caused such concern for his doctors they felt they had to keep intervening medically, Demczko says.\\n\\nBut it turned into a Whack-a-mole situation. When doctors tried to fix something for John David, another serious condition would present itself.\\n\\nWith Grace, the doctors stop aggressively intervening. Instead, they cautiously monitor her. So far, it's working well to spare her the agony and cost of aggressive treatment, and she's developing more than John David.\\n\\nWhen he was alive, the toddler was hospitalized 14 times. Together, Grace and cousin Mary Beth are hospitalized four times. John David underwent five surgeries; the girls undergo surgeries for a feeding tube and cochlear implants.\\n\\nJohn David needed 29 infusions. Grace has not had one.\\n\\nSomehow their bodies learn to manage it, Demczko says. And it does its best when we kind of take a step back and keep our hands off.\\n\\nOne example: John David received regular infusions of albumin, a protein the liver produces, because his levels were about 50 percent lower than normal.\\n\\nWith Grace, doctors accept that her albumin levels are always going to be low. Instead of giving her an infusion, which didn't help John David, they monitor her instead.\\n\\nWho's to say John David's experience will be the same for Grace and Marybeth? Fox says.\\n\\nMaybe it will be like the Ohio girl's, he says.\\n\\nOr maybe even better.\\n\\nA mother's determination Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nWhen Thelma was pregnant with her first child, doctors told her there was no chance for her unborn baby.\\n\\nIt was 2006 and doctors told the then-21-year-old, who was nearing the end of her second trimester, that her unborn baby was underdeveloped. Its head was at 23 weeks, its body at 25 weeks. The baby would not be alive at birth, doctors said.\\n\\nAbout 10 weeks later, Thelma went into labor in her home. She prepared herself to cradle a silent baby. But when Joanna was born, she was pink. She instantly began to cry.\\n\\nThelma and her husband, Buddy, got 16 months with their Joanna before she died of complications related to primordial dwarfism. Looking back, Thelma feels she was ignored by the doctors, that her voice as Joanna's mother didn't matter.\\n\\nWith Grace, things would be different, Thelma decides when she's born.\\n\\nDemzcko and Fox attribute many of Grace's milestones to Thelma.\\n\\nThe mother of four — all of whom are under age 8 — reads any book she can get her hands on that details how the body works and the impact nutrition can have on one's health. Maybe something in there can help Grace, she thinks.\\n\\nWhen Grace has severe acid reflux, doctors prescribe her different medications. Yet it doesn't go away. Thelma thinks there might be another option and calls a cousin who works with babies with reflux. The cousin recommends a probiotic.\\n\\nThelma tries it for Grace, and not long after, the reflux goes away. Although there's no medical research involving this probiotic, the doctors recognize it has helped Grace. They are open to Thelma trying homeopathic methods.\\n\\nGrace Miller walks toward her physical therapist Cindy Burritt during an at-home physical therapy appointment. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nBefore Grace underwent surgery for cochlear implants, Thelma prepares to learn sign language and teach it to Grace and her children. She plans to give her daughter a sign name — used to identify a person — that translates to determined.\\n\\nWhen the Millers go on family outings or attend church, Thelma props Grace on her hip or pulls her in a wagon.\\n\\nLeaving Grace behind is not an option, even though Thelma admits there are times when it's easier. She wants Grace to experience normal life — to hear music and partake in conversations the best she can.\\n\\nGetting there comes with immense challenges. Grace sometimes has crying fits, overwhelmed with the new sounds she can hear from the cochlear implants.\\n\\nBut Thelma will not turn them off.\\n\\nThis summer, Grace Miller underwent surgery for cochlear implants. It was a procedure John David was never able to have. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nIt's going to be rewarding in the long run, she says. That's why I stick to it. Because it's not fun to make your baby fussy if she would be happy otherwise.\\n\\nShe pauses.\\n\\nI have to tell myself it's going to be worth it in the long run.\\n\\n'You're going to have a different course of life' Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nDoctors fear YARSopathy isn't the only fatal genetic disease among the Dover Amish.\\n\\nThe Nemours doctors want to know what they and the community are up against. In order to do this, they need to collect Amish families' DNA to study. A grant of $80,000 has helped kickstart the research.\\n\\nErin Crowgey, research associate director of bioinformatics at Nemours, has developed a DNA test that will screen for 1,300 genetic mutations. Nemours researchers hope every U.S. clinic that treats the Amish will one day use this test on newborns, their parents and even young couples who don't yet have children.\\n\\nWe're trying to better say, 'Oh, you are a carrier for this rare disorder. That's great that you're going to deliver your baby with a midwife at home. But you need to be prepared for the fact that he might have this very toxic disorder, Crowgey says. If they aren't seen really quickly, your medical costs are going to be astronomical.\\n\\nYou're going to have a different course of life, she says.\\n\\nThe kind of testing is not just for the Amish: In the past decade, there has been a boom in genomic medicine. At Nemours, researchers use the same technology to help children with cancer.\\n\\nAn example of a blood test that the Clinic for Special Children, in Strasburg, Pennsylvania, uses with Amish families. This test helps determine if a patient has a genetic disorder. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nBut this kind of genetic testing is easier to do with the Amish, Fox says. The community has a closed population, meaning there are certain genetic problems they know exist only within the group — and dozens and dozens they can rule out.\\n\\nBecause geneticists know what to look for with the Amish, they can complete a test in a matter of hours.\\n\\nThat's not yet possible for most people, Fox says. But the day will come, he says, when people will not talk about the symptoms of an illness, but its genetic basis.\\n\\nThough it's still unclear how interested Amish families, especially young couples who don't have children, will be in genetic testing.\\n\\nDonald Kraybill, a professor at Elizabethtown College and a leading expert in the Amish culture, says many in the community have started to accept modern health care, including genetic testing.\\n\\nThe Amish, on one hand, appear to be conservative and traditional, Kraybill says. On the other hand, they are quietly open to science.\\n\\nIt's remarkable.\\n\\nIn the years following the death of John David, parents Toby and Laura have become two of the Kinder Clinic's biggest advocates. They sit on its board and are the first people Nemours doctors call when they have a question about Amish culture.\\n\\nBut in late November, it's eight of 11 Dover Amish bishops that Demczko and Fox meet with. In the Amish schoolhouse, next to the cemetery where John David, Martha Ann and Joanna are buried, the doctors explain their hope for genetic testing.\\n\\nToby and Laura Miller's son John David died at age 25 months. At the time of his death, he died of a disease doctors did not have a name for. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nThe elders recommend Nemours conduct the testing a day or two before church services if it's OK with the community member hosting the Sunday service in their home.\\n\\nNot everyone in the community will want genetic testing, the bishops warn the doctors.\\n\\nThat's fine to Demczko and Fox. It's a start.\\n\\nLaura and Toby had their four daughters tested when John David was at the Clinic for Special Children. Their youngest son had not been born then.\\n\\nBefore all of this happened, I would have said no, Toby says. I would have pushed it away.\\n\\nThree of the four girls are carriers. The family doesn't know which ones, at least right now.\\n\\nOnce they get older, they can make that choice for themselves, Laura says. I don't want that weighing on their minds as they're growing up.\\n\\nBecause they were old enough. They saw firsthand.\\n\\nA step forward Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nCareful, Thelma says, looking down at Grace in her pale blue dress and tall gray socks. You're going too fast.\\n\\nNow 26 months, the toddler has just slid to the tile hospital floor. Almost instantly, she pops back up and continues taking small, teetering steps down a hallway off the Nemours lobby.\\n\\nThelma holds her hand. Walking is Grace's favorite thing to do, she says.\\n\\nIn the past six months, Grace has hit two milestones: She's taken her first steps and recognized her mother's voice. Her face is more animated. She babbles. She belly laughs. She's breaking into Thelma's kitchen cabinets, forcing mom to baby-proof.\\n\\nWhile Grace has never stayed at Nemours for long periods, she's at the hospital every Monday for hourlong speech therapy appointments.\\n\\nThelma and her family recently spent Thanksgiving with John David's family.\\n\\nWhenever the Millers are together, Thelma often notices how Toby's and Laura's faces light up when they see Grace.\\n\\nThelma once asked Toby if it was hard for him to see Grace, to see how well she is doing. John David could be this far along if doctors had known everything, she tells him.\\n\\nToby's reply: It makes everything John David went through worth it.\\n\\nThelma Miller holds her daughter Grace's hand. Doctors credit Thelma for why Grace has been able to hit so many milestones. Jennifer Corbett, The News Journal\\n\\nEven though Grace has lived longer than John David and Carolyn and Martha Ann, doctors are still unsure of her life expectancy.\\n\\nHer disease is still considered lethal.\\n\\nBut one day, maybe soon, Nemours doctors and therapists hope she will say her first few words. Thelma has a different goal in mind.\\n\\nShe just wants her daughter to recognize the sound of her own name.\\n\\nGrace.\\n\\nAbout this project\\n\\nSaving Grace is based on hours of interviews with Amish families, doctors, nurses, geneticists and Antabaptist experts over the course of a year. Many of these scenes were re-created through interviews, while others were observed by the reporter and photographer. The Amish families welcomed us into their homes and to doctor appointments. They asked that no photos be taken of their faces, due to their religious belief and Delaware Online respected their wishes.\\n\\nAbout the reporter\\n\\nMeredith Newman is the health reporter for Delaware Online.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nEAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) — Miles Bridges soared from the right side of the lane, grabbed a lob pass with two hands and slammed the basketball on his first possession in more than a month. Michigan State's standout freshman later blocked a shot and sprinted to the other end of the court, leaping for a one-handed dunk off another tossed pass.\\n\\nBridges finished with six points and six rebounds in a 17-minute return from an ankle injury and Eron Harris scored 24 points, helping the Spartans beat Rutgers 93-65 Wednesday night.\\n\\nIt felt great to be out there, Bridges said.\\n\\nMichigan State's leading scorer and rebounder played for the first time a loss Nov. 29 at Duke, missing seven games with a sprained ankle.\\n\\nThe trainers and my teammates helped me through the process, Bridges said. They're easing me back in there.\\n\\nBridges was welcomed by cheers when he checked in at the 15:56 mark of the first half and made the crowd roar with his alley-oop dunk off a lob from Matt McQuaid, finishing a play that coach Tom Izzo called during the timeout.\\n\\nI thought it might be good for our players, it might good for fans, it might be good for us, and it definitely might be good for him, Izzo said. We set it up and we didn't know if it would work. It did. It was a great pass. And, I thought that took the weight of the world off his shoulders.\\n\\nNick Ward had 15 points and McQuaid scored 12 for the Spartans (11-5, 3-0 Big Ten) to help them with their fourth straight game. Each of the Spartans who had more than 2 minutes of playing time scored and combined to make 58 percent of their shots.\\n\\nI actually thought we defended them until I looked at the numbers, Rutgers coach Steve Pikiell said.\\n\\nRUTGERS' BRIEF RUN\\n\\nThe Scarlet Knights (11-5, 3-0) started strong, scoring the first six points of the game, before being overmatched as they often have in Big Ten play. Rutgers' Corey Sanders scored a season-high 22, Nigel Johnson had 15 points and C.J. Gettys added 10. The Scarlet Knights made just 12 of 27 free throws.\\n\\nI wanted to substitute and kind of slow the pace down, Pikiell said. Our game plan going in was to chop this thing up and have that horn blowing. We left so many free throws on the table and some timely turnovers down the stretch. They're relentless in their transition game and eventually they got us a few times.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nRutgers: The Scarlet Knights have not won a Big Ten road game in two-plus years in the conference and will likely have to pull off a stunner to change that this season. Rutgers has only one Big Ten victory, in last year's regular season finale, since upsetting No. 4 Wisconsin on Jan. 11, 2015.\\n\\nIzzo insisted he has the Scarlet Knights improve since last year.\\n\\nThey're more discipline, he said. They're more structured. And, they're big.\\n\\nMichigan State: The Spartans need Harris and fellow shooting guard McQuaid to shoot as they did against Rutgers. Bridges will create space on the floor, but it is up to Harris and McQuaid to take advantage of it by making open shots. Harris was 5 of 8 on 3-pointers and McQuaid was 2 of 3 beyond the arc.\\n\\nIt was nice to get Eron Harris going a little bit, and McQuaid going a bit, Izzo said.\\n\\nCONSISTENTLY INCONSISTENT\\n\\nHarris scored as many points against Rutgers as he had in the previous three games combined.\\n\\nHe's been consistently inconsistent, Izzo said.\\n\\nThe senior scored a season-high 31 against Florida Gulf Coast in November, but scored just three points two games later in a loss to Baylor and he scored only two points early in the season against Kentucky.\\n\\nI have to do my job if this team is going to win, Harris acknowledged.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nRutgers plays Sunday at Iowa.\\n\\nMichigan State plays Saturday against Penn State in Philadelphia at the famed Palestra.\\n\\nIt's going to be thrilling for me, Izzo said.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nKAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) — The winners-only field at Kapalua features four Australians, which is not unusual.\\n\\nIt's who they are.\\n\\nYeah, Jason, I'm surprised he's in here, Rod Pampling said with a laugh.\\n\\nJason Day, the No. 1 player in the world, might be the only Aussie in the SBS Tournament of Champions that anyone recognizes.\\n\\nPampling has been to Kapalua twice before, though it had been 10 years. He won the Bay Hill Invitational in 2006 for his second PGA Tour victory. The longer he stayed away, the more he had reason to wonder if he would ever get back.\\n\\nAnd then he won in Las Vegas, ending a drought of 218 tour events without a trophy.\\n\\nDitto for Aaron Baddeley, who had no idea what was wrong with his swing two years ago. He started last season with limited status, got into enough events to find his rhythm and won in a playoff at the Barbasol Championship opposite the British Open.\\n\\nAs for Greg Chalmers?\\n\\nHe had never won in 381 starts on the PGA Tour and had lost his PGA Tour card in 2014. The 43-year-old Australian was playing the Web.com Tour, and the only reason Chalmers got into the Barracuda Championship in Reno, Nevada, was because it was opposite a World Golf Championship. Chalmers has made at least 150 cuts on tour and is classified a veteran member.\\n\\nAt No. 490 in the world, he had the worst ranking of any PGA Tour winner last year.\\n\\nShowing up at Kapalua, looking down the fairway at the expanse of Pacific and feeling the tropical air on his cheeks was the latest reminder of his victory, and how quickly lives and careers can change.\\n\\nThis is unbelievable, Chalmers said. Twelve months ago, I was getting ready to go to Panama, for crying out loud, and struggling to get status on the Web.com.\\n\\nThis is the good life, and they appreciate it more than most.\\n\\nChalmers first joined the PGA Tour in 1999, the year David Duval rose to No. 1 in the world and when the Tournament of Champions was first held at Kapalua. He had won the Australian Open and the Australian PGA Championship twice each. Still, it was frustrating to not be able to win on the strongest tour in the world. He had only a pair of runner-up finishes in his career, most recently to Tiger Woods in the 2009 Buick Open.\\n\\nLook, what I keep saying is that not everybody wins, he said. There are 200 guys on this tour and only 30-odd winners every year. We're spoiled with some top players who win multiple times. They make it look easy, but it's not. When you get it done, it's very exciting.\\n\\nPampling had not felt the Sunday nerves in America since he finished one shot behind Phil Mickelson at Colonial in 2008. He opened with a career-best 60 in Las Vegas, lost the lead with a 71 on Saturday and then held his own against Brooks Koepka and Lucas Glover down the stretch.\\n\\nThe rest was a blur. Pampling rushed to the airport, arrived home to Dallas in the early morning hours and was up before dawn.\\n\\nI watched the tournament — my wife had taped it — and I was double-checking to make sure it happened, Pampling said. It's daunting to look down at your phone and see that you've got 300 text messages. But man, it's good.\\n\\nBaddeley once was Australia's brightest young star. He was an 18-year-old amateur who took down Greg Norman and Colin Montgomerie to win the Australian Open in 1999, and he won his national open the following year as a pro. He won three times on the PGA Tour, including at Riviera in 2011. But his swing got out of whack and he couldn't figure out how to fix it until hooking up with Scott Hamilton in the summer of 2015.\\n\\nThe rest was a matter of being patient, even after missing his card at the Web.com Tour Finals last year and deciding to use his past champion's status to get by.\\n\\nI thought I could get 11 or 12 starts, maybe get an invite or two, and I was playing well enough to finish in the top 10 and play my way into other events, Baddeley said. People around me were more stressed than I was. I was like, 'Relax, it's OK.'\\n\\nHe won in a playoff over Si Woo Kim, and life was good again.\\n\\nAll three Aussies cited the biggest perk as being able to set a schedule as a PGA Tour winner. They don't have to worry about what tournaments they might get in, sometimes only knowing at the last minute.\\n\\nPampling is the only one who secured a spot in the Masters with his victory because it wasn't held opposite a bigger event.\\n\\nAnd that other perk? Being in Maui to start a new year.\\n\\nChalmers was asked if he or Pampling would be more thrilled to be at Kapalua, and it was an easy answer. Pampling had been here before.\\n\\nAnd he already had a (PGA Tour) card, Chalmers added. But I would say at this stage in our careers, both of us are very, very grateful."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nALLEN PARK, Mich. (AP) — Bob Quinn had a lot to answer for during a rare news conference.\\n\\nThe Detroit general manager spoke for over 40 minutes Friday, recapping a disappointing season in which the Lions went 6-10. A year ago around this time, Detroit fired coach Jim Caldwell after back-to-back 9-7 campaigns. Quinn said then he felt the team was capable of more, but the Lions struggled from the start in 2018 under new coach Matt Patricia.\\n\\nDisappointing season for us overall, on the whole. All of us kind of had high expectations going into this year, Quinn said. My position as the general manager here, I'm accountable, I'm responsible. I put this team together, and I feel like we have a good team. We didn't win as much as we should have this year.\\n\\nQuinn said in no uncertain terms that he has confidence in quarterback Matthew Stafford, whose future with Detroit has been the subject of some speculation after he threw for 3,777 yards this season, his lowest total since 2010. Quinn said he feels the Lions can win a Super Bowl with him.\\n\\nMatthew Stafford's our quarterback. He will be our quarterback here, Quinn said. This guy's a really talented player, and myself, the coaches need to put him in better situations.\\n\\nStafford turns 31 next month and just finished his 10th season with the Lions, who drafted him with the first overall pick in 2009. He threw four interceptions in an opening-game loss to the New York Jets that set the tone for the season.\\n\\nQuinn takes questions from reporters so infrequently that on Friday he still faced queries about issues that came up before the start of the season. In May, the Detroit News reported that Patricia and a friend were indicted 22 years earlier by a Texas grand jury on one count each of aggravated sexual assault. The accuser did not testify and the case was dismissed.\\n\\nPatricia maintained his innocence in a news conference after that report. Quinn was at that news conference but did not speak. On Friday, Quinn said he found out about the allegations not long before the report.\\n\\nI first found out about it a couple days before the article came out, Quinn said. Matt had got wind that the article was going to come out and came and told me. So we had extensive conversations with myself, ownership (and team president Rod Wood) about everything.\\n\\nQuinn said the issue had not come up during a standard background check during the hiring process, and he indicated such background checks are beyond his area of expertise.\\n\\nI'm not paid to do extensive background checks. I'm here to select a head coach, Quinn said. I'm very comfortable with Matt Patricia as our head coach.\\n\\nPatricia's first year was a rocky one for the Lions on the field and off, and Detroit fans may not have much patience if things don't improve quickly in 2019.\\n\\nHe's very self-aware, Quinn said. He has a good understanding of his strengths, his limitations. He's going to take this offseason, as we all do, to look back and say, hey, what can I change? Because obviously, we've got to do better.\\n\\nDetroit is now in the market for a new offensive coordinator after deciding not to renew Jim Bob Cooter's contract .\\n\\nWe need to do a better job of going into each week, looking at the opponent, and saying, how are we going to beat this team? They have a great run defense and a poor pass defense, maybe we throw it 45 times. And vice versa, Quinn said. We want someone that thinks that way. That thinks that, hey, I have an offense, but my offense is adaptable.\\n\\nDetroit's late-October trade that sent Golden Tate to Philadelphia didn't help the offense. The Lions were 3-4 at the time and faced the possibility of losing Tate to free agency. They received a third-round draft pick for him.\\n\\nIt was just an offer that we really couldn't refuse, for what the value was, and for what we had left of the player, which was eight games, Quinn said. We felt we had a balanced offense at that time.\\n\\nThe next big name to depart could be defensive end Ziggy Ansah, whom the Lions kept this season on the franchise tag but who played in only seven games because of injury problems.\\n\\nZiggy fought through some things this year, Quinn said while remaining noncommittal about Ansah's future. Ziggy's extremely, extremely tough. I'm proud of him being a Detroit Lion.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Noah Trister at www.Twitter.com/noahtrister"}

His Los Angeles-based firm QueensBridge Venture Partners has backed start-ups from Dropbox to Lyft.\\n\\nNas is an investor in Walker & Company, which introduced the trimmer on Monday as part of its Bevel shaving line. He also stars in a promotional video for the Bevel trimmer ($179.95, designed for barbers and consumers working with coarse or curly hair.)\\n\\nWalker's Bevel wants slice of trimmer market\\n\\nNas talked with USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn.This interview has been edited and condensed.\\n\\nWhy did you invest in Walker & Co. Brands?\\n\\nTristan was recommended by a mutual friend. I was interested in his business and he was interested in me. I listened to him and I was immediately impacted by what he said because the product that he has is something that is close to me. It's grooming. It's haircuts. It's the barbershop in the hood. The barber is somebody who has always been important in all communities but especially the black community. I was just happy to see someone represent that.\\n\\nWhy are you lending your name and image to promote the new Bevel trimmer?\\n\\nI'm a big traveler and everywhere I go for years people say: My son wants a haircut like you, he wants the Nas cut. I started to notice that people like my haircut. So this is something I have been walking toward, in the direction of hair products, for a long time. So it just made the most sense.\\n\\nWhat kind of input did you and your barber Marcus Harvey give Bevel on the new trimmer?\\n\\nIt's just exciting to see someone taking it to another level. Marcus, he's an artist. He's really good at what he does, he cuts hair for TV shows, movies. All kinds of people from all walks of life coming in for haircuts.\\n\\nBarbers stand on their feet for hours and hold things in their hands all day long. We want them to be comfortable. Also these things are made to clean themselves. This is definitely state-of-the-art stuff. We were all pitching in to make sure this was the No. 1 clipper out there.\\n\\nHow important is it for Silicon Valley to make products for people of color?\\n\\nIt's really important because of the fact that there have been so many products out there for people of color that were not owned by people of color, and that matters. Tristan comes from a different way of thinking. Tristan comes into it seeing what's missing in the industry and it's important for him to change that, to add Bevel to the game and make Bevel the company making a difference in the new generation.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on the lack of diversity and lack of people of color represented in Silicon Valley?\\n\\nI think across the board things are starting to get better slowly.This is a tough challenge that needs to be addressed. There is really no perfect answer that can solve it today but there is progress being made.\\n\\nThere are so many players entering the game and changing the game, I am optimistic about the future of the tech world being more diverse. We all have to play our part and fight and not give up and make sure what we are doing is A1. Each one teach one, we need to pull more people in. There are so many bright people out there.\\n\\nIt would be a shame for people to go on the way they have in the past. People come from different backgrounds and they can provide the right thing for a company instead of 10 people from the same perspective trying to solve a problem. I'd like to push (tech) more in the community I am from. It's the new thing for the hustlers in the hood.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY senior technology writer Jessica Guynn @jguynn"}
{"original": "NEW ORLEANS — Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence's legacy was complete even before the Tigers' 49-28 loss to Ohio State in the College Football Playoff national semifinals.\\n\\nWith one national championship, a second appearance in the championship game and three playoff appearances to go with his 90 touchdown passes, Lawrence will go down as the one of the most accomplished college quarterbacks in recent history.\\n\\nYeah, just finishing with no regrets, Lawrence said Friday. Obviously tonight didn't go well, but I know that the way I prepared, the way this team prepared, and then just this whole year, the way we've carried ourselves, I'm proud of it. I don't have any regrets. There's not much I'd go back and change.\\n\\nANALYSIS: Clemson Tigers simply lost to a better college football team in Ohio State\\n\\nMORE: Sorry college football, but Alabama at its best simply seems untouchable\\n\\nIf there is any asterisk on an otherwise shining college career, however, it would be in the results of his two trips to the Superdome, the site of his only losses as the starter.\\n\\nIn both games, against Ohio State and in last year's championship game against LSU, Lawrence was outplayed by an opposing quarterback who decimated Clemson's defense. LSU's Joe Burrow threw for five touchdowns last January. While Lawrence still threw for 400 yards and two scores in the Sugar Bowl, his performance was lost behind Justin Fields' six touchdowns and more than 400 yards of total offense.\\n\\nWhile his execution Friday will go down in Ohio State and playoff history, Fields' performance won't complicate one of the most predictable events of the NFL offseason: Lawrence going first overall to the Jacksonville Jaguars in this spring's draft.\\n\\nLawrence has been pegged for the top of the draft since late in his freshman season and cemented in that place since Burrow was taken by the Cincinnati Bengals last April, to the point where Jacksonville's duel with the New York Jets for the worst record in the NFL provided one of the most interesting subplots to the 2020 season.\\n\\nHaving secured that pick after the Jets won two games in December, the Jaguars now luck into having the chance at selecting a prospect long compared to Peyton Manning and talented enough to reverse the fortunes of one of the league's biggest underachievers.\\n\\nLawrence's arrival would signal a major step in the sweeping changes that await in the Jaguars' offseason. Jacksonville, 1-14 heading into the season finale against Indianapolis, has already fired general managed Dave Caldwell and is expected to dismiss head coach Doug Marrone.\\n\\nLawrence would immediately become the face of the franchise and bring stability and promise to a position that has cycled through wild instability since 2011. The Jaguars have used six different starting quarterbacks in the past three seasons, including three this year, and have failed to develop a long-term option in more than a decade.\\n\\nIn all, just three Jacksonville starters in the franchise's history have started more than 20 games and posted a winning record.\\n\\nFor prospective new coaches and general managers, the chance to build around Lawrence and put a new stamp on the franchise makes the Jaguars an attractive option. Three teams already have openings at both spots: Detroit, Atlanta and Houston.\\n\\nIt's become more common than ever for rookie quarterbacks to start immediately and produce at a high level. Before suffering a season-ending injury in November, Burrow averaged 268.8 passing yards per game with 18 total touchdowns for the Cincinnati Bengals. Justin Herbert, the sixth overall pick by the Los Angeles Chargers, has thrown for 4,034 yards and an NFL rookie-record 28 touchdowns.\\n\\nI mean, Trevor Lawrence is a generational guy, Clemson coach Dabo Swinney said. He's going to be a great player for a long, long time."}
{"original": "Within minutes of announcing the firing of head coach Steve Wilks after only one year on the job, the Cardinals on Monday moved rapidly in their search for his replacement following a brutal 3-13 season.\\n\\nAccording to various reports, the team has already reached out to at least six different candidates:\\n\\n*Adam Gase, who was fired by the Dolphins on Monday after three seasons.\\n\\n*Mike McCarthy, who was fired by the Packers on Dec. 2.\\n\\n*Chuck Pagano, former head coach of the Colts from 2012-17.\\n\\n*Jim Caldwell, former head coach of the Colts from 2019-11 and former head coach of the Lions from 2014-17.\\n\\n*Additionally, the Cardinals have sought permission from the Chiefs to interview offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy and the Rams to interview quarterbacks coach Zac Taylor. Both assistants are allowed to interview for promotions this week, if their respective teams permit it, while their clubs have a bye week before their playoff games begin.\\n\\nRELATED:Ranking NFL coaching vacancies: How attractive is Arizona Cardinals job?\\n\\nCardinals President Michael Bidwill did not mention any candidates by name during his news conference to announce the firing of Wilks, but he did say he feels the Cardinals' vacancy is the most attractive opportunity out there for a coach.\\n\\nWhen you look at this young franchise quarterback that we have (in Josh Rosen), the nucleus of talent that we have and the silver lining here is that we're going to (have) the first overall pick (in next year's NFL draft), not just in the first round but every round, and then we're first in the claims order when players are waived, Bidwill said. So that's going to give us a great opportunity. Plus, we have a lot of cap space, so this is the type of opportunity that I think is very, very attractive to coaching candidates.\\n\\nBidwill wouldn't say if he has a deadline in place to name a new head coach, but with seven other vacancies around the league, he and general manager Steve Keim, who is being retained, know they have to act fast.\\n\\nTaylor, 35, is seen as a hot commodity whom some insiders feel trends along the lines of his boss, Rams head coach Sean McVay, 32, and Bears head coach Matt Nagy, 40. But Taylor, like Wilks until this season, has never been a head coach at any level. Neither has Bieniemy, 49, one of the architects behind Kansas City's electrifying offense this season.\\n\\nIn his first year as coach of the Rams last season, McVay inherited a 4-12 team and turned Los Angeles into 11-5 NFC West champions. In his first year as coach of the Bears this season, Nagy turned Chicago from a 5-11 team to 12-4 NFC North champions.\\n\\nSOMERS:Michael Bidwill, Steve Keim must hire next Arizona Cardinals coach quickly\\n\\nThat's what the Cardinals obviously are hoping for, but there are no guarantees on how long it takes a new head coach to implement his system and the right roster.\\n\\nAsked how long he thinks it should take, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll told Arizona reporters last week on a conference call, I don't know. Ask Sean McVay. He couldn't have done it any faster. It just depends. It depends on the elements and the makeup of it all. Chicago has done a great job of jumping on it. It just depends.\\n\\nIn one regard, Carroll added, it only takes a few years to get your system in place and all that, but there are other guys who are able to do it quicker than that. Unfortunately, that's what you gauge it against and those guys make it harder for everybody.\\n\\nIt's unclear how many candidates the Cardinals plan to interview, and Bidwill would not say if he prefers an offensive-minded coach over a defensive-minded one, but other names possibly on their search list may likely include:\\n\\n*Josh McDaniels, 42, the offensive coordinator for the Patriots. He had a short, two-year run as head coach of the Broncos before eventually returning to New England. Last year, he accepted the head coaching position with the Colts only to bow out of the deal to remain with the Patriots.\\n\\n*John DeFilippo, 40, former offensive coordinator for the Vikings. He was a popular pick to become a head coach somewhere during his two seasons as quarterbacks coach of the Eagles from 2016-17, but some of his luster may have worn off after being dismissed by Minnesota earlier this season.\\n\\n*Jim Harbaugh, 55, head coach at the University of Michigan. Don't rule out the former 49ers' head coach returning to the NFL at some point, but Harbaugh has insisted he isn't looking to leave and only wants to win with the Wolverines. He would be one of the most sought-after coaches on the market if he were available, however.\\n\\n*David Shaw, 46, head coach at Stanford. Shaw has been at Stanford since 2011 and has shown no desire of leaving to coach in the NFL, but his name always gets mentioned as a desirable candidate.\\n\\n*Lincoln Riley, 35, head coach at the University of Oklahoma. He's a hot name with a ton of potential upside, but he might be a year or two away from being able to be lured out of college coaching. If he decides to be interviewed for one of the seven openings out there, that could change everything.\\n\\n*Brian Flores, 37, defensive coordinator of the Patriots. He's only in his first year in his new role after spending the past three seasons as New England's linebackers coach, but he's already snagged an interview with the Packers and is drawing interest from other teams as well.\\n\\n*Vic Fangio, 60, defensive coordinator for the Bears. He's been the DC for four other NFL teams in his career – the Panthers, Colts, Texans and 49ers – and has been in his current role since 2015. He's a dynamic defensive coach and an excellent teacher, but how would he do as a 60-year-old rookie head coach? The Cardinals gambled on an oldster in Bruce Arians and he turned out to be a steal of a hire.\\n\\nMORE:Cardinals players react to the firing of coach Steve Wilks after just one season\\n\\nOther candidates the Cardinals may pursue could include Matt LaFleur, offensive coordinator for the Titans, Pete Carmichael, offensive coordinator for the Saints, Mike Munchak, offensive line coach for the Steelers, and Gus Bradley, the current defensive coordinator for the Chargers and former defensive coordinator for the Seahawks and former head coach of the Jaguars.\\n\\nAsked how aggressive the Cardinals feel they have to be to land their new head coach and then quickly assemble a staff of new assistants, Bidwill wouldn't tip his hand.\\n\\nAgain, back to keeping our cards close to our vest, we're going to try to do the best we can to get the coach in, try to get the best coach and not look at a particular time line, he said.\\n\\nREAD MORE\\n\\nReach McManaman at bob.mcmanaman@arizonarepublic.com.

{"original": "Amir Vahdat and Jon Gambrell\\n\\nAssociated Press\\n\\nEHRAN, Iran — A series of eight earthquakes hit the Iran-Iraq border area and rattled even Baghdad and parts of the Iraqi countryside on Thursday, apparently aftershocks of a temblor in November that killed over 530 people. There were no immediate reports of injuries or damage.\\n\\nThe U.S. Geological Survey said seven of the quakes struck near the Iraqi city of Mandali and an eighth struck near Mehran in western Iran. All struck within an hour of each other, beginning at 0659 GMT.\\n\\nSeven had a preliminary magnitude of at least 5, while the eighth earthquake was a magnitude 4. Earthquakes of magnitude 5 and up to 5.9 are classified as moderate.\\n\\nIranian authorities offered similar figures for the earthquakes on state television. All the information could change as scientists examine the data.\\n\\nIranian state television said online that people rushed into the streets as the temblors hit. In Baghdad, people felt a quake shake the Iraqi capital, followed by what felt like aftershocks.\\n\\nAll the earthquakes struck at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), according to the USGS. Earthquakes at magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. The temblors also all were very shallow, which causes more ground shaking and potential damage, particularly in places without strict building codes.\\n\\nIn November, a major 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck the same region, killing over 530 people and injuring thousands in Iran alone. In Iraq, nine people were killed and 550 were injured, all in the country's northern Kurdish region, according to the United Nations.\\n\\nRandy Baldwin, a geophysicist with the USGS' National Earthquake Information Center in Golden, Colorado, said the earthquakes all appeared to be aftershocks from the November temblor.\\n\\nThe area is located in the sparsely populated and remote Zagros Mountains that divide Iraq and Iran and is home to many shallow faults, he said.\\n\\nIt's ongoing activity there, Baldwin told The Associated Press. If there was a stressed fault that's ready to move, they happen like that until the stresses are relieved, so it's not too unusual.\\n\\nIran sits on major fault lines and is prone to near-daily earthquakes. In 2003, a 6.6 magnitude quake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people.\\n\\nEarlier on Thursday, the USGS said a magnitude 4.9 quake hit Iran's southern province of Kerman before dawn. The official IRNA news agency said the temblor rocked the village of Hojedk, about 700 kilometers (400 miles) south of Tehran and struck at the depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles). No injuries or damage were reported.\\n\\nKerman has also recently seen several quakes, ranging in magnitude from 4 to 6.2.\\n\\nGambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

It is his dream and I am now convinced there is nothing left at our disposal to change his mind.\\n\\nKlopp said Coutinho wanted this move to happen since July, when Barcelona first made its interest known.\\n\\nLiverpool rejected three bids for Coutinho from Barcelona in August, but accepted a new offer early in the January transfer window.\\n\\nBarcelona did not reveal the cost of the deal, but a person familiar with the details told The Associated Press that the transfer is worth 160 million euros ($192 million). The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to comment publicly about the deal.\\n\\nWe managed to keep the player here beyond the summer window, Klopp said, hoping that we would be able to persuade him to stay and be part of what we are looking to do.\\n\\nBut, Klopp added, as hard as it is sometimes to accept, it is part of life and part of football — individuals have their own dreams and their own goals and objectives in life.\\n\\nKlopp said Liverpool had never been in a better position to absorb the loss of a key player like Coutinho.\\n\\nI have so much belief in the talent we have here already, he said, and even more faith, together with our owners, that we will make continued investment into the playing squad, which will allow more growth and more improvement."}
{"original": "SAN JOSE, Calif. — About 50 feet to Ross Pierschbacher's left sat Tua Tagovailoa, elevated on a stage inside the SAP Center with a line of cameras and army of reporters standing in front of him, their questions never ceasing for the hour he was there.\\n\\nPierschbacher and the rest of Alabama's offensive linemen were positioned at round tables on the floor, but few of them stayed there long before milling about the crowded arena floor, to the social media booths stationed on one side or the video game consoles stationed on the other. It surely came as no surprise to any of them that the star quarterback they have spent all season protecting was the center of attention.\\n\\nBut the questions — plenty of them — eventually found those offensive linemen. That's part of what has Pierschbacher so excited about Monday's College Football Playoff national championship game against Clemson, aside from the fact it gives the Crimson Tide a chance to go 15-0 and win a sixth title in 10 years in the final game of his career.\\n\\nMore:Alabama vs. Clemson matchup in championship game is also a clash of cultures in Bay Area\\n\\nMore:Even without Dexter Lawrence, Clemson will keep the Fridge package running against Alabama\\n\\nThe offensive line the redshirt senior leads from the middle will play a significant role in the outcome, for better or worse.\\n\\nIt's cool for us. It's definitely different, Pierschbacher said. Usually you hear about the quarterbacks, and you do with this game, as well, but the spotlight is really on us, so let's go out there and see who wins. It's fun, and I think this game, like it has in the past, will be won in the trenches. That's a good feeling for us.\\n\\nAlabama has already faced its share of talent-rich defensive lines this season — Mississippi State, LSU, Auburn and Georgia come to mind in the rough-and-tumble SEC — but it may not have faced one quite on the same level as Clemson's. There might not be a defensive line in the country that's on the same level as Clemson's, even if the Tigers will again be without standout defensive tackle Dexter Lawrence for a second game after he tested positive for a banned substance.\\n\\nTackle Christian Wilkins and ends Clelin Ferrell and Austin Bryant are multi-year starters. The first two, along with Lawrence, are potential first-round NFL draft picks. Bryant will surely hear his name called. Clemson's replacement for Lawrence in the starting unit, Albert Huggins, is a senior.\\n\\nTogether, that group has helped the Tigers rack up 52 sacks and 129 tackles for loss. Those are the best and second-best totals in the nation, respectively.\\n\\nThey've got NFL Sunday guys up there, all across the board, Pierschbacher. They play fast and strong and physical. They've got a great coach. So rightfully so they get this attention. It's a big challenge for us every year.\\n\\nAlabama, though, has the offensive line to match. The group of Jonah Williams, Lester Cotton, Pierschbacher, Alex Leatherwood and Jedrick Wills has surrendered only 14 sacks and 58 tackles for loss this season, both top-10 totals.\\n\\nThe last time Alabama and Clemson met, at the Sugar Bowl in a national semifinal last season, the Crimson Tide dominated in the trenches, more than doubling the Tigers' production on the ground and limiting them to just two sacks for a net of minus-8 yards.\\n\\nI feel like last year, they just whooped us up front, Ferrell said. Ain't a whole lot into that. I feel like it's a defense we play well but we didn't really win the battle up front on both sides of the ball. And that's what it really comes down to.\\n\\nIn an effort to change that this season, Clemson has focused its film study heavily on the teams it felt were best able to bother Alabama up front. Specifically, Mississippi State and Georgia — the only two teams on the Crimson Tide's schedule that recorded multiple sacks.\\n\\nMississippi State totaled four and hurried Tagovailoa three more times on Nov. 10 but lost 24-0. Still, it was Alabama's lowest offensive output of the season. Georgia finished with only two sacks but was even better up front overall, taking Tagovailoa completely out of his comfort zone before eventually forcing his removal from the game due to an ankle injury.\\n\\nBefore leaving, Tagovailoa completed just 10 of 25 passes for 164 yards and threw two interceptions.\\n\\nI feel like we match up real well against Alabama, the offensive line, Huggins said. I feel like if we play with good hands and low pads, it'll be a great matchup.\\n\\nOne that could potentially play a large role in deciding Monday's game.\\n\\nAlways a great challenge, Williams said. I've played this Clemson D-line three years in a row, and we get a good warm-up during the season playing some of the best D-lines in the country in the SEC, so you know, we don't approach it any differently than any other game. We're know they're a really talented front, really well coached. We approach it the same way we approach any other game. We respect our opponent, but we're playing to handle the line of scrimmage."}
{"original": "New year, new TV.\\n\\nWhile you work on New Year's resolutions and put 2018 behind you, your favorite TV networks and streaming services are doing the same. Early 2019 is full of new TV shows jockeying for your attention, along with returning favorites (Star Trek: Discovery), shows you probably forgot were never canceled (True Detective on HBO) and fan-powered seasons (Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which moves to NBC).\\n\\nTo help you sort through the shows you haven't yet heard of, we picked 10 must-see shows, ranging from one that features singing celebrities dressed as monsters to a superhero show that actually stands out.\\n\\n'The Masked Singer'\\n\\nFox, Wednesdays, 9 EST/PST\\n\\nNot since The Voice arrived in 2011 has a new reality competition captured the nation's attention. At last, Fox might have found a variation on the formula that will shock and delight you even more. Ten celebrities – described as athletes, Emmy and Grammy winners – clad in elaborate costumes sing their hearts out and both viewers and the celebrity judges – Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong and Nicole Scherzinger – try to guess who they are. Each week the losing singer, decided by the in-studio audience and the judges, leaves the show and takes off their mask. It's such bizarre and brilliant fun that you may not even care who the celebrities are. Or, you might wish that your favorite voices lose quickly so you can see who's hiding secret talents. – Kelly Lawler\\n\\n'The Passage'\\n\\nFox (Jan. 14), Mondays, 9 EST/PST\\n\\nThe Passage is adapted from the kind of epic sci-fi/fantasy book series you'd expect to see brought to life on premium cable or streaming, with bells, whistles and a huge budget. But Fox manages to scale down a massive and complex story to fit into its lineup without corrupting what makes it fun and gripping. The series is about a government research project that, while aiming to cure all diseases, inadvertently creates vampires. Researchers believe experimenting on a child is the only way to fix the problem and send a covert operative (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) to kidnap one, but his morals get in the way. It's a lot to take in, but it's packaged cleanly and tensely. – Lawler\\n\\n'Black Monday'\\n\\nShowtime, (Jan. 20), Sundays, 10 EST/PST\\n\\nStarring Don Cheadle, Regina Hall and Andrew Rannells, Black Monday is like The Wolf of Wall Street without all the annoying parts. It's a near-parody of 1980s macho finance culture mixed in with a fictionalized account of how the so-called Black Monday crash happened. The costumes and style are all you'd ever want from a series set in this period, but it's the performances from the three leads that make the series more than just another take on Greed is good. – Lawler\\n\\n'The Other Two'\\n\\nComedy Central, (Jan. 24), Thursdays, 10:30 EST/PST\\n\\nChris Kelly's bittersweet cancer comedy Other People was one of our favorite films of 2016, so naturally, we couldn't have been more excited for the Saturday Night Live writer's latest TV outing, which re-teams him with SNL alums Sarah Schneider and Molly Shannon. The show follows a hapless aspiring actor named Cary (Drew Tarver) who, along with his sister Brooke (Heléne Yorke), is riding the coattails of his winsome teenage brother (Case Walker), a Justin Bieber-esque pop star known as Chase Dreams. Like Hulu's canceled Difficult People, Other Two is acerbically funny and deeply cynical, with snappy showbiz humor and a fully formed leading man who just happens to be gay (which is, sadly, still a rarity on the big and small screen). – Patrick Ryan\\n\\n'I Am the Night'\\n\\nTNT, (Jan. 28), Mondays, 9 EST/PST\\n\\nLong before she shattered box-office records with 2017's Wonder Woman, director Patty Jenkins gave us the brutal yet deeply human Monster (2004), starring Charlize Theron as serial killer Aileen Wuornos. The filmmaker returns to her disquieting true-crime roots with the '60s-set Night, which reunites her with Wonder Woman heartthrob Chris Pine, who plays a disgraced journalist whose life becomes intertwined with that of Fauna Hodel (India Eisley), a young woman seeking answers about her apparently mixed-race background and wealthy grandfather (Jefferson Mays), a prime suspect in the infamous Black Dahlia murder. Pine is charismatic as always, but it's Eisley's mesmerizing performance that gives this chilling mystery its beating heart. – Ryan\\n\\n'Pen15'\\n\\nHulu (Feb. 8)\\n\\nTry not watching this one through your fingers. Andy Samberg and his Lonely Island cohorts produce this cringe-worthy coming-of-age comedy, set in middle school and featuring actual middle-schoolers. The catch? The show's adult creators, Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine, star as seventh-grade versions of themselves, awkwardly cursing out bullies in the schoolyard and swooning over crushes in homeroom. While the joke seems one-note at best (and creepy at worst) the premise works because of Konkle and Erskine's commitment to their painfully relatable characters. And although the jokes are decidedly not family-friendly, their believable friendship as braceface besties gives PEN15 a sweet center. – Ryan\\n\\n'Miracle Workers'\\n\\nTBS (Feb. 12), Tuesdays, 10:30 EST/PST\\n\\nSNL producer Lorne Michaels is behind this spiritual cousin to The Good Place, a quirky workplace comedy set in heaven where God (Steve Buscemi) is a lazy, semi-sadistic oaf whose employees carry out his bidding on Earth. Tired of her insipid job in the dirt division, overly earnest angel Eliza (Geraldine Viswanathan) transfers to the Department of Answered Prayers, where she works alongside neurotic recluse Craig (Daniel Radcliffe). While it lacks the brain of Good Place – one episode centers around God seeking to explode Bill Maher's penis – Miracle Workers still has plenty of heart, morphing into a rom-com as Eliza and Craig try to match up two potential lovebirds whose romance could literally save the world. – Ryan\\n\\n'The Umbrella Academy'\\n\\nNetflix (Feb. 15)\\n\\nThere was no shortage of superhero shows on TV in 2018, but Netflix is making another run – or rather, flight – with Umbrella, an adaptation of the comic book series by My Chemical Romance singer Gerard Way. The series is about a misfit group of superkids, adopted by an eccentric millionaire, who grow up to become troubled adults. It's a much darker and demented take on the family of superheroes story than you've seen before, but the series still maintains a sense of fun. It certainly stands out amid the glut of interchangeable caped hero series. – Lawler\\n\\n'Desus & Mero'\\n\\nShowtime (Feb. 21), Thursdays, 11 EST/PST\\n\\nShowtime is wading into the late-night talk-show waters with Desus & Mero, which moves from its daily home on Viceland. Hosts Desus Nice and The Kid Mero, who first gained popularity in 2013 with their Bodega Boys podcast, don't appear to be switching up the format much: inviting famous guests on to chop it up about music, sports and pop culture. But knowing their raunchy comedy, easy chemistry and frequently insightful takes on politics, this dynamic duo promises to be as unpredictable as ever. – Ryan\\n\\n'Shrill'\\n\\nHulu (March 15)\\n\\nAidy Bryant finally gets a chance to step outside her Saturday Night Live personas with this series, adapted by writer and fat-acceptance activist Lindy West from her memoir. Shrill tells the story of Annie (Bryant) a young woman and aspiring journalist trying to sort through her messy love life and career in Portland, Oregon. She also happens to be plus size, and isn't consumed with trying to change that. Fat women in pop culture are rarely allowed to be happy with their bodies (unless they're villains), so the mere concept of the show is radical and novel enough. But it avoids being a public service announcement in sitcom form; instead, it's as sweet and chill as Portland itself. – Lawler\\n\\nIf you love television and love talking about it even more, USA TODAY Life's Yes, I'm Still Watching is here for you.

He has said he would contact governors to help implement statewide mask mandates and, if they refuse, the former vice president has said he would turn to local officials.\\n\\nBiden has pledged to put scientists, not politicians, behind the microphone; make testing widely available and free; expand national surveillance programs; and restore the CDC's real-time dashboard tracking virus-related hospital admissions.\\n\\nHe also has promised to quickly launch a national plan to distribute personal protective equipment to health care workers and first responders, and to ask for clear, national guidance from the CDC on containment, school openings, travel and gatherings. Biden has vowed to restore the type of daily, expert-led briefings that were typical for previous epidemics, such as H1N1 and Zika virus.\\n\\nBiden has said he would rejoin the World Health Organization, which President Donald Trump began to withdraw from in July, and reestablish the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, which was eliminated by the Trump administration in 2018. Experts also expect the U.S. to strengthen its connections with the United Nations and join in the international effort to get COVID-19 vaccine to low- and middle-income countries.

What I'm going to do is pass Obamacare with a public option,'' Biden said in the final presidential debate against Trump. It becomes Bidencare.\\n\\nHe says Americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting Americans who couldn't access Medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the ACA.\\n\\nBiden has said he would raise the subsidies people can use to help them buy coverage through ACA marketplaces. He says no family will have to spend more than 8.5% of their earnings on health coverage because of refundable tax credits for their premiums.\\n\\nAnd Americans could further cut down on their out-of-pocket costs because a Biden administration hopes it will lower the price of prescriptions by negotiating drug prices.\\n\\nClimate change\\n\\nJust one day after the general election, Biden promised that on the first day of his presidency, he would rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, a plan signed under the Obama administration to combat climate change.\\n\\nBut activists will likely want to see more than just signing back on to the Paris agreement from the former vice president once he's in office.\\n\\nYoung voters and progressives will likely push Biden to support policies such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's Green New Deal.

During a speech about his planned COVID-19 response, Biden said he would give Congress one month to get a bill on his desk that included funding to address the public health and economic aspects of combating the virus.\\n\\nIn his view, the bill should include all the resources necessary so that both our public health response and our economic response can be seen through to the end, he said.\\n\\nBiden has promised he will meet with the governors of every state to push forward a strategy to combat the coronavirus.\\n\\nBiden supports sending direct relief checks worth $2,000 to struggling Americans. The House-approved measure never came to a vote in the Senate, but Democrats have vowed to swiftly revive it.\\n\\nIt's one of the first things we want to do once our senators our seated, Schumer said Wednesday. Our Georgia senators campaigned on it. Our caucus is for it. We think the American people need it.\\n\\nBiden has laid out a plan for unemployment benefits: He would create a health crisis unemployment initiative to help all workers facing a loss of work because of the pandemic; create plans to ensure unemployment benefits are available to those who lose jobs but would be denied benefits for a variety of reasons; extend COVID-19 crisis unemployment insurance, and provide guaranteed emergency paid sick leave and caregiving leave.\\n\\nProtections for LGBTQ people\\n\\nActivists expect Biden not only to use executive orders to roll back a range of anti-LGBTQ policies enacted by President Donald Trump but also choose openly LGBTQ judges.\\n\\nBiden himself has said he plans within the first 100 days of his presidency to push for the passage of the Equality Act, which aims to extend federal protections in the areas of housing, education, credit and services to the LGBTQ population. That's critical, activists say, since only 21 states have anti-discrimination laws on the books. Read more.\\n\\nHousing\\n\\nBiden plans to provide a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 that will help Americans pull together a down payment to purchase a home, shore up rental aid provided by the federal government, and dedicate $10 billion toward expanding a tax credit that spurs the building or revamping of rental housing for low-wage earners.\\n\\nBiden has talked about making sure Americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. Biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive Section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the Section 8 program for those who qualify.\\n\\nBiden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly African Americans, to buy or hold onto property. Those obstacles have included everything from onerous interest rates that leave Black people vulnerable to falling behind on payments and ending up in foreclosure to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by Black Americans.\\n\\nBiden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. He will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the Office of Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.\\n\\nCollege costs and debt\\n\\nBiden wants to make community college and comparable training programs free. And students from households earning less than $125,000 a year will not have to pay tuition if they attend four-year public colleges and universities. He also wants to raise the value of Pell Grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.\\n\\nBiden says that he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. After deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.\\n\\nIf they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years, the balance of their loans will be forgiven. Borrowers who don't earn more than $25,000 annually won't have to make payments on those federal loans, and won't have to worry about accumulating interest.\\n\\nHe would also improve the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program, and start a new initiative that forgives $10,000 worth of undergraduate or graduate student debt for every year a borrower commits to national or community service. The cap would be five years.\\n\\nChild care, free early education\\n\\nBiden has pledged to limit and cap child care costs for many families. He will offer tax credits to help low- and middle-class families pay for child care. Parents earning less than $125,000 annually can get back up to half what they spend on child care for kids under age 13. The cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. And families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.\\n\\nFor children under the age of 5, Biden supports the Child Care for Working Families Act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.\\n\\nAdditionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. That amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to Biden's campaign site. Biden is proposing free preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds.\\n\\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Karen Weintraub, Elizabeth Weise, Grace Hauck, Ledyard King, Joey Garrison, Nicholas Wu, Charisse Jones, Marco della Cav"}
{"original": "Joe Bruzek\\n\\nCars.com\\n\\nThe 2018 Ford F-150 is preparing for an assault from its fiercest rivals, the soon-to-be-redesigned Chevrolet Silverado and Ram 1500. And it's ready.\\n\\nSomewhat out of cycle from its competitors, the F-150 was last fully redesigned for 2015, when it got an aluminum body and steel frame and became one of the most civilized and high-tech trucks around.\\n\\nIt also got some unique features, such as adaptive cruise control and a forward collision warning system with automatic braking, that other trucks lack. Will the F-150 instantly be outdated as soon as there's a new Silverado and Ram? Doubtful, given its updates for 2018.\\n\\nFor 2018, the F-150 gets more power, more torque, more gears and more mpg to better compete with a crop of new trucks on its way — trucks that have undoubtedly benchmarked the impressive F-150. Despite not accelerating as fast as the 6.2-liter-powered Chevrolet or GMC trucks in our previous testing, the F-150 still takes the crown for drivability.\\n\\nMore:Review: Chevrolet Colorado ZR2 is an off-road beast\\n\\nMore:Review: Mitsubishi fights back with cool Eclipse Cross SUV\\n\\nMore:Review: Mercedes-AMG GLA is a pocket rocket\\n\\nI drove a 2018 F-150 Platinum, the second-most-expensive trim level, with the updated 5-liter V-8 and its new 10-speed automatic transmission. Half-ton truck shoppers are no doubt familiar with sticker shock, so we'll just mention our test truck's $63,800 price tag and move right along.\\n\\nThe 5-liter V-8 isn't the flashiest engine in the F-150 lineup: The 2.7-liter and 3.5-liter turbocharged EcoBoost V-6s get that nod. In previous years, the V-8 felt more like a courtesy engine for diehard V-8 truck buyers. It was matched in our acceleration and towing tests by the less-expensive turbo 2.7-liter, and it was easily outperformed by the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine.\\n\\nFor 2018, the 5-liter gains a new fuel-injection system with both port and direct fuel injection for 10 more horsepower to 395, and 13 more pounds-feet of torque. That extra power and torque, teamed with the 10-speed's added gears, make the 2018 5-liter a more compelling engine option (though the turbocharged 2.7-liter V-6 is the jack-of-all-trades.)\\n\\nThe secret to the V-8's improvements is primarily the new transmission, which uncorks more of the engine's potential. The previous F-150 5-liter came with only six gears, which didn't do the high-revving V-8 any favors.\\n\\nThe result is less falloff in engine speed between gears, plus continuous, smooth pulling power. Programming is exceptionally intuitive, and the transmission downshifts promptly and can jump half its gears if needed.\\n\\nF-150 buyers also get improved fuel-economy ratings, up an EPA-estimated 1 mile per gallon in all categories.\\n\\nMaximum towing for 2018 increases to 13,200 pounds when equipped with the 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine. Maximum payload honors go to the 5-liter V-8 at a rated 3,270 pounds.\\n\\nThe F-150's crashworthiness ratings are top-of-the-class. It scored the highest rating in Insurance Institute for Highway Safety crash tests, but it lacks Top Safety Pick status because of poor headlight performance. The 2018 F-150 hadn't been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration as of publication.\\n\\nThe F-150 is the only half ton with optional forward collision warning and automatic emergency braking. Others have collision warning but won't automatically apply the brakes to prevent a collision; that could easily change with the next-generation Silverado and Ram, however.\\n\\nFor 2018, there aren't many improvements to the cabin, technology or even ride and handling. The F-150 Platinum remains a luxury truck in the sense that it's super nice to drive and has interior quality, features and technology that stand out in the segment. Yet interior quality is on par with an entry-level BMW sedan.\\n\\nMore than $60,000 is certainly a lot of money to spend on a vehicle often seen as a utilitarian workhorse, but the F-150 Platinum has an interior, feature set and drivability satisfying enough that I didn't scoff at the price after spending a couple of hundred miles behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe F-150 Platinum can take your payload to work, take your kids to school and be taken out for a date night without pause. And for its price, the F-150 offers features and drivability the other half tons don't — for now, anyway.\\n\\nSee the full review here.\\n\\nWhat stands out\\n\\nEngine: Improvements make the 5-liter V-8 a contender again\\n\\nSafety: Top of class\\n\\nComfort: BMW-like -- but the Platinum level comes at a hefty price\\n\\n2018 Ford F-150 Platinum\\n\\nWhat? A full-size pickup that happens to be America's best-selling vehicle of any sort\\n\\nWhen? On sale now\\n\\nWhere? Platinum is made in Dearborn, Mich.\\n\\nWhat makes it go? A 5-liter V-8, offered in addition to two turbocharged engine choices, good for 395 horsepower.\\n\\nHow thirsty? 16 miles per gallon in the city, 22 mpg on the highway and 19 mpg overall.\\n\\nHow big? 19.3 feet or 20.3 feet in the Platinum, depending on configuration\\n\\nHow much? The Platinum version starts at $54,390 plus $1,395 destination charge. The cheapest F-150 starts at $27,610.\\n\\nOverall: A great truck becomes even greater"}
{"original": "EAST RUTHERFORD — Stave Spagnuolo had a month's head start on the rest of the field as candidates jostle for positioning to be the next head coach of the Giants.\\n\\nTruth be told: Spagnuolo has had two different tenures with the franchise as defensive coordinator to impress ownership, not to mention the four-game audition as interim head coach to close this past season following the Dec. 4 firing of Ben McAdoo.\\n\\nThe 58-year-old Spagnuolo is considered the long shot to claim the job on a permanent basis, but his candidacy is not as cut-and-dried as some may want to suggest.\\n\\nThe Giants kicked off their interviews with Spagnuolo Wednesday and the rest of the tentative schedule, weather permitting, is as follows: former Broncos and Giants running backs coach Eric Studesville on Thursday, Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels and defensive coordinator Matt Patricia on Friday and Vikings offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur on Saturday. A meeting Sunday with Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz is possible, considering ESPN reported Wednesday that the Giants, as had been expected, reached out for permission to speak with him.\\n\\nThey're also expected to meet with Panthers defensive coordinator/assistant head coach Steve Wilks early next week, depending on how Carolina's wild card playoff game Sunday against the Saints turns out for his availability.\\n\\nHere are five things to consider when assessing Spagnuolo's candidacy and his place within the franchise:\\n\\n1. Just about every other candidate, maybe save for Studesville, will have to walk in and earn the respect of the room. Make no mistake: Spagnuolo already has it. There's a reason co-owners John Mara and Steve Tisch asked him to take on the role of interim head coach - they knew what they were getting. This may be viewed as a courtesy interview, but don't discount what Spagnuolo brings to the table from that perspective.\\n\\nSpagnuolo met with Mara, general manager Dave Gettleman and assistant general manager Kevin Abrams Wednesday. Abrams' presence speaks to his increased role moving forward. Tisch will meet with the candidates later in the process.\\n\\n2. Look, it's completely fair to believe Spagnuolo was just as responsible in the struggles that the Giants had en route to their pitiful 3-13 campaign as McAdoo, or anybody else. This is his defense, and with Spagnuolo as DC, it's been feast or famine. A lot of that has to do with personnel, and injuries, and maybe he's lost his way at times trying to make up for being short-handed. But there is no escaping the results, and the Giants believed they were set up to be an outstanding defense this season. They were not, and although the offensive ineptitude certainly contributed to leaving the defense on the field, resulting in the belief that defensive players had to overcompensate, Spagnuolo's unit was not exactly inspiring.\\n\\n3. McAdoo takes the fall for the suspensions of Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Janoris Jenkins, and the pattern of behavior for Eli Apple started on his watch and finished under Spagnuolo. Spags needed to do a better job leadership-wise on his side of the ball. Whether McAdoo strong-armed him or he left the discipline to the head coach, I guess that's up for debate. And give Spags credit for getting the most out of DRC down the stretch and his emergence as a voice of reason. But a question that needs to be answered in Wednesday's interview: why didn't (or couldn't) Spagnuolo step up and stop the bleeding far earlier.\\n\\n4. There's a chance this isn't good-bye for Spagnuolo. He has ties to other head coaching candidates being interviewed by the Giants: McDaniels was his offensive coordinator in St. Louis in 2011, while Shurmur and Spagnuolo are good friends who go back to their days coaching together in Philadelphia. Shurmur was Spagnuolo's OC in St. Louis for two years before taking the head coaching job in Cleveland. It's not inconceivable to believe McDaniels and/or Shurmur - two offensive coaches - would consider bringing Spagnuolo back on their staffs if they get the Giants' job.\\n\\nCOACH TRACKER:Where the Giants coaching search stands on Day 3\\n\\nGETTLEMANIA:Giants embracing promise of change with Gettlemania set to run wild\\n\\nWHAT'S NEXT? Manning, Webb face Giants' uncertain future with confidence\\n\\n5. Stapleton's take: Spagnuolo is likely a better fit for a defensive coordinator spot elsewhere next season. Maybe he goes back to Baltimore to replace the retired Dean Pees - he spent two seasons with John Harbaugh getting his mojo back after failed stints as head coach with the Rams and a very difficult season as DC with the Saints. There also could be an opening if the Eagles lose Jim Schwartz, who has been mentioned as a HC candidate in several spots, including here.\\n\\nSpagnuolo interviewed for the job when the Giants were looking to replace Tom Coughlin, and lost out when they went with McAdoo. From a leadership perspective and the ease with which he can handle the media, Spagnuolo may have been a better fit long-term two years ago than McAdoo proved to be. It's hard to see this current hiring cycle ending with Spagnuolo as head coach of the Giants, however. He deserves an interview, and I would not rule out a return to Big Blue in some form. But you can't put all the failings of 2017 on McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese without including the coaching staff and other key decision-makers in the front office - vice president of player evaluation Marc Ross has already been dismissed - as part of what went wrong."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The Brooklyn Nets had the right formula for a winning start to their road trip.\\n\\nDefense, defense, defense. I thought we were outstanding defensively, Brooklyn coach Kenny Atkinson said.\\n\\nD'Angelo Russell had 23 points and 10 assists, DeMarre Carroll added 20 points, including five 3-pointers, and the Nets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 109-100 on Friday night.\\n\\nThe Nets limited Memphis to 45 percent shooting, including 5 of 24 (21 percent) from outside the arc, and won for the 11th time in their last 14 games. That came after the Nets lost eight in a row, quite a reversal that has moved Brooklyn into the Eastern Conference's eighth playoff spot.\\n\\nOne game at a time, Russell said. As for the change of play during the recent span, Russell said: It's the focus, defense. I would say everybody coming into their place. Everybody's realizing their roles, and it's leading to wins.\\n\\nJoe Harris added 18 points for the Nets, who had six players in double figures. Spencer Dinwiddie scored 13 points and Jarrett Allen had 12 points and 12 rebounds, including five off the offensive glass.\\n\\nMike Conley, held scoreless in Wednesday's loss to Detroit, led the Grizzlies with 31 points. Jaren Jackson Jr. added 19 and Kyle Anderson managed a triple-double with 11 points, 11 rebounds and 10 assists.\\n\\nMarc Gasol had 13 points, nine rebounds and seven assists.\\n\\nWhile the Nets relished in their reversal of fortunes, the Memphis malaise continued. The Grizzlies have lost four in a row, 11 of their last 14 and the frustration led to a locker room fracas after Wednesday's loss to the Detroit Pistons.\\n\\nWhile tempers cooled, the tussle didn't seem to lead to better energy or results for the Grizzlies.\\n\\nWe have to stick together obviously, but there's no more talking to do, Anderson said. You have to go out there and perform.\\n\\nThe Nets led 48-47 at intermission, but pulled away in the fourth with a 9-2 run in the latter half of the quarter. That gave Brooklyn a 106-94 cushion and Memphis never got closer than six points the rest of the way.\\n\\nI do think there's a little bit of self-doubt, Memphis coach J.B. Bickerstaff said of his team's mindset. When times get tough, and you're going through these situations, that can start to creep in.\\n\\nBut we've got to find a way to get it done. No one is come to save us.\\n\\nTIP-INS\\n\\nNets: Rondae Hollis-Jefferson missed his second straight game with a right adductor strain. ... Carroll's previous season high for 3-pointers was four on two other occasions. . ... The victory gave the Nets three straight road wins over the Grizzlies, matching the longest against the Grizzlies since the team was in Vancouver in late 1990s. ... Carroll's 20 points helped Brooklyn's reserves outscore Memphis' 51-20.\\n\\nGrizzlies: Conley was listed as questionable with left shoulder soreness from an injury suffered in Wednesday night's loss to the Pistons. ... Justin Holiday, acquired in a trade with the Chicago Bulls, was not with the team yet. ... Anderson recorded his first career triple-double and 13th in franchise history. ... Memphis had five blocks and nine steals, four of the steals by Conley.\\n\\nREVENGE\\n\\nThe Brooklyn victory avenged a 131-125 double-overtime loss to Memphis on Nov. 30. This time, the Nets outscored the Grizzlies in the fourth to make sure and avoid overtime. We owed them one, Russell said. I felt like we gave it away to them last time, so we had to learn from it and not do that this time.\\n\\nOUTSIDE THE ARC ADVANTAGE\\n\\nThe Nets finished 13 of 34 from 3-point range, the 10th game in the last 11 that a Memphis opponent has made double-digit 3-pointers. Over the last 10 games, opponents are averaging 13.5 made 3-pointers. We're giving up too many 3s, Grizzlies guard Garrett Temple said, adding that the weakside help seems confused right now. .I don't know because the game plan is clear. But we have to find way to run guys off (the 3-point line).\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nNets: Visit the Chicago Bulls on Sunday.\\n\\nGrizzlies: Visit San Antonio on Saturday.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — The Broncos' offensive line has resembled both a carousel and a turnstile. The only constant has been center Matt Paradis, who has played every snap this season.\\n\\nHe's the rock, left tackle Ryan Harris said of his line mate who was cut in camp as a rookie and spent all of last season toiling on Denver's practice squad for a coaching staff that was loathe to give young O-linemen an opportunity.\\n\\nBefore that, he was a walk-on at Boise State after playing eight-man football at Council High School in Idaho, where he only got a breather on kickoffs.\\n\\nI think he played more football games against cows than humans when he first started out, cracked Harris. But he's found a way to adapt and change his game.\\n\\nCoach Gary Kubiak's philosophy of bridging the gap between the starters and backups by giving the second-stringers more snaps in the offseason paid off in a big way for Paradis. Once he got the chance, he never came out, supplanting free agent acquisition Gino Gradkowski in training camp.\\n\\nParadis snapped on every one of Denver's 1,108 offensive plays this season and all 73 possible special teams snaps.\\n\\nThat proved a godsend for a line that lost two left tackles to IR, rotated its right tackles at times and plugged in rookie Max Garcia for both Evan Mathis and Louis Vasquez with the Pro Bowl guards beset by nagging injuries all season.\\n\\nThe most impressive thing is just his work ethic, Harris said. He works just as hard as any guy on this team and the way he works, you'd think he'd been a pro for five, six years. But I just know being at tackle and being his line mate, his confidence and his communications are in another realm from the beginning of the year.\\n\\nAnd that's a big reason we've started to pick up the run game because he's been doing such a good job of directing the rest of us what to do.\\n\\nThe Broncos hit the playoffs on a roll offensively, having rushed for a season-best 210 yards against San Diego in Week 17. Peyton Manning's left foot is finally healthy enough for him to line up under center rather than in the shotgun all the time, which opens up the ground game and the play-action opportunities for Denver.\\n\\nThe soft-spoken center has snapped to all three of his quarterbacks in games this year and he'll be working with Manning again when the top-seeded Broncos (12-4) host the Pittsburgh Steelers (11-6) in the AFC divisional playoff round Sunday.\\n\\nI'm just trying to do my job, Paradis said. I mean, just trying to stay healthy and do my job. It's been a lot more fun getting to play compared to last year.\\n\\nOffensive coordinator Rick Dennison said Paradis' rise from bottom rung on the roster to anchor of the O-line hasn't been a surprise.\\n\\nHis mannerisms and the way he goes about the game is not unlike some guys that have been successful in this building and in this scheme, Dennison said. He's quiet, a quiet leader, has strong hands and then coordinates people up front. Not really that surprised and excited how much more he can get better.\\n\\nParadis has the look of a player who could anchor the position for years to come, much like retired star Tom Nalen did during the previous incarnation of the Broncos'zone-blocking scheme.\\n\\nTommy was an exceptional football player, having coached him. He's got a long way to go to step into those shoes, but he has some of those traits, Dennis said.\\n\\nParadis might have languished on the scout team last year, but he knows all about stamina and staying on the field. In high school, he only sat out kickoffs. Otherwise, he played offensive guard and defensive tackle.\\n\\nSo, it's a lot of plays. But I don't really think about it, Paradis said. I just play football.\\n\\nThat's become his mantra.\\n\\nJust play football, man, Paradis concurred, finally cracking a hint of a smile.

{"original": "Dan Wolken\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nARLINGTON, Texas — Roughly 90 minutes before kickoff back on Sept. 19, word began filtering through Bryant-Denny Stadium that Alabama was going to make a quarterback change. Cooper Bateman was in and Jake Coker, the assumed starter who had yet to fully win the confidence of Alabama's coaching staff, was out for a game against Ole Miss that would become the crossroads of the Crimson Tide's season.\\n\\nGiven what was at stake for Alabama, it was a shocking decision. And Coker, as he now acknowledges, was not happy about it.\\n\\nBut the plain fact was that Coker had not yet settled the central issue in Alabama's season, even as coach Nick Saban was practically beginning him to. As a graduate transfer who came from Florida State with a lot of hype in 2014 but lost the job to Blake Sims and hadn't grabbed ahold of it two games into 2015, it was only natural to wonder if he ever would.\\n\\nCotton Bowl takeaways: Alabama dominates on defense ... and offense\\n\\nYou could see it in his body language (he was disappointed), which is great, offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin said earlier this week. I said that to him: We don't expect you to agree with this decision. If you agree with it, you're not competitive. We expect you to go prove it wrong, and he did exactly that.\\n\\nThough Alabama lost that night and generally played a mess of a game, its late comeback with Coker at quarterback was the turning point of the season. Coker had proven to be Alabama's best, and perhaps only, legitimate quarterback option. Whatever direction this Alabama team was going to take, there was no more revolving door: After an entire spring and fall camp of uncertainty, it was finally Coker's team.\\n\\nIt would have been impossible for anyone to know that Alabama's trajectory from there to here, a 38-0 victory against Michigan State in the College Football Playoff semifinals, would have happened not in spite of its quarterback play but largely because of it.\\n\\nEven as Alabama's largely drama-free season dragged along and Coker looked more and more solid, limiting mistakes while occasionally hitting a backbreaking big play, there was rarely a suggestion he was capable of being spectacular. With Alabama's dominating defense and Derrick Henry rushing for more yards than any back in SEC history, would there really be any need?\\n\\nBut as Alabama evolved from the night of the Ole Miss game into the team that made a mockery of Michigan State in the College Football Playoff semifinal on Thursday, Coker may have changed the entire perception of his brief tenure as Alabama's quarterback. When history looks back on the Crimson Tide's 38-0 victory against the Spartans, the most (perhaps only) memorable thing will be the way Coker outplayed Michigan State's Connor Cook.\\n\\nI wasn't surprised at all by the game he had tonight, Saban said. He's pretty much done a good job all year long in terms of whatever we've asked him to do. Tonight he had to make plays because they were there, and he certainly made them. But I think in each game that we've asked him to do that, he's come through for us very nicely.\\n\\nEven at Coker's best this season, it would have been hard to envision him doing what he did to Michigan State. The Spartans were committed to stopping Henry — which they did, limiting him to 75 yards on 20 carries — and basically told Alabama that Coker would have to make them pay. He did, completing 25-of-30 passes for 286 yards and two touchdowns. That accuracy helped the Tide to the best completion percentage (80.6) of any team in the five Playoff games that have been played.\\n\\nI knew it was going to come down to the receivers and quarterback: Could they make big plays? Alabama receiver ArDarius Stewart said. They were going to obviously try to stop Derrick and they did a good job stopping the run, but I knew on the outside they couldn't handle it. Jake performed excellent. 25-of-30? That's unbelievable.\\n\\nIt was evident from the opening drive that Michigan State was committed to its plan defensively and Saban/Kiffin weren't surprised. Instead of force-feeding Henry, who didn't touch the ball on the first drive, Alabama called run-pass option plays that required Coker to read what Michigan State was doing in the box and then get the ball to wherever Alabama had the numbers to block.\\n\\nIt ended up with Alabama going largely to the perimeter, nickel and diming its way down the field, until the bigger plays started to come. First to freshman Calvin Ridley, then to tight end O.J. Howard, and then pretty much to whomever and whatever Alabama wanted.\\n\\nAlabama routs Michigan State to reach College Football Playoff final\\n\\nI think they were softening us up on the edge with a lot of quick routes outside and some screens, Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. It's a catch-22 situation.\\n\\nBut for all Alabama's talent — and make no mistake, Alabama had the edge at basically every position on the field — the quarterback still had to deliver. And Coker, a fifth-year senior, has never been better in a more meaningful spot.\\n\\nTeams are living organisms, always changing and mutating. For much of this season, Alabama was one-dimensional offensively, even if that dimension was hard to stop. Now, the Crimson Tide heads to Arizona looking like so much more.\\n\\nI felt they loaded the box a lot and our passing game would be open, Howard said. Down the field, vertically was open on a lot of plays and we made it happen. We executed plays that were called. That's what you need out of your team when the running game isn't going well. You have to be able to throw the ball. Jake played great, our receiver made plays and thats what you need to go win a championship.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE COTTON BOWL"}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nBRISBANE, Australia (AP) — Rafael Nadal cuddled a koala on the banks of the river, something that has become a customary photo opportunity for celebrity players on debut at the Brisbane International.\\n\\nThe 14-time major winner has altered his preparation for the Australian Open, hoping a change of venues for the warmup tournaments will bring a change of luck at the season's first Grand Slam tournament after a shocking first-round exit in 2016.\\n\\nNadal kicked off his season with a win in an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi on New Year's Eve, then headed directly to Australia to fine-tune at the Brisbane International in preference to remaining in the Gulf for the event in Doha.\\n\\nI played well in Abu Dhabi ... I played three good matches, and that's important for me, Nadal said Monday after the brief meet-and-greet with a local politician and a native marsupial. I really hope the good matches I played in Abu Dhabi helps me for here.\\n\\nThe 30-year-old Spaniard is playing in Brisbane for the first time, replacing Roger Federer as the tournament's male draw card. He has a tricky opener against Alexandr Dolgopolov and, if he gets through that, a potential quarterfinal against top-seeded Milos Raonic, the defending champion.\\n\\nNadal is coming off a left wrist injury that curtailed his 2016 season, and thinks the extra time in Australia will help him prepare to win his first major title since the 2014 French Open.\\n\\nUntil last year, he had reached the quarterfinals or better at every Australian Open he had contested since 2007, including victory in '09 and runs to the final in 2012 and '14.\\n\\nThe wrist injury last year forced Nadal to withdraw from the French Open before the third round and skip Wimbledon. He won the Olympic doubles gold medal for Spain in Rio de Janeiro, but he struggled with the pain and didn't win a title on a surface other than clay in 2016.\\n\\nLast year that I was playing great, I get injured in the worst moment possible, he said. I'm happy to be back on the competition again. Abu Dhabi was a good start. I need to continue that way.\\n\\nDespite his struggles with injury and the recent dominance of Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, Nadal thinks he can still contend for the Grand Slam titles.\\n\\nBeing here in Brisbane is good news for me, he said, two weeks before the Australian Open starts. I don't know if that's going to help me or not — I can tell you after Melbourne, I cannot predict the future.\\n\\nThe only thing I can say is if I am healthy, I believe that I can do it. If not, I (would) be at home fishing."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – Nancy Pelosi, who took the gavel as House speaker Thursday, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview that President Donald Trump can expect a different world from the first two years of his presidency when the GOP controlled both chambers of Congress.\\n\\nThe California Democrat plans to confront Trump on many fronts, from investigating the deaths of immigrant children in U.S. custody to demanding Trump's tax returns and protecting special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.\\n\\nThose clashes loom as Pelosi and her Democratic colleagues remain locked in a budget and border security battle with Trump that has left parts of the federal government shut for nearly two weeks.\\n\\nThe election of speaker was one of the first orders of business for the new Congress sworn in Thursday, when Democrats took control of the House for the first time in eight years.\\n\\nTrump warned that investigations of him and his administration would lead to a war-like posture in Washington. The new speaker made clear she won't shrink from a fight.\\n\\nHe was used to serving with a Republican Congress, House and Senate that was a rubber stamp to him. That won't be the case, Pelosi said in the USA TODAY interview just before the holidays. Oversight of government by the Congress is our responsibility.\\n\\nThat's the role that we play.\\n\\nDespite calls from some on the left wing of her party to try to remove Trump from office, Pelosi said the efforts to serve as a check on Trump's power don't extend to impeachment – at least not yet. She remains intent on protecting Mueller's investigation into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia in the 2016 election.\\n\\nMore:In Trump era, Nancy Pelosi admits to nostalgia about George W. Bush. Here's why\\n\\nMore:Nancy Pelosi and Jim McGovern: House Democrats will restore transparency, ethics, unity\\n\\nMore:Here's what Democrats will do to immediately change the House\\n\\nIf there's to be grounds for impeachment of President Trump – and I'm not seeking those grounds – that would have to be so clearly bipartisan in terms of acceptance of it before I think we should go down any impeachment path, Pelosi said.\\n\\nI keep coming back to the same word: the facts, she said. The facts will indicate a path, and I don't think we should impeach a president for any political reason, but I don't think we can ignore any behavior that requires attention and that was all based on the facts.\\n\\nOne of the first moves Democrats will take to try to check the power of the White House and Republicans will be the unveiling of an anti-corruption bill designed to ease obstacles to voting, curb the role of big money in politics and hold politicians and government officials to higher ethical standards. The plan's supporters want to require presidents to release their taxes – something Trump has refused to do.\\n\\nNewly armed with subpoena power, Democrats are likely to investigate potential conflicts of interest between Trump's businesses and his role in setting policy for his administration, as well as possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia and whether Trump and his family have financial ties to Russia. Democrats are also likely to subpoena Trump's tax returns.\\n\\nJim Manley, a former aide to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, said oversight of the Trump administration will be a target-rich environment, but as speaker, Pelosi will have an important role in guiding the broad parameters of the investigations.\\n\\nShe'll give the chairmen wide latitude, don't get me wrong, but it's all going to be coordinated by the leadership, Manley said. That's just how she rolls.\\n\\n'War room-style effort'\\n\\nFor the past two years, members of Pelosi's team have held weekly strategy meetings with top policy and communication staffers from several committees with oversight powers. They have focused on exposing scandals among administration officials who have since left their positions, allegations of Trump's conflicts of interests, the handling of security clearances and aspects of the Russia investigation.\\n\\nGiven the magnitude of the corruption, cronyism and incompetency in this administration, it's definitely a war room-style effort, said Ashley Etienne, a Pelosi spokesperson who leads communication work on oversight for Democrats.\\n\\nAs House speaker from 2007 to 2011 and as minority leader before and after that, Pelosi, 78, named close allies to the House Intelligence Committee, the only committee whose membership is controlled by party leaders and the committee that's the central player in the Russia investigation.\\n\\nShe is a former ranking member of the committee, and she may be more deeply involved in its work than any other, said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the incoming chairman.\\n\\nHer involvement isn't at the level of specific investigative threads or witnesses, he said. It's more at the level of the Gang of Eight, the intelligence committee and party leaders who are briefed on covert actions.\\n\\nWhen it comes to protecting the Mueller investigation, her position is part of a consensus, said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the incoming House Judiciary Committee chairman.\\n\\nNancy certainly agrees with that, and she pushed that, Nadler said.\\n\\nCaution on impeachment\\n\\nPelosi's own caution about impeachment hasn't stopped some Democrats from twice voting for impeachment. A House resolution was defeated 355 to 66 on Jan. 19, 2018.\\n\\nThe group Need to Impeach, which is headquartered in her district and funded by billionaire activist Tom Steyer, gathered 6.5 million signatures in support of impeachment – and expects Pelosi to come around.\\n\\nThe Democrats nationally want action around Trump, said Kevin Mack, lead strategist for Need to Impeach. We as a party have to prove that we can represent Democratic values. So I don't think Nancy Pelosi can be a speed bump on impeachment forever.\\n\\nOthers said part of her caution about impeachment comes from watching Republicans go after President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal – and lose House seats in 1998. The House, then dominated by Republicans, voted to impeach Clinton after the election, but he was acquitted by the Senate.\\n\\nGOP pollster Frank Luntz said Americans could welcome the oversight of the Trump administration if they feel it is being done for the right reasons.\\n\\nOn the flip side, Luntz said, If they think it's oversight for political gain, they will reject it.\\n\\nTrump has sought to rally his political base by portraying Democrats as intent on taking him down. Alex Conant, a former aide to Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said Clinton benefited from overzealous Republicans during the Lewinsky scandal.\\n\\nBecause of that, Conant said, Pelosi will need to walk a fine line.\\n\\nPelosi's role will be to negotiate big policy matters with the White House ... and then to try to limit and guide the investigations behind the scenes, said Conant, a White House spokesman during President George W. Bush's second term. Clearly, the Trump administration would love nothing more than for Democrats to overreach and go on fishing expeditions.\\n\\nPelosi is not only the first woman to become House speaker but she is one of just a handful of people who won multiple terms in the post.\\n\\nShe is admired by some in the party for her legislative prowess. Getting Obamacare over the finish line is one example of that.\\n\\nFormer President Barack Obama said in November on The Axe Files podcast that Pelosi isn't always the best on a cable show or with a quick soundbite, but he called her an extraordinary partner and praised her as one of the most effective legislative leaders that this country's ever seen.\\n\\nCoastal elite caricature\\n\\nShe's seen by Republicans and some Democrats as the personification of a coastal elite. Her Hawaii trip during the government shutdown fed into that criticism.\\n\\nDuring the 2018 midterm campaign, the GOP ran constant ads hammering her, pointing out that her favorability rating was underwater. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from mid-December had her at 41 percent unfavorable, 28 percent favorable. That same poll had Trump at 52 percent unfavorable, 37 percent favorable.\\n\\nThe campaign featured scathing attacks on Pelosi from Trump and Republicans. Even some Democrats sought to distance themselves from Pelosi. She worked on strategy behind the scenes and hauled in $135.6 million for Democrats this cycle, including $129 million directly for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, according to her office. She prevailed, and Democrats won a net gain of 40 seats.\\n\\nPelosi has historically appeared to be proper and relied on this grandmother image, but she's actually a very strong, determined woman, said Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. Her relationship with Trump will be a stunning dynamic to watch, Speier said, because Trump hasn't had to deal with anyone like her before – a mother of five children who knows how to deal with bratty behavior.\\n\\nThe president has been successful in bullying people into doing things – that's how he makes his deals, she said. He's got to change his strategy, or he will fail.\\n\\nAfter Democrats won the House, Pelosi faced opposition in her bid for speaker, but she stamped out a centrist rebellion by agreeing to limit her term to just four more years. Rep. Marcia Fudge, D-Ohio, considered challenging Pelosi for the top spot – until Pelosi announced that Fudge would chair a subcommittee focused on elections and voting issues, one of her signature issues.\\n\\nRepublicans grudgingly admire her toughness and ability to hold her caucus together. Pelosi plays the blood sport of politics better than the past three GOP speakers, said Tim Cameron, a Republican strategist who worked for the House GOP conference under Speaker John Boehner.\\n\\nHer ability to dispel potential rivals is literally unrivaled, Cameron said.\\n\\nI think every Republican speaker since 2010 has been jealous of what she was able to get done from 2006 to 2010. She never really had the issues that we had with the conservative wing of the party, Cameron said.\\n\\nLecturing Trump\\n\\nThough much of Pelosi's legislative dealmaking is done behind the scenes, the country witnessed her latest toe-to-toe battle with Trump on government funding during a televised meeting Dec. 11 in the Oval Office.\\n\\nRepublicans pounced on Pelosi for saying the GOP didn't have the votes in the House for a border wall. The House passed $5.7 billion in funding for the wall Dec. 20, but the bill didn't get a vote in the Senate, and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on Trump to abandon the wall.\\n\\nPelosi told USA TODAY that the House vote was another example of Trump's rubber stamp Congress.\\n\\nI know that many of them did not really believe in that, but they gave him the vote anyway, for whatever reason, she said.\\n\\nPelosi's allies pointed to that Oval Office meeting – when the president said he'd be proud to shut down the government – as the latest example of Pelosi holding her own. She lectured Trump on negotiating with Congress, then donned sunglasses as she left the White House, in a moment that lit up the internet.\\n\\nSpeier recalled attending a holiday party with Pelosi the weekend after the meeting with the president. Women approached the pair to thank them for their work and compliment Pelosi for standing up to Trump.\\n\\nI said, 'We're sassy,'  Speier recalled to USA TODAY. And then Nancy says, No, we're badasses.'"}
{"original": "The Associated Press\\n\\nHARTFORD, Conn. – Kim Mulkey and Baylor are making a habit of ending Connecticut's streaks.\\n\\nTeá Cooper scored 27 points and No. 6 Baylor used a dominant fourth quarter to beat top-ranked Connecticut 74-58 on Thursday night, ending the Huskies' 98-game home winning streak.\\n\\nIt was the second consecutive year that the Lady Bears ended a long Connecticut run. Last season, Baylor stopped the Huskies' 126-game regular-season winning streak.\\n\\nWe just happen to be the team that beat them. Not anymore than that. Streaks are made to be broken, Mulkey said.\\n\\nConnecticut fell one victory short of tying its own NCAA record of 99 in a row at home. The Huskies previous loss at home came in the Big East final against Notre Dame on March 12, 2013. The defeat on Thursday was the worst for UConn since a 23-point defeat to LSU in the regional final of the 2007 NCAA Tournament.\\n\\nIt hurts because that spans from three other teams, Connecticut senior guard Crystal Dangerfield said.\\n\\nIt was the worst home loss since Dec. 5, 2005, when UConn lost to North Carolina by 23 points.\\n\\nBaylor (12-1) led by three going into the fourth quarter and neither team could get much going on offense in the first few minutes of the final period. The Huskies cut the deficit to one on Christyn Williams' jumper with 6:36 left. Then the defending national champions took over.\\n\\nThe Lady Bears responded with the next 15 points to put the game away. The run started on a layup by Lauren Cox and two baskets by Nalyssa Smith. Smith finished with 20 points and 12 rebounds.\\n\\nWe went on a run and they just missed some shots, Mulkey said. We didn't do anything differently in the fourth quarter. Fatigue set in, or our defense was that good in the fourth quarter. We're going to guard you man. Don't think there was any secret about that. I'd like to tell you we made a change and I was a genius.\\n\\nConnecticut (12-1) didn't score a basket after Williams' jumper until Dangerfield hit a 3-pointer in the final minute and the game decided.\\n\\nWilliams had 21 points to lead the Huskies.\\n\\nThis was Connecticut's first real test of the season. Since 2007, the Huskies (12-1) have played at least one team ranked in the top five before the New Year. This season the only ranked opponent before Thursday that UConn has faced was then-No. 16 DePaul.\\n\\nYou know we have a really young team young in terms of being able to play in this kind of game, Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma said. They don't know how to play in this kind of game. … Fourth quarter we got four stops in a row and we came out empty handed in all four possessions. Had we scored in three of those possessions, we might have won the game.\\n\\nCOACHES POLL:The top 25 teams in women's basketball\\n\\nNOMINATED:Catchings, Jackson finalists for Women's Basketball Hall of Fame\\n\\nWhile Connecticut hadn't been tested this season until this game, Baylor suffered its only loss of the season in the Paradise Jam Tournament over Thanksgiving to then-No. 5 South Carolina.\\n\\nBaylor was up 33-25 late in the second quarter when UConn coach Geno Auriemma called a timeout. The Huskies responded by scoring the next nine points before Baylor hit the last basket before the half to take a 35-34 lead into the break.\\n\\nThe Lady Bears extended that lead to 55-52 after three quarters. The Huskies had a chance to make it a one-point game, but Walker missed a layup with a few seconds left. Auriemma slammed the scorers table with both hands in disgust after she missed it.\\n\\nBUSY MONTH: Connecticut has three more games against ranked teams coming up over the next few weeks with No. 23 Tennessee coming to Connecticut on Jan. 23 in the first matchup of the former rivals since 2007. The Huskies then face No. 2 Oregon on Feb. 3 and fourth-ranked South Carolina on Feb. 10.\\n\\nThis time of the year you have to treat every game like it's another part of your class, Auriemma said. This is one of the tests you have to take, one every month. It would be devastating if this was the final and now we're done, but it's not.\\n\\nROUGH NIGHT: Connecticut starting center Olivia Nelson-Ododa had a tough game. She didn't score and was 0-for-8 from the field with six rebounds. She came into the game averaging 13 points and 9.4 rebounds.\\n\\nLiv she's a different breed man. She'll get better, Auriemma said. She'll get better. Next time we play in this type of game she will get better.\\n\\nTIP-INS:\\n\\nThe Lady Bears also beat Connecticut last season when the Huskies were ranked No. 1. The two victories are Baylor's only wins over a No. 1 team. … These two teams are 1-2 in victories since 2010-11, with Connecticutgoing 339-18 and Baylor 324-24. … UConn will be ranked in the poll this upcoming Monday for the 500th consecutive week. … A host of WNBA coaches and GMs were in attendance checking out Cox, Crystal Dangerfield, Cooper and Juicy Landrum.. … Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont sat behind the UConn bench. … Caitlin Bickle played her first action for Baylor in over a month after she had surgery to repair a partial tear in her right meniscus. … UConn's 99-game home winning streak ended against St. John's on Feb. 19, 2012.\\n\\nUP NEXT:\\n\\nBaylor: Hosts Oklahoma State on Sunday\\n\\nConnecticut: Hosts Houston on Saturday."}
{"original": "For all the flaws of the Bowl Championship Series, the erstwhile postseason format succeeded more often than not in creating matchups for the national championship that piqued the interest of an audience well beyond the sport's traditional fan base.\\n\\nThere was Texas and Southern California in 2005, which still holds the highest television rating and largest viewership of any postseason game since the advent of the BCS in 1998. There was Florida and Ohio State in 2006. Alabama and Texas in 2009.\\n\\nIf not always competitive — seven of the final nine BCS games were decided by double digits — the matchups accurately portrayed college football as a national sport, even as the Southeastern Conference began a run of seven consecutive championships in 2006.\\n\\nAs expected, the College Football Playoff has dramatically altered how the Football Bowl Subdivision approaches the regular season, turning every Saturday into a referendum on teams and conferences. Behind the layers and layers of hype and microscopic coverage of weekly rankings, the playoff has dominated the national conversation and represented a significant step forward in determining the best team in the FBS.\\n\\nEven amid clamors for an expansion to an eight-team bracket, the novelty of the playoff has also overshadowed the format's missing piece: the failure to provide a matchup for the championship between two national brands.\\n\\nThat will change next week. This season's championship game between the Crimson Tide and Ohio State is the dream matchup of the playoff era, featuring two juggernauts in a pairing that will speak to a far broader audience than the regional showcases that have defined the playoff's existence.\\n\\nThe last championship to include two teams with such broad reach came at the end of the 2012 season, when Alabama steamrolled Notre Dame to win the program's second consecutive title and third in four years.\\n\\nALABAMA: Key to success may be victory in waiting game\\n\\nOHIO STATE: Could Buckeyes be good enough to beat Crimson Tide? Opinion from Dan Wolken\\n\\n2020 BOWL SCHEDULE: Complete results\\n\\nNFL DRAFT: What Ohio State QB Justin Fields' Sugar Bowl performance could mean\\n\\nNFL DRAFT: Clemson QB Trevor Lawrence will be No. 1 pick\\n\\nThe game next Monday includes the intrigue of combining two of the biggest names in the sport with the added subplots of revisiting Ohio State's win in the second national semifinal of the playoff era and answering the question of which conference owns the FBS, the Big Ten or the SEC.\\n\\nIn addition, Ohio State enters next week looking to build off a resounding Sugar Bowl win against Clemson and shine a spotlight on the tenure of second-year coach Ryan Day, who with surprisingly little fanfare has won 23 of his first 24 games. From Alabama's perspective, another blowout paced by an explosive offense would give this year's team a credible case for being ranked among the best in program history.\\n\\nWhile how the game plays out is always difficult to predict — half of the six title games have been decided by less than a touchdown and the other three by at least 17 points — the matchup will undoubtedly create a bump in the playoff's television ratings by drawing in viewers tired of seeing the same teams from the same geographic area meet for the championship.\\n\\nFor the first time since 2014, when the Buckeyes won the first playoff title against Oregon, the game will feature a team from outside the Southeast. The 2015, 2016 and 2018 seasons ended with Alabama against Clemson. The Crimson Tide beat SEC rival Georgia in 2017. Last season ended with LSU beating Clemson to complete an unbeaten season.\\n\\nThat game against Oregon drew in a playoff-record 34.6 million viewers across all ESPN networks, in part due to the newness of the bracket. But no other title game has drawn in more than 28.4 million viewers while the last two games have featured the smallest audiences of the playoff era, perhaps indicating general fatigue caused by predictability and repetitiveness.\\n\\nThe possibility of the fourth iteration of Alabama and Clemson — and the fifth if you count Alabama's win in the Sugar Bowl during the 2017 national semifinals — carried deep historical impact and meaning, as the continuation of a cross-conference rivalry with no analog in the annals of the sport.\\n\\nThe fact the Tigers have crafted a dynasty to last, with two national championships amid an FBS-record 10 consecutive seasons with 10 or more wins, doesn't overcome the fact that Clemson is not a national brand anywhere near Ohio State's scope.\\n\\nUnlike Clemson and perhaps even more so than Alabama, Ohio State touts a national following with roots dating back generations, the result of decades spent as one of the most consistently productive programs in the FBS.\\n\\nThe Buckeyes have claimed eight national championships, won 40 conference championships, including the last four, and made four playoff appearances. With the exception of this shortened season, Ohio State has won at least 10 games in every year since 2012, when former coach Urban Meyer ushered in an era of success matched in program history only by the Buckeyes' two-decade heyday under Woody Hayes.\\n\\nMost important, the Buckeyes have been the defining figure in the Big Ten, the only true rival to the SEC. In essence, while Clemson has recently challenged Alabama's place atop college football, Ohio State has long been Alabama's mirror image — the Crimson Tide dominated the Southeast while the Buckeyes owned the Midwest.\\n\\nAccording to the official records compiled by the NCAA, Ohio State ranks first in career winning percentage (73.1%) and Alabama second (72.9%) among programs with at least 25 years of FBS experience. The Buckeyes rank second (929) and the Crimson Tide third (928) in career victories, while the two programs have combined to claim 25 national championships, some of dubious distinction.\\n\\nThrough no real fault of its own, this is the championship-game matchup the selection committee has been hoping for since the playoff's debut – two powerhouse programs with deep roots in the fabric of the sport and coast-to-coast appeal.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY Sports colleges reporter Paul Myerberg on Twitter @PaulMyerberg"}

Then she could show us what she truly had to offer. Then she could make a play for a world title.\\n\\nInstead, she had to languish for years in the bantamweight division, 10 pounds up from where she was most at home. And in the UFC, that meant going up against a veritable murderer's row of women's 135-pounders.\\n\\nAs a bantamweight in the UFC, check out whom Eye shared the cage with: Sarah Kaufman, Alexis Davis, Leslie Smith, Miesha Tate, Julianna Pena, Sara McMann and Bethe Correia. Tate went on to become a champion. Kaufman was a champ in Strikeforce and now is a champ for Invicta FC. Davis, McMann and Correia all fought for the title at one point. Pena was an Ultimate Fighter winner.\\n\\nAnd yet there Eye was in 2016, being written off by most people becasue of a 1-5 slump – even though in those five losses, she never was finished. And two of them (Davis and Correia) were split-decision setbacks that many had going Eye's way, anyway.\\n\\nSo when the flyweight division finally happened in the UFC, Eye was among the most excited fighters around because it meant she finally could put her talk to the test.\\n\\nIn 2018, after a four-fight skid at bantamweight, Eye finally got the chance to return to flyweight. She went 3-0 in the calendar year with wins over Kalinda Faria, Jessica-Rose Clark and Katlyn Chookagian.\\n\\nThose wins positioned her right in the mix for a potential crack at new champion Valentina Shevchenko sometime this year.\\n\\nI'm never going to get what I feel I deserve, Eye said after her UFC 231 win over Chookagian.

Trump said Nunes had earned it for defending him through the allegations that his campaign had colluded with the Kremlin.\\n\\nWhat he's gone through, and his bravery, he should get a very important medal, Trump said.\\n\\nIn May 2020, he praised both Jordan and Nunes, who he said wouldn't stop trying to defend him.\\n\\nYou deserve a medal. You deserve the equivalent of Pulitzer Prizes, Trump told the congressmen. They ought to take the Pulitzer Prize away from all of these phony journalists that got a Pulitzer Prize.\\n\\nCritics, however, say both men used obfuscation and deception as they sought to protect the White House from scrutiny. Those critics were disturbed by the reports of Trump's plan to honor his two congressional allies.\\n\\nI feel for all the great Americans who have received the Medal of Freedom over the decades. What's next, spray painting MAGA on the WH walls? tweeted David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Barack Obama.\\n\\n– William Cummings\\n\\nAll 10 living former secretaries of defense denounce idea of involving military in election\\n\\nAll 10 living former secretaries of defense, a group spanning multiple administrations with decades of experience, denounced calls to involve the Defense Department in adjudicating the 2020 election in an op-ed in The Washington Post.\\n\\nEfforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory, the group writes. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic.\\n\\nThe group includes officials from both Democratic and Republican administrations, with prominent figures such as Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld, as well as Mark Esper and Jim Mattis, who served under President Donald Trump.\\n\\nThe condemnation comes after the president and his supporters have alleged widespread voter fraud, without evidence. Multiple investigations of the election tally in key battleground states found that President-elect Joe Biden was the winner. The Supreme Court has twice found the president's legal challenges to have no standing.\\n\\nHaving failed in the courts, some of Trump's allies have expressed support for the idea of asking the military to somehow intervene and the idea of declaring martial law was reportedly raised at one Oval Office meeting. A December New York Times report said Trump repeatedly asked aides whether he could use the military to intervene and rerun the election in states the president lost.\\n\\nThe Defense Department has said there's no role for the U.S. military in determining the outcome of a U.S. election. But the current leadership has not cooperated with the normal peaceful transition process, according to the incoming Biden administration.\\n\\nThe former defense secretaries reminded Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller that he and his subordinates – political appointees, officers and civil servants – are each bound by oath, law and precedent to facilitate the entry into office of the incoming administration, and to do so wholeheartedly.\\n\\nWe call upon them, in the strongest terms, to do as so many generations of Americans have done before them. This final action is in keeping with the highest traditions and professionalism of the U.S. armed forces, and the history of democratic transition in our great country.\\n\\n– Matthew Brown\\n\\nTrump campaign aide calls for release of full Georgia tape – Washington Post accommodates him\\n\\nSuggesting a lack of context, a Donald Trump campaign aide at one point Sunday demanded the release of the full conversation between the president and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger\\n\\nRelease the full tape! senior campaign adviser Jason Miller demanded in a tweet – one posted just minutes before The Washington Post did exactly that.\\n\\nThe one hour-and-two-minute tape showed exactly what the four-and-a-half-minute excerpts released earlier did: That Trump tried to bully Raffensperger into overturning Biden's victory in Georgia.\\n\\nIt also exposed Miller to ridicule, as hundreds of social media users tweeted the full tape back to the campaign adviser.\\n\\nHere is the full tape, pollster Frank Luntz said to Miller. Happy to help!\\n\\n– David Jackson\\n\\nRepublican lawmakers spar over efforts to object to Electoral College results\\n\\nSome Republican lawmakers' efforts to object to the certification of Electoral College results continued to cause debate among Republicans as a new Congress convened on Sunday.\\n\\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the third-ranking House Republican, circulated a note among her Republican colleagues Sunday morning calling efforts to overturn the election and prevent the certification of Electoral College results directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans, according to a source familiar with the memo not authorized to speak on the record. NBC News had first reported the memo.\\n\\nAnd in a two-page statement released Sunday, seven House Republicans said they opposed the effort by some Republican lawmakers to object to Congress' certification of the Electoral College results on Wednesday. The lawmakers, some of whom are members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus – normally stalwart defenders of the president – said inserting Congress into the Electoral College process would amount to stealing power from the people and the states.\\n\\nThe text of the Constitution is clear. States select electors. Congress does not, the lawmakers wrote.\\n\\nAmong the signatories is Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a former chief of staff to Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who is spearheading one of the efforts to challenge the electoral college results.\\n\\nAt least a dozen Senate Republicans plan to join House Republicans in objecting to Congress' certification of Electoral College results. Their effort is unlikely to succeed, as a majority of both the House and Senate must vote to exclude electoral votes, but the ensuing lengthy debate may further cast doubt among Republicans about the results of the election.\\n\\n– Nicholas Wu\\n\\nBipartisan group of senators push back against Electoral College objection\\n\\nAfter a dozen Republican senators declared last week that they intend to object to the certification of the Electoral College result, many of their Democratic and Republican colleagues have strongly condemned their plan, saying they risk losing voter's faith in the process over unfounded allegations of widespread fraud.\\n\\nThe 2020 election is over, a bipartisan group of 10 senators declared in a joint statement on Sunday. All challenges through recounts and appeals have been exhausted. At this point, further attempts to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the 2020 Presidential election are contrary to the clearly expressed will of the American people and only serve to undermine Americans' confidence in the already determined election results.\\n\\nThe group, comprised of Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va.; Susan Collins, R-Maine; Mark Warner, D-Va.; Bill Cassidy; R-La., Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H.; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Angus King, I-Maine; Mitt Romney, R-Utah, Maggie Hassan, D-N.H., and Dick Durbin, D-Ill., said the voters have spoken and Congress must now fulfill its responsibility to certify the election results.\\n\\nIn two weeks, we will begin working with our colleagues and the new Administration on bipartisan, common sense solutions to the enormous challenges facing our country. It is time to move forward, they said.\\n\\nIn addition, Republican Sens. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, Roy Blunt of Missouri and Richard Shelby of Alabama told reporters on Sunday they would not support an effort to object to the electoral count.\\n\\nI think it's a solemn responsibility to accept these electoral college votes that have been certified by governors, secretaries of states all across the country, said Capito. I just think this is an ill-fated journey.\\n\\n– William Cummings\\n\\nTrump pressures Georgia official to change vote totals in recorded call\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to flip the state's election result, in a recording of a phone call published Sunday by The Washington Post.\\n\\nThe people of Georgia are angry, the people in the country are angry, Trump tells Raffensperger in the hourlong call, which took place Saturday, according to the Post. Citing unsubstantiated reports he heard, Trump said the vote total should be changed.\\n\\nThere's nothing wrong with saying, you know, that you've recalculated, Trump told Raffensperger.\\n\\nWell, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong, replied the Republican Georgia official.\\n\\nTrump persisted in trying to cajole Raffensperger, telling him at one point, All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.\\n\\nThe president also warned Raffensperger and his general counsel that he thought theicertification of the result could be considered criminal.\\n\\nEarlier Sunday, Trump tweeted that he had spoken with Raffensperger about Fulton County and voter fraud in Georgia. Trump said Raffensperger was unwilling, or unable, to answer questions about previously debunked voter fraud claims.\\n\\nRespectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out, Raffensperger replied.\\n\\n– William Cummings\\n\\nPerdue backs effort to object to Biden victory\\n\\nDavid Perdue, who faces Democrat Jon Ossoff in Tuesday's Georgia Senate runoff election, won't be among the lawmakers meeting in a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, but he is urging them to object to the certification of the Nov. 3 election results.\\n\\nWithout citing specifics, Perdue claimed on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that there were huge irregularities in Georgia that need to be investigated and need to be corrected. He said that, if he was able, he would join the dozen Republican senators and more than 100 GOP House members who are expected to challenge the certification of President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College defeat of President Donald Trump.\\n\\nI'm encouraging my colleagues to object, Perdue said. This is something that the American people demand right now.\\n\\nWith the closing of the 116th Congress, Perdue is no longer a sitting senator and will have to wait in a political limbo until the results of his runoff election against Ossoff are certified by the state of Georgia. If he loses, he won't return to the Senate – at least, not this term – and if he wins, it could take more than a week to get a final count of the vote in what is expected to be a close race.\\n\\nBefore Sunday, Perdue had not explicitly stated his position on the upcoming certification of the Electoral College result. Perdue and Kelly Loeffler – another Georgia Republican in the same Senate runoff limbo – have had to walk a fine line in the two months since the election on the question of whether widespread fraud occurred.\\n\\nPerdue told Fox News, I don't think I should be in this runoff if everything had happened the way it should have in November, but the only recourse we have is to get out and fight and rise up and vote. But when pressed on what was being done to prevent the alleged fraud from recurring Tuesday, Perdue did not cite anything that wasn't done ahead of Nov. 3.\\n\\nOn Friday, Trump said the November election in Georgia was both illegal and invalid because the same early voting practices were being followed for the runoffs. He added, that would include the two current Senatorial Elections.\\n\\n– William Cummings"}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump revived the political battle between businesspeople and environmentalists Thursday, proposing to reduce federal regulations on construction projects, which critics said would worsen climate change.\\n\\nFrom day one, my administration has made fixing this regulatory nightmare a top priority, Trump said during a ceremony at the White House. And we want to build new roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, bigger, better, faster, and we want to build them at less cost.\\n\\nEnvironmental groups said the plan benefits corporate interests at the expense of public health.\\n\\nGene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters, said Trump's proposed changes would undercut the National Environmental Policy Act, the nation's landmark environmental law that turned 50 years old last week.\\n\\nThe implications for access to clean air and clean water and for public input, especially among the low-income communities and communities of color most impacted by climate change and toxic pollution, could be dire, Karpinski said.\\n\\nTrump impeachment:Pelosi says she'll send Senate articles of impeachment against Trump 'soon'\\n\\nThe plan would basically ease environmental rules for construction projects that do not have significant federal funding. It would set time limits on the length of federal reviews of these projects and would not allow regulators to assess a project's cumulative effects on climate change.\\n\\nThe proposals are likely to be published in the federal register this week, and they will undergo a process of public comment and hearings. The government is likely to issue final regulations in the fall.\\n\\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Trump's plan means more polluters will be right there next to the water supply of our children. That's a public health issue.\\n\\nAt the White House, Trump said the approval process should boil down to one federal decision, rather than a series of approvals. He said the changes are designed to slash job-killing regulations and shrink endless delays in approval for necessary projects.\\n\\nHe called the current regulations big government at its absolute worst.\\n\\nPlane crash in Iran:Trump says he thinks 'something very terrible happened' to Ukraine jet that crashed in Iran\\n\\nTrump announced the proposal at a White House ceremony that featured invited guests, including construction workers who wore safety vests and white hard hats.\\n\\nMembers of the oil, gas, agriculture and trucking industries, as well as trade union groups, have long advocated for changes to environmental regulations, saying they are cumbersome and used by environmentalists to block projects.\\n\\nJay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, applauded the proposed changes, saying, Our hope is that these improvements will modernize infrastructure permitting for highways, bridges, power lines, and cell towers.\\n\\nThe National Environmental Policy Act's regulations have not been updated in more than 40 years, Trump administration officials said.\\n\\nExclusive:Americans say Soleimani's killing made US less safe, Trump 'reckless' on Iran\\n\\nClimate change:The Democratic presidential candidates tell us how they would address climate change\\n\\nCritics said the changes will enable supporters of construction projects to discount their impact on climate change when seeking permits from the government. The results, they said, will be a worse environment with more deadly ramifications from climate change.\\n\\nTrump's gift to the fossil fuel industry and special interests will silence ordinary Americans while giving polluters a free pass to trash the environment, destroy public lands and kill wildlife, said Brett Hartl, government affairs director at the Center for Biological Diversity.\\n\\nDeregulation has been a cornerstone of Trump's presidency, and he figures to promote the issue during his reelection campaign this year.\\n\\nIn a statement Jan. 1 on the 50th anniversary of the National Environmental Policy Act, Trump cited complaints about regulations and previewed his proposed changes.\\n\\nPeople seeking permits for big projects can face significant uncertainty and delays that can increase costs, derail important projects and threaten jobs for American workers and labor union members, Trump said."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nWhen talking about the possibility of expanding the College Football Playoff, the word momentum gets tossed around a lot.\\n\\nExpansion seems inevitable. Why? Because playoffs always expand. But when?\\n\\nBig Ten Commissioner Jim Delany told The Athletic last month he was ready to start talking about a larger playoff field, and prominent Big Ten athletic directors Barry Alvarez of Wisconsin and Jim Phillips from Northwestern have voiced support for that idea.\\n\\nMomentum toward expansion?\\n\\nAt the moment I don't see that kind of momentum, Atlantic Coast Conference Commissioner John Swofford said.\\n\\nNotre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick, who sits on the CFP management committee along with the 10 FBS conference commissioners, said now is the perfect time to talk about changes to the four-team playoff.\\n\\nThe CFP is doing great in terms of fan interest. In terms television ratings. In terms of every measure it has exceeded our expectations, Swarbrick said. So being open to talking about the model, this is the perfect time to do it. Do it from a position of strength.\\n\\nBut, he added, Doesn't mean there's any momentum for change.\\n\\nThe current postseason system is not quite halfway through a 12-year contract with ESPN that runs through 2026. The fifth CFP national champion will be crowned Monday night when No. 1 Alabama faces No. 2 Clemson at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Like clockwork, the discussion over whether the current model is satisfactory has been cranked up for weeks — and that word momentum is never far away.\\n\\nIt would seem to me that the political momentum here is moving in the direction of taking a real hard look at expanding this in some way shape or form over the next period of time, which I think would be before the end of this 12 years, said Chris Bevilacqua, co-founder of Bevilacqua Helfant Ventures who has advised conferences in media rights contract negotiations.\\n\\nWhat is certain about playoff expansion is that it will not be a simple task. That alone suggests later — after the completion of the current media rights deal — is a better bet than sooner.\\n\\nI don't think this is on a fast-track at the moment, Swofford said. But I do think there is an openness and willingness to discuss it.\\n\\nThere would be plenty of hurdles to clear, and the number of teams and how they are chosen is relatively simple compared to everything else.\\n\\nWHEN AND WHERE\\n\\nCollege football is currently a one-semester sport and university presidents want to keep it that way. There is a lot already packed into the window from Labor Day weekend when the season opens to about Jan. 10 when the championship game is played. Last year, the NCAA football oversight committee looked at creating a slightly longer season to ensure at least two open dates for each team every year. That meant starting preseason practice in July, before summer classes ended at many schools. The idea was dropped.\\n\\nKeeping the same calendar would mean playoff games in the middle of December, but that would conflict with final exams on many campuses. That space has also been declared off limits by university presidents.\\n\\nWant to play quarterfinals on campuses the third week of December, two weeks after conference championship weekend? Now it's not just the athletes who are being disrupted during finals, but the campus and the surrounding community.\\n\\nHave you ever tried to get a hotel (on short-notice) in Clemson, South Carolina? Or Blacksburg, Virginia? Clemson athletic director Dan Radakovich said.\\n\\nIt has been suggested the quarterfinals could replace conference championship games. Good luck with that. First off, the Southeastern Conference has made it clear it has no desire to get rid of an event that is worth about $75 million to the league. Still, if an expanded playoff has automatic bids for conference champions, those title games become far more interesting and valuable to media companies holding their broadcast rights.\\n\\nShortening the regular-season from 12 to 11 games also comes with a cost to schools that make millions hosting or get big payouts for going on the road.\\n\\nAnother when factor: Would the College Football Playoff want to compete with the NFL, which plays regular-season games on Saturdays during weeks 15 and 16 of its 17-week schedule? If so, the value of those games drops for a broadcaster paying the rights fee.\\n\\nHEALTH AND SAFETY AND MONEY\\n\\nMore often than not teams that reach the CFP championship game will play a total of 15 games. With the long-term effects of football more scrutinized than ever before, adding even one more game is not something done lightly.\\n\\nWe have different obligations than professional sports commissioners who are primarily in it for the entertainment value and driving as much revenue, said former Big 12 Commissioner Dan Beebe, who was a staunch playoff opponent back in the days of the Bowl Championship Series. We have to consider these are student athletes, non-compensated young people.\\n\\nUncompensated, but for how much longer? A federal court case in California challenges the legality of the NCAA's amateurism model and compensation being capped at the value of a scholarship. The NCAA has no involvement with the CFP, which is run by the FBS conferences. The playoff currently generates about $470 million per year that is distributed throughout all levels of college football.\\n\\nWell if you're going to put one more (round) and everybody else gets enriched, what's going to happen with the ones who are playing in those games that are enriching everybody else? Beebe said.\\n\\nESPN executives are quick to point out they do not decide what happens with the playoff and would be fine with expansion if that's what the decision-makers want. But it's unclear how well-positioned the network is to cough up millions for more playoff games.\\n\\nIMPACT ON REGULAR SEASON AND BOWLS\\n\\nCollege football Saturdays are an event for every campus community and the decision-makers want to keep it that way. The playoff has already devalued the regular season in some ways and expansion would continue that trend.\\n\\nThere are no more Games of the Century, regular-season matchups with ridiculously high stakes. But four playoff spots have kept more teams involved in the championship race deeper into November. Eight spots keeps even more teams involved, but eventually there will be an Auburn-Alabama game or Michigan-Ohio State game or maybe a conference title game that will feature two highly ranked teams playing for seeding.\\n\\nIt's easy to scoff at the importance of all the bowls, with players skipping them more and more. But there are 130 FBS teams and maybe 15 percent have a realistic chance to make the current playoff. Increase the berths to eight and maybe that percentage doubles. The majority of teams are still playing for the best bowl spot possible. That's how those schools keep their fans engaged.\\n\\nThe current powerbrokers in college football mostly grew up in the bowl system. They created the playoff to protect it. Expansion would further damage it. And while some fans don't care about the Rose Bowl kicking off at 5 p.m. Eastern on New Year's Day so the sun sets behind the San Gabriel Mountains in the second half, a lot of people with influence do.\\n\\nWHO GETS IN?\\n\\nIf everything else is sorted out, there are also questions about format. Automatic bids for Power Five conferences? Best eight teams? Some combination of automatic qualifiers and rankings? Where do the Group of Five conferences fit? Keep the selection committee or not? If yes, change the criteria by which it selects teams or keep it highly subjective?\\n\\nCharlotte athletic director Mike Hill favors an eight-team format, with automatic bids for Power Five champions and the highest-ranked Group of Five team along with two at-large slots.\\n\\nThere are too many quality teams who could legitimately win the national title but are left out of the playoff, he wrote to AP. The challenge will be in determining where to play first-round games. ... It would be a major challenge with one week's notice.\\n\\nNEXT STEPS\\n\\nThe CFP management committee meets the morning of the Alabama-Clemson game in San Jose, California. For the first time since the playoff was launched in 2014, there is real intrigue about the future of format. There has been plenty of talk, but no signs yet it will lead to action.\\n\\nThe BCS crumbled under the weight of negative public opinion. Fans hated it and the commissioners were tired of defending it. The CFP is not there yet.\\n\\nThere's widespread satisfaction with the four-team college football playoff, CFP executive director Bill Hancock said. But clearly there are some individuals who are thinking about whether or not it's necessary to even begin any kind of discussion about the future. There may be some who want to talk now. There may be others who are not ready. We may ponder when to ponder.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Ralph D.

{"original": "Paul Brandus\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nI often think of some of the last words spoken by President John F. Kennedy. We would like to live as we once lived, he remarked at a breakfast hours before his assassination, but history will not permit it.\\n\\nNor will history permit us to live today as we once did. Events intrude, as they did for JFK that day. But this hasn't stopped politicians — on both sides — from trying to turn back the clock. For example, here we are with one-fifth of the 21st century behind us, and Democrats running for president (most of them anyway) talk of labor-intensive manufacturing and unions, while President Donald Trump praises coal and tries to bring back incandescent light bulb technology dating to 1879. Why not bring back the rotary phone and black-and-white TV while we're at it? Is that the best they can do?\\n\\nTheir nostalgia is understandable. Technology is moving faster than mainstream comprehension; it threatens vast disruption to what we know. This, combined with the very human desire for simple solutions and an avoidance of sacrifice, gives political fuel to those who maintain that answers to the future can be found in the past.\\n\\nEdison would be first to look forward\\n\\nBut life marches on whether we like it or not, and adaptability, not clinging to yesterday, is required.\\n\\nFor example, Democrats should talk more about how to respond to the principal destroyers of jobs today: robotics and artificial intelligence, which are beginning to chew up even once safe white-collar jobs (to be fair, at least one Democrat, Andrew Yang, is talking about this).\\n\\nAnd Trump should acknowledge that bankruptcies in the coal industry have accelerated on his watch while the cost of LED bulbs and renewable energy continues to fall. The future is clear, whether he can admit it or not.\\n\\nSurely, no one would be more contemptuous of these desires to turn back time than the very inventor of incandescent lighting himself: Thomas Edison. Never one to be nostalgic about the past, the relentless inventor was always, always looking ahead. There's a way to do it better, the wizard of Menlo Park said. Find it.\\n\\nAt the turn of the 21st century, 69% of Americans were satisfied with the way things are going in the United States. Today, it's half that. According to Gallup data, satisfaction began to rebound during the Obama era and has strengthened during the Trump years, but even so: We have fallen far during this century.\\n\\nWe must indeed do things better, as Edison said, and we must find a way to do them together. If you're trying to get somewhere, it's best to keep your eyes on the road ahead, not the rearview mirror. Accordingly, as we begin a new and perhaps perilous decade, I think we should acknowledge some problems that have become all too apparent and need addressing.\\n\\nOur personal liberties are being challenged and various studies — from Freedom House, the Cato Institute and the Heritage Foundation, to name three — note that numerous other countries are freer then we are. Freedom House says that in recent years (America's) democratic institutions have suffered erosion, while Heritage says that based on a dozen categories, the United States is 76.8% economically free — below 11 other countries.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nDebt, oil, space:Three things that will be important over the next decade\\n\\nOur politicians brag about how great things are and how we've never had it better. Yet life expectancy in the United States has fallen three years in a row.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nWe love to whine about the state of things, but only 61% of eligible voters bothered to cast a ballot in 2016.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nWe demand good roads and schools, clean water, health care and all the rest but complain that taxes are too high (fact check: not so).\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nHelp make things better in 2020\\n\\nWe have become meaner and less civil. We associate only with our own kind while shunning, belittling, even dehumanizing others who are different. In doing so, we demean our individual character, weaken our communities and tear at our national fabric.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nWe call ourselves patriots and claim to love the Constitution — though most of us likely can only describe its First or Second Amendments.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nWe consider ourselves knowledgeable and informed, yet surveys repeatedly show vast ignorance about things that matter. Only about one-third of Americans, for example, can name all three branches of government. Another study found that more Americans could identify Michael Jackson as the composer of 'Beat It' and 'Billie Jean' than could identify the Bill of Rights as a body of amendments to the U.S. Constitution.\\n\\nAnd everyone seems to have an opinion on Ukraine. Too bad hardly anyone can find it on a map.\\n\\nAn unfit president:From hush money to Trump impeachment, 2019 was a dizzying year of corruption and scandal\\n\\nPerhaps we should acknowledge that we're not as smart as we presume, and that this collective ignorance makes it harder to solve problems.\\n\\nWe can do better.\\n\\nThere's more, but you get the point. We're dealing with deep rooted, often intertwined problems. And while electing a president who conveys civility and good old-fashioned American decency can make a huge difference, we can also be part of the change ourselves. To begin, we can acknowledge our own shortcomings, stop blaming others for our problems and simply resolve to do better by others. As Edison said, we must find a way.\\n\\nWe're all in this together.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — The Broncos aren't well-represented in the Hall of Fame with just four enshrined players who made their mark in Denver. That could change with Terrell Davis, John Lynch and Steve Atwater among this year's modern-era finalists.\\n\\nThe knock on Davis is that his career was cut short by a knee injury, although there are six running backs in Canton that played fewer games. Atwater and Lynch, who won his title in Tampa but capped his career with an outstanding four-year run in Denver, have their own historic hurdles.\\n\\nThere are only seven pure safeties in the Hall of Fame, not counting Ronnie Lott, who began his career at cornerback, and none of them played after 1980.\\n\\nI look at that all the time and I just find that extremely odd, Atwater said. It's like we're not even a part of the team.\\n\\nHe hopes that's about to change.\\n\\nIf not this year, the next several years, I'm sure a pure safety will be going in, he said. If not me and John, it will be some other guys coming right up in a few years.\\n\\nWith Lynch getting his third shot and Atwater his first, momentum might finally be building for a safety to get inducted.\\n\\nLynch said he's stumped as to why more safeties that have played in the last 35 years haven't gotten their due.\\n\\nFormer Colts and Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy, who's a third-time Hall of Fame finalist himself, helped change the position when Lynch arrived from Stanford in 1993.\\n\\nI'll never forget getting to Tampa and Tony Dungy said, 'Hey we're going to do some neat things and really change the way that this position has been played. We're going to blitz you. We're going to play you down in the box. We're also going to play you back. We're going to cover you.' That's why I think it's such an impactful position, Lynch said.\\n\\nAll you have to do is turn on the playoffs. Anytime over the last 10, 15, 20 years you tend to see a safety taking over the playoffs because you can at that position because you're featured in so many different ways.\\n\\nAlong with the Colts — Dungy, Marvin Harrison and Edgerrin James — the Broncos are the best-represented among this year's 15 modern finalists. The Broncos already enshrined are John Elway, Shannon Sharpe, Gary Zimmerman and Floyd Little.\\n\\nLynch is also stumping for Davis, whom he said was the best going for a stretch of several seasons in the late 1990s.\\n\\nI know there's the argument about longevity, but I think there are other guys in the Hall of Fame (that played) around the same time and he's been more productive, Lynch said.\\n\\nDavis played from 1995-2001 and joined Jim Brown as the only running backs in NFL history to average more than 100 yards a game, counting regular season and playoffs.\\n\\nCoach Gary Kubiak said Friday a lot of great running backs had short careers.\\n\\nThat's a tough position to play 10 to 12 years, Kubiak said. I know one thing, how long was his career? Seven or eight years, am I right? Man, was it special. He was a difference-maker to our organization and our football team getting over the top.\\n\\nDavis is the only running back in league history to own back-to-back Super Bowl titles, an MVP trophy, a Super Bowl MVP honor, a 2,000-yard season and seven consecutive playoff wins in which he topped 100 yards rushing.\\n\\nIf you looked at what I was asked to do and if you take whatever the time I played, there was nothing that I didn't accomplish, Davis said. ... When the moments were big, I didn't shrink in the big moments. I played some of my best football in the postseason and in big moments.\\n\\nNotes: Backup QB Brock Osweiler (sprained right knee) sat out practice again Friday but is expected back next week.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nALAMEDA, Calif. (AP) — Jon Gruden has never had a promising, young quarterback like Derek Carr to develop in 11 seasons as an NFL head coach.\\n\\nCarr hasn't had the opportunity to play for a coach like Gruden, an offensive mastermind known for his maniacal work ethic and attention to detail.\\n\\nThe way those two fare together will determine whether Gruden's return for a second stint as coach of the Oakland Raiders will end up as the resounding success owner Mark Davis hoped for while pining for a reunion the past six years.\\n\\nI had a chance to visit with Derek Carr this morning and I said, 'Derek, this is an unbelievable opportunity and if you'll just take advantage of the opportunity, there's so many great things in store for you, not only professionally but personally,' said Rich Gannon, whose career took off after joining Gruden in Oakland in 1999.\\n\\nJon's excited to work with Derek and Derek's already a good player but he's got a chance to be a Hall of Famer and win multiple Super Bowls if he'll just do the work.\\n\\nCarr will be tested and challenged like he hasn't in his first four seasons. Gruden is famous for arriving at work each day at 3:17 a.m., putting in long hours each week.\\n\\nHe will also ride Carr hard if necessary in order to bring out the best in his game.\\n\\nI don't care how hard Derek worked before, he's going to have to change his work habits a little bit to fit in, Gannon said.\\n\\nGannon became a star when he joined up with Gruden after 12 seasons as a journeyman in Minnesota, Washington and Kansas City. He became a first-team All-Pro in his second season with Gruden and won the league MVP the year after Gruden was traded to Tampa Bay.\\n\\nCarr showed he was capable of being a top quarterback when he garnered MVP support in a breakthrough 2016 season. But he took a major step back this past year after signing a $125 million, five-year extension.\\n\\nHe matched his career high with 13 interceptions and recorded his worst totals in yards, touchdown and passer rating since his rookie year in 2014.\\n\\nI think there is a huge ceiling in Derek Carr, Gruden said. I think he has proven that. Up to us as a coaching staff to improve around him, get more consistent, and come up with an offense that really allows him to soar into another level.\\n\\nFixing Carr is just one of Gruden's tasks. Getting receiver Amari Cooper back on track is nearly as important. After beginning his career with back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons, Cooper took a major step back in 2017. He was plagued by the drops that hurt him as a rookie and only topped the 100-yard mark twice all season while finishing with career lows with 48 catches for 680 yards.\\n\\nIt was a puzzling drop-off for a receiver who entered the year considered one of the top in the game. Hall of Famer Tim Brown said he believes Cooper could be in for a 120-catch season if he listens to Gruden's advice.\\n\\nEven for a guy like me, who was having a pretty good career, he was able to take me to another level, showing me how much better I could be, Brown said. I thought I was doing pretty good. Sometimes you just have to turn your brain off and buy in. If you can do that great things can happen.\\n\\nEven some of the greatest players in the game's history credit Gruden for some of their success. Hall of Famer Jerry Rice arrived in Oakland in 2001 as the most accomplished receiver in NFL history but appeared to be on the decline after failing to reach 1,000 yards in each of his final two seasons in San Francisco.\\n\\nBut he had a rebirth in Oakland under Gruden, catching 83 passes for 1,139 yards at age 39. He followed that up with 92 catches for 1,211 yards the following season and compared Gruden to his former coach in San Francisco, Bill Walsh.\\n\\nCould be your best friend or your worst enemy, that's going to keep you on your toes, he said. Maybe that was something that the players, they were lacking this year. Sometimes you fall into listening to the talk but you need a coach that's going to keep you focused. With Jon Gruden, he's that type of coach.\\n\\nWhile Gruden's biggest impact is on offense, his leadership and intensity translate to the entire team. Hall of Famer Howie Long has seen just about everything. He played for 13 years, announced for more than two decades and has two sons in the NFL.\\n\\nSo Long knows what players want in a coach.\\n\\nThey want to be great and they want to be led, he said. They want to believe in the guy in front of the room. I call it the Saran Wrap factor. Players see right through that in the front of the room if you're not authentic, you're not genuine, you're not that way every day. ... Jon has that.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NFL: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Gary Levin\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nSo what exactly is the Santa Clarita Diet?\\n\\nNetflix has been coy about its newest comedy, due Feb. 3, that stars Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant (Justified) as Sheila and Joel Hammond, married Realtors in the mountainous and placid Los Angeles suburb.\\n\\nReview: Netflix's 'Santa Clarita' is a diet that's definitely worth keeping\\n\\nBut we can reveal that the dramatic change Sheila undergoes in the series opener is, in fact, death. And while they tend to their open houses and teenage daughter, the couple must sate Sheila's unbridled id and undead hunger, first with raw meat and, eventually, the human kind.\\n\\nChirps Barrymore: If you ate nothing but protein every day, you'd really thin out!\\n\\n(Fake diet ads are part of Netflix's marketing campaign, to be unveiled during Sunday's Golden Globe Awards.)\\n\\nThe show was created by Victor Fresco, whose quirky humor in shows such as ABC's Better Off Ted and Fox's Andy Richter Controls the Universe didn't find a big-enough broadcast audience. But last year, Fresco's timing was impeccable, even though at first Barrymore thought otherwise.\\n\\nShe hasn't worked much since her daughters, Olive, 4, and Frankie, 2, were born, and was going through a tough divorce, her third: My whole personal life was falling apart, she says.\\n\\nBut the actress was intrigued by the darker turn and some strange parallels with Sheila, and asked Fresco whether her character's death could mark a dual transformation. What if she finds herself, and we do this sort of Cro-Magnon type of evolution with her over the course of the 10 episodes. No gimmicks, no prosthetics, just an awakening, Barrymore says. I just really enjoyed just shedding a snakeskin with her, so it became a really fun obstacle that I wasn't even planning for but seemed so conducive and fun and healthy for my own life.\\n\\nExactly how she became undead is uncertain. When we meet her in the series opener, she's just not feeling well. Presumably, she has been exposed to something — although we don't know what — which is making her feel a bit off, Fresco says.\\n\\nIn spite of their newfound challenge, which involves guest stars such as Nathan Fillion, who plays a rival agent, Sheila and pot-smoking Joel are happily married and supportive in their tract house. (The show was filmed almost entirely in Santa Clarita.)\\n\\nSure, there are obstacles involving their teenage daughter. Abby (Liv Hewson), neighboring cops and their wives, but there's a real optimism to the show, Barrymore says. I don't want to watch a show about a couple fighting and falling apart, I can't handle it right now. It's not heavy, but it's not lacking in a sort of sweetness, if you will. But it's also got bite and backbone and balls.\\n\\nAnd limbs and entrails, too. I think it's a very perfect recipe for 2017, and I had no idea in early 2016 when I was trying to figure out if this was even possible that it would be so right for my life, she says.\\n\\nI like things that are easy to digest. Pun intended."}
{"original": "The Golden State Warriors star never shies away from giving honest opinions. For better or for worse, officials, coaches and teammates have learned that about Draymond Green during his NBA career. So leave it to Green to offer the most accurate assessment of himself.\\n\\nMy conditioning just kind of sucks from being off the court for a better part of a month, Green said following Warriors practice Saturday. That is kind of frustrating because I was coming into camp probably the best shape I came in since my fourth year of the league.\\n\\nGreen missed the first four games of the season because of a foot injury and almost all of training camp due to NBA health a safety protocols. He failed to score in his season debut Friday in the Warriors' loss to the Portland Trail Blazers. On a minutes restriction (he played just 18 minutes), Green's playmaking was also limited (just four assists).\\n\\nHe also did not agree with the contention he has already bolstered the Warriors' defense with his positional versatility and by providing helpful tips to his younger teammates.\\n\\nI sucked last night in guiding people on the floor, Green said. I didn't talk much, which is who I am. I got to be better in that space.\\n\\nYet, Green hardly spoke as if he was conceding defeat after the Warriors' 2-3 start or with his own poor play in his debut. Since when has Green backed down from a challenge? Instead, Green held the same conviction about his skills that led to three NBA championships, a Defensive Player of the Year honor and three All-Star appearances.\\n\\nWhat I'm expecting this year is to have a great year, the 30-year-old Green said about his ninth NBA season. I really want to come out and showcase the work I was able to put in through the course of this offseason and play at the level I know I'm capable of playing.\\n\\nThe Warriors expect Green to become the playmaker he has been in the past, which involves running the offense like a point guard. They see Green becoming the defender he has been who can cover all five positions by mastering individual assignments and covering up for teammates' mistakes. And they envision Green helping Stephen Curry get more open looks because of his passing, and that he can bolster his younger teammates with his demanding and constructive feedback.\\n\\nAmong the many questions the Warriors have to wrestle with: how long will this process take?\\n\\nIt's going to happen, Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. We don't know how long it's going to take. We're dealing with unique circumstances given the offseason.\\n\\nThe Warriors are coming off a season where they finished with a league-worst 15-50 record. Due in part to key offseason departures – Kevin Durant most notably – as well as the long-term injuries to Curry and Klay Thompson, Green posted the worst shooting percentage of his career since his rookie season (38.9%), scoring just 8 points per game, and oversaw a Warriors defense that ranked 26th in defensive rating with 113 points allowed per 100 possessions.\\n\\nGreen played in 43 games in 2019-20 because of various injuries and last played an NBA game on March 10, shortly before the NBA suspended the season because of the coronavirus outbreak. The Warriors were one of the eight teams not participating in the NBA's restart.\\n\\nAfter getting some rest following five consecutive Finals appearances, Green reported having strenuous offseason workouts that left the Warriors impressed with his weight and conditioning.\\n\\nGreen did not confirm testing positive for COVID-19, (who said I came down with COVID?) but his absence to open training camp coincided with the Warriors revealing two unnamed players tested positive for the virus. Green then missed the first four regular-season games because of a right foot strain.\\n\\nThough Green expressed both frustration and understanding with the team-imposed minutes restriction, Kerr said he plans to increase Green's workload only gradually after consulting with Green and the Warriors' training staff.\\n\\nRIP:Paul Westphal dies at 70; NBA Hall of Famer led Phoenix Suns as player and coach\\n\\nHistoric moment:Becky Hammon stepping in as Spurs coach captured with perfect photo\\n\\nThe perspective I've gotten for it is really appreciating the game of basketball and whatever amount of time I have left in doing it, Green said. One thing is for certain – we all have an expiration date when it comes to this game. So really having that appreciation for being able to compete at this level.\\n\\nThe identity of Green's Warriors team continues to change.\\n\\nThe Warriors ruled out Thompson for the season for the second consecutive year after he injured his right Achilles tendon in an offseason pickup game. Although the Warriors have been impressed with rookie James Wiseman for his defense and outside shooting, they recognize the No. 2 overall pick will still face learning curves. Although Stephen Curry remains one of the best shooters, he has less space to operate than when he had more All-Star teammates. Andrew Wiggins (37.5% and Kelly Oubre (27.4%) have been undependable on offense and the Warriors once again rank 26th in defensive rating (114.66).\\n\\nEvery team is a work in progress, Green said. If you are a team that don't think you're a work in progress, you'll be looking back in July trying to figure out where'd you miss the work.\\n\\nHow the Warriors progress will significantly hinge on how quickly Green becomes his old self.\\n\\nGreen and Curry have developed an important tandem that Kerr has described as fire and ice because of their complementary personalities and skills. Durant and Curry were always the Warriors' most talented scorers. Curry and Thompson were always the most talented outside shooters. But Green and Curry were always the most important pair because they shared playmaking responsibilities while Curry provided unmatched shooting and Green provided expert defense.\\n\\nThe fact that they work so well together some ways reflect they each bring something so different to the team, Kerr said. Where they're alike is their ability to compete at a high level and to adapt and adjust. They're both very smart players.\\n\\nGreen can also become the cure for the Warriors' defensive shortcomings and inconsistent intensity. The Warriors already have lauded Green for giving Wiseman pointers and leading a players' only film session that entailed a detailed breakdown on how to set proper screens. Kerr observed that Green set the tone in a recent scrimmage with his energy, his emotion and his trash talking. It seems inevitable that Green will hold any teammate accountable for lacking effort and will help any teammate that simply needs to learn.\\n\\nThough Curry predicted that you'll feel that presence and difference right away with Green's return, even Green sounds aware that the Warriors' fortunes do not rest squarely on him.\\n\\nSo what if Green has reunited with Curry? Their teammates have not consistently hit shots or provided the proper amount of floor spacing.\\n\\nKerr has admitted he needs to make adjustments with his rotations and schemes. And players have admitted they need to improve their effort and not overreact to missed shots or an opponents' hot hand.\\n\\nAs much as we have to find that connection again, everyone else has to figure out their spacing and where they should be when we're doing whatever it is, Green said about reuniting with Curry. Those are all things that will come with time. But in the meantime, we just got to keep improving.\\n\\nWill Green bolster the Warriors' defense? He might know how to defend all five positions, but he cannot fulfill that job description all at once. He might know how to hold teammates accountable for their shortcomings, but he cannot make up for any shortcomings in talent or schemes.\\n\\nI have to bring more intensity. I think that'll come as everything else starts to fall in place, Green said. But we all have to do that as well.\\n\\nIt might not be fair for the Warriors' success or failure to hinge on how quickly Green can knock off rust, restore his game and galvanize his teammates. But based off of Green's track record, it seems likely he can overcome those issues much quicker than his younger teammates can overcome the learning curve.\\n\\nThat partly explains why Kerr has resisted making too many drastic changes this early in the season. He remains fully aware a healthy and engaged Green has always significantly changed the Warriors' identity.\\n\\nDraymond just looks like he's getting his wind. He looked like a guy who missed training camp and has been working his way to get onto the floor, Kerr said. It looked like an exhibition style game for him. It's not a criticism. It's just where he is physically. He got a really tough break coming into the season with the COVID protocols. It's going to take him some time.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY NBA writer Mark Medina on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram."}
{"original": "Financial markets were jolted Wednesday by a report that China — the biggest foreign holder of U.S. government bonds — could curtail its purchases, a shift that has spooked investors already leery of a rise in interest rates at the start of 2018.\\n\\nBloomberg News, citing unnamed people close to the matter, said Chinese officials are considering slowing — or even stopping — its purchases of U.S. government debt. The report suggests that China feels U.S. debt is becoming less attractive when compared to other types of investments. Trade tensions between the world's two largest economies was also cited as a possible reason why China is thinking about reducing its U.S. holdings, according to Bloomberg.\\n\\nIf the reports turn out to be true and China no longer sees Treasuries as an attractive option, the repercussions could be significant, says Craig Erlam, senior market strategist at OANDA, a currency trading firm with offices in New York. A significant change in policy could put considerable upside pressure on U.S. yields.\\n\\nLow interest rates, of course, have been a big driver of the stock market rally the past nine years and has also provided a lift to the economy, as middle-class Americans have benefited from lower borrowing costs.\\n\\nAt the end of October 2017, China held $1.19 trillion of U.S. Treasuries, the most of any foreign country, according to the latest data from the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve Board. Japan was second with U.S. bond holdings worth $1.09 trillion.\\n\\nThe fear is that, at a time when the Federal Reserve has started reducing its holdings of U.S. debt (coupled with news that Japan is reducing its Treasury purchases and China might follow suit), there will be less demand for U.S. debt. And that fewer buyers will result in higher interest rates and borrowing costs in the U.S.\\n\\nMore:Why January matters to stock investors with 401(k) accounts\\n\\nMore:Retirement crisis: 37% of Gen X say they won't be able to afford to retire\\n\\nMore:Why January matters to stock investors with 401(k) accounts\\n\\nBond investors would also get hurt because falling bond prices is the cause of higher yields.\\n\\nBut Erlam says it is too early to speculate on the likelihood that China will suddenly reduce its holdings. What's more, he adds, it is likely that China would tread carefully if it does opt to sell U.S. Treasuries so as not to destabilize the markets.\\n\\nThe financial market reaction to the Bloomberg report was swift. The price of the 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell, with the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, climbing as high as 2.598%, its highest level since March 14, 2017. It finished unchanged at 2.55%.\\n\\nStocks also dipped, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing down 17 points, recovering nearly all of its losses after an earlier drop of nearly 129 points.\\n\\nInterest rates had already been rising to start 2018, as investors begin to price in prospects for faster U.S. growth, more interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve and rising inflation pressures, in part due to rising wages as the job market tightens further.\\n\\nYou already had this backdrop of rising rates and people are getting nervous, says Boris Rjavinski, senior interest rate strategist at Wells Fargo Securities in New York. And when you get another story like China, a major holder of U.S. Treasuries possibly stepping back from the market, it adds to the overall bearish trend in the Treasury market.\\n\\nJim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthhold Group, a money-management firm in Minneapolis, says China is more likely eyeing sales of U.S. bonds for the same reason investors in the U.S. and elsewhere are: Fear that inflation is on the rise and will erode the value of fixed-income investments.\\n\\nThis happens every time rates go up, Paulsen explains. Everyone (that owns U.S. Treasuries) is worried that they will get killed if (prices fall and rates rise), so they lighten up on their exposure to these bonds,\\n\\nStill, Rjavinski stresses that it is premature to think that yields are on the verge of a sharp spike higher and that the multi-decade bull market in bonds is over and a bear market has begun.\\n\\nThe key question is whether it is in China's best interest to sell U.S. Treasuries as an opening salvo in what could become a trade war, analysts say.\\n\\nWould the Chinese risk losing their investments in the U.S. market to make a political statement, particularly when their holdings are most likely targeted for broader investments in the U.S.? says Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial."}

Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) tweeted Monday that if North Korean athletes were to go to the Olympics, he fully believe(s) the United States would boycott. Nearly a month ago, U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley said U.S. attendance at the Olympics was an open question. A day later, however, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that the United States looked forward to going to the Games.\\n\\nFor sports leaders in charge of athletes who are in their last stages of preparation for the Games, it's a confusing time.\\n\\nI think they need to be careful saying things like that because these athletes have worked so hard to get there, U.S. Figure Skating president Sam Auxier said at a news conference at the national championships, where the U.S. Olympic figure skating team is going to be selected this week.\\n\\nThe Olympics should be above politics. … It was a disaster in 1980 for many of the athletes that couldn't go (to Moscow due to a U.S.-led boycott.) And I'd hate to see that just because Trump and Kim Jong-un are trying to see which button's bigger.\\n\\nAuxier and USFS executive director David Raith both said they are following the U.S. Olympic Committee's lead on the issue of any potential boycott.\\n\\nIt's really the USOC's call and (USOC CEO) Scott Blackmun has come out and said we're going to compete unless it's physically or legally impossible through some type of war action, Auxier said. That would change things dramatically. But I don't think our athletes would boycott. They've been working all their lives for this. Who knows what Trump will tweet out, but if he were to say to boycott it, unless there was a very clear reason why to do it, I don't think our athletes would boycott it.

I knew I was going to win something, but it was pretty amazing to find out I finished first.\\n\\nThe barista who dabbles in sports betting ran the table on the final day of the NFL season, winning all five of his games to beat out 1,853 entries in the Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest. First place paid $895,481, and Graham won some more money in a mini-contest to push his earnings over the $900,000 mark.\\n\\nNot bad for a 32-year-old who saved up $3,000 to put on two entries against some of the top sports bettors in the world.\\n\\nI did the best I could do and the games were going to go the way they were going to go, Graham said.\\n\\nThe wise guy bettors might have cringed at the way Graham won, picking opposite sides on both of his cards in hopes one would finish high in the money. He had actually picked the teams he thought would win on the other card, only to go undefeated by picking against them on the card that won.\\n\\nHe was just looking to land in the money and thought that was the best strategy, said Jay Kornegay, sports book director at the Westgate Las Vegas. I think he was almost in shock he won the whole thing.\\n\\nGraham's 5-0 mark on the last Sunday of the regular season vaulted him into the top spot with an overall record of 54-28-3 picking five games a week against the point spread. He went 13-2 over the final three weeks of the season to beat out Mark Jorstad, a farmer from Morris, Illinois, who finished second. Jorstad, who raises corn and soybeans on a 3,000-acre farm, said he made many of his early picks after listening to sports radio while harvesting his crops.\\n\\nI will not be the guy who complains about winning second prize in this one, said Jorstad, who won $360,000. I didn't lose. The guy who won beat me.\\n\\nThe Westgate Las Vegas SuperContest began in the late 1980s as a way for the best professional bettors to compete against each other. It has evolved in recent years into a broader contest that attracts nonpros like Graham and Jorstad.\\n\\nI'm just a farmer, there's no professional in me, Jorstad said. This is like somebody walked across the street and got hit by lightning.\\n\\nGraham was off Monday from his job at Starbucks, where his fellow workers were unaware of his win. He came to Las Vegas a decade ago to try playing poker professionally, only to find out there were too many sharks eager to take his money.\\n\\nSo he tries his hand at sports betting, living frugally so he could put the maximum two entries into the contest. He said that won't change as he figures out what to do with his winnings.\\n\\nI try to keep it low key and be sensible about things, Graham said. I'll keep working and not do anything crazy."}

Andrew Cuomo on Dec. 11, attests to that number, indicating that gyms accounted for 0.06% of COVID-19 exposure from September to November where contact tracers were able to determine the exposure's source. That is compared to the 73.54% which were linked to household social gatherings.\\n\\nWe've been readjusting our clubs for months now with plenty of new safety measures in place to keep everyone feeling comfortable and on track, Kenyon said.

With the strength classes you will learn how to progressively add load as your strength builds, so basically you start where you are and progressively get stronger and improve balance and mobility.\\n\\nAll Sport Health and Fitness in Fishkill wants new members to feel comfortable and safe when they enter so the new procedures they implemented because of COVID-19 will remain relatively the same in 2021.\\n\\nWhen a new member comes in, they all come in for a different reason, Sean Kammerer, general manager of All Sport, said. Some want to lose weight, maintain mental balance, or work with a personal trainer. We're welcoming new members to stay active, stay physical, and stay positive.\\n\\nThe gym's director of operations, Megan Wiley, added hitting the gym is not just about getting into shape.\\n\\nPeople are willing to be socially distant and socialize while at the gym, Wiley said. We have some ladies who this is their second home. As important as it is to run on a treadmill, it's important for people to have that social aspect as well."}
{"original": "It's standard during the regular season for reporters to get weekly access to only a few coaches and players, typically the head coach and the team's best players.\\n\\nThat made media days at the Orange Bowl and Cotton Bowl an opportunity to pepper the entire roster and coaching staff from each of the four College Football Playoff teams — Alabama, Clemson, Notre Dame and Oklahoma — with a series of questions related about the status of the sport.\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports asked student-athletes from these four teams questions related to rule changes, recruiting, drug testing, playing on the road and whether the best postseason format is the current status quo or an expansion to eight teams.\\n\\nHere are their responses:\\n\\nWhat's one rule you would change in college football?\\n\\nIt's football but also making sure player safety is important. I do think they could do a little bit better with the targeting calls. They could be a little more loose with those calls, but other than that everything is fine. - Alabama defensive lineman Isaiah Buggs\\n\\nI would say transfers. Because some people transfer to create better opportunities for themselves. To have to sit out another year, I think that's a little unfair. - Oklahoma offensive lineman Bobby Evans\\n\\nI mean, we definitely want to get paid. - Alabama linebacker Anfernee Jennings\\n\\nDress we have to wear, the uniform stuff. Everything they say we can't do I feel like we should be able to do. From the shirt being out to the knees being out, I don't get the reasoning behind it at all. Whatever, man. - Notre Dame linebacker Jonathan Jones\\n\\nTargeting stuff has been controversial but I think the concept behind it is good. The game needs some of it but some instances it's been a little hazy. We've had some this year called where I was like I don't know if that's targeting; some that weren't called. I think it's a good rule, the game needs it – maybe it just needs time, only been in place for a few years. Needs time to develop. - Clemson tight end Garrett Williams\\n\\nHow many teams should be in the College Football Playoff?\\n\\nEveryone makes it, 129. FCS starts in the spring and once they win, they get in. Winner of FCS and FBS play each other. Oooh, other rule change: We could do what the Premier League does in soccer where we relegate teams. North Dakota State's up with us now and we send someone else down. - anonymous\\n\\nI see pros with the eight-team playoff. I think it honestly gives you a better chance to see what team is truly the best. But at the same time, that's a lot of games. It takes a toll on the players. ... But if you're looking to find the best, really, the eight-team playoff is the way to go. - Oklahoma tight end Grant Calcaterra\\n\\nAs a fan I'd like to see it expand but as a player, we're already playing up to 15 games and I think it'd really deteriorate from the actual playoff if it expands because a lot of people don't play in these bowl games since they're trying to get drafted, don't want to get hurt. ... I think four's fine. - Clemson defensive back Tanner Muse\\n\\nI like the eight-team. I think four just makes more people talk, and eight might just shut everybody up. - Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith.\\n\\nWhat's the strangest thing you were told during your recruitment?\\n\\nOh lord, I'll keep it PG. The strangest thing? ... I guess with all the baseball thing I had, I've had a lot of stuff said to me about what I could do. A couple people said I could pitch, a couple said I could come out and hit every once in a while for football and baseball. That I could pitch if I wanted to – I'm like I don't know, are you trying to sell me some crap? - anonymous\\n\\nEveryone always brought up, 'The girls here love football players.' And not that it was weird ... I mean, it definitely excited me, but I'm kind of like, I'm 17, I'm sitting with my mom. She doesn't necessarily want to hear that. - Alabama tight end Hale Hentges\\n\\nI was told by one school that when I came on my official visit, I would have a host who was a football player but most of the time I'd be accompanied by a female athlete, also. For the whole weekend. A female. He said he'd put us in contact with a beautiful female athlete to accompany us for the whole weekend. - Oklahoma defensive lineman Ronnie Perkins\\n\\nA lot of coaches tell recruits things like, 'You come here, you'll start from day one.' If a coach is telling you you're going to start from day one, it's not true. Because what if you go out there and you're just a bum? No coach is going to put you out there if you're just a bum. A coach said you're going to start from day one is not telling the truth. - Smith\\n\\nHow many times have you been drug tested this season?\\n\\nAmong the more than 15 players asked, responses mostly ranged from 0 to 4 with an even disbursement.\\n\\nOther than you home field, what's your favorite stadium to play in?\\n\\nI would say the Cotton Bowl. - Calcaterra\\n\\nDefinitely Kyle Field, at Texas A&M. That's so fun to play there. My fiancee, all of her family went to Texas A&M, so this past year it got a bit more significant for me. But I love playing there. It's so loud. - Hentges\\n\\nThe most fun I've had in was Boston College this year – I made a tackle on their side, tackle for loss, and then I had a beer thrown at me. I didn't know you could sell beer in a college stadium until it was thrown at me there. - Muse\\n\\nI've been here for three years so my favorite was Texas. That was a great game - Notre Dame safety Devon Studstill\\n\\nShould Kyler Murray play football or baseball?\\n\\nI feel like he should go like that man Bo Jackson and do both. Go crazy. He pretty cold at both. If he were to do just one, I'd say baseball – not knocking him because he's a bad quarterback. He's going to be great whatever he does but if I personally was in that situation, I'd go baseball. - Jones\\n\\nFrom what I've heard, he's a really good baseball player. Obviously he's a really good football player. Being drafted in the first round of baseball speaks for itself. I don't know what to tell him. I'd say baseball if he got drafted that early - Clemson punter Will Spires\\n\\nBaseball: More money, longer time, more endorsements, more face time, more guaranteed money. I don't love baseball but if he loves it, that's the practical choice. - Studstill\\n\\nWhat advice did you get on the NFL?\\n\\nTake it serious. Be all in with it and take it serious. - Clemson defensive back Trayvon Mullen\\n\\nStay true to yourself, make your circle smaller and going out, knowing out what you want. Never lose love for the game, always try to do your best. - Notre Dame running back Dexter Williams"}

Nice to know that the format change we made last year — that the semifinals will be either on a Saturday or national holiday — will allow more people to watch the games.\\n\\nAfter ratings and viewership plunged by 34% from the first playoff to the second, conference commissioners who manage the postseason system decided to move future dates for semifinals off New Year's Eve when it falls on a weekday.\\n\\nThis year's games were also played an hour earlier, so the later game didn't bump up against the stroke of midnight on the East Coast.\\n\\nThe original plan for the College Football Playoff was to play the semifinals on New Year's Eve eight times during a 12-year contract with ESPN that pays $470 million annually. The revised schedule moved games off that date to they could be played on Saturdays in 2018, 2019, 2024 and 2025.\\n\\nAnother scheduling move paid off for ESPN and the CFP this season. The Orange Bowl was originally set to be played in the early afternoon of Dec. 31, but was instead pushed back to Friday night.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nSEATTLE (AP) — Only a few weeks ago, the Seattle Seahawks and Detroit Lions were fighting for the No. 2 seed in the NFC playoffs and a coveted bye that makes getting to the Super Bowl so much easier.\\n\\nStumbles by both teams over the final few weeks have led to the Seahawks hosting the Lions in the NFC wild-card game on Saturday night and a test of whether momentum even matters going into the playoffs.\\n\\nThere's obviously been a bunch of different teams that have done different stuff going in and then turn on a real good show and get going in the playoffs, Seattle coach Pete Carroll said. We'll see what happens.\\n\\nBoth teams will look back on the final few weeks with a certain level of regret.\\n\\nDetroit (9-7) faced a gauntlet schedule, closing with three playoff teams — Giants, Cowboys, Packers — and lost all three to give away the NFC North title and its shot of hosting a playoff game.\\n\\nSeattle may view its stumble as more costly. The Seahawks (10-5-1) lost control of the No. 2 seed when they lost at home to Arizona in Week 16 and with it the chance to be resting.\\n\\nHistory kind of shows you that it's a true restart, Detroit QB Matthew Stafford said. We're looking at data and who's won it and how, and all that kind of stuff. I'm sure there's been teams that have gotten hot and gone and won it, but there are teams that have not had the finish that they wanted and still gone on to be really successful.\\n\\nThere is a lot in favor for the Seahawks playing at home against a Detroit franchise that last won a playoff road game in 1957.\\n\\nSeattle is 5-0 in the playoffs at home since 2010 and has won at least one game in each postseason appearance under Carroll. Since 2012, the Seahawks are 7-3 overall in the playoffs.\\n\\nAll that experience and success doesn't take into account the statistical differences. The Seahawks finished the regular season better than Detroit in every major statistical category offensively and defensively.\\n\\nBut the Lions have shown resiliency all season, recovering from a 1-3 start and winning an NFL-record eight times when trailing in the fourth quarter or overtime.\\n\\nTheir belief — like the way they believe — you can just see the energy change when they make a big play, Seattle linebacker Bobby Wagner said. Whether it's on defense, special teams, offense. Something typically happens where they feed off that energy.\\n\\nHere's what else to watch in the first playoff meeting between the teams:\\n\\nRUN SOMEWHERE: Both the Lions and Seahawks have a run game neither is proud of going into the postseason.\\n\\nSeattle finished the regular season 25th in the NFL at 99.4 yards per game. Detroit was worse at 81.9 yards per game, good for 30th in the league. The Lions are relying on Zach Zenner as their primary ball carrier with both Ameer Abdullah and Theo Riddick on injured reserve.\\n\\nSeattle has shown flashes of being the run-first team of previous seasons, but failed to top 100 yards as a team in the final three games of the regular season.\\n\\nUNIKND QUARTER: Detroit's best quarter has been the second, outscoring teams by 18 points, helping it lead Dallas and Green Bay at halftime before losing both games. Detroit is down two points overall in the first and fourth quarters. In the third, the Lions have been outscored 85-53.\\n\\nThe third quarters have not been kind to us, Lions offensive coordinator Jim Bob Cooter said. We haven't had the ball a lot, we haven't made much out of that, we haven't created first downs to keep the ball, something we're working at.\\n\\nFAMILIAR FACES: Outside of Stafford, there aren't too many recognizable faces with the Lions for Seattle's Cliff Avril to catch up with. Conversely, there are plenty of players still on the Seahawks roster from when Golden Tate was Seattle's top wide receiver.\\n\\nAvril is hoping to exchange pleasantries with Stafford in the form of sacks and quarterback hits. Avril is coming off the best season of his career with 11½ sacks and the key to Seattle's pass rush that tied for third in the league with 42 sacks.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Tate caught 90 or more passes for the third straight season since leaving Seattle and joining the Lions. A big game from Tate — especially on short passes — could be significant in making up for Detroit's lagging run game.\\n\\nDETROIT VS EVERYBODY: The Motor City often feels slighted, or overlooked, and the Lions have added to the story line because some officiating calls have not gone their way in recent seasons, including last year in Seattle .\\n\\nDetroit was once powerful, winning three NFL championships in four title game appearances between 1952 and 1957, but the Lions have won only one playoff game in six decades. Wives and girlfriends of Lions players wore black sweatshirts with Detroit vs. Everybody, printed on them for the regular season finale against Green Bay.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

{"original": "Robert Bianco\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nYou can hardly blame cable networks if they seem a little crazed these days.\\n\\nEverywhere they turn, they face new competitors. On one hand, those that have been producing high-quality scripted programming for years, like FX, face an ever-growing array of smaller cable channels chipping away at their business. On the other, they face a burgeoning world of streaming services, one more profligate than the next.\\n\\nIs it any wonder that even FX, an outlet with as fine an array of scripted offerings as any you'll find, seems desperate to get our attention? In The Americans and Atlanta, it has TV's two best series, and yet neither can match the ratings of Game of Thrones or the pop-culture buzz of Stranger Things.\\n\\nAnd so FX brings us Taboo (Tuesday, 10 ET/PT, ** out of four), a decidedly odd and generally unpleasant big swing that marks the network's attempt to enter the dark fantasy epic territory occupied by Thrones — with a little Thrones incest thrown in for good measure. What it lacks, unfortunately, is Thrones' sweep, moments of playfulness and narrative drive — or any drive at all.\\n\\nCreated by Steven Knight with Chips Hardy and star Tom Hardy (who worked with Knight on Peaky Blinders), Taboo is set in London in 1814 — a fetid mess so dank, you can practically smell it. Clearly, this is not Jane Austen's Georgian England, as evidenced by a showy, self-conscious use of profanity that ranges from offensive to distracting.\\n\\nHardy is James Keziah Delaney, a man of few words and facial expressions, all of them intense. Long thought dead, James returns for his father's funeral to find dad has left him everything — including the rights to a plot of land outside Vancouver that is much desired by the East India Company and its evil president, Sir Stuart Strange (a typecast Jonathan Pryce).\\n\\nStrange assumes Delaney will be an easy mark. Little does he know that time away has sharpened Delaney's instincts and given him strange powers to commune with the dead. Unless, of course, he's just insane — a possibility that for now is left on the table.\\n\\nThere's no doubt Hardy knows how to hold the camera (which is a good thing, because it's usually focused on him in tight closeup). But in its early going, Knight gives him little to do but scowl and threaten — so little, that those few moments of over-the-top violence are almost welcome as a change of pace.\\n\\nIndeed, to say Taboo starts slowly would be unfair to slow things: It barely starts at all. It's mostly all portent — scene after scene of somber looks, eerie music and cloudy skies, occasionally interrupted by a profane outburst or a lustful look. Perhaps more and better is coming, but in this era of abundance, it's hard to imagine anyone but the most devoted fans of Hardy, Knight or FX having the patience to wait for it.\\n\\nAnd expecting them to do so just seems crazy."}
{"original": "Brian C. Beckley\\n\\nReviewed.com\\n\\nHave you ever been at a concert with sound mixing so awful you walked over to the soundboard operator and asked him what the hell he's doing? If so, you're probably an audiophile—the most obnoxious type of music nerd. You're also probably into fine-tuning and perfecting every bit of audio you consume.\\n\\nMusic is one thing, but our auditory lives are not solely defined by music. Everything from crowd banter to the screech of an approaching subway car takes a toll on our ears. Augmented reality is already being used to visually manipulate our environments, so why aren't we talking about augmenting our acoustic reality?\\n\\nHere Active Listening Earbuds Change the Way You Hear\\n\\nThat's exactly what Doppler Labs is doing with its active listening system. Dubbed Here, these in-ear headphones binaurally and wirelessly adjust incoming sound. Said another way, they let you personalize your audio environment.\\n\\nWith a detailed suite of audio tools, Here allows you to dynamically control the volume (noise cancelling) and frequency (EQ) of everything you hear, and even allows you to augment that information with reverb, echo, and filter effects.\\n\\nThere are a number of different applications for the Here earbuds. Concert-goers can use them to, in effect, become their own soundboard operator. You can use the noise-cancelling feature to turn the music up or down, and even zero in on certain instruments with EQ filtering.\\n\\nBeyond music venues, Here—or AR headphones like them—could be used to isolate one speaker in a crowd, or to dynamically soften or mute the frequency of a screeching subway train. Then there's airplanes, which are one of the best environments for noise cancelling headphones.\\n\\nI had a chance to try out Here at Digital Experience in Las Vegas, and was far more impressed than I expected to be. While the buds weren't able to completely mute or cancel out the noise of the show floor—I don't think technology that powerful exists yet—they were able to accomplish some nifty tricks.\\n\\nI struggled to think of a use for the echo and psychedelic (flange) effects, but the ability to use dynamic EQ to adjust my ears' tonal information was pretty neat. The noise-cancelling tech was also effective at adjusting the decibel range of my surroundings.\\n\\nThe Here headphones may sound a little gimmicky, but they point to a future where we'll be able to zero in, tune out, and modify our visual and auditory stimuli. If we accept that AR glasses and headsets—not to mention virtual reality—will soon join the mainstream of consumer gadgetry, then there's no reason to suspect that auditory AR won't do the same.\\n\\n(For my part, I can't help wondering whether it's wise to veil our senses from reality.)\\n\\nIf the Here Active Listening System intrigues you, I have good news and bad news. Bad news first: Doppler Labs only produced a limited run of the earbuds, exclusively for its Kickstarter backers. The good news? The company plans to release an improved version with dynamic stereo controls later this year. You can add your name to the waitlist here. There's no word on pricing just yet.\\n\\nFor more in-depth CES 2016 coverage, head to Reviewed.com."}
{"original": "Jarrett Bell\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nMaybe the Miami Dolphins got it right in filling the first open chair of the NFL head coaching cycle with the hiring Saturday of Adam Gase, considered a rising star.\\n\\nThen again, maybe they blew it again, too.\\n\\nLike the last time, when Joe Philbin was hired, the Dolphins went with a candidate bringing no previous head coaching experience to the table.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean the move is destined to fail. Ron Rivera was a first-time coach when hired by the Carolina Panthers, and his team takes a 15-1 record into the playoffs. Look at the three coaches in the A-North who don't work in Cleveland: Marvin Lewis, Mike Tomlin and John Harbaugh were all hired as first-time coaches, and have staying power bolstered by success.\\n\\nSometimes it works out. But there's a degree of uncertainty with an unproven commodity.\\n\\nTexans pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney inactive with foot injury\\n\\nGase is making the jump after one year as offensive coordinator of the Chicago Bears, which followed a similar stint for a Denver Broncos unit that set records as the most prolific in NFL history.\\n\\nHe gets Peyton Manning's endorsement … just like Jim Caldwell did.\\n\\nMiami is banking on Gase, who helped Jay Cutler produce his most efficient season, to take $100 million quarterback Ryan Tannehill and the team to another level. The Dolphins might have pushed harder to entrust Hue Jackson with the same task, or given Mike Shanahan or Mike Smith another shot.\\n\\nNow the clock ticks as Gase chases Bill Belichick and Tom Brady in the AFC East.\\n\\nHow long does he have? Two years? Three years?\\n\\nThe tight timeline has been reinforced with these wild times on the NFL coaching landscape, where the Tampa Bay Bucs dumped Lovie Smith eight months after drafting franchise quarterback Jameis Winston and the San Francisco 49ers fired Jim Tomsula after a year on the job.\\n\\nTime was one of the elements I discussed with Dolphins owner Stephen Ross during a midseason interview, not long after he fired Philbin and installed Dan Campbell as interim coach.\\n\\nEverybody says they need more time, Ross told USA TODAY Sports.\\n\\nIn today's NFL, you might have a better chance of pulling off a Hail Mary.\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports' NFL wild-card picks\\n\\nRoss, who became majority owner in 2009, went into a fourth season with Philbin before pulling the plug, but I doubt that he'll have as much patience this time in expecting the Dolphins to become a contender. Not after investing heavily in Tannehill and centerpiece D-tackle Ndamukong Suh, who was lured with a six-year, $114 million free agent deal.\\n\\nThe money spent surely raised the expectations. But in a league with parity and some quick turnaround sensation every year, that only further fuels impatience. It can't be lost on Ross that Todd Bowles — an interim coach for the Dolphins in 2011 after Tony Sparano was fired — won 10 games and nearly took the Jets to the playoffs this season as a rookie coach.\\n\\nIn a statement released by the team on Saturday, Ross alluded to Gase's high energy, and his ability to teach and develop players as attractive qualities.\\n\\nDuring our interview, Ross described the most essential characteristic for a head coach as such: It's the inspirational, the motivating of players. It's a question of getting the most out of players.\\n\\nEvery team wants that. And apparently the Dolphins believe that Gase offers a better chance of delivering than the candidates with previous head-coaching experience.\\n\\nLook, none of us start off in the position that we're in, Ross said, regarding his view of first-time coaches. We make mistakes. Hopefully, you learn from your mistakes and you change, you adapt.\\n\\nAt the start of the season, 19 of the 32 coaches were first-time coaches. That reflects how wide-open the prospects have become for landing a first job, as opposed to an overwhelming number of retread hires. For one thing, more coaches are interviewed in today's world, including at least one minority candidate for any opening as mandated by the Rooney Rule.\\n\\nBut with Gase's hiring the first for the seven vacant jobs (with Caldwell's status in Detroit pending, given the hiring Friday of new general manager Bob Quinn), the market underscores the fluidity.\\n\\nIt's one thing for Gase to get his big opportunity. Whether he gets the time to learn on the job if he can't deliver a quick fix is another.\\n\\nThe onus is on the owners, too.\\n\\nMake the wrong move, and you'll have to do it again — sooner rather than later."}
{"original": "David Stern, who died Wednesday at age 77, faced many crises as NBA commissioner.\\n\\nA player brought guns into the locker room. A brawl between teams spilled into the stands and involved fans. A referee gambled on NBA games. Lockouts resulted the cancellation of regular-season games. Those situations revealed a commissioner resolute in protecting the league.\\n\\nBut Stern's most humane, poignant act as commissioner came when he stood by Los Angeles Lakers great Magic Johnson when Johnson announced he was HIV-positive on Nov. 7, 1991.\\n\\nNearly 30 years ago, most of the public didn't have a clear understanding of AIDS and HIV. A diagnosis was perceived by many as a death sentence. Stern's initial reaction upon learning Johnson's condition was standard at the time. He thought Johnson was going to die.\\n\\nEveryone did, Stern told amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, in 2016. That was the nature of HIV/AIDS in this country at the time. I didn't think about what next steps to take until I hung up.\\n\\nJohnson was one of the game's most popular and marketable players who helped rescue the NBA in the 1980s.\\n\\nStern could have distanced himself and the league from Johnson.\\n\\nHe did the opposite. He embraced Johnson, figuratively and literally, and took heat for it. Stern hired Dr. David Rogers, one of the leaders in AIDS research and education, so he and the league could learn more.\\n\\nI learned things that I never thought I would have to know, such as the possibility of HIV passing through fluids, open sores, to get confident that we were proceeding in an intelligent way, Stern said. Somewhere along the line, we realized that this was an opportunity to educate the world and to calm down the fear that anyone with HIV should be treated like a leper.\\n\\nJohnson's health was paramount to Stern, who told amfAR, I remember I became more fascinated by Magic's T-cell count than the score of any game that was being played.\\n\\nJohnson, who had decided to retire, was healthy in the months after his announcement and considered playing again. Fans voted for him to play in the 1992 All-Star Game.\\n\\nThat generated another concern. Players -- even his friends and teammates -- didn't want to play with or against him, afraid they could contract the virus. Owners didn't want Johnson to play, fearful for their players. Doctors began visiting teams and educating players. The league's business partners also had concerns. It had the potential to become a financial and PR nightmare for the league.\\n\\nI work for what I believe is in the best interest of all the owners, Stern told ESPN. There are times when a particular owner or team has a different view. When events are fast-moving, I have to do what is best for the league. For the most part, the owners took our lead.\\n\\nJohnson played in that All-Star Game. He had 25 points, nine assists, five rebounds, two steals and earned MVP. He played for the U.S. Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, but when he considered rejoining the NBA in 1992, opposing players still voiced concern. Johnson chose not to play because of the controversy. But by 1995, players, owners, trainers and executives were more educated. Johnson played 32 games and retired for good.\\n\\nI am going out on my own terms, something I couldn't say when I aborted a comeback in 1992, Johnson said at the time.\\n\\nHe left on his terms because of Stern. Stern cared deeply about the league, and that manifested itself in several ways. We often saw Stern the negotiator, marketer and salesman. He was also a humanitarian, and never was that more apparent than when he supported Magic Johnson.\\n\\nIt confirmed to me the power of sports to educate and to change people's minds on issues, Stern told amfAR. It was a huge, huge opportunity, and I think that Magic, with a little help from us, changed the debate on AIDS in this country and possibly around the world."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nVANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) — Bo Horvat couldn't have been happier to see the calendar flip to 2016.\\n\\nThe second-year center scored twice, including the winner with 66 seconds left in the third period, as the Vancouver Canucks defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 on Wednesday night.\\n\\nHorvat, who had gone 27 games without a goal before scoring in Monday's 3-2 loss to Arizona, took a pass in the slot from Sven Baertschi on a power play and fired home his fifth of the season with Carolina defenseman Jaccob Slavin off for delay of game.\\n\\nIt boosts your confidence quite a bit, said Horvat. To get two of them tonight and help the team win, definitely it's pretty satisfying.\\n\\nBaertschi added a goal for a two-point night of his own, while Jacob Markstrom stopped 26 shots in his sixth straight start for the Canucks (16-16-9) with Ryan Miller out injured.\\n\\nJordan Staal, with a goal and an assist, and John-Michael Liles replied for the Hurricanes (16-18-7), who got 18 saves from Eddie Lack in his return to Vancouver.\\n\\nThat's how it goes sometimes, Lack said of the winner. We're really working hard on our penalty kill and getting better and better. It was a good play by them and a good shot by Bo.\\n\\nVancouver's power play has struggled recently, going just 1 for 26 before Horvat's second goal of the night, and wasted a two-man advantage for 41 seconds early in the third.\\n\\nI thought we showed some resilience after we didn't score on the 5-on-3, said Canucks head coach Willie Desjardins. It was good to see we got one on the power play late. We battled back.\\n\\nA fan favorite in Vancouver before getting dealt to Carolina at the draft when the Canucks decided to go with Miller and Markstrom as their goaltending duo, Lack stopped Horvat on three great scoring chances in the first period.\\n\\nI didn't think it was ever going to go in for me, said Horvat. (Lack) played well tonight.\\n\\nBut he couldn't stop his former teammate a fourth time as Horvat scored his first of the night by cutting in off the wing at 7:15 of the third to give Vancouver a 2-1 lead.\\n\\nCarolina got that one back with exactly eight minutes left in regulation when Staal jumped on a loose puck off a broken play and snapped his eighth of the campaign before the Canucks won it late.\\n\\nTough ending for sure, said Hurricanes head coach Bill Peters. Tough penalty to take and tough way to end the game.\\n\\nAfter registering just two shots in the first, the Hurricanes put in a much better effort in the middle period and grabbed the lead while shorthanded at 8:02 on a shot that Markstrom wanted back. Staal stole the puck at the Carolina blue line and moved into the Vancouver zone before feeding Liles, whose weak shot fluttered under Markstrom's glove for his second of the season.\\n\\nI just misread it completely, said Markstrom.\\n\\nThe Canucks replied with 2:21 left in the second thanks in part to a bad Hurricanes' line change. Adam Cracknell floated a pass up to Baertschi — who returned to the lineup after missing the last two games with a neck injury — and he beat Lack over the glove for his sixth.\\n\\nOur guys battled back huge, said Markstrom. I've just got to buy dinner for Baerts and Bo.\\n\\nHorvat had a good opportunity to open the scoring on a partial breakaway less than four minutes into the first, but Lack was there with a poke check. Horvat had another break later in the period only to see Lack again close the door.\\n\\nJared McCann and Ben Hutton then found iron behind Lack on shots that stayed out before Horvat saw the Carolina goalie thwart his third chance of the period to keep things scoreless.\\n\\nI wanted it, Lack said of being back in the city where he played two seasons. Obviously when I come back like this I wanted it, and it's really tough losing it with a minute to go."}
{"original": "Baker Mayfield has entered do-or-die mode.\\n\\nThe Browns (10-5) would clinch their first playoff berth since 2002 if they defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers (12-3) in the regular-season finale Sunday at FirstEnergy Stadium, but in the starting quarterback's mind, the postseason has already arrived.\\n\\nThe mentality here is we're in our playoffs, just one week early. It's win or go home, Mayfield said Wednesday on Zoom. That's the mentality for our guys. We have the talent. We have the scheme. We just have to go out there and execute it and do our jobs. And when we've had success this year, that's been the case.\\n\\nEverybody knows it's win or go home. There's no need to stress it anymore. There's no need to add any pressure. It's just about us going and doing our job.\\n\\nMore:When in 2021 will pro, college and youth sports return to normal?\\n\\nMore:After rough start, Mike McCarthy's 'Cowboys culture' helps fuel unexpected playoff push\\n\\nActually, the Browns could still make the playoffs if they lose to the Steelers, but they would need significant help.\\n\\nThe Indianapolis Colts (10-5) losing to the Jacksonville Jaguars (1-14) would do the trick. The Tennessee Titans (10-5) losing to the Houston Texans (4-11) and the Miami Dolphins (10-5) defeating or tying the Buffalo Bills (12-3) and the Baltimore Ravens (10-5) beating or tying the Cincinnati Bengals (4-10-1) would work as well. There are other scenarios in which a tie between the Browns and Steelers (hey, it happened in the 2018 season opener) would allow Cleveland to appear in the postseason.\\n\\nBut don't tell Mayfield any of it. Winning is the only option on his radar, and he believes he thrives in high-pressure situations.\\n\\nI've had my back against the wall many a times in my life, Mayfield said. I think I handle that type of stuff correctly.\\n\\nThese are the moments you ask for. When you're little, you dream of playing in the games where it comes down to you have the ball in your hands and you want to take care of business.\\n\\nMayfield continued to lament his performance in Sunday's 23-16 loss to the New York Jets, though running back Nick Chubb and center JC Tretter said he was sharp during Wednesday's practice, which was delayed by more than three hours because practice-squad center Javon Patterson and an unnamed assistant coach tested positive for COVID-19.\\n\\nHe was locked in, Chubb said. He was focused. He was not saying much. He was going out there, practicing hard and leading us.\\n\\nBaker's good. Baker's dialed in. Baker's ready to go, Tretter said. Had a great, great group of meetings, talked through all of our looks and our checks, and we had a good little shorter practice, but a really crisp practice. I think Baker's ready to go.\\n\\nMayfield was ready to go in a different sense on the heels of Sunday's defeat. He stormed out of his Zoom videoconference with media after taking just one question and speaking for about two minutes.\\n\\nIt was completely my performance, Mayfield said of the reason for his frustration after the game. I said there was no excuse when it came to the COVID stuff. We had exactly what we needed to win, and I addressed it then. I said I let the team down, and I'm not going to change that now.\\n\\nBrowns fans won't soon forget the COVID stuff. The Steelers defeating the Colts 28-24 on Sunday opened the door for the short-handed Browns to secure a playoff spot with a victory over the Jets, but it didn't happen.\\n\\nOn the eve of the game, the Browns had their top four wide receivers placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list as close contacts of starting linebacker B.J. Goodson, who tested positive for the virus. They were also without two starting offensive linemen, left tackle Jedrick Wills (illness) and right guard Wyatt Teller (ankle), against the Jets (2-13).\\n\\nMayfield went 28-of-53 passing (52.8%) for 285 yards without a touchdown or an interception. He posted a rating of 68.5. He took four sacks.\\n\\nBut the most glaring problem was Mayfield fumbled three times, losing two on strip-sacks. The other fumble occurred on a fourth-and-1 quarterback sneak and resulted in the game-clinching turnover on downs with 1:18 left to play.\\n\\nYou take each one of those plays and you talk about what technique you can use — two hands on the ball in the pocket, tucking it away and all of those things, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. You constantly harp on that and then you have to practice it, and you have to make sure that you're practicing it so it becomes just rote memory.\\n\\nThe Steelers pummeled Mayfield in Week 6, a 38-7 rout of the Browns on Oct. 18 in Pittsburgh. They sacked him four times. They racked up seven quarterback hits. He threw two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown on his first pass of the game. Stefanski pulled him from the game late in the third quarter to protect him from injury.\\n\\nWe are a much different team, just based on scheme and the things that we have learned about ourselves as the season has gone on, Mayfield said. You want to continue to improve, and we have done that gradually as the season has gone on. We have to play our best ball against the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday. That's all that matters.\\n\\nYes, the Steelers captured the AFC North title this past weekend and will start backup quarterback Mason Rudolph in Cleveland instead of Ben Roethlisberger, who's 23-2-1 as a starter against the Browns. The Steelers will also rest starting center Maurkice Pouncey and defensive stars T.J. Watt and Cameron Heyward, according to reports.\\n\\nMayfield is still concerned about a defense ranked second in the NFL in fewest points (19.2) and fewest yards (302.3) allowed per game. The Steelers are tied for first in the league with 27 takeaways (18 interceptions and nine fumble recoveries). They have a league-high 52 sacks.\\n\\nFacing another tough AFC North defense in the Sept. 13 season opener, Mayfield and the Browns lost 38-6 to the Baltimore Ravens. The offense rebounded in a Dec. 14 rematch, but the Browns still suffered a 47-42 setback.\\n\\nNow Mayfield and Co. will have another chance to get over the hump against a divisional foe. An opportunity to end the NFL's longest active playoff drought is hanging in the balance.\\n\\nWinning is a hell of a lot more fun than the situations I've been in in the past, Mayfield said. Instead of having vacation scheduled, we're focused on taking care of business this week and seeing what happens after that.\\n\\nEverybody here has worked so hard for these moments right here and for these games to truly matter. So we just have to seize the moment."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nKAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) — Ryan Moore was reminded of how much the Ryder Cup helped shape his career after he stuffed two wedges for tap-in birdies, shot a 67 and shared the lead with Justin Thomas going into the weekend at the SBS Tournament of Champions.\\n\\nOnly it really had nothing to do with his score or anything he did Friday at Kapalua.\\n\\nOne question into his interview after the second round, he was asked about the Ryder Cup.\\n\\nI'm leading a golf tournament, and that's all you guys are asking about, Moore said.\\n\\nHe wasn't the least bit bothered. Being chosen as the final player on the U.S. team at Hazeltine and holing the putt that clinched victory for the Americans was one of the best times of his career. He simply was illustrating how a week like that defined him as a player.\\n\\nFor now, anyway.\\n\\nI'm OK with that, Moore said. Before that, I was a guy that was a really good amateur 10 years ago.\\n\\nHe was right again. Moore won the NCAA title, the U.S. Public Links Amateur and the U.S. Amateur in the summer of 2004. The following fall, he became the first player since Tiger Woods to go from college to the PGA Tour without having to go through Q-school.\\n\\nAnd what would the narrative have been five years ago?\\n\\nWhy haven't you won more tournaments, really, Moore said with a smile. That would have been the questions I was getting five years ago.\\n\\nMoore has five PGA Tour victories, the most recent the John Deere Classic last July that earned his return trip to Kapalua. Could he have won more? Every player would say that, and they all know that it's getting harder to do that on the PGA Tour.\\n\\nHis career has been businesslike, much like his personality.\\n\\nFrom that 2005 season, when he earned his card in just 12 tournaments, Moore has only made it to the Tour Championship three times, but he has never gone a full season when he hasn't earned at least $1 million.\\n\\nLast season was the best, sparked by his late surge through the FedEx Cup. He lost in a three-way playoff at the Tour Championship that Rory McIlroy won on the fourth extra hole. That was enough for Davis Love III to use his last pick on Moore, and the 34-year-old delivered. He went 2-1 at Hazeltine, which included the 1-up victory over Lee Westwood in singles that secured the first American victory in eight years.\\n\\nIt was an amazing experience to be part of that team and to actually help the team out and have a couple points for the team, Moore said.\\n\\nBut it wasn't enough to change him as a player, except for giving him a taste of the highest form of pressure in golf. One area where Moore has failed to perform is in the majors. He has only two top 10s in the 35 majors he has played (four as an amateur). There was a tie for 10th at Bethpage Black in the 2009 U.S. Open, and a tie for ninth at Medinah in the 2006 PGA Championship.\\n\\nHe described the Ryder Cup as playing the 72nd hole of a tournament, tied for the lead, on every hole of the match.\\n\\nComing down the stretch, and in those kind of circumstances, I think it can definitely help how I'm going to feel in those situations knowing I've been there and I've handled it in that type of situation, Moore said. But I don't think it's changed me as a golfer or my perspective on things. I think it kind of makes you maybe just a little bit more comfortable with that type of pressure, really.\\n\\nThere's not much of a comparison on Maui.\\n\\nMoore said he gave up on the notion of a working vacation four or five years ago, whether he's in the desert, in the heartland of America or playing golf with views of surfers below the 11th green at Kapalua and humpback whales breeching on the horizon.\\n\\nThis is strictly business, and it shows.\\n\\nHe is tied for the lead and knows the trophy is a long way off, especially with so many players right behind him — Patrick Reed and Jimmy Walker, his Ryder Cup teammates, were one shot behind. Hideki Matsuyama, going for his fourth straight victory, was only three shots back.\\n\\nMoore played Friday with Justin Thomas, the 23-year-old who can flat-out smash it and is getting to the point where he knows where it's going.\\n\\nWhat would a victory mean? It would be a big step toward making another U.S. team, with the Presidents Cup later this year. It would be another victory. And it would mean he gets to start next year at Kapalua. That's enough for him."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nATLANTA (AP) — As Alabama All-America defensive back Minkah Fitzpatrick watched a YouTube video of last week's thrilling Rose Bowl between Georgia and Oklahoma, there was a sense of familiarity with the Bulldogs.\\n\\nWe basically run the same defense. They added a couple of things just like we add some things, Fitzpatrick said. Even the hand signals and stuff are pretty similar. It's pretty interesting.\\n\\nNot surprising, though.\\n\\nGeorgia coach Kirby Smart spent eight years as defensive coordinator for Alabama coach Nick Saban. Alabama's defenses have ranked in the top-20 nationally in yards per play every season since '08. The Tide has been ranked in the top-10 in six of those seasons. Defense has been the backbone of four national championship teams, and both the third-ranked Bulldogs and fourth-ranked Tide bring top-10 defenses into the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday.\\n\\nSaban's defenses — and now Smart's, too — are detail-oriented, fundamentally sound and diverse. Saban's defensive playbook is expansive, and formations can be confounding for opposing quarterbacks to decipher before the ball is snapped. Playing defense for Saban requires not just talent — and there is so much talent — but smarts and discipline.\\n\\nHe's going to run every defense known to man or at least have the ability to do so said Chris Brown, author of The Essential Smart Football and The Art of Smart Football.\\n\\nSaban was defensive coordinator with the Cleveland Browns for Bill Belichick from 1991-94, and the two share similar philosophies.\\n\\nThe basics are this: 3-4 alignments that start with stout defensive linemen, who occupy blockers and can clog multiple gaps up front. This year's Alabama team has 308-pound Da'Ron Payne at nose guard. Georgia has 305-pound nose John Atkins.\\n\\nI think you have to be good up the middle, Alabama defensive coordinator Jeremy Pruitt said. Big guys up front.\\n\\nAs college offenses have become more spread out, Saban and Smart and Georgia defensive coordinator Mel Tucker, who worked for Saban at LSU and Alabama, have adjusted. When facing offenses that line up with three or more wide receivers, the defense shifts to four-man fronts and usually five defensive backs. And with so many teams playing offense up-tempo these days, a key is having versatile players who can be cross-trained at multiple positions. The personnel does not have to change if the defense changes.\\n\\nTight, press coverage is typical on the outside and a concept called pattern matching is often used. Think of it as football's version of basketball's matchup zone.\\n\\nThey're playing zone until someone comes into their space and then they play man, SEC Network analyst and former Auburn offensive lineman Cole Cubelic said. Defenders determine which receiver they are taking by reading the routes.\\n\\nThey're going to challenge receivers and not give up easy stuff, and that comes from (Saban's) time with Belichick, where he learned a lot of sophisticated defensive coverage and concepts, Brown said. It's not what Saban calls country zones, where you just drop to a spot and watch the quarterback's eyes.\\n\\nAdd in those hard to move defensive linemen allowing agile linebackers to fill holes and the basic offense schemes — short throws and between the tackle runs — rarely are productive against Saban's defenses.\\n\\nThey do a great job of denying easy offense, said Miami's Manny Diaz, regarded as one of the top defensive coordinators in the country.\\n\\nBrown said Saban's defensive playbook when Saban coached the Miami Dolphins was famously 1,400 pages.\\n\\nThe menu is huge. All the checks and adjustments are huge, said Temple coach Geoff Collins, who spent a season working for Saban at Alabama before becoming a defensive coordinator at Mississippi State and Florida. But what they'll apply to each game they won't pull from the entire playbook.\\n\\nAnd the defenses are not always what they seem.\\n\\nThey just do a good job of knowing what look they're giving (an offense) and having a compliment off of that look, Collins said. Everything is built off of having a coverage and having a pressure off of the exact same look, and a change-up. They always have a complimentary package off of every disguise.\\n\\nAll those Xs and Os are important, but really there is no secret sauce to stopping offenses.\\n\\nPlenty of teams are using similar schemes and not getting the same results because they don't get the same level of players. All-Americans such as Fitzpatrick and Georgia linebacker Roquan Smith can make most coaches look good. Where the coaching shows up most is not necessarily in the schemes, but in technique and effort.\\n\\nThey're going to be coached tough, said Georgia receivers coach James Coley, a former offensive coordinator at Florida State and Florida. The players that play embrace that toughness. Detailed with their technique, from the way they shoot their hands to how they disengage, how they press, how they jam. How they cover and trail. There is a lot of attention to detail.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Ralph D.

For some schools, this means a nearly two-month break between classes.\\n\\nAnd so the pandemic mini-mester was born.\\n\\nIn Westerville, Ohio, Otterbein University is offering an abbreviated Cardinal + winter term for students to take online courses to catch up or get ahead.\\n\\nScores of students are getting F's:What's the point of failing them during COVID-19?\\n\\nCan a shot reopen schools?:Teachers should be next in COVID-19 vaccine schedule, CDC says\\n\\nWhen university leaders adjusted the fall and spring semester calendars because of the pandemic, they saw a six-week gap and an opportunity, said Kate Lehman, assistant dean for student success at Otterbein.\\n\\nThat's a great opportunity both for students who we knew might not be getting their normal seasonal jobs, might be home with not a whole lot to do, she said. We looked at it as a real opportunity for those students to be able to make progress and do something productive with that time.\\n\\nOther schools around the country have also introduced new winter term options during the longer-than-normal break, including Indiana University, Iowa State University, Emerson College in Boston and Jacksonville University in Florida.\\n\\nEast of Columbus, Denison University isn't offering courses for credit this winter, but it is using the long break to offer winter accelerator options including virtual career boot camps, business consulting and startup workshops, and mini-courses on topics from immigration and gun control to Texas Hold 'Em and The Beatles.\\n\\nThe winter program is modeled after a similar accelerator program the university offered over the summer, after many students suddenly found themselves without the internships they had planned on because of the pandemic.\\n\\nIt was devastating for students, for a lot of reasons, said Denison President Adam Weinberg. They've worked so hard to line these internships up. … We really wanted to fill this need that kind of emerged quickly for our students.\\n\\nIn addition to working part-time as a customer service representative at U-Haul over his long break, student Davis Kleen recently completed one of Denison's virtual career boot camps specifically for juniors.\\n\\nThe three days of online sessions covered resume and cover letter tips, networking and question-and-answer sessions with business recruiters.\\n\\nThe internship search is a big part of Kleen's junior year, he said.\\n\\nWhy not take advantage of this time to get a little bit of extra motivation for my career search? he said.\\n\\nThe extra winter sessions have been popular among many of Kleen's friends, too.\\n\\nFrom my immediate circle at Denison, I've noticed a lot of us have taken advantage of these types of opportunities, he said.\\n\\nAt Otterbein, junior biology major Natianna Chhuom is hoping to graduate early. With new hardships from the pandemic, she's watched several of her close friends have to walk away from their education.\\n\\nThe new Cardinal + winter term is helping her to get ahead, she said. This winter, she is taking a senior-year experience course on social justice, responsibility and change.\\n\\nIt's a really, really fun, great argumentative class, she said.

{"original": "Peter Dunn\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nI love good financial problems. They're much better than bad financial problems. Yet, it's funny how quickly a good financial problem can turn on a dime (so to speak), and become a bad financial problem. The switch is usually the byproduct of overthinking mixed with greed, and a dash of unfamiliarity with success.\\n\\nI offer up to you a pristine example.\\n\\nRecently during a bout of holiday cheer with a friend, he mentioned he and his wife had saved $50,000 for a kitchen remodel and they were ready to proceed with the upheaval of their daily lives with one affirmative call to their contractor. Beautiful, right? Right. Except, like just about any other idea that involves $50,000, it wasn't that simple. He was wondering whether they should get the bank involved. In the blink of an eye, a $50,000 kitchen was on the verge of becoming a $100,000 why did we do that? Or even worse, part of a plot to make $5 quindecillion.\\n\\nVisualize yourself calling a contractor, getting a $50,000 estimate for a kitchen remodel, saving $50,000 aggressively over the course of a couple of years, and then calling the contractor back to start the job. What an amazing feeling bookended by goal setting and diligence. That is until the good ideas start running through your head.\\n\\nMaybe we could just finance the entire project, and invest the $50,000 we saved, you think. Which technically is not a bad idea, if your investment returns outpace your loan interest. Imagine getting 6.5% on your investments on an annual basis and then only paying 3.99% interest on your 10-year home equity loan. Not only would you have a $50,000 kitchen, but your original $50,000 would now be worth $95,609, and you would have only paid a total of $60,718 for the remodeling project and interest.\\n\\nThis is a good problem to have. A good financial problem is when you're faced with a challenging decision and both possible resolutions are relatively good and not all that painful. In this instance, you can either spend the $50,000 you saved to responsibly purchase a kitchen remodel, or you could introduce risk into the equation, employ leverage, and come out the other side with a new kitchen and about $35,000 to boot. It's a bit of a conundrum. A good conundrum, but a conundrum nonetheless.\\n\\nHowever, if you insert some greed, some overthinking, and a few other unbalanced elements, you'll turn the good problem into a bad one.\\n\\nOr we could use the $50,000 as a down payment, and then finance $50,000 to do not only the kitchen, but the laundry room and bathroom too, squeaks through your brain. The payments will only be $505.99 per month, and if we were able to save $50,000 in two years, we will easily be able to afford $505.99, the Judas part of your brain continues.\\n\\nWait, I'm thinking about this all wrong. If I can finance the project and invest my $50,000, all I have to do to win is invest in something that gives me even higher returns than 6.5%, and the sky is the limit! says the it looks good on paper spot in your head. If we purchase $50,000 worth of bitcoin, at the current pace of 1,593% annual return, we'd have $5,317,809,343,361,610,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.00 in 10 years.\\n\\nMore:Don't shortchange your retirement for kids' futures\\n\\nMore:Financial challenge? Don't fake a behavior change to solve it\\n\\nMore:How mental health impacts financial health\\n\\nYeah, I don't think a plan that involves you having $5 quindecillion within a decade is a good plan. You might have gotten carried away.\\n\\nThe kitchen remodel is a placeholder for all sorts of things: retirement, college for your kids, funding a new business, or anything else which requires years of preparation and discipline. I've seen parents blow their kids college funds at the last second on a not-so-sure thing disguised as a sure thing. I've sadly witnessed pre-retirees saunter away from the pre-retiree moniker, back into the working folks grouping, because they stopped doing the dance that got them to the precipice of retirement.\\n\\nIf you behave and choose wisely, you'll have access to more money than you've had before, right before you complete a plan that was years in the making. For instance, at retirement you will have access to the most money you've likely ever had, and armed with 168 hours a week to dispose of it. Again, that's a great problem. It's a great problem until greed and overthinking get into the way, and then you create an avoidable catastrophe.\\n\\nThere's nothing wrong with pivoting during the course of a plan, when presented with new information or opportunity. But getting distracted at the denouement, simply because the finish line is in sight and the excitement overwhelms you to the point of straying, must be avoided at all cost. You can make sure you don't fall victim to this all too common disaster by consistently reminding yourself of your significant goals throughout the accumulation phase, so that the imagery in your head beats back the mutiny which often arrives near the end of the operation.\\n\\nPeter Dunn is an author, speaker and radio host, and he has a free podcast: Million Dollar Plan.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Before they look outside for a new coach to replace Chip Kelly, the Philadelphia Eagles will consider their own assistants.\\n\\nOffensive coordinator Pat Shurmur, who led the Eagles to a season-ending win over the Giants as interim coach, interviewed on Monday. Running backs coach Duce Staley interviewed last Friday.\\n\\nI've been here now for 13 years under two different regimes, Shurmur said. I told the players (Saturday) night that I probably learned more in the last three years than I've learned in any stretch of my coaching career.\\n\\nI think we constantly refine ourselves and we become a better version of ourselves every single day. You learn something new every day.\\n\\nShurmur was 9-23 as Cleveland's coach in 2011-12. He joined Kelly's staff in 2013 and got the chance to be in charge for a week after the Eagles made an abrupt change last Tuesday.\\n\\nI enjoyed this opportunity, Shurmur said. It's kind of bittersweet. Then I think back that maybe had I been a better assistant that this wouldn't have been the case.\\n\\nShurmur began his NFL coaching career on Andy Reid's staff in Philadelphia in 1999. He spent 10 seasons under Reid before going to St. Louis to be offensive coordinator in 2009-10. Shurmur worked with Sam Bradford in the quarterback's rookie season with the Rams, and they were reunited in Philadelphia this year.\\n\\nThe quarterback-head coach relationship is extremely important in any organization, Bradford said. Given the history I have with Pat, I think it would mean a lot to me. I would love to play for him. I really enjoyed playing for him today. If he is a candidate, I hope that he gets serious consideration.\\n\\nBradford isn't a lock to return to Philadelphia, however. He can become a free agent in March and wants to know who will be the coach before he signs a new contract. There's no guarantee a new coach wants him to be the quarterback, either.\\n\\nIt definitely depends on who they hire and what kind of offensive system he wants to run, if he feels like I fit and I feel like I fit, Bradford said.\\n\\nKelly was 10-6 his first two seasons and won the NFC East title in 2013. He went 6-9 before losing his job the same year he took control of personnel decisions.\\n\\nThe biggest knock against Kelly was his inability to communicate well with his players. Some called him distant and unapproachable, though others had good rapport with him.\\n\\nYou want to play for a guy that's going to be there for you, said Bradford, who was one of the players disappointed to see Kelly fired. He's going to lead you and inspire you, someone the guys in the locker room can really rally around.\\n\\nThe Eagles are expected to consider many candidates for the job, including several coordinators. Carolina's defensive coordinator Sean McDermott and offensive coordinators Adam Gase (Chicago), Hue Jackson (Cincinnati) and Josh McDaniels (New England) are among the likely candidates.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nPITTSBURGH (AP) — Jeff Capel turned the page quickly. His players still in their uniforms after Pittsburgh completed its nonconference schedule with a victory over Colgate last weekend, the first-year coach told his club that all the progress it made during a competent and occasionally compelling opening 13 games of the season no longer mattered.\\n\\nThe real metric on whether the rebuilding project Capel took over in April truly has traction will be determined over the next two months when the almost completely overhauled Panthers (10-3) try to end two years of misery in the Atlantic Coast Conference.\\n\\nThat's the first thing he said, senior guard/forward Jared Wilson-Frame said. He just let us know, in a motivational way, too: This is what we came here for. This is what we prepare for and this is what we're trying to change the culture for.\\n\\nThe process starts in earnest on Saturday when 15th-ranked North Carolina (10-3) visits the Petersen Events Center. The first sellout in nearly two years is expected, a sign Capel's optimistic message and his team's energetic play has caught the attention of a fan base that largely stayed away during Kevin Stallings' brief and nightmarish tenure.\\n\\nWe want to give them something to feel a connection with, Capel said. I think we've done that so far. Hopefully, Saturday is another step in that direction.\\n\\nAbout that. Pitt hasn't won an ACC regular-season game since Feb. 18, 2017, when it beat Florida State, a span of 686 days. The only player currently on the roster with a victory over an ACC school is junior guard Malik Ellison, who played at St. John's when the Red Storm knocked off Syracuse twice.\\n\\nWhile Capel joked it probably would help more if I could get out there and play the former Duke star and longtime assistant under Mike Krzyzewski has far more experience facing the Tar Heels than anyone else affiliated with the program save for younger brother Jason, a four-year starter for North Carolina from 1998-2002 who now serves as Jeff Capel's top lieutenant.\\n\\nAnd though Capel can talk all he wants about how facing the Tar Heels is just another game, he knows his players won't buy it.\\n\\nThat's not going to happen, he said. I understand that. We have to treat it as much as we can like (another game) and hope that the gravity of the environment doesn't overwhelm us.\\n\\nSomething that happened with alarming frequency for Pitt last season. The Panthers went winless in league play, with 15 of the 19 games decided by double digits, including a 31-point blowout in Chapel Hill. Only four Pitt players who saw action then will be in uniform on Saturday. The mass exodus has allowed Capel to start over quickly.\\n\\nThe Panthers rely heavily on freshmen guards Xavier Johnson, Trey McGowens and Au'Diese Toney. What they lack in experience they've made up for with production and a dash of swagger. Johnson, who leads Pitt in points and assists, is well aware of his team's recent history, even if he had nothing to do with it. He doesn't consider it a burden.\\n\\nI want to be part of the team that ends the losing streak, Johnson said. I really don't have a losing streak against me, but my first game, don't want to lose an ACC game period, that's my goal.\\n\\nJohnson faced North Carolina freshman Coby White when both played AAU ball, a game Johnson pointed out with a smile that his team won. The odds will be considerably longer this time around.\\n\\nThe Tar Heels are bigger, deeper and more talented than the undersized Panthers. Their leading scorer is 6-foot-8 senior Cameron Johnson, who spent three years at Pitt before heading to North Carolina as a graduate transfer in 2017. Cameron Johnson, who is from the Pittsburgh suburbs, is likely to receive a hostile welcome from Pitt's raucous Oakland Zoo student section. In a way, it's tangible and audible proof of the inroads the Panthers are making off the court.\\n\\nNow comes the hard part: trying to do the same on it. They won't lack for confidence.\\n\\nWe know we're at this level, Wilson-Frame said. We know we're supposed to be on the court with them. We have the same (ACC) logo on our chest, all of us do. It's just a game and we're excited to play against them.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball coverage: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and http://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}

It's hard to escape the conclusion that having grown up in a country that considers the Kennedys to be aristocracy, Meghan didn't understand that being a Windsor is not like being a celebrity, commented Virginia Blackburn in the tabloid Express.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Friday's Daily Mail promised new revelations about the countdown to chaos behind palace doors, and about Meghan fleeing to Canada to rejoin baby Archie, leaving Harry behind to deal with crisis talks with the queen.\\n\\nBreaking: Meghan flies back to Canada (where the couple had left Archie) as Harry deals with their 'abdication' crisis in the UK., tweeted Mail royal reporter Rebecca English.\\n\\nMonths ago, in the midst of Britain's endlessly agonizing divorce from the European Union, self-declared foes of Meghan came up with Megxit, encapsulating in one hashtag the skill many Brits command over their own language: Clever, sharp and more than just a little mean.\\n\\nNow unpleasant comparisons are being made: Introducing the former Meghan Markle as the new ...Yoko Ono! Just as Ono was supposed to have broken up the Beatles, the original Fab Four (not really), now Meghan is breaking up the royal family (not really).\\n\\nMeghan is clearly going to be made the modern day Yoko Ono/Wallace(sic) Simpson within the Royal Family & the press... #GetOut #Megexit, tweeted Claudia Wright.\\n\\nOthers more in tune with British history are comparing Meghan to that other American divorcee who married a royal – long-loathed Wallis Simpson, Duchess of Windsor – 83 years after Queen Elizabeth's uncle King Edward VIII abdicated to marry the woman I love.\\n\\nThis can only be described as an abdication, declared respected writer and biographer A.N. Wilson in The Daily Mail.\\n\\nYou have a very popular and senior member of the royal family who falls for an American divorcee and his world falls apart. Sound familiar? Talk about history repeating itself, Blackburn added in The Express.\\n\\nMore:What are Harry and Meghan thinking? They don't want to be 'senior royals' anymore?\\n\\nMore:Everything we know about Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan's historic royal announcement\\n\\nMore:Madame Tussauds in London removes Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan figures: '#Megxit'\\n\\nEven some American papers featured critical headlines about Harry and Meghan: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are hypocrites — abdicate or stay!, shouted the New York Post.\\n\\nNot every media outfit is piling on. Marina Hyde in The Guardian, the left-leaning newspaper that is skeptical of the monarchy, couldn't be bothered with the fuss, in her column under the headline: Meghan and Harry's story is quite the drama, but it's no abdication crisis.\\n\\nMany enfeebled minds are being lost today about Meghan and Harry, when perhaps the comings and goings of someone a distant sixth in line to the throne ought not really to cause them to entirely wet their pants, she wrote.\\n\\nHere's another comparison: A YouGov poll found that 50% of Americans polled support the Sussex decision to step back from their roles (compared to 45% of British) and 7% of Americans (compared to 26% of Brits) were opposed. But almost as many Americans (43%) said they didn't know anything about the furor.\\n\\nSaid furor appears not to have ruffled the Sussex Instagram account, which continues its quotidian posts as if nothing is amiss. On Friday, the account featured a picture of Meghan, smiling, with a woman at the Hubb Community Kitchen in London (one of her charity projects). The post said the couple visited the kitchen, apparently without the media, after their Tuesday visit to Canada House, judging from what she is wearing in the picture.\\n\\nThe Duke and Duchess were so happy to reconnect with the women and hear about the projects they continue to develop to help those in their community and beyond, read the caption.\\n\\nSo what gives with the snark against the Sussexes on social media and in some real media?\\n\\nThe halcyon days after Harry and Meghan's May 2018 wedding, when the two were said to be the future faces of a modern monarchy, have disappeared in a miasma of criticism and mockery over such issues as their insistence on privacy, their opinions on climate change while using private planes, their fury at racist comments posted on royal social media accounts, and their on-going battles with the media over their coverage.\\n\\nThe two have filed lawsuits against major tabloids for alleged copyright infringement and hacking, a move unlikely to earn them plaudits from the press.\\n\\nSome of the animus has fallen on Meghan, the biracial, divorced older-than-Harry former actress who is believed by many to have changed the previously happy-go-lucky Harry.\\n\\nSpoiled brats, huffed ex-tabloid editor-turned-TV morning show host Piers Morgan, leader of the anti-Meghan chorus ever since he says she ghosted him on social media after meeting Harry in 2016.\\n\\nThe Queen must FIRE Their Royal Hustlers: Deluded Meghan and Harry should be stripped of their titles before this pair of grasping, selfish, scheming Kardashian-wannabes bring down the Monarchy, Morgan tweeted about his latest reproving column.\\n\\nHere we should point out some of the Sussex comparisons are not entirely apt: Harry isn't king, is never going to be king (he's sixth in line currently), and isn't quitting the royal family, so the abdication allusion is a stretch. Meghan and Wallis Simpson were born in America and were divorced, but that is the extent of the similarities.\\n\\nAnd Ono, while she was widely blamed for breaking up the Beatles, historians and the principals themselves argue the band was already breaking up when she met John Lennon.\\n\\nWhy then so much Sturm und Drang over Harry and Meghan? Why are their announcements taking over front pages even while the world worries about a potential war in Iran, for instance, or Britain wrings hands about continuing uncertainty over Brexit?\\n\\nWith everything going on in the world it's amazing to me how many people give a (damn) about Meghan Markle and Prince Harry 'stepping down from royal duties.' Who (cares)? Really? tweeted conservative Fox Nation host Tomi Lahren, an employee of the media corporation which owns The Sun and The Times of London, which do care, very much. (The Times accused Harry of petulance and hot-headedness.)\\n\\nWhy? Because gossip is always a juicy topic and royal gossip even more so. Because many people in Britain believe, rightly or wrong, that Harry and Meghan have delivered a blow to his grandmother, the 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth II, who is beloved but above all revered. The Brits don't like it if they think their head of state has been dissed.\\n\\nIt didn't help that the Sussexes announced their plans with little advance notice of his grandmother and his father, Prince Charles, judging from the careful statement issued in response by Buckingham Palace. There were reports Harry issued his announcement Wednesday in defiance of the queen's orders.\\n\\nAlso, some Brits fear Meghan is taking Harry, the much-loved younger son of much-lamented Princess Diana, far away from them. Will they now move to Canada and take their 8-month-old son, cute-as-a-button Archie, with them? Thus, the alarm klaxons going off.\\n\\nOthers see in Harry's actions a resemblance to Diana, who once declared proudly that she didn't operate by a royal rule book. Because I lead from the heart not the head, she said in a 1995 BBC interview.\\n\\nAnd, to be sure, not everyone is disapproving of Harry and Meghan on social media. Plenty of Twitter users declared they should be left alone, allowed to live the life they want, not the life handed to them, even if on a golden platter.\\n\\nSeeing the press reaction to Megan and Harry's announcement, just confirms why they're right to step away. Good luck to them. #Megxit, tweeted British actor Toby Stephens."}
{"original": "Let me start off by saying I am sucker for a good closet system. What made it difficult to move out of my parents' house many years ago was that I'd be saying goodbye to the custom-built California Closet they had installed in my room (I mean, I'd miss my parents too, obviously, but I've accumulated more shoes over the years than I know what to do with). It was almost genius the way they transformed an empty space with the addition of a few well-placed bars, shelves, hooks, and more.\\n\\nI needed to find a way to recreate that on my own—within a reasonable price point. Enter Rubbermaid.\\n\\nThe basics\\n\\nCredit: Rubbermaid Rubbermaid closet configurations can be customized for nearly any space.\\n\\nYou've probably seen the brand Rubbermaid floating around your miscellaneous Tupperware drawer. But they offer much more than food storage: the brand sells sheds (you heard that right: buy and build your own shed), cleaning supplies, water bottles and coolers, and more—all pretty standard equipment you'd need for everyday living. It's thus not entirely surprising one of their best-selling items is a closet system. I mean, as we prepare for the apocalypse, we need all the storage we can get to stock up on canned goods.\\n\\nThe brand offers three types of closets: The FastTrack system that features expandable all-in-one shelving, the Direct Mount system that includes basic non-adjustable wire shelves, and the Configurations system, the one I have complete with bracket supports, hang rod supports, telescoping rods and more. While I wish I had a more eloquent response as to why I went with this one, it was all they had in stock at Home Depot at the time. But looking into their other two offerings, I'm glad the one I chose represents a healthy mix of both adjustable and fixed shelving. It's meant to fit into closets between six and 10 feet wide, and its steel-based shelves and hanger bars support between 11 and 20 pounds.\\n\\nWhat I liked about Rubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits\\n\\nCredit: Rubbermaid This closet is easy on the eyes, the wallet, and the clutter.\\n\\nThe main thing I like about it probably won't apply to everyone: While the brand claims, rails, shelves, and telescoping rods can be set up in minutes with no cutting, using simple household tools, I'm a little ashamed to say I hired someone to install it. Before installing anything heavy like this closet (which weighs 62 pounds once assembled), you need to hammer and nail directly into a stud behind the drywall (this can be achieved using a studfinder, which TBH sounds like a dating app I would 10/10 sign up for). If you don't have studs behind your drywall that you can hook your furniture into, you'll need to insert separate anchors to avoid having your drywall ripped out of your wall.\\n\\nI am not a particularly graceful person with so much as a butter knife—I couldn't trust myself to hit the nail on the head, so to speak. (And yes, I could have solicited my husband to do it, but we've learned that building furniture together puts a very real strain on our marriage, so we figured the cost-benefit analysis of hiring a handyman vs. a divorce lawyer made sense.)\\n\\nMy husband and I share a hollow nook that connects directly from our bedroom into an en-suite bathroom. When we bought the house, it was completely empty, so I like that this system made excellent use of wasted space. This tells me a product like this can essentially turn any old corner in your home or small apartment into a custom-built walk-in closet. Our handyman used a chainsaw to divide the shelving so we could place two units at opposite ends of our closet. My husband has around two feet of shelving since he owns like three shirts, and I have four feet of shelving.\\n\\nMy three levels of shelves house at least 50 sweatshirts (it's cold in Canada, okay?!), and my hanger racks keep at least 20 button-downs and trousers crease-free. I also use the racks to hang items I'd normally pile in a heap somewhere, like purses, scarves, bras, and belts. Since having it installed seven months ago, I've noticed far less clutter in my actual bedroom. Wall shelving like this is also a great way to free up some space in your chest of drawers or armoire, should they be bursting at the seams.\\n\\nI also appreciate that the system is said to be customizable even after it's built, which is why I've held on to some extra pieces I hadn't used, just in case I decide to change things up.\\n\\nWhat I didn't like about Rubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits\\n\\nCredit: Rubbermaid There's lots to love about these closets, but they're not perfect.\\n\\nIf it seems like I like having a closet system more than I like having this particular closet system, you're not wrong. I don't like that I felt intimidated by all the options. It felt like a very do-or-die situation. Like, what if the configuration I chose is not, in fact, the most economical use of space? Will I have to tear it out of my wall and start over? In the brand's defense, that doesn't seem like their fault. I just struggle with making decisions and sticking to them. I am much more used to reorganizing free-standing furniture to change up a room's vibe than resigning myself to one particular look.\\n\\nI was excited about the prospect of placing shelves according to where I felt in my heart of hearts they belong, but I left it up to the handyman. He's an engineer by trade, so I trusted him to have a sense of how its pieces would make sense aesthetically and structurally. If you don't have self-confidence issues when it comes to home repairs like I do, I'm sure you would be able to install it yourself with a quick YouTube tutorial beforehand.\\n\\nI wouldn't say the material itself is flimsy—it can support the weight of an entire well-fed toddler, after all. My main quip is that the base of each shelf is made of wires separated a bit over one inch apart. That means if I stack a pair of heels on top, the heel plunges right through onto a lower shelf, sullying clean clothes. This requires I place a mat under each pair of shoes, which isn't particularly convenient or easy on the eyes.\\n\\nAnother tiny issue I have is, again, entirely my fault. I don't love that I built my hanger bars only a few feet from the floor. This means my blouses and scarves drag on the floor, which my cats interpret as the most interesting toy ever. However, it says a lot that the closet was able to withstand my cats swinging from my clothes like Jane and Tarzan (they collectively weigh 22 pounds, according to their last checkup).\\n\\nAre Rubbermaid Configurations Closet Kits worth it?\\n\\nCredit: Rubbermaid Store a serious chunk of your belongings in a fraction of the space.\\n\\nHonestly, yes. I recognize how huge of a luxury it is to have the space to put up a wall-mounted closet in the first place, so that in and of itself negates some of my issues with it. If you plan on using the shelves to store large flat items, like folded sweaters, then it's a great bet. But if you're looking to use this as a sort of display case for smaller trinkets, cute little purses, or other accessories, you're better off looking for something with a solid flat base.\\n\\nAfter testing a variety of closer organizers, we dubbed the configurations kit our runner-up. As our tester Rebecca Boniface notes, this type of closet is a better idea if you own your home or are planning to stay in one place for a while, since it requires you to drill into the wall.\\n\\nIts individual compartments are of perfectly fine quality, so the closet system is very much what you make of it. I can't say for sure how it'll turn out without the help of a handyman because, y'know, anxiety, but I have faith in you to pull it off.\\n\\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

{"original": "Ryan T. Anderson and Robert P. George\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nA decade ago, President Barack Obama affirmed that marriage unites a man and woman. So did 45 states and the federal government. The only states to redefine marriage had done so through activist court rulings or, in 2009, legislative action. At the ballot box, citizens had uniformly voted against redefinition. A majority agreed with Obama.\\n\\nThen, in 2012, Obama evolved, and the Supreme Court took cases involving marriage law. Nothing in the Constitution answered the actual question at hand: What is marriage? The court should have left the issue to the people. But in 2013, it struck down the federal definition of marriage as a male-female union in a 5-4 ruling.\\n\\nThe court also punted on a challenge to a state definition of marriage adopted in a 2008 constitutional referendum by which a majority of Californians — yes, Californians — overturned an activist court. Only in 2015 did the Supreme Court, breaking 5-4 again, redefine marriage for the nation, provoking four irrefutable dissents.\\n\\nSame-sex marriage advocates told the public that they sought only the freedom to marry. Same-sex couples were already free to live as they chose, but legal recognition was about the definition of marriage for all of society. It was about affirmation — by the government and everyone else.\\n\\nIt's unsurprising that once a campaign that used to cry live and let live prevailed, it began working to shut down Catholic adoption agencies and harass evangelical bakers and florists. This shows it was never really about live and let live — that was a merely tactical stance.\\n\\nFamily, marriage — redefined\\n\\nWhile these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. This undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.\\n\\nUSA TODAY Editorial Board:Baker's case is not about the First Amendment\\n\\nJack Phillips, owner of Masterpiece Cakeshop:Here's why I can't custom-design cakes for same-sex weddings\\n\\nIt also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. After all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? There's nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of polyamory point out. If marriage isn't a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? If it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?\\n\\nMarriage redefiners could not answer these questions when challenged to show that the elimination of sexual complementarity did not undermine other marital norms. Today, they increasingly admit that they have no stake in upholding norms of monogamy, exclusivity and permanence.\\n\\nSame-sex marriage didn't create these problems. Many in America had unwisely already gone along with the erosion of marital norms in the wake of the sexual revolution — with the rise of cohabitation, nonmarital childbearing, no-fault divorce and the hookup culture. It was no surprise that many would then question the relevance of the male-female norm. Legal redefinition is a consequence of the cultural breakdown of marriage.\\n\\nMonogamy is old news\\n\\nBut same-sex marriage is a catalyst for further erosion. Already, we see respectable opinion-makers mainstreaming throuples, ethical nonmonogamy and open relationships. This was predictable; we and others predicted it.\\n\\nSomething we didn't predict are the headlines about transgender and nonbinary identities. A decade ago, few Americans had given much thought to the T in LGBT. Today, transgender identity seems to dominate the discussion of sexuality and sexual morality.\\n\\nA sex change couldn't solve the underlying issues:I was a transgender woman for 8 years — time I can't get back\\n\\nLiving your truth is hard — but right:High school could have been hell for my transgender son. Don't make it hell for the next kid.\\n\\nThere's a logic here. If we can't see the point of our sexual embodiment where it matters most — in marriage — we'll question whether it matters at all. Hence the push to see gender as fluid and existing along a spectrum of nonbinary options.\\n\\nThere's a deeper logic, too. Implicit in the push for same-sex marriage was body-self dualism — the idea that we're actually nonphysical entities inhabiting physical bodies, or ghosts in machines. That's why the plumbing in sexual acts seemed not to matter.\\n\\nTrue one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. What mattered was emotional union and partners' use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings. Of course, two men or two women (or throuples or even larger sexual ensembles) could do that. But the logic didn't stay with marriage. If the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity.\\n\\nThis has had tragic consequences, especially for children.\\n\\nChildren burdened by our mistakes\\n\\nNearly unthinkable a decade ago, certain medical professionals tell children experiencing gender dysphoria that they are trapped in the wrong body, even that their bodies are merely like Pop-Tarts foil packets, as one expert explained.\\n\\nSome doctors now prescribe puberty-blocking drugs to otherwise healthy children struggling to accept their bodies. They prescribe cross-sex hormones for young teens to transform their bodies to align with their gender identities.\\n\\nAs part of a government grant-supported study, doctors even performed double mastectomies on adolescent girls — including two 13-year-olds.\\n\\nDiscrimination isn't dead:Trump's anti-transgender memo would hurt teens like me. I'm hoping my state protects me.\\n\\nA national policy epidemic:My daughter thinks she's transgender. Her public school undermined my efforts to help her.\\n\\nThese changes weren't grassroots movements. They've come from people wielding political, economic and cultural power to advance sexual-liberationist ideology. The change has been top down — from Hollywood's portrayal of LGBT characters to business executives boycotting states over religious-freedom laws. Having lost at the ballot box over and over — even in California — activists found new avenues: ideologically friendly courts, federal agencies, big corporations.\\n\\nHaving secured a judicial redefinition of marriage, they pivoted to the T, with the Obama administration redefining sex to mean gender identity and imposing a new policy on all schools.\\n\\nAnd having won government support, activists turned to eliminating private dissent. Former presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke wants to yank the tax-exemption of noncompliant churches. Megadonor Tim Gill vows to spend his fortunes to punish the wicked. Who are the wicked? Those who refuse to accept the new sexual orthodoxy.\\n\\nAll of us, including those identifying as LGBT, are made in God's image, are endowed with profound dignity and thus deserve respect. It's because of this dignity and out of such respect that the institutions serving the human good — like the marriage-based family — should be supported, not undermined or redefined. That basic rights like religious freedom ought to be upheld, not infringed. That a healthy moral and physical ecology — especially for children — must be preserved.\\n\\nThe progress of the past decade has exacted steep costs.\\n\\nRyan T. Anderson is the William E.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee guard Kevin Punter Jr. initially resisted the adjustment that has helped make him one of the nation's most prolific scorers.\\n\\nWhen Rick Barnes took over as Tennessee's coach in the offseason, he suggested that Punter alter the mechanics of his shot. Punter said that marked the first time someone had mentioned changing his unorthodox delivery.\\n\\nI didn't want to do it, to be honest with you, just for the simple fact that I've been (shooting that way) all my life, Punter said. I always knew my shot was ugly. I didn't want to do it, but I said, 'I'm going to give it a try.' And to be honest with you, it worked out.\\n\\nHas it ever.\\n\\nPunter has 23.1 points per game - more than double his average from last season - to rank second in the Southeastern Conference and 10th among all Division I players in scoring. Punter will try maintaining his torrid pace Saturday when Tennessee (8-6, 1-1 SEC) hosts No. 21 Texas A&M (12-2, 2-0).\\n\\nBarnes has asked plenty of players to tinker with their shots during a 29-year head coaching career. Barnes says Punter probably has adapted to the switch as quickly as any of them.\\n\\nThat's one of the hardest things to do for all of us, to change habits, Barnes said. For you to change a shot like that, if he doesn't want to do it, he won't do it. We've asked other guys on the team here to tweak some things here and there, and not any of them have been able to stay with it the way he has.\\n\\nPunter is on pace to become the first Tennessee player to average at least 20 points per game in a season since Chris Lofton scored 20.8 points per game in 2006-07. No Tennessee player has finished a season with as many as 23.1 points per game - Punter's current average - since Allan Houston had 23.7 in 1990-91. This natural shooting guard is producing those big totals while adjusting to playing point guard for the first time.\\n\\nHe averages 28.5 points per game in SEC competition and has scored at least 23 points in 10 of his last 11 games.\\n\\nThat represents a remarkable jump for this 6-foot-2 senior from the Bronx, a borough of New York City. Punter averaged 10.3 points per game last season after arriving from State Fair Community College in Sedalia, Missouri.\\n\\nBarnes believed Punter could benefit from some changes. Specifically, Barnes wanted Punter to make sure he began his shooting motion with the ball out in front of his body. Punter had been shooting with the ball directly above his head or occasionally even behind it.\\n\\nIt took all summer - all summer long, Punter said. But this year, I shoot in front of my face rather than behind my head and all crazy.\\n\\nPunter's new shot and his willingness to drive into the lane have boosted his production. Punter is shooting 51.5 percent overall and 40.6 from 3-point range while averaging 8.1 free-throw attempts per game. He has 114 free-throw attempts, tied for 13th nationally.\\n\\nLast season, Punter shot 41.9 percent overall and 35.2 on 3-pointers while averaging 2.9 free throws per game.\\n\\nI can stand here and close my eyes and think of all the times I've walked through Pratt (Pavilion, Tennessee's practice facility) at all different times of the day and he's standing right there in front of the rim just working on moving the ball from behind his head, to the left of his head out where he has it in that nice sweet spot now, Barnes said.\\n\\nPunter has adapted so well he's deleted his old shooting approach from his muscle memory.\\n\\nI used to kid him, Barnes said. I'd say, 'Let's see the old KP.' He says, 'I can't do it. I won't do it.'"}

{"original": "Jason Williams\\n\\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer\\n\\nCINCINNATI -- The high ticket prices. The Delta dominance and downsizing. The drives to Dayton.\\n\\nFinally, the day has arrived that might alleviate all the years-long headaches for Greater Cincinnati fliers.\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines, the crown jewel of low-cost carriers, announced Wednesday it's coming to Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, launching daily non-stop flights to Chicago and Baltimore beginning June 4. The carrier is pulling out of Dayton International Airport and shifting its flights to Cincinnati, similar to the move fellow low-cost carrier Frontier Airlines made in 2013.\\n\\nAmid blue, red and yellow balloons and banners, top business and political leaders from both sides of the Ohio River touted Southwest's arrival as a game-changer for an airport once notorious for having the nation's highest ticket prices. Hyperbole? Well, they weren't saying that when discount carriers Frontier and Allegiant came to town in recent years.\\n\\nMake no mistake: This ... is ... big, Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley said.\\n\\nSouthwest Airlines carries more passengers domestically than any other airline, accounting for 25% of all U.S. passengers. It created the model for low-fare airlines — popular because of its impeccable customer service, no reserved seating, and a resistance to charging baggage and change fees as competitors nickle-and-dime fliers. Those are big reasons Southwest is the only discount carrier that has the cachet to lower fares across the board at an airport, aviation experts have told The Cincinnati Enquirer.\\n\\nSouthwest says 'Southwest Effect' still going strong\\n\\nIn other words, Delta fears Southwest.\\n\\nDallas-based Southwest has done what no other competitor has accomplished in a market once owned by Delta Air Lines. Southwest has won over the business community — and vice versa. The airline convinced enough companies to make seat guarantees, and also received a commitment from businesses to cover some advertising costs to promote the new service across the region.\\n\\nDetails about which companies and the level of commitment made were not disclosed, but the high-powered Cincinnati Business Committee, Cincinnati Regional Business Committee, Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber and REDI were heavily involved in connecting Southwest to large and mid-sized companies.\\n\\nWe feel there are folks here who have a vested interest in helping Southwest be successful, said David Harvey, Southwest's managing director of business development. We were able to build relationships with some key corporate partners to get formal travel agreements in place well before we start the service. That's going to put big wind in our sails.\\n\\nHavana becomes the 100th city on Southwest's route map\\n\\nSouthwest took its first look at CVG a decade ago, Harvey said. That's about the time Delta began a decade-long downsizing of some 600 flights at CVG, mostly due to the Atlanta-based carrier's decision to focus on other markets after its merger with Northwest Airlines. But Delta still had a strong enough grip on Greater Cincinnati to make CVG one of the nation's most expensive airports. The high fares still forced small and mid-sized company managers and vacationers to look mostly to Dayton for cheaper flights.\\n\\nSince Candace McGraw took over as airport CEO in summer 2011, CVG has aggressively recruited low-cost airlines. The airport pursued all domestic low-cost carriers, also including JetBlue Airways. The turning point started in 2013.\\n\\nAfter noticing many of its passengers out of Dayton were from Greater Cincinnati, Frontier decided to step onto Delta's turf at CVG and launched daily non-stop flights to Denver in May. The Denver-based carrier became the first low-cost airline at CVG in a decade. Fliers quickly embraced Frontier, prompting discount carrier Allegiant Air to give CVG a try in early 2014. Both carriers have made several expansions since.\\n\\nHas that helped pave the way for Southwest? Oh, without a doubt, McGraw said. They took a chance on us, and success begets success in the airline industry.\\n\\nDecember route roundup: Where airlines are adding service\\n\\nIn fall 2014, Southwest got serious about CVG. Harvey started quietly meeting with airport officials and leaders of the CBC, CRBC, chamber of commerce and REDI. Periodic meetings occurred in 2015, and the CBC asked an aviation consultant to help with a formal business case late that year. Also in 2015, CVG ended a 40-year agreement with the airlines, a deal in which Delta has influence over most of the airport's business decisions.\\n\\nA new deal balanced the power among the airlines at CVG, where landing costs have declined 44% in the past four years. That helped the business community build its case with Southwest, whose executives repeatedly heard a recurring message from Greater Cincinnati businesses' concerns about declining flights and high fares during hours of meetings last year.\\n\\nIn talks with 200 regional companies each year, REDI president and CEO Johnna Reeder said air service is No. 1 issue I hear about, hands down.\\n\\nIn November, the region's Fortune 500 and other big-company CEOs — all represented by the Cincinnati Business Committee — met with some of Southwest's top executives. That all but sealed the deal. Many CEOs, including real estate developer and Reds co-owner Tom Williams, were at CVG for the press conference.\\n\\nThis was a complete collaboration between business and government in Kentucky and Ohio, Cintas CEO Scott Farmer said.\\n\\nThe Cincinnati Enquirer is part of the USA TODAY Network.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nFLORHAM PARK, N.J. (AP) — Geno Smith remains confident in his abilities, no matter what his lengthy list of doubters and critics say.\\n\\nHe entered training camp as the New York Jets' starting quarterback, but a punch to Smith's jaw derailed his season — and his future with the franchise.\\n\\nI'm extremely competitive, Smith said Monday. I was put in a tough situation this year. I think I did my best to handle it in the best way possible. Being that I didn't play, it's probably the first time that I haven't played since I was about 8 years old.\\n\\nSmith's season was limited to one game on the field, filling in for an injured Ryan Fitzpatrick for three-plus quarters at Oakland on Nov. 1. His final stats line was forgettable: 27 of 42 for 265 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.\\n\\nI want to be out there, we all do, Smith said. But I use things as my motivation, as fuel to my fire. Everything that I've went through and everything that's been said, I listen to it. I hear it, and I use it.\\n\\nNot good enough. Not consistent. Not a leader. Not good at reading defenses. Makes questionable decisions.\\n\\nThey've all been said or written about Smith over the last few seasons since being the Jets' second-round draft pick out of West Virginia in 2013 and starting as a rookie. Having his jaw broken when then-teammate Ikemefuna Enemkpali slugged him during a locker-room dispute in August only added to the narrative.\\n\\nBut Smith is also undeniably talented, with tantalizing athleticism and a strong throwing arm. That combination has the Jets wondering what could be if he puts it all together.\\n\\nI believe in myself, he said. I believe in my ability. I think the experience that I gained this year and the developmental part of that, I think that's going to grow and continue to grow. I just want to continue to become the player that I envision myself being.\\n\\nSmith is unsure what's in store, but has no doubts he can be a starting quarterback in the NFL.\\n\\nOf course, he said.\\n\\nIt seems unlikely, however, that it will be with the Jets. At least, not next season.\\n\\nFitzpatrick is scheduled to be a free agent, but said Monday he'd like to return — and coach Todd Bowles said the feeling is mutual, adding that the 33-year-old veteran would be the starter if he returned.\\n\\nThat could leave Smith on the sideline again in his fourth NFL season.\\n\\nNo one knows what will happen, he said. No one can predict the future. I know you guys (the media) like to. You like to think that you know everything, but we'll see.\\n\\nAt 25, Smith still has time to turn things around. He has 27 career touchdown passes and 35 interceptions and has also rushed for seven scores.\\n\\nI'm not getting any younger, Smith said. When I came in, from Day 1, I wanted to play. That's never going to change.\\n\\nSmith wouldn't speculate on where he'll play next season, saying only, We'll see. He has a year remaining on his rookie contract, and the Jets could opt to have him compete with Bryce Petty as Fitzpatrick's backup, or cut ties with him.\\n\\nHe acknowledged, however, that he would prefer to be in a situation in which he has a chance to be a team's starter.\\n\\nWell, of course, Smith said. I guess if you're saying that I don't have that opportunity here, I don't believe that. We don't know what's going to transpire.\\n\\nSmith brushed off a question about whether he might entertain the idea of trying to seek a trade or ask to be released.\\n\\nThat's a very hypothetical question, he said. I don't really know how to answer that. I haven't done it yet.\\n\\nBowles was complimentary of Smith, praising him for how he carried himself during what could be a career-defining season.\\n\\nI like Geno Smith as a quarterback and a person as well, Bowles said. I thought Geno was very mature as a person. I thought he was very mature as a quarterback. I thought he handled everything well. I thought he took all his reps. I thought he got better as a person and I was very proud of what he did this year.\\n\\nSmith insisted he had no regrets about what happened during training camp, calling it humbling. But he doesn't consider this season a lost opportunity, saying he's appreciative of everything that has happened.\\n\\nSmith heads into the offseason focused on getting stronger and improving himself in every area possible.\\n\\nI'm going to continue to do that, but work 10 times harder, he said, because I've got 10 times more motivation.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred says he and his office have reviewed 75,000 emails relating to the Houston Astros' electronic sign-stealing scandal. They have interviewed at least three current major league managers, an untold number of players and dozens of major league personnel overall.\\n\\nAll that gumshoe work may not inform the commissioner's impending punishment of the Astros than 19 words he put forth on Sept. 15, 2017:\\n\\nAll 30 Clubs have been notified that future violations of this type will be subject to more serious sanctions.\\n\\nThis proclamation came in the wake of a groundbreaking sign-stealing scandal involving the Red Sox, an Apple Watch and the home video room at Fenway Park.\\n\\nSo when Manfred slapped the Red Sox on the wrist, he accompanied the fine with a missive to every major league club, that sign-stealing is cool but, he reminded, no such (electronic) equipment may be used for the purpose of stealing signs or conveying information designed to give a Club an advantage.'\\n\\nMLB OFFSEASON: Best free agents still on the market\\n\\nHALL OF FAME: Was Derek Jeter baseball's last celebrity?\\n\\nYet there went the Astros, just a week after this pointed Manfred memo was circulated, banging away in a relatively meaningless late-September game against the Chicago White Sox, their video camera-laptop-trash can system apparently in midseason form. With any luck, MLB's investigation will reveal the extent of the Astros' shenanigans that postseason, when they went 8-1 at Minute Maid Park and won the World Series.\\n\\nThe bill for thumbing their nose at the commissioner is about to come due.\\n\\nManfred's office is soon expected to announce penalties resulting from the Astros' alleged scheme. It appears the Astros cooperated with the investigation, which is wise, since they say the cover-up is always worse than the crime.\\n\\nBut if there's anything worse than a cover-up, it is blatantly flouting your czar's edict handed down just days earlier.\\n\\nThe result may be, at least temporarily, an Astros organization that looks a lot different than it did just 10 weeks ago.\\n\\nAssistant general manager Brandon Taubman is already gone, fired under pressure from the commissioner's office after a profane, bizarre and misogynistic diatribe toward media members that the organization initially denied before stumbling through an awkward contrition that spanned most of the World Series.\\n\\nNow, general manager Jeff Luhnow, architect of the franchise's teardown and subsequent buildup into a near-dynasty, among the game's most influential figures by ushering the analytics era into a bolder but also colder stratosphere, is in the cross hairs.\\n\\nIt was the GMs that were targeted in the memo, the most important adults in the room, charged with policing their own. That includes the managers, who should have some idea what's going in their dugouts, the tunnels and the video room.\\n\\nIt seems impossible for Luhnow or manager A.J. Hinch to emerge unscathed from this. Luhnow either failed to convey the memo's import, or knew the Astros were running afoul and chose to let it continue as the club marched toward its first championship.\\n\\nWhether Hinch imparted the message to his players – Now boys, knock it off! – or took a see-no-evil, hear-no-evil approach, he is, in fact, the ranking adult in the dugout, the tunnel leading away from it and the clubhouse. Knowing about the Trash Can Timbales and doing nothing, or not knowing about it – the latter seems particularly unlikely – both add up to managerial malfeasance.\\n\\nAnd that makes it a near certainty that a commissioner's office rightfully loaded for bear and badly needing to send a message will suspend both for an extended period.\\n\\nThat it is the Astros who will have their brass disappeared by MLB is somewhat ironic. They were the victims, after all, of a hacking effort by Chris Correa, who as a Cardinals scouting director and former Luhnow cohort in St. Louis, accessed the Astros' database and ended up with a lifetime ban from the game and a 46-month prison sentence.\\n\\nLegally, Correa's hack job was a serious offense. Just as Luhnow and Co. may find themselves harshly punished to send a message that electronic sign-stealing won't be tolerated, Correa bore the brunt of a U.S. Attorney terribly eager to exploit this low-hanging fruit of a cybercrime.\\n\\nFrom a baseball perspective, too, Correa ran terribly afoul of the law. Proprietary information is more golden than ever in the game, crucial in procuring and developing talent.\\n\\nAt the same time, some 90% of players acquired don't pan out. Imagine being one of the few that do, scrapping your way to the major leagues and into the game's marquee event, only to have the results potentially tilted by a different form of cheating.\\n\\nOh, we're not conflating stolen signs with cyber crime, just as others shouldn't play the what-about card on the Astros' behalf, under the guise that everybody was doing it.\\n\\nTake the more recent revelations of the Red Sox's 2018 cheating, which The Athletic reported involved sussing out sign sequences in the video replay room, returning to the dugout and eventually passing the signs on from the basepaths.\\n\\nWhile technically running afoul of Manfred's edicts issued in 2017 and 2018, it still required a ballplayer reaching base, studying the signs, relaying them to the batter in a manner deemed ethical by almost anyone in the game.\\n\\nThe numerous tells among runner and batter provide ample impetus for a pitcher, catcher or pitching coach to change up the signs once they sense something amiss.\\n\\nAmbush By Invisible Garbage Can offers no such warnings.\\n\\nCertainly, the Red Sox will be punished by MLB as well – perhaps harshly, given the repeat offender nature of the alleged actions by both franchise and manager Alex Cora, an Astros bench coach in 2017. Their crimes do not match the Astros, who are technically on trial for sign-stealing but also may bear the brunt of a visceral disdain stemming from any number of events, most recently the Taubman debacle.\\n\\nAbove all, though, they are going to go down hard for the most basic of reasons – ignoring a direct order.\\n\\nPerhaps they even tossed the memo into their favorite garbage can."}
{"original": "The ending of Sunday's wild-card game between the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans Saints prompted another wave of criticism for the NFL's overtime rules, which allowed the Vikings to win without New Orleans even touching the ball.\\n\\nRoughly 48 hours later, the XFL unveiled an alternative idea as part of its official rules.\\n\\nThe rules for startup league, which will kick off next month, will include several departures from how the game is played in the NFL. Among the most significant changes is a shootout-style overtime procedure, with teams getting up to five one-play possessions from the 5-yard line worth two points each. The teams will alternate plays until one team is mathematically eliminated.\\n\\nXFL commissioner Oliver Luck said the intent of the rule is to create a fast, exciting overtime period while also allowing offensive and defensive players on both teams to play a role in the final outcome.\\n\\nTOM BRADY'S NEXT STOP?:Six NFL teams stand out as landing spots if QB splits with Patriots\\n\\nPANTHERS HAVE A NEW COACH:Baylor's Matt Rhule to become next coach\\n\\nWe think it makes sense, because you've got the players on the field deciding overtime that were the players on the field through the course of regulation deciding the fact that overtime was necessary, Luck told USA TODAY Sports on Tuesday morning.\\n\\nWe think people will like it, based on the feedback that we've gotten from focus groups — and just sort of the general excitement around a hockey shootout, which is different but somewhat similar. Or a soccer shootout.\\n\\nLuck said the league hasn't yet determined whether the overtime action will occur at the same end of the field, or whether all units will be on the field at the same time — Team A's offense vs. Team B's defense at one end, for example, and Team B's offense vs. Team A's defense at the other. (Defenses cannot score on overtime possessions.)\\n\\nHere are some of the other notable rules the XFL is revealing Tuesday, many of which had previously been floated by Luck or otherwise rumored.\\n\\nA 9-point touchdown?\\n\\nYes, this will officially be a thing in the XFL. The league is eliminating the traditional extra point and replacing it with a three-tiered PAT system:\\n\\nA successful offensive play from the 2-yard line, worth 1 point\\n\\nA play from the 5-yard line, worth 2 points\\n\\nA play from the 10-yard line, worth 3 points\\n\\nThe defense can also score on these plays, as well. So if Team B intercepts Team A on a 3-point attempt and returns it to the opposite end zone, Team B would get 3 points.\\n\\nSignificant special teams tweaks\\n\\nThe XFL is trying to revive the kickoff, but also keep it safe, by mandating that blockers line up 5 yards across from each other. So instead of running downfield to cover a kickoff, the kickoff coverage unit will line up on the opposing 35-yard line. The kickoff return team will line up on the 30. Once the ball is caught or on the ground for three seconds, the two sides will be allowed to engage. The league hopes this will eliminate some of the high-speed collisions that have resulted from the running start in the NFL.\\n\\nOn punts, there's a similarly significant change: If a punt travels into the end zone, it will be placed at the 35-yard line. If it sails out of bounds between the end zone and the 35, it will also be placed at the 35-yard line. So there won't be any so-called coffin corner punts in the XFL. And the hope, generally, is that this rule will encourage coaches to more frequently go for it on fourth downs near midfield.\\n\\nDouble forward passes\\n\\nThis has long been in the works, and it's not quite as dramatic as it sounds. The gist of the rule is that a team can attempt two forward passes as long as both originate from behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to the NFL rule that requires the first pass to travel backwards. This change is, in part, intended to open the door for more trick plays out of the shotgun.\\n\\nOther notable changes\\n\\nA 25-second play clock, as opposed to the 40-second clock in the NFL\\n\\nA designated ball-spotter, in an effort to speed up the pace of play\\n\\nRequiring just one foot in bounds to complete a catch, as opposed to two in the NFL\\n\\nA running clock, except in the final two minutes of each half\\n\\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad."}

The NFL's leading receiver posted video on Instagram Monday showing him walking briskly on a treadmill.\\n\\nPittsburgh's best chance at reaching the Super Bowl in Minneapolis next month is with Brown's No. 84 on the field.\\n\\nYet the past two weeks have shown the Steelers have the versatility to survive and perhaps even thrive even if he's limited.\\n\\nSmith-Schuster and Bryant were spectacular against New England and kept it going against Houston and Cleveland.\\n\\nI wish everybody had a JuJu in their life, left tackle Alejandro Villanueva said.\\n\\nThe 21-year-old Smith-Schuster is the league's youngest player and he's spent most of his rookie season documenting his acclimation to life in the NFL, episodes that include putting together some of the league's most entertaining touchdown celebrations , losing his bicycle, having Villanueva teach him how to drive and adopting a French Bulldog named Boujee.\\n\\nIt makes for a good time to be sure, but it's Smith-Schuster's precocious talent and not his outsized personality that has given Pittsburgh the biggest boost.\\n\\nThe contributions of Haden, Bryant and Alualu have been less dramatic but in many ways no less important. The Steelers will need their stars to be stars.\\n\\nWe expect our guys to win, Heyward said.

{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nFor most NFL teams, the process of figuring out how to get better starts this week.\\n\\nAnd every club — even the one that winds up winning the Super Bowl next month — will try to make upgrades during the offseason via free agency, the draft or trades.\\n\\nTeams are self-evaluating right now, said Ted Sundquist, the former general manager of the Denver Broncos, letting the owner know, 'This is where we think we're at. This is the direction that we're going to go. This is where we think we need to improve in order to get to the playoffs next year.' You have a firm understanding, having come out of Week 17, where your holes are.\\n\\nSome teams need more help than others, of course. And some moves will work out better than others.\\n\\nSometimes, the chips just fall the way they do, Sundquist said, and your plan just gets blown up.\\n\\nWhat's known is that there will be change.\\n\\nWhen you finish the season in the National Football League, you're probably dreaming if you think you're going to have the same exact roster back as you had a year ago, Washington Redskins coach Jay Gruden said. We're going to have a draft with new players. We're going to have free agents. We're going to lose some of our free agents.\\n\\nReporters from The Associated Press who cover the NFL look at what each team's most pressing needs are:\\n\\n___\\n\\nNFC EAST:\\n\\nCOWBOYS : DE, CB — Suspensions and injuries cast doubt over whether Randy Gregory and DeMarcus Lawrence are long-term answers as pass rushers. CBs Morris Claiborne and Brandon Carr might not be back, so Dallas could revisit 2012, when it signed Carr in free agency and moved up in the draft to take Claiborne.\\n\\nGIANTS : OL, QB — The running game has been bad for years and the offensive line could use plenty of help, especially at tackle. Eli Manning just turned 36, so it's time to find a real QB of the future.\\n\\nREDSKINS : DL, LB — Didn't do much last offseason to upgrade their defensive line, which needs a run-stopper or two; only eight teams allowed more rushing yards. A starting linebacker, plus depth there, is also a must.\\n\\nEAGLES : WR, CB — A topflight wideout, particularly a deep threat, is the most pressing need, because Philadelphia only had one with 500 yards receiving. A starting cornerback is another priority.\\n\\n___\\n\\nNFC SOUTH:\\n\\nFALCONS : DT — Atlanta's biggest remaining hole is the interior defensive line, where Jonathan Babineaux is 35.\\n\\nBUCCANEERS : RB, WR — Running back became a priority when Doug Martin was suspended for violating the NFL's policy on performance-enhancing substances. Also needed: a receiver to take attention off Mike Evans.\\n\\nSAINTS : DE, CB, LB — Need another edge rusher to make teams pay for using multiple blockers on DE Cameron Jordan. New Orleans struggled with CB depth, while an upgrade over journeyman MLB Craig Robertson would help a struggling defense, too.\\n\\nPANTHERS : WR, OL — Cam Newton's numbers went from MVP-worthy to mediocre and part of the problem was a lack of help. Carolina had just one receiver among the top 50 in catches. Offensive tackle is an area of need, with Michael Oher's uncertain future and Mike Remmers' inconsistent play.\\n\\n___\\n\\nNFC NORTH:\\n\\nPACKERS : CB, OLB, RB — After a series of injuries at cornerback, stunting the development of Damarious Randall and Quinten Rollins, Green Bay needs someone at that position, along with help for the pass rush. Also must figure out a plan at running back.\\n\\nLIONS : OL, LB — Detroit must do a better job of protecting QB Matthew Stafford and improving the running game, so a veteran to join an offensive line that started two rookies in 2016 would be a good start. Could replace oft-injured LB DeAndre Levy.\\n\\nVIKINGS : OL — The line failed to protect QB Sam Bradford at times and largely was responsible for the league's worst rushing offense (75.3 yards per game, 3.2 per carry). Left guard Alex Boone and center Joe Berger are probably the only keepers.\\n\\nBEARS : QB — Whether or not Jay Cutler stays, Chicago clearly needs its quarterback of the future.\\n\\n___\\n\\nNFC WEST:\\n\\nSEAHAWKS : OL, RB — Despite an overhaul last offseason, offensive line is still an issue. Wouldn't hurt to add a running back to ease Thomas Rawls' load.\\n\\nCARDINALS : CB, OL — The most glaring need is a DB to play opposite Patrick Peterson. Arizona needs help along the interior and depth for its offensive line.\\n\\nRAMS : OL, WR — To help Jared Goff and Todd Gurley, improvement is needed along the mediocre line and throughout an unimpressive receiving corps.\\n\\n49ERS : QB — San Francisco has plenty of needs, but none more important than quarterback after neither Blaine Gabbert nor Colin Kaepernick impressed this season. The only other QB on the roster is journeyman Christian Ponder, so the Niners might add a couple.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAFC EAST:\\n\\nPATRIOTS : DE — After trading Chandler Jones in the offseason, then Jamie Collins in October, and with Chris Long a free agent, New England likely will want young talent to replenish the front seven.\\n\\nDOLPHINS : LB — Kiko Alonso was solid when healthy, but Miami could use at least two linebackers after having trouble stopping the run and defending short passes over the middle. Plus, injuries exposed a lack of depth.\\n\\nBILLS : WR, S, QB — Big holes at receiver, where Buffalo needs someone opposite Sammy Watkins, and safety, where Aaron Williams' neck injury created problems. QB has been unsettled since Jim Kelly retired two decades ago.\\n\\nJETS : QB, CB, S — A roster overhaul starts at quarterback, where Ryan Fitzpatrick was a bust, Geno Smith got hurt, Bryce Petty was uninspiring before getting hurt, and Christian Hackenberg is a real project. With Darrelle Revis a shell of his shutdown self, New York's secondary could end up with four new starters.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAFC SOUTH:\\n\\nTEXANS : OT, QB — LT Derek Newton tore both patellar tendons on one play in October and it's unlikely he'll be ready for the start of next season, while Duane Brown is an unrestricted free agent after next season. Houston could draft a QB after Brock Osweiler's poor season.\\n\\nTITANS : CB, WR — Cornerback is a glaring need, with Jason McCourty finishing up his eighth season and Perrish Cox gone. Tennessee could use a speedy wide receiver to stretch the field.\\n\\nCOLTS : Pass rusher, CB — Indianapolis needs someone to chase down QBs, thanks to Robert Mathis' retirement and Trent Cole's contract expiring. Adding a cornerback to start opposite Vontae Davis also would help.\\n\\nJAGUARS : OL — Made strides along their offensive line, going from allowing 71 sacks in 2014, to 51 in 2015, to 34 this season. But if QB Blake Bortles is going to develop further, he needs more protection, so Jacksonville should add at least one tackle and maybe two interior linemen.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAFC NORTH:\\n\\nSTEELERS : LB — James Harrison is 38 and isn't going to play forever. Pittsburgh needs to develop a consistent pass rusher opposite Bud Dupree. Lawrence Timmons is set to become a free agent and former first-round pick Jarvis Jones not in the team's 2017 plans.\\n\\nRAVENS : CB — A season-ending injury to Jimmy Smith left the Ravens with journeyman Shareece Wright and rookie Tavon Young at the corners for the final three weeks.\\n\\nBENGALS : OL, DE — Only six teams allowed more sacks. Cincinnati expected first-round pick Cedric Ogbuehi to move into the right tackle spot, but he struggled, had his role reduced, and was benched. The defense is old, and the line struggled to generate pressure at times.\\n\\nBROWNS : QB — Robert Griffin III got hurt in the opener, missed 11 games, returned, showed rust, then got hurt again. After skipping the chance to draft a top college quarterback last year, Cleveland must get it right with one of its two top-10 picks.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAFC WEST:\\n\\nCHIEFS : LB, WR — Derrick Johnson ruptured his Achilles tendon; he already was in the twilight of his career. So finding a middle linebacker is crucial. And Kansas City's seemingly endless search for offensive help means it'll eye a wideout to support Jeremy Maclin and Tyreek Hill.\\n\\nRAIDERS : LB — Oakland could use a more dominant inside linebacker than Perry Riley Jr. or Malcolm Smith to complement edge rushers Khalil Mack and Bruce Irvin.\\n\\nBRONCOS : OL — Denver must refurbish its line for the second consecutive offseason. Two free agents, Russell Okung and Donald Stephenson, didn't fare well. Guards Max Garcia and Ty Sambrailo regressed. Center Matt Paradis was bothered all season by bad hips.\\n\\nCHARGERS : Owner — It won't happen, but fans have been clamoring for it as Dean Spanos appears to be leaning toward moving the team to Los Angeles. The Chargers missed the playoffs for the sixth time in seven seasons — and were the only team to lose to the 1-15 Browns.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Sports Writers Genaro Armas, Bob Baum, Greg Beacham, Tim Booth, Dave Campbell, Tom Canavan, Schuyler Dixon, Josh Dubow, David Ginsburg, Fred Goodall, Will Graves, Kyle Hightower, Joe Kay, Larry Lage, Mark Long, Rob Maaddi, Michael Marot, Brett Martel, Charles Odum, Steve Reed, Kristie Rieken, Andrew Seligman, David Skretta, Arnie Stapleton, Teresa M.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Darius Leonard and Quenton Nelson made a quick impression on their veteran teammates.\\n\\nThe first time the Indianapolis Colts wore pads at training camp, longtime left tackle Anthony Castonzo watched Nelson, the new left guard, stop defensive linemen cold on successive plays. Andrew Luck got a glimpse of Leonard's skills when the new linebacker leapt in the air, twisted his body and picked off his pass.\\n\\nThe veterans knew instantly this rookie class would be different.\\n\\nOn Friday, Leonard and Nelson were rewarded for their remarkable debut seasons by becoming the second set of rookie teammates to be voted to The Associated Press All-Pro team. Gale Sayers and Dick Butkus were the other players to achieve first-team status in 1965, and both went on to have Hall of Fame careers with the Bears.\\n\\nIn both cases they bring a lot of juice into the meeting room, into the weight room. They have infectious leadership qualities, first-year coach Frank Reich said. Their love for the game, their love to compete at the highest level I just think is very infectious and you love their confidence to be able to just let that loose.\\n\\nIt happened quicker than expected.\\n\\nWhile analysts generally regarded Nelson as a star down the road when the Colts took him No. 6 overall in April's draft, the 6-foot-5, 330-pound guard was immediately penciled into the starting lineup and started showing flashes of what he could do. When the pads went on, Nelson turned up the intensity and became a smash hit.\\n\\nHis nasty attitude set the tone for the Colts' offensive line, and he teamed with Castonzo and center Ryan Kelly, Indy's first-round picks in 2011 and 2016, to change the team's reputation. As a result, Indianapolis (10-6) allowed a league-low 18 sacks this season after giving up a league-high 56 in 2017. Marlon Mack rushed for 100 yards four times — the most by a Colts running back in 11 years — and the Colts reached the playoffs for the first time since 2014.\\n\\nNow the honors are piling up, too.\\n\\nNelson became the first Colts offensive linemen chosen to the Pro Bowl since Jeff Saturday in 2010, Indy's first rookie Pro Bowler since Marshall Faulk in 1994, and the first guard to make it since Ron Solt in 1987. Now, he's the first Colts' All-Pro linemen since Saturday in 2007.\\n\\nCastonzo knew it was possible right from the start.\\n\\nThe first morning (of practice) at camp, he went in and absolutely stoned somebody just locked him down. I don't even know who it was, Castonzo told the AP. Then he did it again on the next play and you knew it wasn't a fluke.\\n\\nLeonard faced a more daunting challenge after starring at South Carolina State, an FCS school.\\n\\nGeneral manager Chris Ballard became a fan after watching Leonard make 19 tackles against eventual national champion Clemson in 2016. He didn't wait long to take Leonard, selecting him with the first of four second-round picks, No. 36 overall.\\n\\nLeonard's transition was delayed, too. He worked out at the combine despite a quadriceps injury, and was held out of offseason workouts when he tweaked the muscle. Naturally, Leonard felt like he was behind when he arrived at training camp. But he turned heads at camp with his interception — and never stopped.\\n\\nHe wound up setting a franchise-record with a league-leading 163 tackles and had seven sacks, six forced fumbles and two interceptions despite missing one game with a knee injury. He's the first Indianapolis linebacker to be voted All-Pro since Robert Mathis won the league's sacks title in 2013.\\n\\nHow'd he make the transition so smoothly?\\n\\nYou feel behind, but you know that's when I got with coach (Matt) Eberflus and coach (Dave) Borgonzi every morning, Leonard said. We were doing everything, just spent more time going over everything in the morning (before practice).\\n\\nIt worked.\\n\\nBallard issued a statement in which he took no credit for hitting the jackpot with his first two draft picks, though he certainly understands the magnitude of the feat after spending his first 12 NFL seasons in the Bears' scouting department.\\n\\nWe are thrilled for Quenton and Darius and they are both deserving of All-Pro recognition, he said. Both will also be the first to credit their teammates for the honor. That's a testament to the unique culture that has been developed in our building.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Fred DuVal\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nOn our family coffee table is the book Phoenix, Now vs. Then. It compares photos of various local locations now and 40 years ago. My recent experience in China reminded me of that book.\\n\\nI participated in one of the first American cultural exchanges with China 40 years ago. Our host counterparts were ambitious young Chinese leaders who demonstrated an insatiable curiosity about America, both our free enterprise system and our democracy. The youth in China were at the cusp of pressing their nation to resemble ours.\\n\\nThat was then.\\n\\nToday the many young people we met have now largely concluded that their managed economy and managed democracy serve them better than the American-inspired and freer alternatives.\\n\\nChina has national strategies. We don't\\n\\nThey celebrate an economic growth rate almost twice ours, which is lifting more than 400 million Chinese into the middle class. They cheer their eventual emergence as the biggest economy on the globe.\\n\\nAnd while they admire American self-expression and expansive human rights, the young Chinese now acquiesce to limits on it as an acceptable trade-off for the autocratically driven economic success that is occurring. As one pointedly said: You may have a lot of free speech, but it seems that's all you have, is talk.\\n\\nThe stakes are too high for my family: Farmer: I won't vote for Trump again without an end to high tariffs, trade war with China\\n\\nFor centuries the Chinese were mired in a political and economic system that rendered them voiceless — and powerless — to change. Now they have more say and are exercising a choice. America is no longer seen as a better alternative.\\n\\nThey proudly explain that they have unified national strategies for long-term economic growth, education investment, energy and their global engagement.\\n\\nAnd we have none of them. They are playing the long game — and we aren't.\\n\\nThey observe Western democracies, such as our Congress and its policy paralysis, and cheap partisan vitriol and say, no thanks. They follow Brexit and think, that's another competitor gone.\\n\\nWe win partisan battles yet lose the war\\n\\nWhat does this mean for us?\\n\\nOur two-party system, calcified by social media and siloed news corridors, has turned forward thinking and collaboration into political death warrants for our elected leaders.\\n\\nNow, winning elections isn't about better ideas but about better tactics for making the other side unelectable. Governing is about risk management, not leadership.\\n\\nTo those on both the right and left who have come to see the other team as evil in intent and traitorous in deed, and seek to punish those seeking broader common ground, it may work for partisan scorecards. But it isn't working for our country.\\n\\nWhen will the world take notice? I've fought China's slow-motion genocide of Uighur Muslims. Now, my family are victims.\\n\\nWe are stalling out. In our total preoccupation with defeating the other political party, we are losing our ability to address greater existential threats.\\n\\nWe have historic gaps in opportunity and income. We are falling behind other nations in educational achievement in a knowledge-based economy. Our national debt grows to new historic highs enabled by both parties — and we owe most of it to China.\\n\\nCan democracy win? 2020 is a test\\n\\nThe climate crisis is exploding. The primacy of individual-based identity politics cannibalizes common national identity and goals.\\n\\nWe are stuck in ideological debates of the '60s and '70s. We have no strategy for the future. Both sides seem satisfied with winning the next election while sacrificing the century.\\n\\nAmerica won the 20th century because we pulled together as one nation to build a competitive economy for its time. We prevailed in two World Wars and built a functioning democracy that most of the world sought to emulate.\\n\\nChurchill opined that the ills of democracy can be cured by the strengths of democracy. The 2020 election will test that belief.\\n\\nThe 21st century has its own new challenges. Leading it is not an American birthright. And the competition — with fundamentally different values — is bringing their game.\\n\\nFred DuVal is a member of the Arizona Board of Regents, a former gubernatorial candidate and former senior staff member in the Clinton White House .

{"original": "In California, 2019 was quite a year.\\n\\nCelebrities were caught in a college admissions scandal, planned power outages thrust hundreds of thousands into darkness during wildfires and two big earthquakes rocked cities in the southern parts of the state. New Gov. Gavin Newsom took action on more than 1,000 bills, pressed pause on executions and halted new fracking permits (after they surged on his watch). And that hardly scratches the surface.\\n\\nSo, for today's newsletter, we are diving into some of the biggest stories that we published last year and the important collaborations that helped us tell the California story and hold its leaders accountable.\\n\\nBut before we celebratethe year that brought us baby Yoda, let's revisit the decade we just closed out. The 2010s brought us planking and Tinder. We Gangnam Styled and Harlem Shook. There were times of unity, when millions took to streets to march for women's rights (or to play Pokémon Go), and times of division — we all still remember whether we saw that dress as blue and black or gold and white (obviously #blackandblue btw). And, we carried on through it all.\\n\\nIn the past 10 years, there has been bad news and good, triumph and tragedy, and a whole lot of change. We even survived the end of the Mayan Calendar. What a decade. What a year.\\n\\nI'm California Reporter Gabrielle Canon, filling in for Arlene Martínez. Get the latest headlines from across the state delivered straight to your inbox by signing up here (it's free!).\\n\\nGavin Newsom's first year as governor\\n\\nIt's hard to believe it's only been a year since Newsom took the helm as governor of the Golden State. In an exclusive year-end sit down with USA Today, he shared his hopes for the future, defended his dedication to taking on the Trump Administration, and championed a continued pursuit of the California dream — even as residents in the state face a myriad of new challenges to achieve it.\\n\\nNewspapers collaborate to expose criminal cops\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2019, investigative reporters at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism got their hands on a list that showed an eye-popping number of current or former law enforcement officers, and applicants, who had been convicted of a crime. The result of a Public Records Act Request, the records — including the list with 12,000 names — didn't specify who was on the job. State Attorney General Xavier Becerra's office refused to help reporters parse through the list and even threatened legal action if they published the document.\\n\\nThus began an unprecedented collaborative effort that brought together reporters from three dozen newsrooms across California, including USA Today Network publications The Desert Sun, Ventura County Star, Redding Record Searchlight, Salinas Californian and Visalia Times Delta. The investigation exposed how more than 80 law enforcement officers currently working in the state broke the laws they are charged to enforce.\\n\\nThe review also found that one of every five officers kept their jobs or are still working more than a year after they were sentenced, and 630 cops were convicted during the last decade. Domestic violence was one of the most common charges, after DUI and serious driving offenses. The series was revelatory and showed just how much more there is to uncover. California has among the strictest secrecy laws on police records in the country.\\n\\nYou can search the database here, and find out more about how the project came together here.\\n\\nDestined to burn\\n\\nAs the devastating Camp Fire ripped through the town of Paradise in 2018, escaping residents were caught in dangerous gridlock. The traffic jam in the town of 27,000 people contributed to the catastrophe — and it's one that is likely to be repeated in other high-risk California towns where the roads aren't equipped for a mass exodus when flames are moving fast.\\n\\nThis was just one of many stories produced as part of the Destined to Burn series, highlighting the lessons learned and risks remaining from California's worsening wildfires. The result of a collaboration between the USA Today Network, McClatchy, Media News, and the Associated Press, the series explored the urgent issues and California's unique wildfire risks.\\n\\nFrom celery fields to college graduate at age 58\\n\\nAdolfo González had spent years working the celery fields in Salinas. The 58-year-old came to California from a rural village in Mexico, speaking Zapoteco, his native language, and intended to support his mother and siblings. He never stopped learning. After long days working he went to school. He learned English, and it took him more than a decade, sporadically taking classes between harvesting seasons, but he earned a GED.\\n\\nIn 2019, González received his bachelor's degree in Spanish from California State University, Monterey Bay. He graduated with academic honors with plans to become a teacher and his hometown has rallied around him. Days before his credential test, Monterey County proclaimed June 11 Adolfo González Day.\\n\\nAs I have said, I have done this for my family and my community, and myself, too, he said. But I never imagined I can inspire this many people. Read his inspiring backstory and how his hometown celebrated.\\n\\nAn ever-widening rich-poor gap\\n\\nThe California story is increasingly one of income inequality. Communities across the state have witnessed surges in street encampments, faced rising rents and experienced stark gaps between the rich and the poor. Many residents are struggling to survive in the state they have always called home.\\n\\nHousing costs are roughly 2.5 times the national average here, while more than a third of residents live in poverty. Roughly two-thirds of Californians said they'd tell young folks to lay down roots outside the state. The income gap in California is wide — and still growing.\\n\\nIn 2019, a statewide media collaboration assembled to tell the story of California's divide. Hosted by CalMatters, the series raises awareness about poverty, showcases local storytelling, and utilizes interactive tools and events to engage audiences.\\n\\nYou can learn more about the ongoing project and read the stories here.\\n\\nA few other great reads\\n\\nI'd like to end with a bit of gratitude. As we start a new year and a new decade, we at the USA Today Network would like to tip our hat to you, dear reader. Thank you for joining us on this journey. Stick with us as we continue to share important stories into the future — there's so much more to come!\\n\\nIn California is a roundup of news compiled from across USA TODAY Network newsrooms.

{"original": "LOS ANGELES—The poster at one of the flashy new Amazon Books stores was inviting.\\n\\nSmart Home Made Easy — want to get started but don't know where to start?\\n\\nI think most customers there would raise their hands and say, That's me.\\n\\nAmazon's list put hard-to-understand tech geekdom into words we all get. What it didn't do was spell out the dollars that would be needed to be invested or how some of this stuff might work. Sowe're going to decode that for you.\\n\\nLet's start with money. If you bought everything listed — and were handy at home enough to handle installation — you're looking at just over $1,000 to buy the smart outlet, lights, Fire TV Stick, doorbell, thermostat, lock, security cameras and a device to interact with all this good stuff, which, in Amazon's case, is the $220 Echo Show, which brings video to Alexa.\\n\\nDecoding time! Start with:\\n\\nSmart Outlet\\n\\nThis is the simplest of the smart home accessories. The Amazon Smart Plug ($24.99) or the WeMo Switch Smart Plug ($34.99). You plug this into wall power and then put your pre-existing products (lamps, TV, radio, you name it) into the Smart Plug. From there, you can use an app, or voice assistant like Alexa, to command the product to be turned on and off. Amazon suggests using it with a coffee pot to start it in the morning from bed, but our coffee pot needs a filter, coffee, fresh water and a button that requires a physical turn on to get it going. But hey, no dispute about the lamp, right?\\n\\nLighting\\n\\nSet your mood using colored smart bulbs, dimmers and light strips. That sounds cool, but the bulbs are pricey (around $50 each) and to get the colors Amazon mentions, you'll need to also buy and plug in a hub that speaks to the bulbs. Luckily, many newer plain bulbs are Bluetooth-enabled and don't require the extra set up of the hub. Once plugged into the socket, you can now say, Alexa, turn on the lights and get it done.\\n\\nTV Streaming\\n\\nChange channels, turn up the volume and fast forward a program, using just your voice, Amazon says. Yes, this is technically possible, but it depends on which TV you have, and which accessory you buy. With the Fire TV Cube ($119), Amazon says it can control compatible TVs from certain manufacturers. You cannot use your voice to change channels through an over-the-air HD antenna. With the $49 Fire TV Stick, the functions Amazon touts on the poster happen by speaking the commands into the Fire TV remote.\\n\\nDoorbell\\n\\nWith a Ring video doorbell (starting at $99), you can look at a smartphone app, or the big screen of the Echo Show, to see who's at the door — from wherever you are.The Alexa angle is that you can talk to the person outside via the Echo speaker.\\n\\nLocks\\n\\nSmart home saves the day when you forgot to lock the door or can't find your keys. Ask Alexa to lock and unlock your front door. And look to spend $125 to $225 to buy a lock from a number of makers, including August, Schlage or others, and possibly installation fees, though you may be able to install it yourself.\\n\\nThermostat\\n\\nUse your voice to turn up the heat or turn on the AC from anywhere in the house. You'll invest around $250 for your smart thermostat, from Nest or ecobee, and you'll replace the old thermostat by installing this new one. Expect to potentially need to pay to have it installed.\\n\\nSecurity cameras\\n\\nInstantly monitor the inside of your home with your voice, with the purchase of camera monitors. But only if you're willing to fork over some additional cash to buy the Fire TV, Fire Tablet, Echo Show, or Echo Spot — if you don't already own these devices.\\n\\nIf you're willing to, there are other options. The Amazon CloudCam starts at $119 for one, or $199 for two. Installing Amazon CloudCam is as simple as the Smart Plugs. You connect power to the camera via AC or USB, pair the video with an app (Android and iOS) to see the pictures, and you're up and running. Google-owned Nest also has a camera available for $160, and the Alexa twist is that you can use voice command to turn the unit on and off.\\n\\nRival Google says some 10,000 smart home devices work with Google Home, Google's answer to Alexa, but we couldn't find a website that spelled it out as distinctly as Amazon did at its retail store. Here's the best we could find.\\n\\nReaders: Have questions about setting up the smart home? Is there any fine print we missed from Amazon's poster? Let's chat about it on Twitter, where I'm @jeffersongraham."}
{"original": "Foster Sarell, the No. 2 player overall in the Class of 2017, committed to Stanford during Saturday's U.S. Army All-American Bowl in San Antonio.\\n\\nSarell, an offfensive tackle, had finalists of Nebraska, Notre Dame, Stanford, USC and Washington. He had taken official visits to all of them, except Stanford, but visited Palo Alto numerous times unofficially.\\n\\nIt was really tough, it was a lot of deciding and meeting with my family, rethinking everything, Sarell said this week. It comes down to best fit, where you want to be and that's where it came down for me.\\n\\nRELATED: Jake Fromm, Hunter Johnson lead East to victory\\n\\nWHAT WE LEARNED: Five observations from the Army Bowl\\n\\nNAJEE: No. 1 overall recruit still not saying where he's going\\n\\nAt 6-6 and 311, Sarell is massive, but shows great athleticism for his size in pass blocking and opening holes in the run game.\\n\\nIt was amazing this whole process, and it's been incredible, he said Saturday. It's been my dream school since I was a little kid. Just follow your heart and I think it led me to the right place.\\n\\nStanford also has a commitment from offensive tackle Walker Little, who is ranked No. 19 overall and as the No. 4 offensive tackle, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings. Stanford also has commitments from No. 1 pro style quarterback Davis Mills and top tight end Colby Parkinson.\\n\\nSarell, from Graham-Kapowsin (Graham, Wash.), was named the winner of the Anthony Munoz Lineman of the Year during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl Award Show on Friday night, presented to the top senior offensive or defensive lineman.\\n\\nThe award is named for the Hall of Fame offensive lineman who spent 13 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals.\\n\\nWR Jamire Calvin to Oregon State\\n\\nWide receiver Jamire Calvin became the first player to commit during the U.S. Army All-American Bowl when he selected Oregon State in an emotional moment with his family.\\n\\nCalvin, from Cathedral (Los Angeles), is ranked as the No. 36 wide receiver by the 247Sports Composite.\\n\\nHis finalists had been Alabama, Nebraska, Notre Dame, Oregon State and Washington State with many analysts thinking he would be heading to Nebraska. He also received a New Year's Day offer from Baylor.\\n\\nOriginally my mind was set on another school, but in the past few days talking with everybody, talking with my dad and the other guys, I had a heart change, he said. Being able to play with my best friend is just a blessing.\\n\\nThe Beavers also have a commitment from Jeffrey Manning, a Cathedral defensive back.\\n\\nCalvin had 86 catches for more than 1,300 yards with 17 touchdowns.\\n\\nEno Benjamin, from Wylie East (Wylie, Texas), selected Arizona State during the broadcast.\\n\\nRanked as the No. 8 running back, he had a final five of Arizona State, Baylor, Texas, Utah and Michigan.\\n\\nBenjamin visited Arizona State in October and said he made his decision in November, although he kept it quiet until Saturday.\\n\\nA finalist for Army Player of the Year, he was an Iowa commit who was among the players who decommitted after defying Iowa's policy by taking other official visits. He is ranked as the No. 8 running back and will be the highest-ranked running back commit of the Todd Graham era at Arizona State.\\n\\nI will be committed to Arizona State University, Benjamin said. They really had what I was looking for in a program as far as academics. If I wasn't playing football that wold be a school that I would love to attend.\\n\\nBenjamin, who has a 3.94 GPA, is planning to student business law. That was a huge factor, knowing how many connections you can have coming out of that program.\\n\\nBenjamin could potentially redshirt, given Arizona State's senior depth at the position. He will report in January.\\n\\nChuck Filiaga to Michigan\\n\\nThe 6-6, 335-pound Filiaga moved from California to Aledo (Texas) before his senior year of high school after living in American Samoa, but he isn't heading west for college. Filiaga picked Michigan at the Army Bowl.\\n\\nIt feels great, he said after his commitment. It takes a lot of pressure off me and I can't wait to get up there.\\n\\nHe chose Michigan over Oklahoma and Nebraska. He is listed as the No. 14 offensive tackle.\\n\\nOffensive tackle was a huge priority for Michigan in this class, and head coach Jim Harbaugh handled Filiaga's recruitment in the last month.\\n\\nCoach Harbaugh has made me a huge priority, Filiaga told 247Sports this week. He's wanted to know if I am a team guy and not a 'fame and fortune' type of player, and that fits me perfectly. I have stayed quiet during my recruitment because I'm not big into the attention and would prefer to help my team, focus on my goals and hone my craft as an offensive lineman.\\n\\nBubba Bolden returns to USC\\n\\nBolden committed to USC for a second time at the Army Bowl.\\n\\nThe safety from Bishop Gorman (Las Vegas) committed to the Trojans in December 2015 and then decommitted in July 2016 before his senior season.\\n\\nRanked as the No. 6 safety, Bolden was being pursued by Ohio State, where high school teammates Tate Martell, Haskell Garrett and Tyjon Lindsey have committed.\\n\\nArizona State remained in the mix because Bolden's teammate and fellow defensive back Alex Perry had committed to the Sun Devils.\\n\\nI will be taking my talents to the University of Southern California, he said. My family has supported me throughout this whole thing and they love USC. Got great coaches out there and I feel like I can go in and make a great impact.\\n\\nDarnay Holmes to UCLA\\n\\nRanked as the No. 12 player overall, cornerback Darnay Holmes choose UCLA.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you've got go where family is at and make sure that you're going to be taken care of, said Holmes from Calabasas (Calif.). Some college coaches might tell you things that might be true or might be true, but you've always got to stay to close to family and always keep God first.\\n\\nThe reference to family is to Demetrice Martin, UCLA's assistant head coach and defensive backs coach. Holmes has said Martin has been like family to his family for years.\\n\\nRELATED: Darnay Holmes' little nephew really wanted him to commit to Ohio State\\n\\nHe chose from among Nebraska, Ohio State, USC and UCLA and made a last-minute decision after his family arrived in San Antonio for the Army Bowl on Thursday.\\n\\nAt one point, the Bruins were seemingly the favorite, but he visited Ohio State for the Michigan game and got an in-home visit from Ohio State coaches before the dead period began in mid-December. USC also was a strong contender late in the process. He was leaning toward USC earlier in the week.\\n\\nHolmes is an early enrollee.\\n\\nRanked as the No. 7 player overall, the cornerback from South Grand Prairie (Grand Prairie, Texas) selected Ohio State over Oklahoma and Florida. Ohio State has long been considered the favorite and was the choice at the Army Bowl.\\n\\nWhen I got there, I was just comfortable with the coaching staff and the plan they set up for me, he said when asked why Ohio State, They're put a lot of defensive backs in the NFL. Also, because of life outside of football. They had the whole nine yards.\\n\\nHe also cited the reputation of the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State.\\n\\nWhen I researched all the schools, the best program was the Fisher College of Business, he said. I was a little taken aback by that."}

We employ multiple layers of security throughout our airport system and work closely with the TSA (Transportation Security Administration) and our law enforcement partners.\\n\\nHomeland Security issues warning\\n\\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Saturday issued a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin, still in effect, that said there was no indication of a specific, credible threat inside the United States but warned that an attack in the homeland may come with little or no warning.\\n\\nThe bulletin notes that the United States has designated Iran a state sponsor of terrorism and raises the specter of possible Iranian cyberattacks or terror from homegrown violent extremists.\\n\\nIran maintains a robust cyber program and can execute cyber attacks against the United States, the bulletin said. Iran is capable, at a minimum, of carrying out attacks with temporary disruptive effects against critical infrastructure in the United States.\\n\\nPassengers arriving to the U.S. who are traveling from Iran or have passed through Iran will probably continue to face additional scrutiny, Kerlikowske said.\\n\\nThe Washington state chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights advocacy group, said more than 60 Iranians and Iranian Americans were detained and questioned at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine on the border with Canada over the weekend.\\n\\nOthers were refused entry to the U.S because of CBP's lack of capacity to detain them.\\n\\nThose who were detained said that their passports were confiscated, and they were questioned about their political views and allegiances, the council said in a written statement.\\n\\nCBP officials have refuted the allegation.\\n\\nSocial media posts that CBP is detaining Iranian-Americans and refusing their entry into the U.S. because of their country or origin are false, the agency said in a tweet. Reports that DHS/CBP has issued a related directive are also false.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., sent a letter to Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf and Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan demanding information on reports that as many as 200 Iranian Americans were targeted for secondary screening and held for up to 12 hours at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine.\\n\\nThe letter, also sent to Blaine Sector Port Director Kenneth Williams, asks the Trump administration to produce any directives, orders, guidance, instructions regarding the screening of individuals of Iranian heritage, or any changes in screening procedures in response to Soleimani's death.\\n\\nUtilities taking precautions\\n\\nUtilities also are being vigilant about the security of major infrastructure here.\\n\\nCyberattacks on the power grid have been of particular concern in recent years. Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy consider such attacks a serious threat.\\n\\nIn Arizona, officials with utilities Arizona Public Service Co. and Salt River Project said they are taking the usual precautions.\\n\\nDue to the critical nature of our business, APS maintains a constant, heightened state of awareness of emerging security threats, including physical and cyber security threats, APS spokeswoman Jenna Rowell said Monday. In this case, APS's cyber security team is monitoring the situation with a focus on staying informed of any relevant threat intelligence that may be shared by federal agencies or industry and technology partners.\\n\\nSRP also is keeping in touch with government agencies to monitor for security threats, spokesman Scott Harelson said.\\n\\nWhile we cannot discuss specific steps, we can tell you that we have asked all of our security and personnel at sensitive locations be vigilant and report any suspicious activity they might observe, he said.\\n\\nAPS runs the largest nuclear plant in the U.S., the Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station, 50 miles west of downtown Phoenix.\\n\\nRowell said operations at the plant are normal, with all three units operating. None is undergoing refueling, which brings hundreds of contractors onto the plant site daily for a month or more at a time.\\n\\nWe are in a standard level of security, as the security teams and employees there are always vigilant about monitoring for and reporting any suspicious activity at or in the vicinity of the plant, Rowell said.\\n\\nRepublic reporters Melissa Yeager, Ronald J. Hansen and Ryan Randazzo contributed to this article."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nThe final weekend of the NFL's regular season produced some frozen water fails on television and some frostiness from Oakland Raiders owner Mark Davis, who put Jack Del Rio in the awkward position of announcing his own firing.\\n\\nFirst, the live television faux pas.\\n\\nBoth ESPN reporter Diana Russini at Gillette Stadium, and FOX's Jen Hale at the Meadowlands tried to show just how cold it was by turning over a glass of ice only to watch the water flow right on out during live takes.\\n\\nI filled this glass up with water about 15 minutes ago, Russini said. And ...\\n\\nThe water poured right on out.\\n\\nHere on the sideline, both staffs are having trouble keeping things from freezing up, Hale said as she dumped out her own cup of water. Cups, they keep freezing if they're already filled with water.\\n\\nThat wasn't as cold as the frosty reception Del Rio got from Davis as he came off the field following a 30-10 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers that left after a disappointing six-win season.\\n\\nDel Rio handled the situation with class.\\n\\nHe told me he loved me and appreciated all that I did, but felt like we weren't going in the right direction, Del Rio said. He felt he needed a change, and I told him how much I appreciated the opportunity he gave me. I mean that. Very grateful. My childhood team, but it's a results business. I understand that.\\n\\nI appreciate the players and coaches and all the hard work, all the effort and energy. I do believe we have established a solid nucleus. Whoever comes in here has a chance to take that nucleus and go to special places, and I'll be pulling for them.\\n\\nDel Rio took over a three-win team after the 2015 season and won seven games his first year before guiding the Raiders on a breakthrough season with 12 wins. But it ended in disappointment when a broken leg for quarterback Derek Carr in Week 16 cost the Raiders a chance at a division title and led to a first-round playoff loss.\\n\\nEnding Oakland's 13-year playoff drought earned Del Rio a four-year extension in February but not any slack.\\n\\nDespite the return of Carr and the additions of Marshawn Lynch and Jared Cook, Del Rio's decision to fire coordinator Bill Musgrave after last season despite a dynamic offense and replace him with quarterbacks coach Todd Downing backfired.\\n\\nThe offense regressed significantly as Carr struggled under Downing's tutelage and the defense showed no signs of improvement before firing coordinator Ken Norton Jr. after the defense became the first in league history to go 11 games into a season before intercepting a pass.\\n\\nSpeculation is high that Jon Gruden will return to Oakland for a second stint as coach. He was traded by the Raiders to Tampa Bay following the 2001 season and beat Oakland in the Super Bowl the following season. He was fired by the Buccaneers after the 2008 season and has been in the broadcast booth since.\\n\\nDel Rio was the ninth coach in Oakland since Gruden left, but only the second to get them to the playoffs.\\n\\nI honor the owner's decision, Del Rio said. It was a great honor for me to lead this organization and get this opportunity, and I understand it's a results business. We had a great first two years and this year was a big disappointment. Can't disagree with that.\\n\\nThe final weekend of the regular season produced plenty of glorified exhibitions like the Kansas City-Denver game featuring a bevy of backups, including QB Patrick Mahomes making both his first NFL start and first NFL relief appearance for the Chiefs.\\n\\nJust as he did earlier this year with Martellus Bennett, Patriots coach Bill Belichick put newcomer James Harrison in line to make an immediate impact . Released by the Steelers after not getting the playing time he wanted, the 39-year-old linebacker had two sacks, five tackles and a forced fumble in a 26-6 win over the Jets that secured home-field advantage through the AFC playoffs for the Patriots. That was more production than he had all year with the Steelers, who are the conference's No. 2 seed.\\n\\nCorey Coleman let a chance to avoid 0-16 slip through his hands on fourth down in Cleveland's 28-24 loss to the Steelers' B team.\\n\\nThe Ravens let the playoffs slip through their grasp when Andy Dalton threw a 49-yard TD pass to Tyler Boyd on fourth-and-12 with 44 seconds left to push Cincy to a 31-27 win in Baltimore.\\n\\nThat sent the Buffalo Bills to the playoffs, ending their 17-year drought, the longest in American sports.\\n\\nSo, Bills fans finally with something to look forward to in January like those previous generations who always had Jim Kelly and Thurman Thomas to cheer on well into the winter.\\n\\nAt least until they'd lose the Super Bowl.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

{"original": "If there was an award for winning with the least amount of talent over the last five seasons, Virginia coach Tony Bennett would take it by a landslide.\\n\\nIt's usually that lack of superior talent — five-star recruits and former McDonald's All-Americans — that leave us scratching our heads as to how Virginia is Virginia. Current Milwaukee Bucks guard Malcolm Brogdon was the ACC player of the year when Virginia went to the Elite Eight two years ago and a key cog on back-to-back 30-win, ACC title-winning teams the years before that. But Brogdon was no superstar, and his success was a product of Bennett's unique system as much as anything.\\n\\nBennett's teams have been among the best defensive teams since ascending to an elite status in the ACC back in 2014. It's no different this year: Virginia leads the nation in scoring defense (allowing 52.7 points a game) and ranks second in field goal percentage defense (limiting teams to 36% shooting).\\n\\nGetting a batch of under-recruited and chip-on-their-shoulder players to play defense is one feat. But it's Bennett's tempo-controlling offense — against teams in one of the country's toughest conferences, no less — that is most impressive. Virginia ranks 254th in scoring. And still wins.\\n\\nThat tempo control was on full display in the Cavaliers' eye-opening 61-49 win against North Carolina on Saturday, a statement victory that puts the rest of the country on notice that this program is a force once again. Virginia limited a talent-loaded UNC roster to just 49 points and 59 possessions (15 possessions fewer than average) and forced 19 turnovers. But the difference was in the halfcourt as Virginia's patient offense led to big baskets when it mattered, deflating any Tar Heels' momentum.\\n\\nHeading into the season, Virginia was hard to figure, especially coming off a 23-win 2016-17 that included a fifth-place ACC finish. But it's never been about the players at Virginia. That's Duke and North Carolina. Virginia wins championships with that annoyingly good (and boring) system. Of course, having the right weapons for that system is essential. And this week helped answer questions about whether Virginia had that weaponry. The answer, after the impressive UNC win and a dominant 26-point annihilation of Virginia Tech on its home floor (the Hokies hadn't lost at home all season), is an emphatic yes.\\n\\nThe title-winning ingredients are all there. Kyle Guy (15.5 ppg) and Ty Jerome (9.9 ppg) provide the three-point marksmanship, and Devon Hall (11.6 ppg) and Isaiah Wilkins (6.9 ppg, 7.4 rpg) add more athleticism and the defensive tenacity this program is known for. Then factor in upstart freshman De'Andre Hunter (6.6 ppg) and Rutgers transfer Nigel Johnson (6.5 ppg) as key contributors. Most important, Bennett has size (frontcourt players Jack Salt is 6-10 and Mamadi Diakite is 6-9) and a deep roster (seven guys average more than 6 points a game, which is abundant for Virginia) all of which he can utilize in sure-to-be grueling ACC action.\\n\\nExpect Virginia, No. 8 in the Coaches Poll this week, to jump into the national mix as a top-five team next week. While its résumé (14-1 overall, 3-0 in the ACC, No. 3 RPI, No. 87 non-conference strength of schedule) is nice but still lacking more meat, the fact of the matter is that outside of the obvious kingpins this season — Michigan State, Duke and Villanova — there aren't a bevy of national title contenders. And, if the season ended today, Virginia would be in the mix for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament alongside West Virginia (which cost Virginia its only loss) and Oklahoma. And there will be plenty of opportunities in ACC play to bolster its credentials, anyhow.\\n\\nMuch can change from early January to mid-March, and a 3-0 start in ACC play is exactly that — just a strong start. But it's also a notice that last season was atypical. And a wake-up call to not sleep on this team anymore.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM COLLEGE BASKETBALL THIS WEEK"}

{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nADELBODEN, Switzerland - In a race peppered with World Cup history, Alexis Pinturault held off hard-charging Marcel Hirscher to win Switzerland's classic giant slalom on Saturday.\\n\\nPinturault won a pulsating duel by just 0.04 seconds after five-time defending overall champion Hirscher put pressure on by posting the fastest second run.\\n\\nWith his 19th career World Cup win, Pinturault broke a tie with Alpine ski icon Jean-Claude Killy for most victories by a Frenchman in the circuit's half-century of racing.\\n\\nKilly won his first race almost 50 years ago to the day when the same storied Adelboden hill staged the first giant slalom of the debut World Cup season.\\n\\nJean-Claude is still Jean-Claude. He has his own history, I have mine, said Pinturault, playing down comparisons with a great who swept the downhill, giant slalom and slalom gold medals at the 1968 Grenoble Winter Olympics.\\n\\n(It's) just something unbelievable, and almost unbeatable, said Pinturault, who took a giant slalom bronze at the 2014 Sochi Olympics.\\n\\nRELATED COVERAGE:\\n\\nMikaela Shiffrin's streak ends but she's not worried about records\\n\\nHirscher is a regular history-maker, and scored his 100th World Cup podium finish — tied for second on the all-time list with Marc Girardelli of Luxembourg.\\n\\nIt's something special, said Hirscher, who leads the season-long World Cup standings in pursuit of a record sixth overall title. Girardelli also won five, from 1984 to '93.\\n\\nI'm sure that when I'm getting older, 50 or 60 years, hopefully it will be great to hear that a young athlete is catching or beating my record, Hirscher said.\\n\\nNeither Hirscher nor Pinturault has won a major title in giant slalom but that looks likely to change at the world championships next month, also in Switzerland at St. Moritz. The giant slalom race is Feb. 17.\\n\\nPinturault has three wins in the discipline this season, when Hirscher was runner-up each time. The Austrian, a two-time worlds silver medalist in GS, also won Italy's classic at Alta Badia last month.\\n\\nThe two standouts were far ahead of the rest Saturday. Hirscher's Austrian teammate, Philipp Schoerghofer, finished third, trailing 1.94 behind Pinturault.\\n\\nWearing bib No. 1, Pinturault was 0.70 ahead of Hirscher when leading the morning first run. Schoerghofer had been second fastest.\\n\\nHirscher set an impressive second-run target and Pinturault acknowledged hearing the crowd's noisy roars for his rival from the start gate.\\n\\nI heard he took the lead and also that he made a huge second run, the Frenchman said.\\n\\nPinturault's lead dropped at each time check, and Hirscher smiled ruefully on seeing he lost. He held up a thumb and forefinger slightly apart to show how close it was.\\n\\nStill, Hirscher holds a 44-point lead in the season-long GS standings with three races and a maximum 300 points left to win. The finals week race is scheduled for March 18 at Aspen, Colorado. Hirscher leads Pinturault by 268 in the overall standings.\\n\\nPinturault joined a stellar list of skiers who have won on Adelboden's snow-covered cow pastures. It includes Hirscher, Girardelli and other greats such as Ingemar Stenmark of Sweden, Alberto Tomba of Italy and Hermann Maier of Austria.\\n\\nThe two men who have won every major gold medal in giant slalom since 2009 skipped Saturday's race.\\n\\nTed Ligety of the United States, the 2014 Olympic champion, a three-time world champion and Adelboden winner in 2013, is nursing back pains.\\n\\nThe 2010 Olympic gold medalist and 2009 world champion, Carlo Janka, chose to focus on upcoming downhill races and his home world championships. That left Switzerland to endure another tricky day in GS nearly six years after its last podium placing, when Janka won at Kranjska Gora, Slovenia.\\n\\nThe home team's best hopes on Saturday, Justin Murisier and Gino Caveziel, both skied out of the first run in sight of a big finish-area crowd on the steep final section.\\n\\nSwitzerland's only finisher was 23rd-placed Manuel Pleisch, more than four seconds behind Pinturault and Hirscher in a class, of their own."}

Take the plunge\\n\\nOnce in awhile, go big or go home a la Blindspot's Jaimie Alexander, who wowed in a plunging emerald Genny gown at the Globes. A tip of the hat also goes to Fargo star Kirsten Dunst, who pulled out the stops in her noir Valentino gown.\\n\\n2. Redheads look great in red\\n\\nThrow the old maxim out the door.

Henson's slightly waved bob and Melissa McCarthy's long, loose red carpet style.\\n\\n5. Guys, it's time to up your suit game\\n\\nNeed styling advice, men? Black suits are kinda boring. To try something a bit riskier, just look to the always fashionable, pattern-friendly David Oyelowo and Kevin Hart, whose textured tux was a standout.\\n\\n6. Keep makeup simple\\n\\nMost stars opted for less makeup this year instead of more. A classic example was Brooklyn star Saoirse Ronan, whose fresh-faced beauty shone through her light eyeliner, flush of blush and matte nude lip. The Danish Girl's Alicia Vikander followed the trend, utilizing a restrained amount of shimmery eyeshadow and berry lipstick.\\n\\n7. The LBD is still everyone's go-to\\n\\nAfter the Globes ended, Jennifer Lawrence ditched her long Dior gown for a little black (Versace) dress. Because proper partying (the Joy star won, after all) means not worrying if someone is stepping on your train."}
{"original": "Michael Bonner\\n\\nThe Clarion-Ledger\\n\\nSTARKVILLE - Mississippi State will have its third defensive coordinator in three years after Manny Diaz accepted the same position at Miami on Saturday.\\n\\nDiaz is from Miami and his father was mayor of the city in the early 2000s. Diaz also has ties to new Miami coach Mark Richt, serving as a graduate assistant at Florida State from 1998-99 when Richt was the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach.\\n\\nStarkville is a special place, and I could not be more thankful for the opportunity Dan Mullen and Scott Stricklin gave my family and I, Diaz said in a statement. The Bulldog fans are like no other and it has been a privilege to be a part of such a great program, university and community.\\n\\nI wish the MSU players, coaches and fans all the best. Their future is bright. We knew it would take a very unique opportunity for us to consider leaving. God blessed me with a chance to return home, to coach in my hometown and to reunite with family. It is the kind of opportunity that comes along rarely in this business. It was simply too good to pass up. I can't wait to help Coach Richt build a championship program at Miami.\\n\\nDiaz began his second stint at Mississippi State in 2015. He spent one year with the program in 2010 as the defensive coordinator and linebackers coach. The second go-around at the same position lasted just as long.\\n\\nThis is the last defensive coordinator position that I ever want to take, Diaz said when he was hired in January of 2015. This is it. This is where I want to coach defense.\\n\\nA need for Diaz's services arose in Starkville after Geoff Collins left MSU prior to the Orange Bowl. Collins accepted the defensive coordinator job at Florida.\\n\\nThe opening at defensive coordinator and linebackers coach is the third coach Dan Mullen will have to fill heading into 2016. Tony Hughes' departure to become the head coach at Jackson State left openings at safeties coach (and recruiting coordinator). Strength coach Rick Court accepted a similar position at Maryland.\\n\\nHughes and Diaz influenced MSU's recruiting as much as the defense. In filling each vacancy, Mullen undoubtedly will focus on recruiting as much as football philosophy. It will also be the sixth defensive coordinator change in Mullen's eight seasons at Mississippi State.\\n\\nDiaz overhauled Mississippi State's pass defense in 2015. The Bulldogs ranked last in the SEC allowing 272.8 yards per game. Under Diaz, MSU limited teams to 216 passing yards per game in 2015.\\n\\nThe defense slipped against he run, though. Diaz's defenses allowed 23 more yards per game than the unit surrendered in 2014. MSU allowed at least 200 yards rushing in four of its final five games.\\n\\nThe Bulldogs also regressed in turnovers. In the final year under Collins, MSU created 23 turnovers. That number dropped to 14 under Diaz.\\n\\nMSU finished the season strong in the Belk Bowl, though. It created two turnovers in the first three possessions of the game, holding North Carolina State to 28 points. MSU entered the season finale having allowed its last three opponents to post at least 31 points.\\n\\nThe incoming defensive coordinator will inherit a talented roster. The Bulldogs started one senior on defense in the Belk Bowl and returns its top seven tacklers. Beniquez Brown, Richie Brown and A.J. Jefferson all will be seniors after ranking in the top three in tackles for loss and sacks in 2015.\\n\\nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com. Follow @MikeBBonner on Twitter."}
{"original": "Rajan Menon and William Ruger\\n\\nUkraine matters more to Russia than it does to the United States. This hard reality makes the Trump administration's recent decision to approve selling lethal weapons to Ukraine, including anti-tank missiles, counterproductive and dangerous.\\n\\nDefenders of the move contend that it will deter Russia and pressure Vladimir Putin to accept a just political settlement of the continuing war in Ukraine's Donbas region.\\n\\nIt won't. Putin is too deeply committed in eastern Ukraine to back down, especially with an election approaching. Russia believes it has vital interests there that it must defend, even if that prolongs economic sanctions.\\n\\nOUR VIEW: Russia the 'evil empire' again\\n\\nSoon after news of the arms sales broke, Russia's deputy foreign minister declared that his country won't be cowed. Russia has already demonstrated, notably in 2015, that it can parry U­krainian military advances by sending additional personnel and weaponry. And because Russia shares a 1,200 mile-long border with Ukraine, Moscow will always be able to do so much faster and more easily than Washington can. Thus, arming Ukraine will likely escalate the conflict.\\n\\nUnderstanding Ukraine's significance to Russia is not equivalent to condoning Putin's annexation of Crimea and support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine. It does mean there are limits to what the U.S. can achieve short of a more serious commitment.\\n\\nTrump's $41.5 million arms package will scarcely change battlefield outcomes in Ukraine. But it will certainly provoke Russia. What if Putin ups the ante and Ukraine's military is pushed back? Will Washington ship more arms? What if that doesn't work? Ask the arm Ukraine folks. You won't get an answer. Instead, they'll talk about international norms and self-determination. Sound statecraft demands greater realism about constraints, costs and risks. Ideals aren't enough.\\n\\nRajan Menon is professor of international relations at the City College of New York.

{"original": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank will be patient as it weighs future interest rate hikes in light of low inflation, adding that policymakers will also take into account recent stock market volatility.\\n\\nPowell seemed to deliberately convey a more cautious approach to rate hikes this year than he did during a news conference last month after the Fed raised rates for a fourth time in 2018.\\n\\nWith muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves, Powell said in a discussion with former Fed chairs Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke at the American Economic Association and Allied Social Science Association's annual meeting in Atlanta. The talk was moderated by New York Times reporter Neil Irwin.\\n\\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, already up about 400 points after a booming jobs report, leaped another 400 points by early afternoon following Powell's remarks.\\n\\nPowell also said he would not resign if asked to do so by President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Powell for lifting rates and crimping the faster economic growth Trump has promised. Trump has reportedly discussed the possibility of firing Powell, news that further intensified a market sell-off last month.\\n\\nA president can dismiss a Fed board member only for cause, and it's unclear if he can remove a Fed chief who could continue to serve on the board. Experts, however, have said such a move would roil markets and jeopardize the Fed's independence.\\n\\nWhile Fed officials have been providing a generally upbeat view of the economy, Powell noted the market has plunged from its early fall peak because of fears of slowing global growth and the Trump administration's trade fight with China, among other factors.\\n\\nWe're listening carefully to that, and we're going to be taking that downside risk into account as Fed policymakers decide whether to raise interest rates, Powell said Friday.\\n\\nHe seemed to compare the Fed's flexible approach to early 2016, when the central bank forecast four rate hikes that year but wound up hiking just once amid a market sell-off, economic troubles abroad and a drop in oil prices.\\n\\nPowell's message was unmistakable, in our opinion, says economist Michael Feroli of JPMorgan Chase.\\n\\nPowell also said the Fed would be willing to pause its campaign to shrink the $3.5 trillion portfolio of bonds that it purchased during and after the Great Recession to lower long-term interest rates – presumably if the economy weakened significantly.\\n\\nWe said we'd be prepared to adjust the plan as appropriate to achieve our objectives of solid economic growth and stable inflation, Powell said. We wouldn't hesitate to change it.\\n\\nBy contrast, at his December news conference, Powell reiterated the Fed's view that the balance sheet reduction was on autopilot and the Fed was relying on its benchmark short-term interest rate to tweak the economy's temperature. His remarks further fueled investor concerns that Powell and the Fed were blithely moving forward with a campaign to tap the brakes on the economy despite scant evidence of inflation, market turbulence, slowing global growth and forecasts for weakening activity in the U.S.\\n\\nFed officials instead focused on the economy's recent performance, which has reflected healthy growth and unemployment that has dropped below 4 percent.\\n\\nLast month, Fed policymakers forecast two rate hikes in 2019, down from its previous estimate of three, but fed fund futures markets were pricing in just one move. Lately, markets have expected none.\\n\\nThe stock market punished the Fed by plummeting further after Powell's December news conference, hurting consumer and business confidence and raising the prospect that the dimmer outlook could itself hurt the economy.\\n\\nOn Friday, Powell seemed to be acknowledging that he and other Fed officials got the message, and markets responded in kind.\\n\\nWhen we get conflicting signals, policy is very much about risk management, Powell said."}
{"original": "Glenn Harlan Reynolds\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nWhen you move to another state, how long is it before you actually live there? That, in short, is the question the Supreme Court will decide this year in a case from my home state of Tennessee, due to be argued Jan. 16.\\n\\nDoug and Mary Ketchum moved from Utah to Tennessee because their special-needs daughter's fragile health required it. Once in Memphis, they wanted to run a business that would give them a steady income with flexible enough hours to let them care for their daughter, Stacy.\\n\\nThey bought Kimbrough Towers Fine Wine, but there was a catch. Although a new arrival to Tennessee (or any other state) can register to vote, acquire a driver's license, own property, etc. more or less immediately, Tennessee law limits liquor licenses to people who have lived in the state for two or more years.\\n\\nTennessee says that law is unconstitutional. The state's Alcoholic Beverage Commission recommended that the Ketchums receive their license, but the liquor-store trade association, the Tennessee Wine & Spirits Retailers Association, threatened to sue if the license was granted. Instead, the commission filed its own suit, asking that the law be declared unconstitutional. The Ketchums, represented by libertarian public-interest law firm the Institute for Justice, also sued.\\n\\nRead more commentary:Dangerous mix of world conflicts create recipe for a rough century\\n\\nI deleted my Twitter account. It's a breeding ground for thoughtlessness and contempt.\\n\\nDonald Trump must bust Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google monopolies like Teddy Roosevelt.\\n\\nTwo courts agreed, but now it's before the Supreme Court because it's complicated. The 14th Amendment's privileges or immunities clause — not to be confused with the different privileges and immunities clause in Article IV of the Constitution — limits how states can discriminate against new residents. In addition, the interstate Commerce Clause, through the dormant Commerce Clause, forbids discrimination against out-of-staters.\\n\\nThe Ketchums argue that because the court has recognized a fundamental right to travel freely (including a change of residency) from one state to another, the limitation on liquor licenses for new residents is unconstitutional. But the 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition, gave states some additional rights. Not only did it end prohibition by repealing the 18th Amendment, it also provides: The transportation or importation into any state, territory, or possession of the United States for delivery or use therein of intoxicating liquors, in violation of the laws thereof, is hereby prohibited.\\n\\nDoes this mean the Ketchums have fewer rights?\\n\\nThere are two questions: First, does this mean that the Ketchums have fewer rights than otherwise because they're selling booze? Second, if Tennessee says the law is unconstitutional, why doesn't it just repeal it?\\n\\nThe answer to the first question is probably not. The Supreme Court has held that the general rule against discriminating against out-of-staters is not overridden by the 21st Amendment, though some scholars have criticized that. Even so, we're supposed to have a seamless national market — making interstate commerce easier was the original reason for the Constitution. And though at the end of Prohibition, states were allowed to stay dry if they wanted to, or to restrict liquor sales to state-monopoly stores, the purpose of that local-option provision wasn't to allow them to discriminate against people from elsewhere. (Though that probably not reflects the case law as it is — the Supreme Court may have decided to hear the case so as to change existing rules, under the Commerce Clause or the privileges or immunities clause.)\\n\\nBut why not just repeal the law? Fundamentally, because repealing laws is hard. As fans of Schoolhouse Rock know, the path from bill to law — even a law repealing an existing law — is difficult and uncertain. Legislatures aren't actually designed to pass bills so much as to make it easy to kill them, often without leaving any fingerprints.\\n\\nWhy are unconstitutional laws still on the books?\\n\\nBut this leads, as now-Judge Guido Calabresi pointed out many years ago, to the accumulation of statutes that grow obsolete but which remain on the books because there's not sufficient political energy to get rid of them. Various tools have been suggested, and sometimes implemented, to do something about this, from sunset provisions to judicial doctrines such as desuetude. Generally speaking, however, once they're on the books, we're stuck with them.\\n\\nWhen an obsolete law is on the books, even a fairly small constituency can usually block its repeal, even if the law would never command a majority in the legislature today. In the absence of better tools, sometimes all you can do is hope a court will strike it down.\\n\\nIf it were up to me, I'd require that every law be re-enacted every 20 years or so by a majority, or be dropped off the books. In the meantime, the Ketchums' fate may tell us something about how the Supreme Court feels.\\n\\nGlenn Harlan Reynolds, a University of Tennessee law professor and the author of The New School: How the Information Age Will Save American Education from Itself, is a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors."}
{"original": "Saritha Prabhu\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nSaritha Prabhu of Clarksville is a USA TODAY NETWORK Tennessee columnist.\\n\\nOne of the reasons Donald Trump got elected president was because he spoke the truth about our nearly two decades-long foreign policy in the Middle East.\\n\\nThe gist of his argument was: We've spent trillions of dollars on wars, occupation and nation-building in the Middle East and have achieved nothing. Our soldiers have suffered grievously with our military adventurism. That money could've been better spent on domestic nation-building to help Americans lead better lives.\\n\\nWhatever one thinks of Trump and his character, his argument was sound and was embraced by tens of millions of Americans. It also echoed what another populist, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was saying in much of 2016.\\n\\nWith this argument, Trump was able to pulverize the foreign policy establishment wings of both parties, represented by Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nOUR VIEW:Backtracking on Syria leaves foreign policy in a better place\\n\\nRead more commentary:As a Syrian refugee in America, I watched my country collapse. But there is a path to hope.\\n\\nMy husband lost a limb in Afghanistan. Now, as his caregiver, I'm on the front lines.\\n\\nAs American troops install razor wire in Arizona, images of the Berlin Wall resurface\\n\\nFast-forward to 2018, and to Trump's unilateral decision to withdraw roughly 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria, overriding the advice of his generals and almost the entire foreign policy establishment.\\n\\nElites want the US in Middle East conflict forever\\n\\nMany foreign policy and military elites and experts have been crying foul in recent weeks. The usual arguments have unfolded: America is in retreat and its global leadership role will be weakened; we'll cede Syria to Russia and Iran; our ally Israel will be threatened and so on and so forth.\\n\\nIn other words, America should have a military presence forever and ever till death do us part in several Middle Eastern countries.\\n\\nOne can't help noticing that many of these people are the same experts who thought it a good idea to advance regime-change in Iraq and Libya, who are now advocating the same in Syria, and who think occupying Afghanistan for 17 years and running is sound.\\n\\nWhy are we still listening to them? They may have impeccable credentials, but their motives, judgment and agendas can often be suspect.\\n\\nBetween the neoconservatives and the liberal interventionists in our foreign policy establishment, America has become toast.\\n\\nSuggestions for future military interventions\\n\\nAs a party-less, ideology-less independent voter who wants only the best for America, I'll take political courage and common sense wherever I can find them. So I applaud Trump's courage, pragmatism and independence in bucking our military-industrial complex.\\n\\nGoing forward, I have three humble suggestions for any gung-ho military interventions:\\n\\n►We sorely need separate congressional authorization for each new military incursion. That means exhaustive hearings, democratic debate and public consensus. One problem we've had since the 2001 terrorist attacks is that we've had a roving, all-purpose Authorization for Use of Military Force used and/or abused to initiate, expand and/or unendingly keep our armed forces in an increasing number of Muslim-majority countries. Does the American public even know the size and nature of our post-2001 expanding military footprint?\\n\\n►For the love of God, let's spread the sacrifice around. When commentators such as Max Boot, Joe Scarborough, Bret Stephens and other foreign policy and media elites send their grown children to fight in the Middle East, Middle America's sons and daughters can go, too. Otherwise, no can do.\\n\\n►For any new future military interventions, there ought to be clear goals and a clear exit strategy delineated with no room for mission creep and endless quagmires.\\n\\nOne reason we admire President George H.W. Bush was because he kept the Persian Gulf War in check and didn't get us embroiled in Iraq. Let's emulate that restraint and wisdom.\\n\\nThere will always be strife and chaos in the Middle East due to the centuries-long Shiite-Sunni enmity. Our military presence there doesn't mitigate it; we are, in some ways, participants there and often end up sowing more discord and creating more terrorists.\\n\\nAnd of course there are the unforeseen, unintended consequences: Our Iraq misadventure ended up empowering Iran and imperiling the Christian minority in Iraq. Our Libyan fiasco ended up creating the refugee and migrant crisis affecting Europe.\\n\\nTo the American voter I'd humbly say: Think for yourself. Don't fall for the same tired drumbeats. Reject blind loyalty to party and ideology. Realize that on the issues of illegal immigration and war, especially, there are vested interests with ulterior motives pushing counterintuitive policies. Always keep America's interests in mind.\\n\\nSaritha Prabhu is a columnist for The Tennessean, where this column originally appeared."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — John Fox helped change the culture in the Chicago Bears' locker room.\\n\\nHe just didn't produce enough wins to keep his job.\\n\\nThe Bears fired Fox on Monday after three losing seasons, ending one of the least successful coaching stints in team history.\\n\\nToday is the tough part of our results-oriented business, he said in a statement.\\n\\nWhile Fox was let go after a 5-11 finish, general manager Ryan Pace got a contract extension through the 2021 season.\\n\\nWe think we have the right structure and we think we have the right people in those positions, chairman George McCaskey said.\\n\\nWe've seen some results in terms of player development and relying primarily on the draft for that development. We just haven't seen those results on the field in wins and we're looking forward to that.\\n\\nChicago has had four consecutive losing seasons — each with 10 or more losses. The Bears haven't finished above .500 since they let Lovie Smith go following a 10-6 finish in 2012. They haven't been to the playoffs since 2010.\\n\\nHired shortly after the Bears brought in Pace, Fox leaves with a 14-34 record in three seasons and a .292 winning percentage that ranks as the second lowest in franchise history.\\n\\nOnly Abe Gibron was worse — 11-30-1 (.274) from 1972-74.\\n\\nOur record is a reflection on me as well, Pace said. But I feel good about where we're at right now. I feel much better about where we're at right now than at this time last year and that starts with the quarterback position.\\n\\nPresident Ted Phillips apparently sees the same things.\\n\\nI see the young talent, he said. The locker room is a great atmosphere. The players believe in themselves.\\n\\nPace said the Bears had not officially asked permission to interview other teams' assistants and that they're open to coaches with offensive or defensive backgrounds. He would not say if Vic Fangio is in the running or if he hopes to retain him as defensive coordinator.\\n\\nPace would not say, either, roughly how many candidates he hopes to interview or what traits he's seeking in a coach.\\n\\nThough McCaskey and Phillips will have input, Pace made it clear the decision on the coach is his. He also said he will continue to have final say on the roster.\\n\\nThe next coach will have to get the most out of Mitchell Trubisky. After all, Pace staked his reputation to the quarterback when he traded up a spot with San Francisco to draft him with the No. 2 overall pick last spring.\\n\\nFox is 133-123 in 16 seasons as a head coach and is one of six coaches to lead two teams to Super Bowl appearances, joining Don Shula, Bill Parcells, Dan Reeves, Dick Vermeil and Mike Holmgren.\\n\\nFox helped orchestrate quick turnarounds while leading Carolina and Denver to a combined six division titles and seven playoff appearances in 13 years before he took over Chicago in January 2015. But his time with the Bears was forgettable.\\n\\nFox helped restore some of the professionalism that was missing under former GM Phil Emery and coach Marc Trestman. But Fox's conservative approach and some questionable decisions during games were sore spots.\\n\\nThe Bears were 3-15 against the NFC North and dropped all six division games this past season.\\n\\nI think he built a foundation, linebacker Sam Acho said. I think the success that he had here, we're not going to see until later. Whether I'm on this team or not, I think you're going to see success in the future.\\n\\nCornerback Prince Amukamara said there were plenty of hugs for Fox when he met with the team Monday.\\n\\nGreat, passionate coach, he said. Didn't give up on us, didn't quit on us and that's very special for a head coach.\\n\\nInjuries exposing a lack of depth have been a major issue since the regime change.\\n\\nPace has had some big hits in the draft such as star running back Jordan Howard (2016, fifth round) and notable misses such as oft-injured receiver Kevin White (2015, first round).\\n\\nHis record in free agency is shaky, and he has struggled to replace some talented players no longer with the team such as receivers Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery, tight end Martellus Bennett and kicker Robbie Gould.\\n\\nThe Bears will need to bring in play-making receivers. But with the presence of Trubisky, Howard and running back Tarik Cohen and a promising defense led by end Akiem Hicks, tackle Eddie Goldman and linebacker Leonard Floyd, Pace insisted the team is in a better spot than it was three years ago. He also feels more comfortable in his position.\\n\\nI feel very comfortable in my shoes, I feel very confident, and I have a lot of good people and a lot of resources around me to help me attack this, Pace said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://pro32.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Pulling off what once seemed incomprehensible given the adversity and turmoil that plagued the organization throughout the year, the Washington Football Team clinched the NFC East title by defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 20-14 Sunday night.\\n\\nIn so doing, 7-9 Washington punched its playoff ticket, returning to the postseason for the first time since 2015. Washington also became only the fifth team in NFL history to win a division with a losing record.\\n\\nOn Saturday, Washington hosts Tampa Bay, and its players and coaches will see if they can extend good fortunes further despite being early 7-point home underdogs.\\n\\nSunday night, in a performance befitting of the NFC East's 2020 season, Washington did not at all win pretty against the host Eagles. There were ups and downs, maddening miscues, and some elements of the night proved down right confounding.\\n\\nMore:32 things we learned from Week 17 of the 2020 NFL season\\n\\nMore:NFL releases schedule for wild-card playoff games; Colts-Bills to kick off 'Super Wild Card Weekend'\\n\\nWashington mustered only three second-half points. And quarterback Alex Smith, who recorded two first-half touchdowns, threw third- and fourth-quarter interceptions, putting additional pressure on a defense that has carried the team all season.\\n\\nBut even more perplexing was Philadelphia coach Doug Pederson's decision to seemingly wave the white flag at the start of the fourth quarter and bench promising rookie quarterback Jalen Hurts in favor of third-stringer Nate Sudfeld despite trailing by only three points. The move angered veteran members of the team and frustrated members of the New York Giants, who needed a Philadelphia victory to secure the division title instead of Washington.\\n\\nBut despite the oddities and season as a whole, the night still belonged to Washington. The players brought to fruition the vision their first-year head coach held for them even when they opened the year 1-4.\\n\\nSo, it was fitting Washington couldn't run away with the victory despite facing an Eagles squad that entered the game 4-10-1. Nothing about Washington's season has come easy. But victory did come.\\n\\nIt's just a testament to the guys in the room and the character that Rivera is building here, second-year pro Montez Sweat said. It's the culture. It's a winning culture, it's a hungry culture and everybody's holding each other accountable. That's got us heading in the right direction. … It's all the guys buying in. Everybody's playing for the guy next to them.\\n\\nAs was the case throughout their turnaround, the team on Sunday leaned heavily on the three key figures: Rivera, Smith and rookie pass-rusher Chase Young, who have served as the catalysts for change and beacons of hope amidst the longest of odds and bleakest of circumstances.\\n\\nIf any team in the league this season received a full-on dose of adversity, it was Washington.\\n\\n-- The COVID-19-induced challenges of a new coaching staff trying to install its system without offseason practices or even face-to-face meetings with players until late July.\\n\\n-- Off-field controversies - the forced abandonment of the long-time nickname, allegations of rampant organizational sexual harassment and misconduct, and bitter legal battles between owner Daniel Snyder and his partners - have hung over the squad much of the offseason and regular season.\\n\\n-- A cancer diagnosis for Rivera, and seven in-season weeks of chemo treatments, which forced him to miss meetings and practices.\\n\\n-- The early-season benching of anticipated franchise quarterback Dwayne Haskins after a 1-3 start to the season.\\n\\n-- The season-ending injury to his replacement, Kyle Allen, who followed Rivera to Washington from Carolina and was supposed to give the team a boost thanks to his familiarity with the offense.\\n\\n-- A momentum-killing calf strain to Smith after four straight victories.\\n\\n-- A second failed Haskins stint marred by poor play and off-field judgement and his subsequent release last week.\\n\\nSo, the pressure of Sunday night's win-or-go home game against Philadelphia actually brought a welcomed element of simplicity.\\n\\nFor once, only football mattered.\\n\\nThroughout this season of calamity, Rivera and Smith served as testimonies of inspiration for a young locker room; Rivera with his bout with cancer, and Smith with his comeback from the gruesome 2018 injury that threatened his football career, his leg and his life and required 17 surgeries to correct.\\n\\nThe coach and quarterback also helped stabilize this unproven roster and helped its players navigate a challenging season, block out the drama and overcome deficiencies in the areas of experience and talent.\\n\\nRivera regularly used the acronym APE to get his message across, reminding his players that attitude, preparation and effort were the only things in their control individually and collectively.\\n\\nHe also stressed it's not how you start, but how you finish. He repeatedly pointed to his 2014 Panthers team that rebounded from a 3-7-1 start to win the NFC South with a 7-8-1 record and reach the playoffs.\\n\\nWashington's players began to buy in and in their words, learn how to win.\\n\\nSmith, meanwhile, sparked a struggling offense with his experience, consistency and poise. In Smith, Washington had a quarterback strong on ball security and an ability to position teammates for success. Washington's offense certainly still had its issues, however, Smith's impact elevated the unit to a level of competitiveness.\\n\\nMeanwhile, a young, talent-rich defensive front solidified in the second half of the season with first-round pick Chase Young leading the way.\\n\\nYoung, the second overall pick out of Ohio State, showed signs in the season opener (also against Philly) of the impact he could have as a one-man wrecking crew and as someone who could command double-teams and free up teammates to make plays.\\n\\nYoung hit a rough patch midway through the season while dealing with a hip injury, but after regaining his health, he roared to life. In the final six weeks of play, Young recorded three sacks, two forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and a touchdown. And his teammates fed off of his energy. He also commanded such respect that he was added to the team's roster of co-captains in the final weeks of the season.\\n\\nSunday night against the Eagles, Washington's three new pillars again delivered.\\n\\nDespite the second-half struggles, Washington continued to reflect the resolve of its coach rather than fold as the franchise's fans have witnessed in previous years.\\n\\nSmith wasn't spectacular, but he again paced an offense that made just enough key plays to get the job done while benefiting from the backing of a strong defense anchored by Young and his two tackles, sack and a fumble recovery.\\n\\nSo, despite the ugly patches of the game, and Pederson's perplexing decision, Washington's players worried not about style points but pushed through and prevailed.\\n\\nIt speaks way more to the team, the character we have, Smith said. Everything that was stacked against, going through the offseason, new coaching staff, all the changes, all the COVID stuff, and for us to get off to a slow start like we did and find a way to battle back and then finish it off like this, it says a lot about the character we have in the locker room. Good or bad, those guys come to work and we put in the effort.\\n\\nComing off the field, Young jubilantly yelled that he and his teammates are ready for Tom Brady, whom they'll host with his Bucs on Saturday. But after the locker room celebration, a more subdued and reflective Young went back onto the field to take in the lingering atmosphere while FaceTiming his mother.\\n\\nI just had to take it in, being a rookie, he said. I'll never get that back. I can never re-run that. So, I had to go back out there and take it all in. … It's just a brotherhood, just a love for one another. I remember when we were 1-4. But we're not done though. We're not done. … We're still on go."}

He told Fox News that he was working in total coordination with the White House on impeachment, which drew immediate criticism, including from several Republican senators.\\n\\nOn Friday, McConnell said the Senate's job is to be deeply engaged with issues and the news and that their job does not change with impeachment, noting each senator has a responsibility to their constituents, their country and the future.\\n\\nThe oath that senators take in impeachment trials — to 'do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws' — has never meant that senators should wall themselves off from the biggest news story in the nation and completely ignore what the House has been doing, McConnell argued.

A number of reports over the last several weeks have raised questions about the Trump administration's actions with Ukraine as the president asked the country for a number of investigations that could help him politically. The president's dealings with Ukraine were the focus of his impeachment.\\n\\nThe trial must be informed by the evidence, Schumer said Friday, arguing new witnesses and documents should be called for at the start, not after the trial has started.\\n\\nHe noted that it may seem we are no closer to an agreement on the procedures for a trial but said if there are no witnesses called, the Senate will act as little more than a nationally televised meeting of the mock trial club.\\n\\nIf the two leaders do not come to an agreement on how the trial should run, a majority of senators could pass a measure that outlines the process and procedures.

About two-thirds of government spending is for benefits such as Medicare and Social Security, which are unaffected by shutdowns. Also unaffected are the jobs of federal workers considered essential.\\n\\nLessening the impact even further, Congress did manage to pass a measure financing the Pentagon, the Department of Health and Human Services and several other large agencies.\\n\\nNone of this should obscure the fact that this shutdown is both destructive and inane, perhaps more so because Congress, President Donald Trump and even much of the American public seem inured to these periodic events.\\n\\nThe shutdown is affecting a number of loan programs from the Small Business Administration and other agencies.

But he beat a hasty retreat when he started coming under attack from hard-line conservative pundits and power brokers.\\n\\nTrump has been seeking $5 billion for the wall; Democrats have been offering $1.3 billion for border security. A deal in this case would not be difficult to envision, as the numbers involved are dwarfed by the $3.8 trillion budget.\\n\\nIdeally, in return for the Democrats meeting him partway on border security, Trump would agree to end his policy of threatening Dreamers — young adults who were brought here illegally as children — with deportation once their court protection ends.\\n\\nThis fight over border funding, however, has larger overtones that might stand in the way of a quick resolution. Wednesday's meeting at the White House with congressional leaders ended with no signs of progress.\\n\\nDemocrats, who take control of the House on Thursday, are happy to finally be in the position of being able to say no to Trump and want to display that power to their rank-and-file voters. They plan to offer a measure funding the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8 and the rest of the government for the remainder of the fiscal year.\\n\\nTrump, meanwhile, has spent his first two years catering to his base and ignoring or insulting just about everyone else. He does not appear inclined to change that now.\\n\\nThis leaves much of the country wondering when this desultory fight over a relatively small matter will come to an end. From the looks of things, the answer is: not very soon.\\n\\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page."}
{"original": "Marilyn J. Mosby and Kimberly Foxx\\n\\nOpinion contributors\\n\\nLamar Johnson, 45, has spent more than half of his life behind bars. And now, even though there is overwhelming evidence of his innocence, he remains incarcerated.\\n\\nLast month, the Missouri Court of Appeals heard arguments on Johnson's motion for a new trial, one that prosecutor, St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner, championed. The court dismissed Johnson's motion, but it recognized the importance of the issues presented in this case and agreed to transfer it to the Missouri Supreme Court.\\n\\nIn July, the Conviction Integrity Unit in Gardner's office found that Johnson's conviction was obtained through the false testimony of an eyewitness who later recanted and was secretly paid by the state. Elected prosecutors from around the country are closely following Johnson's case because its outcome affects us all.\\n\\nAs prosecutors, our discretion to address past miscarriages is at stake. More important, keeping an innocent man in prison does nothing to protect the public. It also, as so aptly stated in the CIU report, corrodes public confidence in the justice system.\\n\\nCounting convictions doesn't bring justice\\n\\nA prosecutor's job is not about a win-loss record or counting convictions. It's about seeking justice and promoting safe and healthy communities. We run for office because we are committed to justice for victims of crime and to changing a system that has failed individuals, families and communities — especially poor, black and brown communities — for far too long. While in office, we learn that there is no more tragic example of this failure than a person imprisoned for a crime he did not commit.\\n\\nProsecutors must be able to look back and seek to remedy cases where injustices occurred. Overturning wrongful convictions is an essential duty.\\n\\nIt's clear that the system failed Johnson.\\n\\nIn 1994, he was convicted of a murder that prosecutors now agree he had nothing to do with. The two men responsible for the crime have since confessed. The system robbed Johnson of approximately 25 years of his life. His two daughters were forced to grow up without him.\\n\\nCOLUMN:A year out, First Step is powerful example for states of bipartisan criminal justice reform\\n\\nTragedies like Johnson's are sadly all too common in our legal system, the inevitable casualties of a failed tough-on-crime playbook that for too long prioritized winning at all costs over seeking justice.\\n\\nGardner has taken a different approach and filed a motion for a new trial. She has faced resistance from the lower court and Missouri's attorney general, who pushed the judge to bar Johnson from having his case decided on its merits, in spite of the newly discovered evidence of his innocence.\\n\\nIt is hard to imagine what interest the court or the attorney general has in preventing this case from being decided on the merits. But what is clear is that when a prosecutor's discretion to seek a new trial for an innocent man is threatened — as Gardner's has been — it compounds the failure that caused Johnson's conviction in the first place.\\n\\nLimiting prosecutorial discretion will continue to make it more difficult for other wrongfully convicted men and women to present evidence of innocence. And it makes it harder for prosecutors to fulfill the ethical responsibility to address past harms, to restore integrity in our system and rebuild fractured bonds of trust with our communities.\\n\\nIn more ways than one, a history of struggle\\n\\nGardner isn't alone. Just as the system disproportionately prosecutes men of color, it has a history of dismissing efforts of black female prosecutors, like Gardner, who try to right past wrongs.\\n\\nCOLUMN:Attorney General Barr wrong about role of prosecutors. Tough-on-crime stance stunts progress\\n\\nWhen I (Mosby), as Baltimore state's attorney, lobbied to introduce legislation that would eliminate hundreds of wrongful convictions caused by the actions of corrupt police officers, the Maryland State's Attorneys' Association vehemently came out against me, going so far as testifying against the legislation.\\n\\nAfter my co-author Kimberly Foxx, state's attorney for Cook County, Illinois, made a motion to overturn dozens of convictions tainted by coerced police interrogations, the local police union lambasted her as someone harboring anti-police sentiment.\\n\\nDistrict Attorney Rachael Rollins of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, pledged to focus on prosecuting violent crimes and diverting nonviolent matters to treatment and restoration programs. For that, the president of the National Police Association said Rollins had incited ... illegal conduct, and the group filed a complaint with the bar association.\\n\\nBlack and brown communities want and deserve long overdue changes to the justice system. A few moments of resistance cannot be a deterrent for that change.\\n\\nProsecutors' obligation to correct injustices in our system is not at odds with our commitment to victims. But the resistance we face when fulfilling this duty is at odds with public safety.\\n\\nPOLICING THE USA:A look at race, justice, media\\n\\nTo keep communities safe, we must protect the integrity of every conviction so individuals trust our system and will cooperate with law enforcement to solve crimes. We also need to hold law enforcement accountable at all levels so innocent people are not at risk of being convicted as a result of fabricated evidence.\\n\\nOf all our duties, the obligation to protect the integrity of the justice system is the most imperative, and we must get it right. For Johnson, that means the people and systems working against Gardner need to let her do her job.\\n\\nMarilyn J. Mosby is the Baltimore state's attorney. Kimberly Foxx is the state's attorney for Cook County, Illinois.\\n\\nProsecutors Rachael Rollins, Aramis Ayala, Stephanie N. Morales, Diana Becton, Sherry Boston, Aisha N. Braveboy, Satana T.

Having to hop back and forth from the states to Europe and back again, there's not a lot of that going on which is a good thing. My focus has always been the biggest events in the world since I got into that top-50, but even more so now because of wanting to travel less and wanting to spend more time at home.\\n\\nMcIlroy is in Hawaii this week for the Sentry Tournament of Champions, the first time he's committed to the event. Usually he would play a few times in the Middle East, but his schedule was always light to start the year.\\n\\nThat's another change he's making in 2019 after feeling like he was always playing catch-up once his PGA Tour schedule ramped up.\\n\\nEvery time I show up to the start of the year on the PGA Tour, other guys have played nearly 10 events and I'm sort of playing my first or my second one. So I wanted to try and start a little bit early, get a few more starts under my belt before the big bulk of the season kicks in.\\n\\nHe wasn't eligible for last year's Tournament of Champions at Kapalua's Plantation Course following a winless and injury-riddled 2017. He bounced back early last year with a dominant putting performance to take home the Arnold Palmer Invitational. The rest of the year included seven top-10s and a few close calls, including runner-up finishes at the Dubai Desert Classic, BMW PGA Championship and British Open.\\n\\nMcIlroy knows he needs to do better on the greens to get back to an elite level. He finished 97th in strokes gained putting last season.\\n\\nReally my 15-20 feet range is what I need to work on if you look at the stats from last year, McIlroy said. It was really my speed. My speed wasn't very good from that range. I was leaving myself sort of three and four-footers coming back a lot, which is maybe partly a mental thing but also a physical sort of stroke thing and not hitting it out of the center of the putter all the time.\\n\\nOtherwise McIlroy's game feels good, and he put in a lot of video work over the offseason. But he knows the real test starts this week in his Tournament of Champions debut.\\n\\nThe way I've played out there the last few days has been good, but I guess you never really know until you tee it up, McIlroy said."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Forced to assess the 2017 season far sooner than anticipated, Ravens coach John Harbaugh acknowledged changes must be made for Baltimore to snap its three-year run missing the playoffs.\\n\\nHe will not, however, shuffle the coaching staff.\\n\\nHarbaugh will fill the void left by the retirement of defensive coordinator Dean Pees, but said Thursday he will bring back offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg and attempt to keep the rest of the staff intact unless guys get opportunities to go somewhere and do some different things.\\n\\nPees announced his retirement Monday, less than 24 hours after the Ravens (9-7) were bounced from the playoff chase with a 31-27 loss to Cincinnati.\\n\\nThe in-house contender for the coordinator job is Ravens linebackers coach Don Martindale. Chuck Pagano, fired as head coach of the Indianapolis Colts on Monday and Baltimore's defensive coordinator in 2011, is also among those being considered.\\n\\nAsked to describe what he's looking for from Pees' successor, Harbaugh replied: Definitely continuity. I'm a believer in this system. I think this system has been something that's been developed over a long period of time, and we have worked really hard every single year to make it better. We've evolved it and grown it, and I think you see the results.\\n\\nThe Ravens have long been known for their defense, and this year that unit was the strength of the team. Baltimore recorded three shutouts, led the NFL with 34 takeaways and ranked 12th in yardage allowed.\\n\\nThe offense, on the other hand, needs help. Harbaugh lauded the performance of quarterback Joe Flacco , who rebounded from a back injury to come on strong during the Ravens' late-season playoff push.\\n\\nBut the coach was unrelenting in his assessment of the wide receivers, noting that there were too many dropped passes and far too few big plays from a unit built around veterans Mike Wallace and Jeremy Maclin and featuring 2015 draft pick Breshad Perriman, who is thus far a first-round bust. Baltimore ranked 29th in net yards passing per game (189.4).\\n\\nThat's an area we've got to look at really hard,, Harbaugh said. The passing game wasn't where it needed to be.\\n\\nTight end Benjamin Watson led the team with 61 catches and six touchdowns. Wallace and Maclin combined for only seven scores, and Baltimore had only five catches of at least 40 yards.\\n\\nWe want to get playmakers. That's something that we need, Harbaugh said. We're going to add players. It's not to say that we can't add some players through free agency. That's the way that the salary cap works. The draft will be the major part of it.\\n\\nCovering a variety of topics in a session that lasted nearly 40 minutes, Harbaugh said he and owner Steve Bisciotti, along with general manager Ozzie Newsome, are looking forward to improving upon a three-year stretch in which the team has gone 5-11, 8-8 and 9-7.\\n\\nOur focus is on, can we be better tomorrow than we were today? And that's just the truth of it, Harbaugh said. To me, that's our focus. It's not looking back and saying, 'Hey, we didn't do this or we didn't do that.' Everybody is full speed ahead to be the best we can be, and has been for the last three years.\\n\\nHad Cincinnati's Andy Dalton not thrown a 49-yard touchdown pass on a fourth-down play with 44 seconds left, the Ravens would have spent this week preparing for the playoffs amid a city bathed in purple. Instead, Harbaugh was left trying to appease a fan-base that responded to mediocrity and the team's take-a-knee stance during the national anthem on Sept. 24 by staying away in record numbers on Sundays.\\n\\nWe understand our fans. We understand what they respect, Harbaugh said. And we want nothing more than to get it there, so we can have that moment, we can complete that pass and we can have the whole city going crazy and dancing in the streets. That's what we're fighting for.\\n\\nI wanted it to happen this year. I wanted it to be the miracle year this year. Maybe we could have done it, and then all of a sudden, it's not to be. OK, are we going to lament it and look back and beat ourselves up, find reasons that aren't there and point fingers? That's not what I'm going to do. That's not what leaders do. Let's go to work.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "If you think one bad season is going to force the New Jersey Devils to reverse course and rethink their entire rebuilding strategy, think again.\\n\\nThe club announced a multi-year contract extension for coach John Hynes on Thursday, showing a vote of confidence in the second-winningest coach in franchise history.\\n\\nJohn's leadership has been instrumental in building both culture and systems that are focused on the development of our players, Devils general manager Ray Shero said in a statement.\\n\\nHe has cultivated a group of veteran leaders, while helping our young players develop and gain experience. John is to be commended for the progress the team has made under his direction and this commitment shows that we are confident in the role he will play in our future success.\\n\\nThe terms of the contract were not released.\\n\\nThe 43-year-old Warwick, Rhode Island, native led the Devils to their first Stanley Cup playoffs appearance in five seasons in 2017-18. New Jersey was eliminated by the Tampa Bay Lightning in five games in the opening round but the fanbase had hope for the first time.\\n\\nThat hope, however, quickly vanished as the team dropped to the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings this season. Fans were lobbying for former Chicago Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville, the uncle of Devils' forward John, to take over for Hynes, but the team never seriously considered replacing him.\\n\\nLast month, Shero spoke to beat writers for the first time since training camp and gave Hynes a vote of confidence, saying he wanted a coach who could grow with the team.\\n\\nShero indicated that he's seen the growth under Hynes and felt he was still the right coach to lead the Devils, despite the team's drop-off this season.\\n\\nShero pointed to Hynes' leadership, ability to motivate players and his development background as a former American Hockey League head coach. The GM also lauded the culture Hynes had created and said firing him would undo all of the progress.\\n\\nI wanted to hire the right coach for the right team and this was the team I saw, Shero said in December. It wasn't a situation I wanted to get into where it's three years and that's it.\\n\\nThe club's ownership group, led by managing partners Joshua Harris and David Blitzer, have made it known they are behind Shero and Hynes and their mission to build the Devils into a contender from within. They're willing to be patient.\\n\\nJohn has been an important part of the progress we have made toward our ultimate objective of competing at the highest level in the league year in and year out, Harris said. We have been impressed with John's leadership ever since he became a first-time NHL head coach with the New Jersey Devils three years ago. He is a fantastic teacher and mentor, qualities which have served the organization well in developing our young talent. His ability to communicate and connect with players has helped define our culture and inspire those around him to be their best.\\n\\nBlitzer added: John's passion for excellence on and off the ice is a critical building block for all that we hope to accomplish as an organization. John is representative of who we are and what we look to become. His commitment to help create an organization that is respected by our competitors and admired by our fans is essential to us.\\n\\nHynes, now in his fourth season, has guided the Devils to a 125-122-38 record (.505 winning percentage). The Boston University product also served as head coach for Team USA during the 2016 IIHF World Championships and was an assistant coach at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey.\\n\\nTaylor Hall blossomed into an MVP under Hynes, becoming the club's first Hart Trophy winner in 2018. Nico Hischier, the first overall pick in the 2017 draft, became a top-line center at just 18 years old under Hynes and he was integral in the development of goalie Keith Kinkaid.\\n\\nThe mission in Newark is clear: Build for the long haul. They don't want to win a Stanley Cup only to be right back where they were when Shero and crew were hired in 2015, toiling in obscurity.\\n\\nThe fanbase may be upset with the club's decision to soldier on with a coach without a winning pedigree, while championship coaches such as Quenneville and Darryl Sutter remain unemployed. But the key decision-makers have made it clear they don't see those coaches as the right ones for this job.\\n\\nThis job belongs to Hynes, and the organization remains steadfast in his ability to lead the Devils to success.\\n\\nWe've established a standard in New Jersey of what we expect: How we act, how we practice and how we play, Hynes said. Throughout my time here, the management, scouts, coaches, players and support staff have worked tirelessly to create this culture. We will continue to instill in our team the tenets of grit, compete and being a self-starter, as we build this brotherhood.\\n\\nI appreciate the confidence Josh, David and Ray have shown in me from Day One, and know that the entire organization is pulling in the right direction.\\n\\nMore NJ Devils news\\n\\nDevils:What Mackenzie Blackwood can learn from NJ Devils' loss to Stars\\n\\nTaylor Hall:Devil named as NHL All-Star\\n\\n5 NJ Devils' storylines to watch in 2019:Goaltending, Taylor Hall and John Hynes\\n\\nHow they line up:NJ Devils change defensive pairings ahead of tilt with Stars"}
{"original": "The Editorial Board\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nAs Democrats prepare for the 2020 presidential election cycle, they are full of eager anticipation, if not outright confidence.\\n\\nAnd why shouldn't they be? Notwithstanding his continuing strong support from Republicans, Donald Trump is the most unpopular president in the history of polling, with an average approval stuck in the low 40s. While previous presidents have dipped below him for brief moments, none has stayed so low for so long. Trump has not once reached an average approval of 50 percent.\\n\\nSome of his biggest weaknesses, moreover, are with independents and voters in the Midwestern states that elected him in 2016. In Michigan, Democrats just won the aggregate vote for the U.S. House of Representatives by seven percentage points and the governorship by nearly 10 points. They took three of four House seats in Iowa, a state that swung heavily to Trump in 2016.\\n\\nAdding yet more to Democrats' optimism is Trump's penchant for putting himself in untenable positions, like the one he is in over border wall funding. He can either infuriate his base by compromising or alienate pretty much everyone else by continuing a cruel, unpopular government shutdown.\\n\\nMOVEON:2020 nominee must be unapologetically progressive\\n\\nYet for all of this, and for all of the legal peril that Trump faces, the Democrats could blow it.\\n\\nThey could do so by nominating someone so far to the left that he or she could lose much of the swing vote and be cast as a liberal version of Trump. If Democrats really want to rid the nation of Trump, assuming he is on the ballot in 2020, they should consider their options carefully.\\n\\nThis is not to say Democrats should avoid issues such as climate change or immigration reform that Trump and his enablers have tried to marginalize.\\n\\nIt does mean that, at a time when the national debt is approaching $22 trillion, Democrats should steer clear of unaffordable government solutions to problems such as education and health care. They should also avoid hewing too closely to identity politics or the rigid liberalism of college campuses.\\n\\nConsider what worked for them in November. Democrats owe their new House majority less to the celebrity liberals getting so much attention than to enterprising moderates such as Abigail Spanberger in Virginia and Colin Allred in Texas.\\n\\nA relatively uncontroversial Democrat could win the next presidential election if he or she appeals to moderates, comes across as sane and competent, proposes practical solutions, and is competitive in key battleground states such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\\n\\nFor Democrats to choose a nominee on the far left bank of the political mainstream would cement their reputation as the party that never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\\n\\nIf you can't see this reader poll, please refresh your page."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) — Game-planning sessions can get a little dry sometimes for the Green Bay Packers.\\n\\nNot lately, not with coach Mike McCarthy and quarterback Aaron Rodgers in that same meeting to spice things up — both on and off the field.\\n\\nThe Packers are coming off their most impressive offensive outburst in a while after beating the Washington Redskins 35-18 in an NFC wild-card game on Sunday. Rodgers has been more involved in planning of late and don't expect the routine to change as the Packers prepare to visit the Arizona Cardinals in the divisional round this weekend.\\n\\nSo Aaron's been very much involved the last couple weeks. That's fun having him in the room, McCarthy said Monday. Once you get the head coach back in the room, the meetings go an hour longer. And then you get the quarterback in there, now they're two hours longer.\\n\\nThe hard work has paid off.\\n\\nThe Packers shook off a sluggish first quarter and 11-0 deficit to race past the Redskins on the road. The offensive line performed well, running backs Eddie Lacy and James Starks each had touchdown runs, and the receivers created big plays.\\n\\nRodgers was back in rhythm, enjoying every minute. A TV camera even caught a light moment when the giddy Rodgers walked up behind McCarthy and put two hands on the coach's shoulders.\\n\\nIt sure didn't look like there was any friction between the coach and quarterback, which has been a popular topic of speculation during an offensively-challenged season.\\n\\nYeah, I mean I don't see it the way it's perceived, McCarthy said. So I enjoy our relationship and 'it's great that everybody got to see some good clips' is my answer.\\n\\nAfter handing play-calling duties to associate head coach Tom Clements at the start of the season, McCarthy took the responsibilities back in Week 14 against Dallas. There was a promising win against the Cowboys, but results since then were mixed — until the convincing victory over Washington.\\n\\nA playoff win means even more after Green Bay ended the regular season with two straight losses.\\n\\nI talked a lot the last couple of weeks about being able to turn it on and a lot of you probably thought that was lip service, Rodgers told reporters after the game, but we just needed a game like this to get our mojo back and got our confidence going.\\n\\nFirst, they need a little rest. The Packers weren't going to return to the practice field until Wednesday, though planning meetings for the Cardinals game have begun.\\n\\nRodgers' involvement isn't entirely new, since he's usually around on off days when coaches are putting together the game plan, though it appears that he might be a little more involved.\\n\\nOffensive coordinator Edgar Bennett spoke highly of Rodgers' football mind. McCarthy said Rodgers asks good questions, and questions are important in those meetings, because it can be dry ... But it's good to go in there and make sure you hash it out.\\n\\nWhatever the reasons behind the rejuvenated offense, the Packers are feeling much better about themselves than this time last week.\\n\\nThe team talked earlier last week about taking on an underdog mentality before McCarthy decided to scrap that theme. For all of their struggles in the regular season, the Packers still know what it takes to win.\\n\\nI get what people are saying. We're not going to be an underdog. We're no underdog going to Arizona. I don't care what people think or how we're picked or things like that. We're going out there to win, and we expect to win, McCarthy said.\\n\\nNOTES: McCarthy wasn't sure yet whether the team would love Thursday night or Friday for Arizona, and whether the Packers would hold their final practice of the week on the road. ... The team returned from the relatively warm Washington area, where the temperature at game time was 61 degrees on Sunday, to sub-zero wind chills in Green Bay in the evening. The Packers had a nice surprise waiting when they got back into town. Getting home, the guys from the equipment room had our cars warmed up, so it was nice to come home to minus-5 and have your car running, McCarthy said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nOnline:\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Matt Patricia said it in his end-of-season news conference this week: His goal, the Detroit Lions' goal, is to field a championship contender. But judging by what happened on the field this year, he's a long way away.\\n\\nThe Lions, in Patricia's first season as head coach, took two giant steps backwards. They lost 10 games for the first time since 2012, they finished in last place in the NFC North and they experienced some disturbing regression from their $135-million quarterback, Matthew Stafford.\\n\\nCertainly, there are legitimate reasons for some of the Lions' struggles. The defense was slow adapting to a new system, and when it finally came around, the offense was decimated by injuries.\\n\\nBut no one wants to hear excuses, and Patricia is not the type to make any.\\n\\nI think the teams that win consistently, play and prepare consistently every week, he said. They improve and they have a good toughness about the way that they approach their way to win. I think the teams that don't, beat themselves with bad football, penalties, turnovers, mistakes and just fundamentals that aren't up to par. So, I think we had a season that was a mix of both. I think we had some good weeks and we had some bad weeks, and the truth is, that's what our season was.\\n\\nMore:Matt Patricia now out of excuses after dismissing Jim Bob Cooter\\n\\nThe Lions do have two promising young building blocks in Kerryon Johnson and Kenny Golladay, and the interior of their defensive line should be a strength going forward. But their lack of playmakers was evident on both sides of the ball, and a big reason they lost six times by double digits.\\n\\nOverall, it was a disappointing season, and this year's final grades reflect as much.\\n\\nQuarterback\\n\\nStatistically, Stafford had one of the worst seasons of his career. He threw for just 3,777 yards, averaged a paltry 6.8 yards per attempt and had bouts of turnovers that cost his team in losses to the New York Jets, Seattle Seahawks and Chicago Bears.\\n\\nStafford threw four interceptions against the Jets, four in two games against the Bears and had just three the rest of the season as the Lions tried hard to give their quarterback high-percentage throws. Stafford played the final month through a back injury, but the Lions had no real deep passing game to speak of long before that.\\n\\nStafford was at his best in a Week 17 win over the Green Bay Packers, and he was sharp in early-season wins over the New England Patriots (when he completed 12 of his first 13 passes) and Miami Dolphins (when he had a 138.1 passer rating). But he couldn't manufacture any of the late-game heroics he has been so synonymous with over his career, and he'll enter 2019 with a new offensive coordinator and a fan base that's more skeptical of his play than ever.\\n\\nGrade: C-minus\\n\\nRunning backs\\n\\nHe only lasted 10 games because of a knee injury, but Johnson, the rookie second-round pick out of Auburn, was the Lions' offensive MVP this year. Johnson finished with 641 yards rushing and three touchdowns, and he ranked among the NFL leaders with a 5.4-yard-per-carry average. He had 100-yard rushing games against the Patriots and Dolphins, and lost just one fumble in 150 touches.\\n\\nMore:Kerryon Johnson: I could have played in playoff game this week\\n\\nThe Lions' biggest problem with their running game was that they didn't let Johnson touch the ball more this year. LeGarrette Blount opened the season as the starter, and he was supremely ineffective. Blount scored five touchdowns to earn a $350,000 bonus, but he averaged a career-low 2.7 yards per carry and looks like he's on his last legs as a player.\\n\\nMore:Lions offense won't change dramatically in 2019. Here's why\\n\\nTheo Riddick caught 61 passes, second most on the team, but his snaps would have been better going to Johnson, too. Riddick no longer strikes fear in opposing defenses as he averaged just 6.3 yards a catch. Zach Zenner was the Lions' second most effective back. He did an admirable job closing out a December win against the Arizona Cardinals, had 123 yards from scrimmage in Week 17 against the Packers and earned himself a roster spot somewhere in the NFL next year.\\n\\nGrade: C-plus\\n\\nWide receivers/tight ends\\n\\nIn his second NFL season, Golladay emerged as a borderline No. 1 receiver. He led the Lions with 70 catches and 1,063 yards, and he made too many spectacular plays to count. Golladay is so big and physical he can overpower most defensive backs, but he still disappeared for stretches of the season. In the Lions' first three games after the bye, he had just six catches. And he didn't score a touchdown after Thanksgiving, when the Lions' receiving corps was decimated by injury.\\n\\nGolden Tate was in the midst of another strong year as Stafford's trusted safety valve when the Lions traded him to the Philadelphia Eagles in October. The offense fell apart without Tate – the Lions allowed 16 sacks in their first two games without Tate as Stafford had nowhere to throw – and neither Brandon Powell nor Bruce Ellington was able to approximate his production.\\n\\nMarvin Jones had one big game, a seven-catch, 117-yard, two-touchdown day against the Seahawks, before a knee injury ended his season in November. Jones couldn't rekindle his deep connection with Stafford, and most everyone in the Lions' receiving corps struggled to win one-on-one matchups downfield. The Lions had arguably the worst group of tight ends in the NFL from a pass-catching perspective, though Levine Toilolo made some big grabs late in the season, Michael Roberts had a couple touchdowns and Toilolo and Luke Willson played a hand in the run game's success.\\n\\nGrade: C-minus\\n\\nOffensive line\\n\\nThe Lions' weren't terrible up front this season, but they weren't great, either. And given the investment they made in their offensive – two first-round picks, two high-priced free agents and a third-rounder – that's not good enough.\\n\\nT.J. Lang was the Lions' best offensive lineman when he was on the field, but he played just six games because of injuries. Kenny Wiggins, Lang's replacement, had some rough moments early, especially against Tom Johnson and the Vikings, but he settled down late in the season and made some key blocks in the run game. Rookie Frank Ragnow played all but one snap at left guard. He was inconsistent and got abused by All-Pro Aaron Donald, but he had enough good moments as a run blocker to think he can be a really good interior lineman one day.\\n\\nRick Wagner was a solid run blocker at right tackle, but I had him allowing a whopping 10.5 sacks as he struggled against all of the top pass rushers he faced (Danielle Hunter, Khalil Mack, DeMarcus Lawrence). Taylor Decker (4.5 sacks) was much better in pass protection on the left side and could be in line for a contract extension this offseason, but he had four drive-stalling penalties. And Graham Glasgow (nine penalties) seemed more comfortable in his first full season at center. The Lions were a better run-blocking unit overall this year, but the line's issues in pass protection were part of the reason Stafford couldn't take many shots downfield.\\n\\nGrade: C\\n\\nMore:5 fearless Lions 2019 predictions: One star traded, one stays\\n\\nDefensive line\\n\\nIt's not hyperbole to say the midseason acquisition of Damon Harrison changed the trajectory of not just the defensive line but the Lions' defense as a whole. Harrison made 50 tackles in 10 games in Detroit, had 3.5 sacks and helped transform the Lions from one of the NFL's worst run-stopping units (139.3 yards per game allowed before he arrived) to one of its best (92.5 ypg allowed after).\\n\\nHarrison had some help, of course. Da'Shawn Hand, a fourth-round pick out of Alabama, looks like a draft-day steal as he was solid against the run and a better pass rusher (three sacks) than anticipated. And A'Shawn Robinson, after a slow start to the season in which he was a healthy scratch for the opener, had his best year to date with 49 tackles and a number of big run stops. Both Hand and Robinson finished the season on IR with knee injuries.\\n\\nThe Lions tied for 11th in the NFL with 43 sacks, but their pass rush was non-existent for long stretches of games, especially from the defensive line. Romeo Okwara had a team-high 7.5 sacks, but many were of the coverage variety, and Ziggy Ansah once again had trouble staying on the field, though he was effective when healthy. Collectively, the group made too few splash plays early in the season, and the Lions' 102.7 passer rating allowed – third highest in the NFL – was partly a function of a lack of pressure up front.\\n\\nGrade: B-minus\\n\\nLinebackers\\n\\nThe Lions overhauled their linebacking corps last offseason, signing Devon Kennard and Christian Jones on the first day of free agency, and there's no doubt the group was better than in 2017. Kennard finished second on the team with seven sacks, though five came in the first five games. He was a solid edge-setter against the run, typically playing as a stand-up linebacker on the left side.\\n\\nJones' contributions were a little more imperceptible. He wasn't bad. He had 69 tackles and forced a fumble, but he didn't make many splash plays. Jones' best attribute is that he's a dependable tackler, but he had his struggles in coverage against the Vikings late in the season and the Bears.\\n\\nSecond-year linebacker Jarrad Davis is a bit of a lightning rod. He's a physical force who had some big moments and really nice games (against the Packers and Cardinals late in the season), but he also missed 17 tackles on the year, according to Pro Football Focus, and was front and center on some key mistakes. Davis had a costly offside penalty against the Bills and got beat in coverage for a back-breaking first down by Ezekiel Elliott, albeit that one on a tough play. He did emerge as a pass rusher (six sacks), and Eli Harold contributed as an edge rusher in limited snaps.\\n\\nGrade: C-plus\\n\\nDefensive backs\\n\\nDarius Slay is headed to his second straight Pro Bowl after another solid season. Slay wasn't as dominant as he was in 2017, but he had three interceptions and 17 pass breakups while typically shadowing the opposing team's No. 1 receiver. Safety Quandre Diggs (three INTs) was named a Pro Bowl alternate. Diggs had a pick-six in the opener and another interception in Week 17 and was probably the Lions' most consistent defensive back this year.\\n\\nNevin Lawson remains an underappreciated No. 2 cornerback. He doesn't have an interception in his career and was flagged 11 times this season, but he shut down Adam Thielen in early November and slid seamlessly inside to the slot cornerback spot when the Lions were juggling personnel in their secondary. Backup cornerbacks DeShawn Shead and Teez Tabor both had rough seasons, with Tabor getting benched for much of the year and Shead misplaying a Hail Mary against the Vikings. Undrafted rookie Michael Ford played well in his first couple games off practice squad, but was exposed the more he was on the field.\\n\\nGlover Quin, by his own account, had a disappointing season at safety. He missed a couple tackles he normally makes and did not have an interception for the first time since 2011. Quin looked like he lost a step this year, and the Lions gave rookie Tracy Walker more snaps as the season wore on. Walker played a limited role overall, but showed promise as Quin's potential replacement. He had one interception and a second called back by penalty.\\n\\nGrade: C-plus\\n\\nSpecial teams\\n\\nThere's no sugar-coating it, the Lions were terrible on special teams early in the season. I gave them an F in my midseason grades, and they were bad enough in coverage through the season's first two months, and impotent enough in the return game, that it got special-teams coordinator Joe Marciano fired.\\n\\nPunter Sam Martin was solid in the second half of the season as the Lions did a good job controlling field position. He netted just 39.2 yards per punt, but he landed 32 of his 74 punts inside the 20-yard line. Matt Prater made better than 85 percent of his field goals for the fourth straight season. Prater wasn't as good from distance this year (8 of 12 on 40-plus-yarders) as he was in seasons past, and he missed a potential game-winner against the Buffalo Bills, but he's still more reliable than most kickers around the league.\\n\\nPenalties were a constant issue in the kicking game, including one that wiped out a touchdown, and the Lions allowed one punt-return score (and nearly another) against the Jets. Jamal Agnew missed half the season with a knee injury, but didn't have a big impact as a returner when he was on the field. The Lions did execute a nice fake field goal for a touchdown in Week 17, but they also let Seahawks punter Michael Dickson run for a first down out of his own end zone.\\n\\nGrade: D\\n\\nCoaching\\n\\nPatricia and his staff did some good things this year. The defense showed marked improvement as the season went on, they put together smart game plans, as boring as they were, late in the season when they were short-handed on offense, and they executed a couple creative trick plays.\\n\\nBut by and large, the edge the Lions thought they'd gain from hiring Patricia as coach wasn't there. The season got off to a slow start in part because players didn't care for Patricia's ways, and they had too many no-show on gameday throughout the year. The Lions got blown out at home in their opener against the Jets, took three quarters off the next week against San Francisco and had their sloppiest day of the year in a November trip to Chicago.\\n\\nI think Patricia was mostly sensible with his game management, though the surprise onside kick attempt against the Rams was incongruous with an otherwise conservative game plan. I didn't like Patricia's timeout usage at the end of the first half in losses to the Seahawks and Bears, and the fact that coordinators Marciano and Jim Bob Cooter were let go speaks both to the job they did and to Patricia's ability to put together a staff. Patricia gets some leeway as a first-time head coach, but he better learn quickly from his mistakes because he'll be on the hot seat in 2019.\\n\\nGrade: D\\n\\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.

{"original": "WASHINGTON – Ominous statements from Washington and Tehran on Thursday highlighted the quandary President Donald Trump faces in confronting an increasingly aggressive Iran, even though Iran-backed protesters pulled back from their attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\\n\\nThe tensions were underscored when Defense Secretary Mike Esper warned that Iran might be planning additional military strikes on U.S. targets, just hours after a top Iranian military commander boasted that Tehran was not worried about the United States.\\n\\nWe have the power to break them several times over and are not worried, Revolutionary Guards Commander Brigadier General Hossein Salami said, according to Tasnim, a government-affiliated news outlet. We are not leading the country to war, but we are not afraid of any war.\\n\\nTrump and his top advisers have repeatedly touted their maximum pressure policy, a sanctions-driven campaign designed to isolate Tehran diplomatically and cripple the country economically.\\n\\nBut the recent clashes demonstrate that Iran has its own strategy, one that has proven remarkably effective. Iran's leaders, and its proxy forces in places like Iraq, remain willing and able to lash out at the U.S. – causing spikes in global oil prices, undermining American allies and threatening U.S. assets abroad.\\n\\nThey're showing our impotence, said Barbara Slavin, director of the Future of Iran Initiative at the Atlantic Council, a foreign policy think tank in Washington. This is maximum resistance to maximum pressure.\\n\\nThe embassy protest erupted Tuesday, two days after U.S. airstrikes hit Iranian-backed militia targets in Iraq and killed more than 25 people. The airstrikes were retaliation, U.S. officials said, for an Iranian-sponsored attack on an Iraqi base that killed an American civilian contractor and wounded American servicemen.\\n\\nSlavin and others said the U.S. response was counterproductive and demonstrates the dilemma Trump faces as he walks a tightrope between a war he doesn't want and capitulation his supporters would abhor.\\n\\nRisk of another strike?\\n\\nIran's attack on the Iraq base may well have been designed to goad the U.S. into striking inside Iraq, according to an analysis by Abbas Kadhim, an expert on Iraq who is also with the Atlantic Council.\\n\\nTehran got exactly what it wanted, he wrote in a post Wednesday.\\n\\nNow, he noted, Iraqi political leaders are condemning the U.S. reprisal and some are even calling for the withdrawal of American troops from that strategic country. Meanwhile, Iran is likely searching for yet another way to strike the U.S., as Esper hinted on Thursday.\\n\\nIn the dangerous stalemate between the US and Iran ... the US has to expect that Iran will react to any action by choosing another battlefield where the balance of power is more favorable, Gerard Araud, a former French ambassador to the U.S. and Israel, tweeted on Wednesday. We saw it in the Gulf, we are seeing it in Iraq.\\n\\nChants of 'Death to America'\\n\\nThe embassy attack in Baghdad – a confrontational move that prompted Trump to dispatch hundreds of additional U.S. troops to the region – immediately captured Washington's attention and revived memories of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. That standoff lasted 444 days and helped doom then-President Jimmy Carter's bid for re-election. As in 1979, the protesters in Baghdad this week shouted Death to America! and smashed their way into the diplomatic compound, setting fire to a reception area as U.S. combat helicopters swooped over the complex.\\n\\nImages from the scene at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad revealed extensive damage, showing a burned and charred reception area, smashed windows and vandalized rooms left behind by supporters and members of the Iranian-trained Hashed al-Shaabi military network, also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces. No deaths or serious injuries have been reported, and the embassy was not evacuated.\\n\\nThis week's tit-for-tat aggressions in Iraq are part of a broader campaign that stretches back to Trump's decision to withdraw in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal, a multilateral agreement aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions but which Trump blasted as weak. The U.S. has since imposed massive sanctions on Iran in an effort to force Tehran to negotiate a new deal. Trump's advisers have demanded that Iran end its ballistic missile program and stop funding proxy forces in the region, among other steps.\\n\\nNone of that has worked. Instead, according to U.S. officials, Iran sabotaged oil tankers in the Persian Gulf in May, downed a U.S. drone in June and struck Saudi oil facilities in September. The Saudi attack alone disrupted more than 5% of the world's daily oil supply.\\n\\nThe Iranians have not stopped trying to extend their influence in the region. The Iranians have not come back on bended knee to accept a new nuclear negotiation with more Iranian concessions, said Robert Ford, a former U.S. ambassador to Syria and Algeria.\\n\\nThe Iranians didn't even agree to meet Trump in New York last September, despite Trump's repeated entreaties to Iran's President Hassan Rouhani, said Ford, now a senior fellow at Yale University and the Middle East Institute in Washington.\\n\\nNow, with every escalation, Trump's predicament worsens, Peter Beinart, a professor at the City University of New York, wrote a piece published Wednesday in The Atlantic.\\n\\nHis confidants insist that he can't afford a war – which would likely boost oil prices and damage the economy – especially in an election year. Yet he also can't pursue real diplomacy, at least not without provoking a confrontation with the GOP's hawkish foreign-policy elite, Beinart writes. He's caught between his desire to avoid being like George W. Bush and his desire to avoid being like Barack Obama.\\n\\nFord said the Trump administration's maximalist position may be viewed within Iran as an indication that the U.S. is more interested in regime change than any kind of compromise. It looks to me like Tehran is hoping that in a year, Donald Trump will be gone, he said.\\n\\nSlavin said Trump has few palatable options to solve the current standoff.\\n\\nWe've already sanctioned Iran up to the eyeballs, she said. We can kill some of their proxies here or there. But the next level is to attack Iran itself, and if we do that, then it's off to the races. We have another Middle East war – one that the U.S. doesn't want to fight and that could result in another failed state, just like Iraq after the U.S. ousted Saddam Hussein.\\n\\nContributing: John Bacon and the Associated Press"}
{"original": "Paul Singer\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nIt was a line buried in an Office of Congressional Ethics report that tipped me off to members of Congress and staff receiving more than 200 improper trips overseas from groups tied to a Turkish cleric now accused of launching a failed coup in Turkey.\\n\\nUnder the new rules House Republicans approved late Monday then abandoned Tuesday, I never would have seen the report.\\n\\nThe 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.\\n\\nBut the House Ethics Committee didn't want this report released. The committee had ordered OCE in March 2015 to drop its probe of the Azerbaijan trip, saying it had its own investigation under way, despite the fact that the committee had originally approved the trip for the entire congressional delegation, including Rep. Yvette Clarke, D-N.Y., who was a member of the Ethics Committee. But OCE refused and proceeded to publish its report over the objections of the Ethics Committee.\\n\\nUnder the rules changes pushed by House Republicans on Monday night, OCE would have had to stand down.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nHouse Republicans drop plan to gut ethics office\\n\\nHouse Republicans move to slash powers of ethics watchdog\\n\\nHouse ethics board drives transparency, controversy\\n\\nIt is not the first time OCE has provided information to the public that the Ethics Committee could not or would not release. In 2010, then-congressman Nathan Deal, R-Ga., resigned while the Ethics Committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in Georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. His resignation meant that the Ethics Committee lost jurisdiction over him, but OCE decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. Under the new rules, it would have lost that right.\\n\\nIn fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about House ethics cases during the past seven years has come from OCE reports. The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.\\n\\nSince the OCE was created in 2008, it has publicly released about 70 reports on investigations of members of Congress and staff. By comparison, in 2007, before the OCE was created, the Ethics Committee announced reviews of conduct of four members of Congress. Two cases involved lawmakers who were facing charges in court; the other two were for improper trips taken four years earlier.\\n\\nOn the Senate side, with no similar independent ethics review body, the Senate Ethics Committee has not publicly announced a single investigation against a senator in nearly 5 years.\\n\\nIt is not clear exactly how the new proposed rules would have affected ethics investigations, but it is almost certain that the net result would have been that the public would learn less about allegations of ethics violations by their elected officials.\\n\\nThis is also not the first — and probably not the last — attempt by lawmakers to make it harder for OCE to investigate them. Two years ago, Republicans pushed through a late-night amendment that underscored the need for OCE to protect the due process rights of accused lawmakers. It is not clear that rules change had much impact."}
{"original": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\\n\\nAlabama\\n\\nMontgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.\\n\\nAlaska\\n\\nAnchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.\\n\\nArizona\\n\\nPhoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.\\n\\nArkansas\\n\\nFayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nDana Point: A baby gray whale heading south with its mother was spotted swimming alongside dolphins and sea lions off the Southern California coast. Crew members on a whale-watching boat recorded video of the pair in about 100 feet of water near Salt Creek Beach in Dana Point on Tuesday. Capt. Frank Brennan aboard Dana Wharf's Ocean Adventure estimated that the calf was just a day or so old. You could still see the fetal folds on it behind the blowhole, he said of the young whale. Brennan told the Orange County Register he followed the pair as white-sided dolphins stopped feeding to check the whales out. The dolphins and whales were then joined by a group of sea lions. The whales are migrating to the lagoons of Baja, Mexico.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nDenver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.\\n\\nConnecticut\\n\\nKillingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.\\n\\nDelaware\\n\\nWilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia\\n\\nWashington:Neighbors in a Northeast D.C. community quickly mobilized to help their neighbors who lost everything in a raging fire Sunday, WUSA-TV reported. Neighbors donated everything, from school supplies to toiletries. James Caviness-Bey was working overnights at Wal-Mart when he got word of the fire, with his family still inside their Madison street home. But on Wednesday night, he was able to thank D.C. firefighters for their quick response. He also recognized the person he calls the real hero: his wife, who ran back into their burning home when she realized their 2-year-old grandson was still inside. With the flames intensifying, Edwina Caviness-Bey dropped her grandson from the second floor window into her son's arms. From there, she had no choice but to jump out. She had second-degree burns, a fractured pelvis and wrist, and is still in the intensive care unit preparing for surgery. Caviness-Bey, his son and grandson all got to thank their neighbors Wednesday night. Even the family dog, whom for hours they thought had died in the blaze, made an appearance. Neighbors are planning another donation drive to support this family in the coming days. In the meantime, they have set up a GoFundMe page.\\n\\nFlorida\\n\\nWest Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.\\n\\nGeorgia\\n\\nAtlanta: Leaders of the African Methodist Episcopal Church forgave $4 million in debt owed by a college it founded in Atlanta. The financial boost for Morris Brown College was announced Tuesday night, news outlets reported. In exchange, the college agreed to establish a $1.5 million scholarship for AME church members. Morris Brown College lost its accreditation in 2002. Interim president Kevin James launched an effort last year to become accredited again. An official told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the debt forgiveness will help. The Georgia Conference of the African Methodist Episcopal Church founded Morris Brown College in 1881, the newspaper reported. The college has about 40 students enrolled, according to news outlets.\\n\\nHawaii\\n\\nHonolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.\\n\\nIdaho\\n\\nKellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released. Silver Mountain Resort is located about 60 miles east of Spokane, Washington, along Interstate 90 in the Idaho Panhandle.\\n\\nIllinois\\n\\nChicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.\\n\\nIndiana\\n\\nIndianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934. Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.\\n\\nIowa\\n\\nDes Moines:It will cost more to attend the Iowa State Fair this year. Gate prices for adults will rise to $14 from $12 last year, and tickets for children ages 6 to 11 will increase to $8 from $6, the fair announced Wednesday. Advance purchase prices are going up a dollar: to $9 for adults and $5 for children ages 6 to 11. Children 5 and under still will get in free. Building and security improvements, roads and entertainment are driving the increases, said the fair's marketing director, Mindy Williamson. There will be ticket discounts on some days for certain groups, including veterans on Aug. 17 and Older Iowans Day on Aug. 19. The fair runs Aug. 13-23 this year.\\n\\nKansas\\n\\nWichita: An animal rescue group said an emaciated dog is recovering after he was found in a locked kennel that was thrown in a dumpster. The Wichita Animal Action League said in a Facebook post that the pit bull was found Wednesday at an apartment complex and taken to a veterinarian, where he is eating food as fast as it's put in front of him. He is around 2 years old and weighs just over 20 pounds, less than half the amount a dog of his size should weigh.The post described the dog as very sweet and loving. The group is asking for donations for his medical care. The post said the dog is dehydrated and will need slow, small meals over a long period of time because feeding him too quickly could be dangerous. It will likely be months before he is eligible for adoption. Wichita Officer Charley Davidson said an investigation is underway.\\n\\nKentucky\\n\\nLouisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.\\n\\nLouisiana\\n\\nNew Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.\\n\\nMaine\\n\\nPortland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.\\n\\nMaryland\\n\\nBaltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.\\n\\nMassachusetts\\n\\nWellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.\\n\\nMichigan\\n\\nJackson:A prison inmate said he was transferred and lost his job as a tutor after complaining that teachers were supplying answers to a high school equivalency test. U.S. District Judge Mark Goldsmith declined to dismiss the lawsuit, the Detroit Free Press reported Thursday, which means it will go to trial or be settled. Munin Kathawa, 57, who is serving a life sentence for murder, sued five people, including a deputy warden, claiming his rights were violated. He said he reported his concerns about cheating in 2018 to a state lawmaker and a Catholic priest. Corrections Department spokesman Chris Gautz declined to comment. Kathawa said he was falsely accused of being a safety threat and removed as a tutor. A teacher, Laura Bendele, testified in a deposition that she was pressured by officials to stick to that story but refused.\\n\\nMinnesota\\n\\nMinneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.\\n\\nMississippi\\n\\nHancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.\\n\\nMissouri\\n\\nJefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.\\n\\nMontana\\n\\nHelena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.\\n\\nNebraska\\n\\nOmaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.\\n\\nNevada\\n\\nLas Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.\\n\\nNew Hampshire\\n\\nNashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nTrenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.\\n\\nNew Mexico\\n\\nAlbuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nNew York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.\\n\\nNorth Carolina\\n\\nChapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.\\n\\nNorth Dakota\\n\\nWilliston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.\\n\\nOhio\\n\\nCincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.\\n\\nOklahoma\\n\\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.\\n\\nOregon\\n\\nPortland: Lawmakers have approved a $4.5 million contract with a hazardous waste removal company to clean up homeless encampments across the city. The City Commission unanimously voted to give the contract to Rapid Response Bio Clean on Wednesday after the agenda item was pulled late last month over concerns from homeless people and their advocates, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported Thursday. Opponents said the cleanups are traumatic for homeless residents and cause them to lose their property. Under a modified deal, Rapid Response workers will get training in nonviolent conflict resolution and to carry naloxone, an injection that can reverse drug overdoses. The workers generally disposed of the needles, shopping carts, trash and human waste that are left behind after a homeless camp is cleared. Notices about a clean-up must be posted at least two days before the work begins. The city has contracted with Rapid Response since 2016. But in recent weeks, the contract, which expands the scope of the company's responsibilities and significantly increases the amount of money approved for campsite cleanups. Mayor Ted Wheeler said the new contract strikes an excellent balance between keeping the city clean and respecting the homeless. Rapid Response was to resume its work by Thursday.\\n\\nPennsylvania\\n\\nMacungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.\\n\\nRhode Island\\n\\nProvidence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.\\n\\nSouth Carolina\\n\\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.\\n\\nSouth Dakota\\n\\nSioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported\\n\\nTennessee\\n\\nSpring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.\\n\\nTexas\\n\\nGalveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.\\n\\nUtah\\n\\nSt. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.\\n\\nVermont\\n\\nMontpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.\\n\\nVirginia\\n\\nVirginia Beach: An animal shelter took in 20 cats after they were found living in a storage unit with their owner who had recently lost her home, the adoption center said in a social media post. The woman and the felines were found living in a Virginia Beach self-storage unit this week, the city's Animal Care and Adoption Center said on Tuesday. The city doesn't have a limit on how many cats residents can own, Animal Control Supervisor Meghan Conti told The Virginian-Pilot. The adoption center said the cats were understandably scared, but are otherwise in good health and didn't show signs of neglect. They're being housed together and awaiting adoption into new homes. The animal shelter didn't say how long the cats and their owner had been living in the storage unit or what happened with the woman.\\n\\nWashington\\n\\nSeattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.\\n\\nWest Virginia\\n\\nCharleston: The U.S. Labor Department awarded $866,675 for flood recovery in West Virginia, the state's U.S. senators announced. The funding is through the Disaster Recovery National Dislocated Worker Grant Program. Flooding in February 2018 destroyed homes, displaced residents from jobs and caused more than $22 million in public infrastructure damage, U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin said in a news release. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito said the grant will provide Workforce West Virginia with assistance to rebuild.\\n\\nWisconsin\\n\\nTown: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors. Mecher said he got quite a few stares from fellow motorists. When he stopped, he got questions about the legality of transporting a snowmobile on top of a car. When he arrived in Bessemer, it took just nine minutes to remove the snowmobile from its lofty perch with a front end loader and a strap.\\n\\nWyoming\\n\\nJackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground."}

For centuries, the day Congress formally receives and counts each state's electoral votes has come and gone without much fanfare. But this year, President Trump and some of his allies plan to use this day as a final stunt in their misguided and unfounded effort to try to overturn the results of the election. That won't happen.\\n\\nAs the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, I will be in the House Chamber receiving and reporting on the election certifications from the states. And let me assure you — no matter what chaos some Republicans are trying to create, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in as the next President and Vice President of the United States on Jan. 20.\\n\\nPence can't overturn the election\\n\\nTo be sure, our democracy has suffered because of the Trump presidency and his persistent attacks on our democratic institutions. There will be much to repair. At the same time, our democracy has withstood four years of the Trump administration and I know that it can withstand a few more days.\\n\\nNearly two months have passed since President-elect Joe Biden won more than 81 million popular votes — the most of any presidential candidate in history — and 306 Electoral College votes.\\n\\nMore impressive is that President-elect Biden earned those votes in an election that numerous national security experts and a bipartisan group of state and local election officials concluded was the most secure in American history. Even former Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department found no evidence of widespread voter fraud that could change the outcome of the 2020 election. And Republican elected officials, including leaders like Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have accepted the results of the election.\\n\\nThat hasn't stopped President Trump from obsessively making baseless accusations. But these claims are just that — baseless. Since Election Day, more than 80 judges have rejected Trump and his Republican allies' lawsuits and many of those judges were appointed by Trump himself.\\n\\nSedition fatigue:For Trump and many Republicans, betrayal is now politics as usual\\n\\nYet, despite all of this, dozens of Republican members of Congress have indicated that on Jan. 6 they plan to challenge the electoral votes from some states President-elect Biden won, something that has only occurred in both chambers twice in more than 120 years. In both historical cases, bipartisan majorities in Congress voted to reject the challenge. And we know that they will do the same this year.\\n\\nOthers have suggested that Vice President Mike Pence, who is expected to preside over the Joint Session of Congress, may attempt to single-handedly reject valid slates of electors from states that Biden won and replace them with slates of Trump electors. This assertion is as crazy as it sounds — even if he wanted to, Pence could not legally overturn the results of this election.\\n\\nNo middle ground after Georgia call\\n\\nWhile these attempts are futile, we must remember that there are many more people of courage who have chosen to put our democracy and our country in front of their own personal political ambitions. They have stood tall, including my Republican Senate colleagues like Mitt Romney, Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins and John Thune. To quote Republican Sen. Ben Sasse, the efforts to undermine our election are in fact a dangerous ploy.\\n\\nIt is my sincere hope that more follow these senators' lead, especially after we heard the president's call to the Republican Secretary of State in Georgia urging him to find 11,780 votes.The words on that tape are a disgrace to our democracy. Now, my Republican colleagues must decide if they are on the side of our Republic, or part of an effort to subvert the will of the voters. On this one there is no middle ground.\\n\\nBlueprint for an overthrow:Trump challenge to Biden win exposes massive democracy flaw. Next time it just might work.\\n\\nThe attempt by this president and his allies to overturn this election is undemocratic and it is un-American. Fortunately, in the end, it will also be unsuccessful. Democracy will prevail.\\n\\nWe are in the midst of a pandemic that has killed more than 350,000 Americans. Millions of Americans are out of work. It's well past time to stop with the distractions and chaos and to start working to address the needs of the American people. Thankfully, on Jan. 20 we will have a president who will lead and put the American people first.\\n\\nAmy Klobuchar is the senior senator from Minnesota and the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which has jurisdiction over federal elections.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nMIAMI (AP) — The Miami Dolphins were awful in the first quarter — not that they were much better after that.\\n\\nBut too often the Dolphins looked as if they weren't ready at kickoff, which is something the next coach will need to change.\\n\\nThat's just the start. An organizational shake-up has been ongoing — coach Joe Philbin and his offensive and defensive coordinators were fired during the season, and general manager Dennis Hickey departed last week.\\n\\nUnless the Dolphins retain interim coach Dan Campbell, which is unlikely, they'll soon hire their ninth coach since 2004.\\n\\nBut what really needs to change is the team's record. The Dolphins went 6-10, their seventh consecutive season at .500 or below.\\n\\nHere's a final look back as Miami begins another long offseason:\\n\\nSLOW STARTS: The Dolphins were outscored 96-47 in the first quarter, the worst differential in the AFC. They scored a first-quarter touchdown in only three games.\\n\\nHard to explain, executive vice president of football operations Mike Tannenbaum said. It's hard to play balanced football when you're being outscored by 40-plus points in the first quarter. It puts pressure on your offensive tackles. It puts pressure on your defensive secondary. There are a lot of things when you get off to these bad starts that hurt.\\n\\nIn the other three quarters, Miami was outscored by a total of 30 points.\\n\\nOTHER STATS: The Dolphins allowed exactly 4,000 net yards passing, the highest total in the franchise's 50 seasons. But they ranked worse — 28th in the NFL — against the run, compared with 21st against the pass.\\n\\nThe defense did rank first in one category — with 79 rushing plays for negative yardage.\\n\\nOffensive imbalance was an issue all season. The Dolphins ranked ninth with an average of 4.4 yards per rush, but threw the ball 65 percent of the time, third highest.\\n\\nMiami converted 31 percent of its third downs, third worst. Ryan Tannehill was sacked 45 times to tie for third most.\\n\\nQB REGRESSION: Tannehill fell to 29-35 as a starter, and his completion percentage, touchdown rate, interception rate and passer rating were all worse than in 2014.\\n\\nHowever, Tannehill's accuracy on deep throws improved significantly. He had 57 completions of at least 20 yards, 16 more than a season earlier. His average of 11.6 yards per completion was by far the highest of his four-year career.\\n\\nI like Ryan. He's our guy, new general manager Chris Grier said. We can win with Ryan. We are moving forward with him, and we are going to build a competitive roster at all positions.\\n\\nIN THE DIVISION: The reason the Dolphins finished last in the AFC East for the first time since 2007 is that they went 1-5 against the other teams in the division. They were outscored 74-31 by the Bills, 65-34 by the Jets and 46-27 by the Patriots.\\n\\nWe have to figure out a way to win in the AFC East, Tannenbaum said. Being 1-5 is not ever going to get us to where we want.\\n\\nLOOKING AHEAD: The Dolphins have the eighth selection in the draft. That's the highest pick they've taken into the draft since 2012, when they selected Tannehill.\\n\\nThe most pressing need for upgrades this offseason will be at defensive end, linebacker, cornerback and guard.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine.

{"original": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\\n\\nAlabama\\n\\nMontgomery: A recycling center that employs adults with intellectual disabilities should have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to its workers, federal labor officials said. The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that employees were rightfully owed $540,000. Montgomery Arc and two of its partners – Hanan Center and McInnis Recycling Center – will now pay $541,597 in back wages to 80 employees, federal officials said. The deal is part of a settlement between the organizations and the federal agency, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reports. The organizations were supposed to provide services to the employees in exchange for paying them less than minimum wage, the newspaper reports. But the agency found that it failed to provide services required by federal guidelines.\\n\\nAlaska\\n\\nAnchorage: More than two dozen tribal groups oppose a federal land-use proposal that could open large areas of wilderness to future mining in rural Alaska. The opposition is in response to a proposed Bureau of Land Management update to its resource management, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The Bering Sea-Western Interior Resource Management Plan covers 21,094 square miles in Alaska's western and interior regions. The agency announced its preferred proposal in March, known as Alternative C, which would make mining an option on nearly all the land in the plan. The proposal would increase available mining land from the current 13,594 square miles established in the 1980s.\\n\\nArizona\\n\\nFlagstaff: All students in the Flagstaff school district will be provided with iPads under a loan program that starts this week with middle and high school students and continues with elementary school students at the start of the next school year. Flagstaff Unified School District voters in 2018 approved a bond measure to provide $10.6 million to pay for the tablets, cases and other accessories. The district won't require students to use the iPads, but officials say opting out could affect the potential of classroom learning, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Students and their parents have been asked to sign a new loan agreement, to review an existing agreement on responsible use of technology and to pay a nonrefundable $25 annual device protection plan fee. Scholarships for the fee are available for families in need.\\n\\nArkansas\\n\\nFort Smith: The director of the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council says up to $200,000 may have been stolen from the organization that provides financial assistance, housing and food to the needy. The Times Record reports that CSCBC director Marc Baker said improper invoices had been submitted for vendors that had already been paid. The newspaper said Baker last week reported anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000 of duplicate invoices since July. Fort Smith police spokesman Aric Mitchell said an investigation into Baker's allegation would likely begin Monday. Baker said he contacted the FBI because the funds include money from two federal grants, but he was referred to Fort Smith police. The agency's website says it provides services such as housing, food, utility payment assistance and dental programs to low-income residents in about a dozen western Arkansas counties.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nSan Diego: Homeless people facing a ticket or arrest by San Diego police could have the infractions cleared if they agree to stay for 30 days in one of the city's shelters, according to a report. The program could help stabilize lives and get people connected with services, while also allowing officers to enforce laws on the street, San Diego police Capt. Scott Wahl told the Union-Tribune. The San Diego Police Department launched a neighborhood policing division in 2019 that includes outreach teams and officers who enforce quality-of-life laws that often involve homeless people. Last summer, police began offering shelter beds in lieu of citations to homeless people who had been contacted for encroachment, illegal lodging, littering or other minor infractions. But while about 300 people took the offer, many left the shelter within a day or two, Wahl said.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nDenver: The state is starting off 2020 with plenty of snow in the mountains. Mountain snow moisture statewide is 122% of the usual amount for this time of year, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. High-country snow moisture is up 30% compared to this time last year. All areas measured by the federal agency have above-average snow moisture. Early-season snows boosted snowpack in the northern part of the state. Snow has fallen in southern ranges more recently, evenly boosting snowpack levels statewide, the Denver Post reports. Light mountain snow is forecast in northern Colorado in the days ahead. Much of Colorado's mountain snow moisture accumulates in late winter and early spring.\\n\\nConnecticut\\n\\nFairfield: The state and AT&T have signed a deal designed to improve cellular service on the Metro-North commuter rail line. The agreement, announced Friday, gives the telecommunications company access to the right-of-way along the rail line, where the company plans to install a series of small cell nodes. Gov. Ned Lamont says that will provide better cellular coverage and higher data speeds for train passengers. The Democratic governor also announced that 132 recently purchased rail cars will be designed in partnership with industry experts and equipped with rooftop antennas that amplify 4G and 5G signals in the train.\\n\\nDelaware\\n\\nDover: Authorities who launched a two-day sting in response to a rash of shootings in the capital city say they seized guns and drugs. The operation targeted Dover's Capitol Park neighborhood, where there were four shootings in the last two weeks of the year, Delaware State Police spokeswoman Master Cpl. Melissa Jaffe said. A drive-by shooting on New Year's Day also injured two teens. No arrests were made, but Jaffe said authorities seized a loaded Smith & Wesson .40-caliber pistol, a black tactical-style ballistic vest and a loaded assault rifle, as well as 656 baggies of heroin. Police said in a news release that officers had learned the contraband was being hidden on state and county land. The effort involved more than 60 troopers and law enforcement officers from multiple other agencies.\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia\\n\\nWashington: The district saw one of the nation's highest numbers of bank branches close in 2019, WTOP-FM reports. Only New York and Chicago saw more closures than the 57 last year in the D.C. market, according to MagnifyMoney. As more Americans use digital and mobile banking, firms are looking to save on overhead and earn on real estate by closing down expensive physical branches. An increase in mergers may also be to blame, WTOP reports, with the FDIC pegging such mergers as at a 17-year high.\\n\\nFlorida\\n\\nTallahassee: State health officials say there were nearly 3,400 hepatitis A cases in 2019. According to statistics through Saturday, there were 3,395 cases – including 63 new cases reported the prior week. To underscore the outbreak, the Panama City News Herald reports the state totaled 1,175 reported cases of hepatitis A in the five previous years combined – with 548 of those cases in 2018, according to state Department of Health data. Hepatitis A can cause liver damage and is spread through such things as fecal matter. That can include transmission by people not properly washing their hands after going to the bathroom and contaminating food or drinks. Health officials urge people to get vaccinated against the disease. As of Saturday, Pasco County had the most cases in the state in 2019, with 414.\\n\\nGeorgia\\n\\nMacon: Terry Patterson plans to run a dozen marathons in 2020 as he keep logging road race miles at the age of 65. Patterson, of Macon, ran his first marathon, the local Cherry Blossom Road Race, in 2002. He began entering more races and hasn't stopped. In fewer than two decades, Patterson says, he's completed 83 marathons in all 50 states. He estimates the total distance he's run during road races exceeds 10,000 miles. I do get a lot of accolades for how old I am, Patterson told WMAZ-TV. And I do brag about how fast I can run. He's showing no signs of slowing down. Patterson ran a 3-hour, 52-minute marathon in Seattle last fall. In April, he qualified for the Boston Marathon. He's signed up for 12 marathons this year and hopes to add his first race overseas in China. His first marathon of the new year will be closer to home, at nearby Robins Air Force Base on Jan. 18.\\n\\nHawaii\\n\\nHilo: The Big Island geothermal power station that was knocked offline by a volcanic eruption hopes to produce lower-cost electricity under a new agreement with a state utility, company officials said. Puna Geothermal Venture and Hawaiian Electric Light Co. are seeking approval of an amended power purchase agreement submitted last week to the state Public Utilities Commission. Hawaiian Electric said Puna Geothermal agreed to sell electricity from its restored and enlarged facility, the state's only geothermal power plant, at a reduced price that would save a typical residential customer $7.50 to $13 a month. Puna Geothermal is working to resume normal operations after the Kilauea volcano eruption that began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower Puna. Lava destroyed the company's substation and covered geothermal wells, while cutting off road access.\\n\\nIdaho\\n\\nBoise: A federal agency has ordered a company to pay four employees tens of thousands of dollars in unpaid overtime and travel time after the company violated labor laws. An investigation by the U.S. Labor Department found that Intermountain Concrete Polishing paid employees straight-time rates for all the hours they worked, including workweeks that exceeded 40 hours, the Idaho Statesman reports. The company also failed to record or compensate employees for travel time when they worked several hours away from their homes, officials said. The Meridian-based floor polishing company must pay $47,676 to four employees for violating overtime and record-keeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal officials said.\\n\\nIllinois\\n\\nChicago: The state will stop collecting fines against drivers who are ticketed after cameras catch them violating red lights, Comptroller Susana Mendoza said Monday. She said poor and minority motorists appear to be most affected by the $100 tickets, which can double if not timely paid. She also noted a federal investigation of relationships between some communities and a red light vendor. The new policy starts Feb. 6. This system is clearly broken, Mendoza said. I am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers. A 2012 state law allows local governments to use the comptroller's office to collect debts. Unpaid traffic tickets, for example, can be deducted from tax refunds. Mendoza said communities can hire private debt collectors instead.\\n\\nIndiana\\n\\nIndianapolis: The Children's Museum of Indianapolis set an attendance record during 2019, breaking a mark that had stood for a decade. The museum had just over 1.3 million visitors last year, topping its 2009 record by about 8,300 people, officials said. Ten years ago, the museum's attendance was boosted by a King Tut exhibit and the opening of an Egypt exhibit. In 2019, special exhibits included Star Trek: Exploring New Worlds and PAW Patrol Adventure Play. The new mark also comes after the museum, north of downtown Indianapolis, opened its $24.5 million outdoor Sports Legends Experience in 2018. Museum CEO Jeffrey Patchen says it strives to provide fun and imaginative exhibits that appeal to all, from children to grandparents.\\n\\nIowa\\n\\nWaterloo: A business lobbying group is trying to halt the city's new ordinance that is supposed to help convicted felons find work. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry filed a petition for injunctive relief against the city in Black Hawk District Court on Friday, arguing cities don't have the authority to pass laws like Waterloo's. The ban the box ordinance prevents companies from including a question on applications about whether prospective employees have been convicted of crimes. But in its petition, the ABI points to a 2017 Iowa law that bans cities and counties from passing some business-related ordinances. The local governments can't preempt federal or state rules about business practices like benefits and hiring practices. The Legislature passed the law because some county officials – including those in Polk County – wanted to raise the minimum wage.\\n\\nKansas\\n\\nTopeka: Psychiatrists are so hard to come by in some rural parts of the state that doctors from outside its borders now commonly treat patients through video conference. Kansas, like the rest of the U.S., is seeing an increase in patients seeking mental health treatment. The state can't find enough doctors, nurses and therapists to treat them, and providers say the problem is worse in the state's least-populated rural areas. The Kansas News Service reports the High Plains Mental Health Center in northwestern Kansas has long struggled to attract psychiatrists for patients in its 20-county coverage area. Executive Director Walt Hill stopped even trying because it typically took him more than a year to fill a position. Attracting psychiatric nurses is hard, too. So Hill turned to providers who conference in from Kansas City, Missouri; Texas; and Oklahoma.\\n\\nKentucky\\n\\nOlive Hill: Carter Caves State Resort Park is offering more than 200 activities at its Winter Adventure Weekend this month. Among the activities during the four-day event are cave tours, winter survival, rappelling, ice climbing and guided hikes. There will be 243 workshops and field trips offered for people ranging from beginners to advanced winter adventurers, based on difficulty and skills required. Registration is $20 per person, with additional charges for some field trips and workshops. Registration is available online or, pending availability, at the site. The event is set for Jan. 23-26. The park is in Olive Hill and has a lodge with a restaurant, cottages and campground.\\n\\nLouisiana\\n\\nNew Orleans: A new high school is preparing students for careers in coastal protection and restoration, anticipating a future with ongoing climate change and sea level rise. New Harmony High School opened in fall 2018 and currently serves about 100 south Louisiana students. Besides their traditional classes in math, literature and history, New Harmony students take science classes that tackle environmental issues. The school currently has grades nine and 10, with plans to expand to 11th and 12th grades. The state charter school's mission is intricately tied to the state's future. A multitude of issues from the leveeing of the Mississippi River to oil and gas development have made Louisiana ground zero for coastal land loss. The state estimates it has lost just over 2,000 square miles of land – a tract about the size of Delaware – since 1932.\\n\\nMaine\\n\\nEast Machias: Atlantic salmon laid a record number of eggs in the East Machias River last year, according to a conservation group that tracks the species' status in the wild. The fish are considered endangered in the U.S. by the federal government, and they only appear in a handful of Maine rivers. The Downeast Salmon Federation said the high number of eggs shows that efforts to bring them back in Maine's river systems are working. Biologists counted 61 of the nests the fish build for spawning in the East Machias River. The Downeast Salmon Federation's executive director, Dwayne Shaw, said that's six times the number counted in the river since the federation started tracking the fish's egg nesting patterns two decades ago. The federation counted only 10 of the nests in 2018, the Bangor Daily News reports. That was about an average number. The nests carry about 4,000 eggs each.\\n\\nMaryland\\n\\nGreenbelt: Residents, civic associations and local governments in counties that would be crossed by a proposed high-speed, magnetic levitation train linking Baltimore and Washington say they are weighing options to fight the plan. The Washington Post reports the city of Greenbelt is among those opposing the so-called maglev project. Last month, the city issued a request for services to attorneys and law firms willing to take on the fight. Other options being weighed to oppose the $10 billion plan include lobbying lawmakers and organizing protests, the newspaper reports. Critics say the train would offer little benefit to communities it will pass through because it would only stop in Washington, Baltimore and the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Opponents are worried about construction impacts. But supporters say it will ease traffic congestion, create jobs and boost economic development.\\n\\nMassachusetts\\n\\nBoston: A group of families in the state is fighting a recent court ruling that found au pairs should be treated as employees entitled to minimum wage. An organization called Au Pair Families of Massachusetts is planning to lobby for legislation in the Statehouse on Wednesday, the Boston Globe reports. A federal court ruled Dec. 2 that au pairs in Massachusetts were entitled to earn state minimum wage and overtime, which could raise host families' costs by as much as $333 per week. Many host parents agree au pairs should have additional protections but argue the new changes will make the program less accessible in a state that has some of the nation's highest child care costs. The au pair program, overseen by the U.S. State Department, was launched as a cultural exchange program in which young people live with families in other countries while helping with child care and some housework. Host families paid at least $197 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work before the ruling.\\n\\nMichigan\\n\\nDetroit: A statue of the robot featured in the 1987, Detroit-set film RoboCop is nearing completion ahead of its debut at a science museum. Organizers of the Kickstarter campaign website who crowdfunded Robocop for the city posted some photos last week with an update of the statue with a note that its final form is coming later this winter at the Michigan Science Center, The Detroit News reports. Organizers wrote in the update that the statue is 11 feet tall with his head on and that his stainless steel base weighs half a ton. He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect, they wrote. It has been almost a decade since the idea came about. A Twitter user, who tagged then-Mayor Dave Bing in a tweet, noted that Philadelphia has a statue of another movie icon, Rocky Balboa, and that RoboCop would be a GREAT ambassador for Detroit. The campaign that launched in 2012 raised $67,436 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide. Since then, Giorgio Gikas, one of Detroit's premier sculptor conservators, has been creating the work.\\n\\nMinnesota\\n\\nSherburn: A rural veterinarian who has taken in dozens of miniature horses since they were seized because of maltreatment says she wants to be paid for caring for them for a year and a half. Shirley Kittleson says the bill for their care has topped $325,000. Kittleson filed a lawsuit last month against the Humane Society and Watonwan County for nonpayment. Kittleson was asked to care for the herd of 72 after the Animal Humane Society and Watonwan County sheriff seized the horses from a farm in Odin in June 2018. The farm's owner, Michael Johnson, was convicted of two counts of animal neglect. Watonwan County told Kittleson soon after she sent them a couple of monthly bills that the horses were the responsibility of the Humane Society. Kittleson said she could find new homes for the horses, but the Humane Society won't release the herd, according to the Star Tribune.\\n\\nMississippi\\n\\nJackson: As the 2020 Legislature prepares to convene Tuesday, the future of hemp in the Magnolia State is hazy. There were a few attempts to legalize hemp production in the 2019 session, but all failed. Now, as farmers in surrounding states are already cultivating and selling hemp, Mississippi remains one of only three states where production is illegal. A task force on hemp production met three times last year and weighed pros and cons of the issue. Farmers crowded into a room in the Capitol to hear about a new crop they might soon plant. Agricultural experts explained the benefits and hardships of growing hemp without taking a hard stance on the issue, but law enforcement officials on the task force were deeply critical of hemp legalization. The task force ultimately produced a report that included these findings, though it doesn't include a recommendation on whether to legalize hemp. Last year, the House passed a bill legalizing hemp production. That bill stalled in the Senate.\\n\\nMissouri\\n\\nSt. Louis: A memorial to soldiers downtown has been damaged by vandalism, including a spray-painted message of No war. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning. It wasn't immediately clear if it was in response to the airstrike that killed a top Iranian official, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an attack that's drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington. About 150 people marched through downtown St. Louis on Saturday in opposition to further military action against Iran. The Missouri Historical Society's director of marketing and communications, Leigh Walters, said it is sad that anyone would deface a memorial to those who have made the supreme sacrifice for their country. The memorial opened in 1938 to honor World War I soldiers and reopened in 2018 after a two-year, $30 million renovation.\\n\\nMontana\\n\\nBig Sky: Gallatin National Forest officials are warning backcountry enthusiasts to take extra care after three snowmobilers escaped injury in a weekend avalanche near Big Sky. Forest forecaster Alex Marienthal said in a Sunday advisory that the snowmobilers were caught Saturday in a 1,500-foot-wide, 4-to-6-foot-deep slide on Buck Ridge. Marienthal says similar avalanches have broken naturally on sugary and weak layers hidden deep inside snowpack in recent days. More can be expected. Backcountry visitors are urged to avoid slopes that are wind-loaded with snow and to avoid steep slopes that may hide persistent weak layers of snow. Two snowmobilers were killed in a Jan. 1 avalanche near Lake Dinah, northwest of Seeley Lake. The West Central Montana Avalanche Center had issued an avalanche warning for the area after more than a foot of heavy, wet snow had fallen overnight.\\n\\nNebraska\\n\\nLincoln: A state lawmaker concerned about prison overcrowding plans to propose building a new 300-bed work release facility in Omaha. State Sen. Steve Lathrop tells the Omaha World-Herald he'll introduce a bill calling on the state to begin planning a new community corrections facility. Building the new facility could cost more than $40 million, but Lathrop's bill would only require the state to plan for the new work release facility. Nebraska's prisons currently hold 2,006 more inmates than their design capacity of 3,535 inmates, putting the prison system at 157% of its design capacity. Lathrop says the state is facing a prison overcrowding crisis and needs to address the issue. A consultant recommended expanding Omaha's community corrections prison in 2014, but the project was never done. Lathrop says work-release facilities can help better prepare inmates to return to society.\\n\\nNevada\\n\\nWells: A historic hotel damaged in a 2008 earthquake is getting restored. The El Rancho Hotel and Casino in Wells is expected to see a new life after the small Elko County town received grants to fix it up. The city has secured funding from the federal Community Development Block Grant program and the Nevada Commission for Cultural Centers and Historic Preservation to help restore the property. Restoration is estimated to cost about $500,000 to the city as well. City manager Jolene Supp says the payoff will be worth it. The city plans to reopen the building as a community center, restaurant and small-business incubator. Originally a hotel-casino and later a community center and banquet hall, the El Rancho served the town of 1,200 since it was built in 1949. A 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit Wells in February 2008, damaging hundreds of structures in town, including the hotel.\\n\\nNew Hampshire\\n\\nConcord: This year's New Hampshire Women's Rally will feature speakers on reproductive health, climate, immigration, and electing women to office from the bottom to the top of the ticket. The fourth annual rally is scheduled for Jan. 18 outside the Statehouse from 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. It's called March on the Polls. Some of the groups at this year's event will be Planned Parenthood NH Action Fund; the NH Women's Foundation; Equality Health Center; NH Sierra Club; Granite State Progress; Rights & Democracy NH; NH Campaign for a Family Friendly Economy; and MomsRising. More details can be found on Facebook.\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nIsland Beach State Park: Officials hoped they would collect 200 discarded Christmas trees to bolster dunes at the park but have received 10 times that amount. State Department of Environmental Protection officials, who operate the park, said they collected some 2,000 Christmas trees Saturday during a drop-off event. DEP officials say the trees help catch sand and support the dunes, which provide protection to the island during storms. The dunes also provide habitat for about 400 plant species and numerous types of birds. The island is made up of nearly 1,900 acres of dunes and beaches and remains one of the few remaining undeveloped barrier island beaches in the northeastern United States, according to state officials. Now, state officials are looking for volunteers to help move and place the Christmas trees into specific dune areas. Volunteers and state workers will meet at 8 a.m. Saturday. Volunteers must pre-register online.\\n\\nNew Mexico\\n\\nSanta Fe: Native Americans go without medical insurance at a much higher rate than the state's other residents, according to a state-commissioned study from the Urban Institute that explores gaps in medical insurance coverage by race and ethnicity as well as age, location and education level. New Mexico fares relatively well overall in terms of paid access to health care services in comparison with the U.S. as a whole. The study found that 187,000 non-elderly residents go without health insurance – about 10.5% of the state population. The national average is just over 11%. Among Native Americans, 37,000 people go with insurance – or 16.2% of the population. Health insurance coverage also is relatively scarce in the northwest area of the state that is home to the Navajo Nation. The Urban Institute found that Native Americans working in the health care and educational fields are especially prone to go without health insurance.\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nNew York: Throngs of demonstrators joined by elected officials walked solemnly across the Brooklyn Bridge in a solidarity march Sunday against anti-Semitism and all acts of hate. The No Hate, No Fear march was organized by New York's Jewish community in the wake of recent anti-Semitic attacks, including a knife attack at a Hanukkah celebration north of New York City that left five people wounded and a fatal shootout at a kosher grocery in Jersey City, New Jersey. The crowds of participants, thousands strong, jammed the streets in lower Manhattan as they waited their turns to get across the bridge. It is wonderful that we are doing this and sad that we still have to do it, said Claudia Stoller, 31, of Manhattan. But it was never lost on me that the Jewish community could always be targeted and should always be ready to be strong.\\n\\nNorth Carolina\\n\\nAsheboro: The North Carolina Zoo says it had a record-setting number of visitors in 2019. The zoo has announced it saw 917,309 visitors in 2019, a record and 85,000 more than in 2018. We are thrilled to welcome so many guests from North Carolina and around the world to our zoo, Zoo Director Pat Simmons said. We have plans to keep improving our programs and guest experience so that even more people can enjoy the zoo in the future. The facility says it is the world's largest natural habitat zoo. It is home to more than 1,800 animals and 52,000 plants.\\n\\nNorth Dakota\\n\\nBismarck: Officials say high winds caused a power outage that led to a produced water and oil spill in Dunn County. The state Department of Environmental Quality was notified Monday of Sunday's spill at a salt water disposal facility operated by Hunt Oil Co., about 8 miles northwest of Halliday. Officials said the equipment failure caused by the power outage led to multiple tanks overflowing. Initial estimates indicated about 27,720 gallons of produced water and 15,540 gallons of crude oil overflowed the tanks. Most of the spill was contained on site, but winds blew some of the material onto pastureland. Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas development. It is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals.\\n\\nOhio\\n\\nCleveland: Records show the Cuyahoga County prosecutor is on track to send about 100 children to adult court to face criminal charges for the second consecutive year, a practice criticized by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio as being unnecessary in most cases. As of mid-December, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court records indicate 99 teenagers had cases bound over to Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court in 2019, cleveland.com reported. Nearly 9 in 10 of those juveniles are black, records show. Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley, whose jurisdiction includes Cleveland, said many of the juveniles his office prosecutes as adults previously were charged in juvenile court and then committed more crimes. O'Malley, a Democrat who took office in January 2017, told cleveland.com in October that he does not apologize for trying to keep the community safe.\\n\\nOklahoma\\n\\nOklahoma City: A judge facing a felony charge of failing to file her state income tax returns has been removed from presiding over criminal trials. The Oklahoman reports Oklahoma County Judge Kendra Coleman was reassigned Friday by Presiding Judge Ray C. Elliott to handle victim protective order requests and mental health cases. Coleman is facing a felony charge for failing to pay state taxes in 2017, was admonished by the state Supreme Court for failing to pay her taxes and more than 60 parking tickets, and has been found in contempt by the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. Coleman's attorney, Joe White, has called the felony indictment false on its face, saying the taxes were eventually paid. The judge's attorney has also said the contempt citation must be more specific about the allegations against her.\\n\\nOregon\\n\\nSalem: The state's correctional facility for girls and young women had among the highest rates of sexual victimization in 2018, according to a federal report. In the report, 42 girls and young women at Albany's Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility were surveyed; 14.3% reported being sexually victimized in 2018. That's more than twice the national average of 7.1%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Oregon Public Broadcasting says the report does not distinguish sexual abuse reports in individual facilities made against staff versus those made against other youth. Other Oregon facilities above the national average include St. Mary's Home for Boys in Beaverton at 11.1% and the Rogue Valley Youth Correctional Facility in Grants Pass at 10.3%. All other Oregon juvenile facilities fell below the national average. The National Survey of Youth in Custody conducted the report.\\n\\nPennsylvania\\n\\nPhiladelphia: Michael Fitzpatrick, a former congressman from suburban Philadelphia who served four terms in the U.S. House before handing off the seat to his brother, died Monday morning after a long battle with melanoma, his family said. He was 56. Michael Fitzpatrick passed away peacefully this morning, surrounded by family, after a long and arduous battle with melanoma, Fitzpatrick's family said in a statement released by county Republican Party officials. Fitzpatrick, who also served as a Bucks County commissioner, worked during his time in Congress to establish the Washington Crossing National Cemetery. He decided against running for a fifth term in 2016. His brother, Brian, a former FBI agent, ran instead and won and continues to hold the seat. Fitzpatrick, of Levittown, is survived by his wife and six children.\\n\\nRhode Island\\n\\nNorth Kingstown: The annual Rhode Island National Guard Open House Air Show in Quonset Point will resume in 2020 after having been canceled last year because of troop deployments. This year's show is scheduled for June 27-28 at the Quonset Air National Guard Base in North Kingstown, the National Guard announced Friday. The air show debuted in 1992 and has been canceled twice – once in 2013 because of federal budget cuts and last year due to a large number of deployments within the Rhode Island National Guard. Officials said they expected more than 500 troops to be deployed last year during the traditional time frame of the air show. Officials say this year's show will include an F-22 Raptor demonstration, the U.S. Air Force Academy Jump Team, a World War II heritage flight and the Geico Skytypers.\\n\\nSouth Carolina\\n\\nFlorence: Authorities are investigating the fatal shooting of an airport public safety officer officer in Florence. A man shot and killed the officer Sunday morning during a traffic stop at Florence Regional Airport, the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division said in a news release. Florence County Coroner Keith von Lutcken identified the victim as Jackson Ryan Winkeler, 26, of Dillon, WPDE-TV reports. The suspect, 37-year-old James Edward Bell, initially fled but was later captured by Florence County deputies, officials said. Winkeler also volunteered with the Latta Fire Department, which lowered its flag to half-staff Sunday.\\n\\nSouth Dakota\\n\\nSioux Falls: A company has awarded holiday bonuses its 120 employees likely won't forget. Myrl & Roy's Paving gave its workers $10 million in bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $400,000 depending on length of employment and job duties. One of the owners, Sue Unzelman, says they wanted to thank the employees for their hard work and loyalty. It's something we really wanted to do, reward their loyalty, their stick-to-it-ness, she says. I can't tell you how happy I was to see the reactions, the tears in the room. Unzelman and her siblings are selling the second-generation company to L.G. Everist, a rock mining company with pits and quarries in the region. Myrl & Roy's Paving began over five decades ago after Myrl Unzelman and Roy Schultz left their jobs in a road construction business and bought a $500 dump truck, a rake and a shovel.\\n\\nTennessee\\n\\nNashville: The latest design plans for the city's most ambitious development project reveal a complex new downtown district anchored by Amazon's office campus and an entertainment district similar to L.A. Live. The 25-story Grand Hyatt hotel will be the first tenant to open in the fall in the 17-acre Nashville Yards development. Two office towers for an Amazon operations hub are also well under construction. But most of the site work is still either in the preliminary stages or has yet to begin. San Diego-based Southwest Value Partners expects to spend $1 billion to create the district in the next few years. The entire project, which includes new street designs with pedestrian plazas, stretches from Broadway to Church Street. It will be fronted by a 1.3-acre park along the railroad tracks running through the Gulch.\\n\\nTexas\\n\\nLubbock: Police say a man who shot at a police officer early Sunday was then fatally shot when two officers returned gunfire. Police say in a news release that 30-year-old Drew Nichols Wallace-Flores was killed in the shooting in a southwest Lubbock neighborhood. Police say the officers were investigating a report from a resident of seeing a man on security video checking vehicle door handles in the neighborhood shortly after 5:30 a.m. Sunday when the man fled as one officer arrived. Police say the officer gave chase on foot, and as the second officer arrived, Wallace-Flores fired at the first officer, and both officers returned fire, killing Wallace-Flores at the scene. The names of the officers were not immediately released. Police say both are on paid leave pending an investigation into the shooting.\\n\\nUtah\\n\\nProvo: The state's number of drug overdose suicides has potentially been underreported by 33%, according to a new study. Published in the journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, the study came to the conclusion after looking at 2,665 overdose deaths from 2012 to 2015 in Utah, the Provo Daily Herald reports. Paul Nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. If you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, Nestadt said. State health officials say roughly 630 Utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. Utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000. According to the study, that rate could be significantly higher.\\n\\nVermont\\n\\nBrattleboro: Leaders of a hospital that is a critical provider of psychiatric and addiction services in the Green Mountain State say the facility faces the possibility of sale or closure amid a disagreement with state officials over funding. Brattleboro Retreat serves more than half the people in Vermont who need psychiatric care, and it provides all of the child and adolescent psychiatric care in the state, according to its chief executive officer, Louis Josephson. Michael Smith, secretary of Vermont's Agency of Human Services, says he has rejected a request for an additional $2 million in funding from Brattleboro Retreat. That request would be in addition to a financial package valued at an estimated $16 million for new beds and a recent rate increase valued at an estimated $3.5 million per year, he said.\\n\\nVirginia\\n\\nFredericksburg: A cancer patient says her faith in humanity has been restored after she received thousands of pieces of mail from around the world this holiday season. The Free Lance-Star reports Jean Lee, 61, hoped a few cards would help as she battled the depression of ongoing treatments for a cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 2003. So the Stafford County woman posted a request on Facebook, asking people to tell her about their lives and hometowns. That led to a segment on a Washington TV station, and her story continued to spread. Lee said she received a package from Antarctica, a scarf from England, Kona coffee from Hawaii and a clock-jewelry box made by inmates at a Tennessee correctional facility, who paid $25 to ship it to her, the newspaper reports. When I say this whole experience has given me hope, that's coming from a woman who was very jaded, Lee told the newspaper.\\n\\nWashington\\n\\nSpokane: The city is planning to write off hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid utility bills dating back two decades as it looks to upgrade its payment software. The proposal would forgive more than $450,000 in payments and late fees accrued by 174 ratepayers during the years 1999 to 2013. The Spokesman-Review reports a city official says those payments would be legally difficult to recoup. Nonpayment of utilities, including charges for trash collection, sewer and water services, can result in late fees, liens placed on a property and termination of service. But the debt that is being considered for forgiveness may have been incurred by businesses no longer located in the area or residents who died or moved away. Spokane City Councilwoman Candace Mumm says she wants to make sure city officials have done everything to secure payment before writing the debts off.\\n\\nWest Virginia\\n\\nCharleston: The state has announced its initial slate of events for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. The yearlong commemoration will start Wednesday with a reception ahead of the governor's state of the state address, Secretary of State Mac Warner's office said. Women will wear early 1900s-style clothing at the event. Other events throughout the year include a documentary showing, a lecture series, a gala, a women's suffrage march at Marshall University and more. Events are being posted online on Warner's website and through a social media account. Warner is leading a coordinating committee to plan events for the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.\\n\\nWisconsin\\n\\nMilwaukee: A driver shot and wounded two children who threw snowballs at a car, police said. Officers who responded to a shooting report Saturday night on the north side of Milwaukee found the injured children and gave them first aid until they were taken to a hospital. The children are a 13-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. Both suffered non-life-threatening gunshot wounds, police said in a news release. Investigators say they're looking for the driver of a white Toyota who fired at the kids.\\n\\nWyoming\\n\\nJackson: An operation to kill the mountain goats that have invaded Grand Teton National Park and threaten the existence of the park's struggling bighorn sheep herd began Sunday, officials say. A large swath of the high Tetons, including the north and west slopes of the iconic Cathedral Group, will be closed to the public as aerial gunners contracted by the park spend up to a week locating and shooting at the approximately 100 goats, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. We're trying to be efficient and effective – so doing this as fast as possible in the most efficient way – and we believe that the aerial operations does that, park spokeswoman Denise Germann said. She had no prediction about how many animals would be targeted but said it's possible that at least one more week of aerial shooting will occur, depending on how this operation goes.\\n\\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports"}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – Georgia voters head to the polls Tuesday for a pair of runoff elections that will determine control of the U.S. Senate, marking the end of the tumultuous 2020 election cycle that saw Republicans make gains in Congress while losing the White House.\\n\\nThe elections are being held as President Donald Trump continues to allege that widespread voter fraud in Georgia caused his loss to Joe Biden on Nov. 3. Republicans are worried those claims – punctuated by Trump's extraordinary phone call Saturday when he tried to pressure GOP state officials to overturn November's election – could discourage GOP voters from turning out Tuesday.\\n\\nI just want to find 11,780 votes, Trump said on an audio recording first obtained by The Washington Post. The number refers to the margin Trump needed to beat Biden.\\n\\nPeach State voters will decide whether Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler return to Washington or if Democratic challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock take their place. All four ran Nov. 3, but none got enough votes under state law to win the Senate seats outright, forcing Tuesday's runoffs.\\n\\nWins by both Ossoff and Warnock would result in a 50-50 split in the Senate, effectively giving Democrats control of the chamber since Vice President-elect Kamala Harris would cast tiebreaking votes.\\n\\nA win by one of the Republicans would keep the Senate in the hands of Republicans and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell,R-Ky. Though it would be a narrow Republican majority, Biden and Democrats would face an uphill battle on any legislation they hoped to pass.\\n\\nGeorgia is a reliably red state that has not elected a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 20 years.\\n\\nThe question is whether one of Trump's final political acts will push Republicans to victory or hand control of Congress to Democrats.\\n\\nTrump said back in 2016 he could shoot someone in Times Square and most of his supporters would still be with him. There's a lot of truth in that, but if this election is as close as people think, then even if he turns off a small sliver of Republicans, this might be a step too far and could be the difference, Charles Bullock, a University of Georgia political science professor, told USA TODAY.\\n\\nAn 'unforced error' by the president\\n\\nDuring the call with state officials, Trump is heard pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, to find enough votes to reverse his 11,779-vote loss two months ago, saying, There's no way I lost Georgia.\\n\\nHe repeated that wording during a rally Monday night in the state, continuing to call the general election rigged. Trump also put pressure on Vice President Mike Pence during the rally.\\n\\nI hope Mike Pence comes through for us, I have to tell you, Trump told supporters in Dalton, Georgia.\\n\\nTrump called Pence a great guy, but also said: Of course, if he doesn't come through, I won't like him quite as much.\\n\\nGabriel Sterling, a Republican who works for Raffensperger as the state's voting system implementation manager, told Fox News on Monday that the spurious claims of voter fraud spread by Trump and his allies appear to be depressing Republican voter turnout in Tuesday's election.\\n\\nBased on the slightly more than 3 million ballots cast in early voting, Democrats are outperforming Republicans, Sterling said. In the four most Democratic congressional districts (the 2nd, 4th, 5th and 13th), turnout is either approaching or above 80% of the Nov. 3 election while the turnout in the two largest GOP districts (the 11th and 14th) is below 70%, according to state data compiled by the nonpartisan website georgiavotes.com.\\n\\nI am afraid that many Republicans have been discouraged by the actions and discussions around the president, Sterling said. It's absolutely a distraction unfortunately, this unforced error on the part of the president. ... A lot of people are focusing on Nov. 3 when they should be focusing on Jan. 5.\\n\\nTrump has questioned the legitimacy of Tuesday's runoffs, describing them in a tweet Friday as illegal and invalid. Over the weekend, Trump promoted a tweet that criticized Loeffler and Perdue for not being part of an effort by a dozen GOP senators who plan to challenge the certification Wednesday of the Nov. 3 election, a mostly ceremonial recognition of Biden's victory.\\n\\nSaturday, the president retweeted a supporter asking, Why are my own #GA Senators @Kloeffler & @Perduesenate not supporting this effort?with a link to an article about the planned challenge by Senate Republicans.\\n\\nOn Monday, Loeffler announced she would join that effort.\\n\\nMore:Trump is heard on audiotape pressuring Georgia secretary of state to 'find' votes to overturn Biden's win\\n\\nPolls show both Senate races as toss-ups, adding to the worry among Republican leaders in Washington that losing the seats could shut them out of power on Capitol Hill where Democrats control the House.\\n\\nDemocratic control of Congress would give Biden a much greater chance of enacting his agenda on climate change, health care, racial justice and other issues he campaigned on. It would allow the new president to install a Cabinet and fill court vacancies with nominees of his own choosing.\\n\\nThat alarms Republicans who helped raise money or campaigned on behalf of Perdue and Loeffler.\\n\\nMore:Trump travels to Georgia before Senate runoff that will decide control of Senate\\n\\nThe fate of the Senate – and the nation – will be decided by Georgia voters, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in an opinion piece posted on the Fox News website. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.\\n\\nConservatives admit Trump call hurts\\n\\nTrump has held an iron grip on the GOP since breaking away from the primary pack in 2016 with a brand of celebrity showmanship and right-leaning populism.\\n\\nHis conversation with Raffensperger in the context of Georgia's runoff races tests how far the president can stretch the GOP coalition outside his base.\\n\\nTrump's usual critics condemned his request that state election officials find enough votes to win Georgia's electors, but it also drew winces from some of his allies.\\n\\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., is one of the president's staunchest supporters and is among the senators who pledged to object to certifying the 2020 Electoral College results Wednesday. During a Fox News interview Monday, she acknowledged Trump's conversation with the Georgia secretary of state was not a helpful call.\\n\\nGeorgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, a Republican, said in an interview with CNN that most of what the president brought up during the phone call was based on misinformation.\\n\\nI am 100% certified to tell you that it was in appropriate, Duncan said. And it certainly did not help the situation.\\n\\nConservative commentator Erick Erickson, a Georgia native, tweeted Sunday that state Republicans were apoplectic at the president, who they feel is sabotaging the runoff races.\\n\\nHe said the Georgia GOP is nervous about weaker turnout in certain strongholds, where figures show voting trails the rest of the state. One such area: Dalton, where Trump held the rally Monday night. In November, he beat Biden by 40% in that area.\\n\\nThat part of the state has the most GOP vote, and it has lagged behind the rest of the state, Erickson said on his website Monday. It is probably not a coincidence that this is also where the loudest 'the race was stolen' voices come from. The GOP has suppressed itself up there.\\n\\nBiden's victory in November marked the first time a Democrat seized the state in a presidential election since Bill Clinton in 1992.\\n\\nMany attribute the win to an upsurge of Black voters in the state's urban centers and growing suburbs, but others say Biden was helped by a depressed Republican vote led by moderates who were disgusted at Trump.\\n\\nTrump has been 'the air they breathe'\\n\\nWhen the president isn't trying to cast doubt on the runoffs, he is focused on his own efforts to overturn November's election, which might handcuff his ability to motivate voters to help Perdue or Loeffler in the final stretch.\\n\\nIf he is distracted by the phone call, will he actually encourage these people to vote? His legacy depends on it, but some Republicans are convinced he'd rather the GOP lose Georgia, Erickson said.\\n\\nBullock, the political science professor, said Perdue and Loeffler might feel personally uncomfortable with what Trump did but they cannot divorce themselves from the president at this point.\\n\\nDonald Trump has been the air they breathe and the blood in their veins, he said.\\n\\nBullock said avoiding the president's wrath might cost Republicans the Senate, adding that other Georgia Republicans are keeping quiet in hopes of dodging possible primary challengers during the next statewide election.\\n\\nPerdue downplayed the controversy, telling Fox News he did not think the revelation of Trump's effort to pressure the secretary of state would impact his reelection bid. Rather than criticize the president, he slammed Raffensperger.\\n\\nI'm still shocked that a member of the Republican Party would tape a sitting president and then leak that. It's disgusting in my view, Perdue said.\\n\\nRaffensperger, who said he voted for Trump, escalated the GOP civil war Monday when he said it would be appropriate for the Fulton County district attorney to investigate the president's request to find enough votes.\\n\\nAttacking Raffensperger, a civil engineer and businessman, could backfire among conservative-minded voters who feel he was simply doing his duty, Bullock said.\\n\\nI have no doubt he wishes that Georgia had voted for Trump, Bullock said. But as a data person, he did all sort of checks, and each time he did a calculation, Biden came out ahead. He's not going bury his head in the sand, and he's not going to violate the law by trying to put his thumb on the scale.\\n\\nContributing: David Jackson"}
{"original": "Tom Pelissero\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nA recent memo from NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell about best practices in the hiring process for top coaching and front-office posts seems to be having the intended effect on the diverse list of candidates receiving interview requests.\\n\\nThe question is, will that translate to a change in the makeup of those who actually get jobs?\\n\\nFollowing the NFL's annual meeting last month with the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which promotes diversity and equality of job opportunity in the league, Goodell recommended to teams the consideration of multiple minority candidates for head coach and general manager openings, as well as informally applying the so-called Rooney Rule to coordinator jobs.\\n\\nNFL coaching buzz: Latest on job openings, candidates\\n\\nFive of the six teams with head coach vacancies – the Buffalo Bills, Jacksonville Jaguars, Los Angeles Rams, San Diego Chargers and San Francisco 49ers – already have complied in terms of multiple interview requests, and the 49ers have done the same with their GM opening. Five African-American coaches have received requests, with three on the alliance's recommended list (Miami's Vance Joseph, Buffalo's Anthony Lynn and Arizona's Harold Goodwin) receiving at least three each.\\n\\nThe thing that we want to get away from is using the Rooney Rule to hinder the interview process, John Wooten, chairman of the Fritz Pollard Alliance, told USA TODAY Sports.\\n\\nIn other words, the Rooney Rule says that you have to interview at least one minority, right? And that's fine. However, in order to really know that I'm utilizing and I'm doing what the process should be in terms of making it a better place, then I'm going to interview more than just one minority. I'm going to look back over your body of work, and I'm going to interview two to three, if not four guys. … Otherwise, you're just hiring who you want to hire.\\n\\nThere was no formal change to the Rooney Rule, says Robert Gulliver, the NFL's executive vice president and chief human resources officer – Goodell's memo was strictly a recommendation on best practices and other points from the December meeting. The NFL's career advisory panel also puts out a list of top candidates that certainly includes diverse talent, Gulliver said.\\n\\nBeware, No. 1 seeds, hot teams poised to slice through NFL playoffs\\n\\nAccording to the NFL, there were six diversity hires for head coaching jobs and one for a GM job from 1990 to 2002, before the Rooney Rule was instituted in 2003. From 2003 through the 2016 season, there were 15 minority head coaches and seven minority GMs hired.\\n\\nThe way the interview process is playing out (this year) is entirely consistent with the expectations of the Rooney Rule, and that is that diverse candidates should have an opportunity to represent their candidacy, Gulliver said, adding that Wooten and the Fritz Pollard Alliance advocated for the best practices Goodell recommended.\\n\\nWhat the volume of interviews means for hiring this year remains to be seen. There was just one minority hire in each of the past two cycles: Todd Bowles with the New York Jets after the 2014 season and Hue Jackson with the Cleveland Browns after last season. Bowles is the only minority given his first NFL head-coaching job in the past five cycles, compared to 21 white coaches.\\n\\nNFL rebuild rankings: Which teams are in best shape for next season?\\n\\nIn a league where the player population is roughly 70% African-American, just five of 32 head coaches (15.6%) are black. A sixth head coach, the Carolina Panthers' Ron Rivera, is Hispanic. Six African-Americans can fairly be considered top football executives in their respective organizations.\\n\\nDon Yee – a prominent agent who has represented minority coaches and extensively studied hiring patterns – believes the Rooney Rule has served its purpose of sensitizing owners to the issue, but now should be abolished to let each organization exercise its own discretion.\\n\\nEspecially myself being a minority, said Yee, who is Asian-American, some might take the position that even categorizing a hire as a quote-unquote 'diversity hire' is stigmatizing.\\n\\nOne key everyone agrees upon is making the sure the pipeline is being fed with candidates, which on the coaching side means promoting diversity not only in coordinator jobs, but other jobs that feed those positions, such as quarterback coaches. Gulliver said Wooten is also expected to submit a recommended list of coordinator candidates to the league soon, as he has in several recent cycles.\\n\\nI think the teams are doing a heck of a job of checking out a diverse slate of guys, and I think a lot of it has to do with what's coming out of the league office, Wooten said. I think all of this combination is healthy.\\n\\nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero.\\n\\nPHOTOS: NFL pre-playoffs power rankings"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nATLANTA (AP) — Nick Saban saved his best for No. 6.\\n\\nHe's won plenty of national titles with better players than everyone else.\\n\\nThis time, it was all about the coach.\\n\\nIf there was ever any doubt that Saban will go down as the greatest ever to prowl a college sideline, it was totally erased with the championship that pulled him even with the Bear.\\n\\nIn a most un-Saban-like move, he switched quarterbacks at halftime of the national championship game, the kind of desperate ploy you might expect from a brash young up-and-comer, not a 66-year-old all about the methodical process — covering every base, accounting for every scenario, winning over and over again without a lot of drama.\\n\\nTua Tagovailoa, a ukulele-playing, left-handed freshman from Hawaii, took the field at the start of the third quarter with Alabama trailing 13-0 and doing absolutely nothing on offense. The Tide had accounted for just four first downs and 97 yards with two-year starter Jalen Hurts taking the snaps, but it was a bold decision nonetheless by the wily ol' coach.\\n\\nAfter all, this was the biggest game of the season, and Hurts was the one who led Alabama there for the second year in a row. He's a proven winner, having lost only two out of 28 games coming into Monday night, and it certainly would've been the safe bet to stick with him a little longer.\\n\\nBut Saban — who refuses to let the game pass him by even as coaches young enough to be his sons keep attempting to take him down (including former assistant Kirby Smart, who now coaches Georgia) — switched to Tagovailoa without hesitation.\\n\\nIt might go down as the greatest decision in a career filled with them.\\n\\nTagovailoa completed 14 of 24 passes for 166 yards and three touchdowns, the last of them a 41-yard strike in overtime to DeVonta Smith that gave Alabama a 26-23 victory over Georgia on Monday night.\\n\\nWe've had this in our mind that, if we were struggling offensively, that we would give Tua an opportunity, even in the last game, Saban said. No disrespect to Jalen, but ... I thought Tua would give us a better chance and a spark, which he certainly did.\\n\\nThe Tide rallied from a pair of 13-point deficits, and managed to pull it together after Andy Pappanastos shanked a 36-yard field goal try that would've won the game on the final play of regulation. Georgia went on offense first in overtime and, after Jake Fromm took a huge sack, the Bulldogs settled for Ricardo Blankenship's 51-yard field goal.\\n\\nAlabama's offense took the field and immediately fell into a huge hole. Georgia sniffed out a screen pass, Tagovailoa couldn't pick up his next option and Georgia dumped the youngster for a 16-yard loss.\\n\\nOne play later, the Tide was national champions.\\n\\nWith the poise of a veteran, Tagovailoa looked to his right, causing the Georgia safeties to slide toward that side of the field. Then he swung the other way, launching a pass to Smith streaking down the left sideline. He ran right by cornerback Malkom Parrish, who clearly thought he had help from safety Dominick Sanders, and hauled in a pass that was delivered in stride as he glided all alone into the end zone.\\n\\nSaban has now won five national titles in his 11 years at Alabama, and his first season doesn't really count since he had to rebuild a program that had become a laughingstock under a string of mediocre coaches. When you throw in a BCS title from his time at LSU (albeit a shared title, since Southern Cal was voted No. 1 in The Associated Press poll), he's matched Bryant for the most championships by any coach.\\n\\nAnd, really, Saban has the edge.\\n\\nOne of Bryant's titles comes with a huge asterisk. In 1973, the Tide finished No. 1 in the coaches' poll, which was finalized before the bowls. Alabama went on to lose to No. 2 Notre Dame 24-23 in the Sugar Bowl, giving the AP title to the Fighting Irish.\\n\\nLet's be honest, nobody outside of Tuscaloosa and the Bryant family views that team as the best in the land.\\n\\nAnother feather in Saban's cap is the way he's won his championships. During the 2011 season, the Crimson Tide stifled LSU 21-0 with one of the great defensive performances in college football history. Two years ago, Alabama needed a dynamic offense and great special teams play to pull out a 45-40 victory over Clemson.\\n\\nThis time, he had to make a change right in the middle of the game at the most prominent position on the field.\\n\\nThat's a new one, even for Saban.\\n\\nSomebody tried to give me a game ball, he said. It has to be a team ball.\\n\\nSaban shows no signs of slowing down or giving the least bit of thought to retirement. He'll celebrate this title like he did all the other ones, for about 24 hours before he gets back to work in pursuit of No. 7.\\n\\nEvery team wants to be successful, he said. The message to the team tonight after this game was I hope you take something from this game and the resiliency that you showed in this game and it helps you be more successful in life.\\n\\nIt's not just about winning the championship, Saban added, no doubt remembering a final-second loss to Clemson in last year's title game. I know that's what you all write about and what you talk about and all that. We like winning, and we hate losing. But there's more to it than that.\\n\\nWinning sure makes it a lot more fun, though.\\n\\nAs Smith hauled in the title-clinching pass, Saban ripped off his headset, threw his arms in the air and let out a bit of a scream.\\n\\nFor once in his life, he seemed caught off guard.\\n\\nIt only lasted a moment.\\n\\nI couldn't believe it, Saban said, shaking his head and repeating himself.\\n\\nI could not believe it.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

Chiefs OLB Justin Houston is expected to play after resting his surgically repaired knee for the past four weeks. LB Tamba Hali (knee) did not practice Friday.\\n\\nThree things to know: Texans (4) at Patriots (1) divisional playoff preview\\n\\nTHREE THINGS TO KNOW\\n\\n1. Home cooking? As intimidating as Arrowhead can be, the Chiefs have lost their past four home playoff games and haven't won in front of their faithful fans in postseason since the 1993 season. But it's hard to believe they won't have a significant advantage. A Pittsburgh offense that tends to be far less effective on the road anyway will also have to overcome the ear-splitting din, and a change of venue can only help after the Steelers dismantled the Chiefs 43-14 at Heinz Field in Week 4. However an ice storm headed for the region — it has already forced the NFL to move the game from Sunday afternoon to Sunday night — could wreak havoc.\\n\\n2. Hill's thrills: A middling Kansas City attack has been augmented lately by rookie WR Tyreek Hill, who's scored a touchdown of at least 68 yards each of the past four weeks. He is a threat through the air, on jet sweeps, and especially on special teams, where he's scored three times on returns. Pittsburgh must respect Hill's elite speed, and that will only open up the field for all-pro TE Travis Kelce, WR Jeremy Maclin and the running game, which is augmented by QB Alex Smith's ability to operate outside the pocket.\\n\\n3. Pitt's triplets: Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger, WR Antonio Brown and RB Le'Veon Bell showed just how dangerous they could be in their first-ever playoff game together. Big Ben found Brown for 50- and 62-yard TD passes in the first quarter of Sunday's wild-card win over the Miami Dolphins. Bell, making his postseason debut and playing for a new contract, took over from there, adding two scores on the ground along with 174 yards from scrimmage. The trio was even more dominant in the October blowout of the Chiefs, with Roethlisberger passing for 300 yards and five touchdowns (2 to Brown) while Bell racked up 178 yards from scrimmage. However it must be noted that Big Ben has been ordinary, at best, on the road in 2016 (9 TDs, 8 INTs, 59.4% completion rate, 78.4 rating) and must now also cope with a foot injury suffered against Miami.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\\n\\nPHOTOS: NFL wild-card action"}
{"original": "PHOENIX — Major League Baseball sent a detailed memo to its 30 teams Monday restricting access to their facilities and limiting voluntary workouts before the start of spring training, according to a copy of the document obtained by USA TODAY Sports.\\n\\nWhile Cleveland and several major league teams planned to open their spring-training facilities this week to their players and staff for voluntary workouts, MLB sent the memo to every team's front office with strict regulations, threatening harsh disciplinary measures to any team violating the procedures.\\n\\nWe have been informed that some clubs intend to increase the number of players at their Spring Training facilities in January and February prior to the commencement of spring training,'' the memo reads. As you are all aware, COVID-19 is surging in the United States, and conditions may worsen after the holiday season. We have not yet received firm guidance from our medical experts on whether it is safe to conduct organized workouts in Club facilities under current conditions, and the protocols that would be required to conduct such workouts safely.\\n\\nWe also have not yet negotiated with the Players Association over the health and safety protocols that will be applicable to 2021 Spring Training and the 2021 season. Finally, the intensive COVID-19 testing protocol that we utilized in 2020, which is necessary when the risk of community transmission is high, will not be available to clubs from central baseball until the start of Spring Training.\\n\\nAs a result, until the commencement of spring training … clubs may not direct, encourage, or request (even on a voluntary basis) that players travel from their present locations to the club's spring training site for the purpose of utilizing club facilities.\\n\\nSpring training is scheduled to commence Feb. 17 with Opening Day on April 1, but MLB has discussed delaying the season with the surge of COVID-19 cases. Major League Baseball Players Association is adamant that the season start on time, with the players receiving their full salaries after receiving only 60 games of pay in 2020.\\n\\nMLB informed clubs in their memo sent Monday that only three categories of players may access their facilities before the start of spring training:\\n\\nPlayers who have a permanent residence proximate to their facilities.\\n\\nPlayers who require entry to the facility to receive medical care.\\n\\nPlayers who have been approved to attend a club-organized mini-camp under the terms of the Basic Agreement.\\n\\nThe only players who will be provided transportation and housing are those who require medical care and have been approved to attend a mini-camp. No other program or camp may be conducted prior to spring training, including programs for minor league players. Clubs are strictly prohibited from inviting players to participate in workouts, arranging transportation and housing for players, organizing player workouts except with permission, or conducting large group workouts.\\n\\n2021:MLB, union at odds on whether to delay start of 2021 season\\n\\nINDIANS: Cleveland plans to change nickname after 2021 season\\n\\nThose in violation, the memo says, will be subject to significant discipline by the Commissioner.''\\n\\nWhile we recognize that clubs desire to get their players ready for the season,'' the memo reads, we need to balance that objective with the very real health and safety risks that gathering players presents when the risk of COVID-19 transmission is high. Outbreaks of COVID-19 at club facilities in January or February prior to the time that spring training commences and without protocols agreed to by the Players Association in place may make it more difficult in certain jurisdictions to obtain approval for our protocols.''\\n\\nArizona, which hosts 15 major-league teams during spring training, has the highest rate of COVID-19 cases in the United States, according to date from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nArizona's rate of new cases the past week was 121.8 per 100,000 people, nearly twice the national average of 64.7. There were 62,047 over the last seven days in Arizona, including more than 17,000 on Sunday, the state's new single-day record.\\n\\nMLB will also require that each club provides a list of players who request access to their facilities before the start of spring training. Teams must also maintain daily records of all players and staff members who enter the facility, including arrival and departure times, and temperature readings.\\n\\nThere are mandatory temperature checks and COVID-19 symptom screenings for anyone entering the facility, with no one permitted with a temperature above 100.4 degrees or exhibits any COVID-19 symptoms. The clubs are responsible for arranging for COVID-19 PCR testing at its own cost. Face coverings must be worn at all times indoors with only one staff member permitted to supervise any individual workout. And all meals will be prohibited in the facility until further notice.\\n\\nThere will be a limit of 10 players and 10 staff members permitted into the facility at the same time with only five people permitted in the clubhouse at any one time. Until the 2021 health and safety protocols are completed, minor-league players will be limited to using facilities that are not occupied by players on the 40-man roster, including clubhouses, batting cages, weight rooms, and cafeterias.\\n\\nMLB is also asking that players and staff members continue to stay home as much as possible, avoid public or crowded areas, including restaurants and bars.\\n\\nWe intend to have specific protocols for 2021 addressing the conduct of players and staff when away from the stadium, according to the memo. Until those protocols are agreed-upon with the Players Association, the off-the-field conduct of players and staff is the most significant risk that clubs must manage to maintain a COVID-free environment in their facilities.''\\n\\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter @Bnightengale"}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nAMES, Iowa (AP) — In less than a year, Iowa State has gone from not having enough quality players to having perhaps too many for the minutes available.\\n\\nHow coach Steve Prohm handles the situation will determine the Big 12 fate of the Cyclones. The early returns suggest he won't try to keep everyone happy.\\n\\nDespite having arguably a dozen Big 12-level players, Prohm largely stuck with a seven-man rotation in Wednesday's 69-63 win over Oklahoma State. That is not likely to change when the Cyclones (11-2, 1-0 Big 12) host No. 5 Kansas (12-1, 1-0) on Saturday.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, you can't just throw in 10 or 11 guys in there just because you think you have them, Prohm said. You have to play the guys you think can win, and if you're running guys in and out I think that sometimes defeats the purpose. Everybody has different philosophies.\\n\\nIowa State brought back a pair of starters in Lindell Wigginton and Solomon Young in late December, which left the team completely healthy for the first time all season.\\n\\nBut Prohm became so comfortable with his starting five in their absence that he has continued to use it, even though Wigginton has played starter-type minutes since coming back and will do so for the rest of the year, according to Prohm.\\n\\nThe bottom line is, in this league you need finishers, Prohm said when asked if Wigginton will rejoin the starting lineup.\\n\\nPoint guard Tyrese Haliburton — once Wigginton's de facto replacement — has made himself surprisingly indispensable as a freshman. The 6-foot-5 Haliburton's versatility has helped spark an offense that ranks first in the Big 12 at 82.3 points per game and second in the league at 48.5 percent shooting.\\n\\nHaliburton, once a prime candidate for a redshirt, is averaging 8.3 points, 4.5 rebounds, 4.2 rebounds and 2.1 steals while shooting 45 percent on 3s and committing just 11 turnovers.\\n\\nIt's just about finding your role and adapting to that role, Haliburton said. For some guys it could be scoring 20 points. For some guys, it could be getting 10 rebounds. For me, I just think I bring a lot of energy to this team, and that's my main role right now.\\n\\nOne of the guys that hasn't consistently cracked Prohm's rotation is sophomore Cam Lard, who seemed on the verge of stardom just a year ago. Prohm did make Lard his first post player off the bench against the Cowboys, and Lard could play a major role on Saturday against the likes of Kansas big men Dedric Lawson and Udoka Azubuike.\\n\\nLard played a season-high 16 minutes in Stillwater.\\n\\nI thought he made a huge difference for us defensively, Prohm said. He just gave us a presence I think we need in this league at the rim. He was dialed in, but it took him a while ... that was the first step, and now he's got to take the next step.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}

{"original": "Alexander Liebeskind\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nGiven the polarized racial climate of our society, it is all too easy to pick a side.  'Crazy Rich Asians' is going to change Hollywood. It's about time, reads the headline on Karen K. Ho's optimistic article for Time magazine. She extols the first modern story with an all-Asian cast and an Asian-American lead in 25 years, and she's not wrong.\\n\\nBut then again, neither is the opposite take. For some viewers, 'Crazy Rich Asians' is not Asian enough, Mike Ives counters in The New York Times, citing descriptions of the film as problematic and oppressive.\\n\\nWe laud this movie as a cinematic masterpiece and disregard its defects, or we point out its faults and discredit its significance as a culturally revolutionary film. Now that the dust has settled, and Crazy Rich Asians has been nominated for two Golden Globe awards, we mustn't overlook the insight the film grants us if we don't reduce it to a good-bad binary.\\n\\nWe all know cultural appropriation is bad. Before I was capable of understanding what the words meant, I knew they were dirty.\\n\\nRead more commentary:\\n\\n'Black Panther' highlights Africa's centuries of greatness, empowers students of color\\n\\nWhy 'Crazy Rich Asians' made me cry\\n\\n#MeToo and inclusion riders are great. But should I worry about my son?\\n\\nThe sentiment was everywhere. My elementary school teachers showed me villainized photos of rice-farmer Halloween costumes, warning us of the insensitive bigots we could inadvertently become if we weren't careful. My Cantonese mother imbued me with a visceral aversion to Oriental-theme parties, which threatened cultural erasure by perpetuating stereotypes that all Asians are the same.\\n\\nThese lessons served me well. I implicitly knew that cultural appropriation should be avoided at all costs, and I was also aware that it could happen by accident. I understood the offense many took when Scarlett Johansson was cast as lead Motoko Kusanagi in the live action version of the Japanese manga Ghost in the Shell, and the way it potentially trivialized Asian culture to a movie theme while suggesting that Asian actors and actresses themselves are less than desirable.\\n\\nWhen Crazy Rich Asians hit theaters several months ago, I was similarly disgruntled. I gasped at the outdated, Confucian, misogynistic stereotype the film perpetuated by suggesting that powerful Asian women must sacrifice their careers, and frowned at the cherry-picked dumpling parties and mahjong games that threatened to reduce Asian culture to a means of entertainment. Under the false guise of economic profitability, the film homogenized the term Asian, supplanting sub-Asian diversity with a myopically fair-skinned, wealthy, British-accented version.\\n\\n'Crazy Rich Asians' makes Asians seem sexy\\n\\nYet no offense was taken. Instead, Asians and non-Asians alike overlooked these deficiencies, labeled Crazy Rich Asians a cinematic triumph, and declared it the momentous step forward that the industry so direly needed.\\n\\nTo my surprise, I largely agreed.\\n\\nIn case you haven't heard enough about the #OscarsSoWhite cinematic environment in which we find ourselves, Crazy Rich Asians is monumental. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was more than 92 percent white as recently as 2016, and the last full-Asian cast took place a quarter-century ago.\\n\\nThe film turns Singaporean society to an opulent potpourri of food, cars and glamour, making Asianness seem enviable in the process. In fact, in glorifying the Asian romance between Nick Young and Rachel Chu, Crazy Rich Asians actually makes Asians themselves sexy.\\n\\nCultural appropriation and celebration, too\\n\\nIn certain respects, Crazy Rich Asians certainly does commit cultural appropriation, and we must be prepared to acknowledge that. Yet if we stubbornly degrade it as a failure to embrace Asian culture, we lose sight of the unprecedented wave of Asian popularity that it has catalyzed, redefining our perception of Asianness in and outside of cinema. Cultural appropriation and cultural celebration, despite popular opinion, are not mutually exclusive.\\n\\nAt a time when Hollywood is trying to change, this proof of coexistence could not be any more pertinent. While the #OscarsSoWhite movement speaks to a lack of representation, it simultaneously illustrates a decisive awareness and calls attention to progress that can't be ignored. Last year's Black Panther, for instance, paralleled Crazy Rich Asians in its attempt to revolutionize cinematic representation and cultural norms.\\n\\nOn a less dramatic scale, If Beale Street Could Talk (which opened last month) and Miss Bala (opening Feb. 1) constantly question the cinematic portrayal of culture. We can either swallow our qualms about cultural appropriation and accept it as a necessary evil, or we can negate the potential of film to redefine cultural norms in the same way Crazy Rich Asians has.\\n\\nEven when the excitement over Crazy Rich Asians fades, its redefinition of cultural appropriation will remain critical. Let's not forget this nuance during awards season.\\n\\nAlexander Liebeskind, a Los Angeles native, is a student at the Fu Foundation School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Columbia University.

How could they close down the largest and most traveled bridge in the U.S. and he didn't know about it?\\n\\nPolitical analyst Matthew Hale said Christie's speech was designed to present the governor as the best option for current Trump supporters who eventually will change course.\\n\\nDonald Trump literally took the bully pulpit away from Chris Christie when he entered the race, said Hale, an associate professor of political science at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. As tough as Governor Christie is, no one can out-bully The Donald. Christie is trying to be the bully with a brain, giving GOP primary voters the indignation and anger towards Democrats and Obama but also ideas that could actually happen.\\n\\nTrump, who usually takes to Twitter to respond to attacks, had no immediate response. He had a 7 p.m. ET rally in Lowell, Mass.\\n\\nIn his speech, Christie had plenty of criticism of President Barack Obama and likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. But he warned Republicans to avoid siding with inexperienced candidates.\\n\\nTrump, retired surgeon Ben Carson and former Chief Executive Carly Fiorina haven't been elected officials and have claimed that being a government outsider is an asset.\\n\\nUSA TODAY GOP Power Rankings: Year ends with Trump still in front\\n\\nIf we are going to turn our frustration and anger with the D.C. insiders, the politicians of yesterday and the carnival barkers of today into something that will actually change American lives for the better, we must elect someone who has been tested — someone with proven experience, someone who knows how to make decisions because he has been making them for years, in the middle of the firefight that's been going on the last seven years between big government liberalism and our brand of freedom-loving conservatism, Christie said.\\n\\nHale said Christie was sounding the right notes.\\n\\nAs voters get closer to actually voting, it seems that Trump's more outlandish and impossible ideas will lose some luster, and Christie wants to be the alternative, Hale said. Christie has played the adult in the room before in a number of his early New Jersey budget speeches. It is a great strategy for him to try and replicate on the presidential stage.\\n\\nChristie gains in N.H. and Trump notices\\n\\nChristie also urged Republicans to coalesce around a candidate electable in November.\\n\\nAs a party we should welcome and encourage disagreement and debate, but Republicans have to work together and be willing to compromise to reach solutions on our most important issues, Christie said. In the absence of meaningful solutions on issues like national security, the economy and immigration, Hillary Clinton will be elected our next president and no part of the Republican agenda will come to fruition.\\n\\nFollow Bob Jordan on Twitter: @bobjordanAPP\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nDeclared 2016 GOP candidate: Ted Cruz\\n\\nDeclared 2016 GOP candidate: Chris Christie\\n\\nDeclared 2016 GOP candidate: Marco Rubio\\n\\nDeclared 2016 GOP candidate: Donald Trump"}

Obviously, he's one of the greats, Frost said about Bryant. This is a team award. I'm just happy to represent the players and coaches that had such a phenomenal year.\\n\\nFrost is first since former Boise State coach Chris Petersen in 2009 with a non-Power 5 program.\\n\\nThis completes the awards season for Frost. In the past few weeks, Frost also claimed the Home Depot Coach of the Year, American Football Coaches Association Coach of the Year, AP Coach of the Year and Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year awards.\\n\\nUCF rolled past Memphis 62-55 in the American Athletic Conference Championship game, and beat Auburn 34-27 in the Chick-Fil-A Peach Bowl to finish 13-0. UCF finished ranked No. 6 in the final AP Poll of the season, receiving four first place votes.\\n\\nIf this year taught me anything it's that with the current structure I don't think a Group of 5 team has a chance, Frost said. (The CFB Playoff Committee) kept us at a comfortable distance from the Top 5 and Top 10 for a long time, even when we were undefeated. Continued move two and three loss teams ahead of us. It's obvious to me that they don't have that intention to have that debate. Hopefully that will change.\\n\\nWhen asked about the current state of the College Football Playoff, Frost said he believes it should be expanded to eight teams. This would include the five conference champions and then three at-large bids.\\n\\nSteve Spurrier was honored with the Bryant Lifetime Achievement Award.\\n\\nIt's very nice, Spurrier said. I was telling somebody I'm the only coach here that Bear Bryant recruited me out of high school. I visited Alabama way back in 1962. Alabama was playing Miami that day. ... It was only 3-3 at halftime and Alabama won 36-3. They clobbered them in the second half.\\n\\nSpurrier finished his career as the winningest coach at Florida (122-27-1) and South Carolina (86-49).\\n\\nHe was really good to all the coaches all over the country, Spurrier said about Bryant.

The NFC East title has changed hands for the 16th straight season, Rivera capturing it in his first season taking over a Washington team that went 3-13 a year earlier.\\n\\nIt is Washington's first title since 2015.\\n\\nThe Giants (6-10) went to bed disappointed. New York had outlasted the Cowboys (6-10) 23-19 in a Sunday afternoon game at MetLife Stadium, enough to keep the team's playoff hopes alive in the case Washington lost. When Eagles coach Doug Pederson pulled quarterback Jalen Hurts in the fourth quarter and sent in backup Nate Sudfeld with Philadelphia trailing by 3 (Carson Wentz was a healthy scratch), Giants players didn't hesitate to question Pederson's motives.\\n\\nI think the Eagles just hate us more than Washington, Giants receiver Golden Tate tweeted during the fourth quarter. That's only thing that could make sense right?\\n\\nEven the NBC TV crew openly questioned the move.\\n\\nI could not have done it, analyst Cris Collinsworth said about the QB change. You have men out there fighting their guts out.\\n\\nPederson said in his postgame press conference the decision to play Sudfeld was his and he was not trying to throw the game. Sudfeld's playing time, paired with Pederson's decision to eschew a field goal and go for it on 4th-and-4, down 17-14 with 2:01 to play in the third quarter, perplexed fans.\\n\\nYes, I was coaching to win, Pederson said Nate has been here for four years and I felt that he deserved an opportunity to get some snaps. Listen: If there's anything out there that thinks I was not trying to win the game, (tight end Zach) Ertz was out there, (defensive end) Brandon Graham was out there, (receiver) Darius Slay was out there. All our top guys were still on the field at the end.\\n\\nWe were going to win the game.\\n\\nSudfeld finished with a 14.6 rating after completing 5 of 12 pass attempts for 32 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in addition to a lost fumble. He also rushed twice for 12 total yards. Hurts completed 7 of 20 attempts for 72 yards and an interception, though he rushed 8 times for 34 yards and two scores.\\n\\nWith the loss, the Eagles dropped to 4-11-1 and rose to the sixth overall selection in the 2021 draft. The Cowboys will pick at 10 and the Giants 11, perks of a division whose 23 combined wins were worst in the NFL.\\n\\nSix of eight divisions won at least 32 combined games. But questions loom for Philadelphia, including at quarterback, where Wentz's four-year, $128 million extension runs through 2024. Hurts, the Eagles' 2020 second-round draft selection, replaced Wentz on Dec. 6 vs., the Packers and never relinquished the job. In twelve-plus games this season, Wentz threw 16 touchdowns to 15 interceptions and fumbled 10 times (four lost).\\n\\nWashington's quarterback play Sunday night featured its own ball-security issues, quarterback Alex Smith, throwing two interceptions and having a fumble his team recovered. He completed 22 of 32 attempts for 162 yards and two touchdowns.\\n\\nSmith's issues don't overshadow the remarkable comeback his season, and a postseason advancement, represent.\\n\\nSmith suffered a gruesome broken leg in 2018 that ultimately required 17 surgeries, an infection risking his leg and life in the process. His return to play in 2020 far exceeded expectations for the man who wondered if he would walk again.\\n\\nIn seven games, he completed 168 of 252 pass attempts (66.6%) for 1,582 yards, six touchdowns and eight interceptions.\\n\\nEven Smith, in a postgame interview with Sunday Night Football sideline reporter Michele Tafoya, was incredulous. What would he have said had he been told before the season that he'd lead Washington to the division title?\\n\\nI wouldn't have believed you in a million years, Smith told Tafoya.

{"original": "Gallery Photos: Best of Anthony Smith view 23 images\\n\\nIt wasn't Anthony Smith's plan to talk his way into a fight with Jon Jones while on the air after UFC 232.\\n\\nDuring a FOX production meeting prior to the pay-per-view event, Smith said there was an agreement across the table that he wouldn't interview Jones. It was better to avoid a clash that could irritate the UFC star.\\n\\nI wanted to be respectful and be the better person and not stick myself in that situation to where I would be the one looking like the (expletive), Smith told MMAjunkie on Saturday.\\n\\nThings didn't quite go according to plan when Jones (23-1 MMA, 17-1 UFC) picked up a FOX microphone. After Jones scored a third-round TKO win over Alexander Gustafsson, analyst Kenny Florian asked the newly minted UFC champion about fighting Smith (31-13 MMA, 7-3 UFC) if he didn't go on to face rival Daniel Cormier.\\n\\nAnd then the camera pans to me, and they need, like, a response, Smith said. And so I just kept it super simple, like, 'What have you got planned for July?'\\n\\nFormer UFC middleweight champ Michael Bisping egged on Smith, urging him to say more. But Jones had already latched on to his light heavyweight colleague and accused Smith of using the FOX platform to book a title fight.\\n\\nWhich really pissed me off, because I actually did the opposite, Smith said.\\n\\nOne week later, Smith clearly has Jones' attention. The light heavyweight champ hinted at an upcoming fight on social media. He even quoted a Smith interview where Smith vowed a fight any time, anywhere and any place. And late Saturday night, Jones hinted big news coming soon in a post on Instagram, which was followed by a TMZ report that Jones vs. Smith is in the works for UFC 235 on March 2 in Las Vegas, despite Jones still needing to be licensed by the Nevada State Athletic Commission.\\n\\nDoes this mean Smith is the next person to meet Jones in the octagon? He's not so sure.\\n\\nAs big of an idiot as he is, he's also very, very smart, Smith said. So I would imagine him posting about me and insinuating that's the next fight is doing one of two things: He's either trying to sign for more money in a different fight, or he's going to try and back me into a corner.\\n\\nSmith thinks it's the latter, and what that means is a fight under circumstances favorable to Jones, like a headliner on four weeks' notice at UFC 235. The short notice is the logical conclusion Smith sees to a favorable outcome with the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which called Jones before the commission to discuss an adverse drug test prompting the move of UFC 232 from Nevada to California.\\n\\nI'm smart enough to know that that's a possibility, that he may be waiting, because he's posting quotes of things that I'm saying. Like, what is the reason behind that? The only thing that even makes any sense is he knows I'm going to be presented with an opportunity. You said you'd fight him any time, anywhere, any place. Well, here it is on four weeks' notice.\\n\\nOr, Smith added, it could be the former option, which means Jones is really angling for more money to move up to heavyweight, where a lucrative trilogy fight against Daniel Cormier resides, and Smith is simply the bait to entice the UFC to pay up.\\n\\nI don't know what's happening behind the scenes, Smith said. Jon controls all the cards right now. He's the best goddamn guy to ever fight, and regardless of what we say about him, I don't think PEDs change that. I think he's the best fighter we've ever seen, regardless.\\n\\nSmith still believes he's the man to upset Jones, and he's been lining up a fight since an upset of ex-champ Mauricio Shogun Rua this past July. Part of his job has been to draw headlines. He's been very outspoken about the champ's history with drug tests, firmly convinced Jones has cheated by using steroids. He's vowed to deliver a beating whether Bones is clean or not.\\n\\nCompetitively, Smith has spoken loudest with three pivotal wins in 2018. None of them, of course, have impressed Jones, who said as much during their confrontation on air.\\n\\nAs meticulous as he's been to get to this point, Smith swears he didn't plan for the viral moment that might clear the way for a title shot. This one, he was just in the right place at the right time – with a hot mic.\\n\\nI was presented an opportunity, and I took it, Smith said. It worked out, obviously. I didn't have to do anything, and my name is in the headlines.\\n\\nFor more on the UFC's schedule, check out the UFC Rumors section of the site."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nSAN DIEGO (AP) — Mike McCoy will return as coach of the Chargers despite a 4-12 record this season.\\n\\nThe next big question is whether he'll be coaching them in San Diego or Los Angeles.\\n\\nI'm very thankful for the opportunity to be back, McCoy said Monday, a day after the Chargers lost at Denver to go winless in the AFC West for the first time since 1984, the year Alex Spanos bought the team.\\n\\nAlex Spanos' son, Dean, the team's chairman, said late Monday that the team had applied for relocation to Carson in suburban Los Angeles, citing a lack of public support to help subsidize a stadium. The Chargers want to partner with the Raiders on a stadium in Carson while the St. Louis Rams are also seeking approval for a move to nearby Inglewood. NFL owners could decide next week whether any of the teams move before next season.\\n\\nAsked if he's the right guy to lead the Chargers into the nation's second-biggest market, McCoy said: Without a doubt. I can't wait for the opportunity. We're all ready to roll.\\n\\nThen, he added: I'm ready to be the coach wherever it is. I'm excited just to be the head football coach of the Chargers. It's all speculation up to this point in time what's going to happen. In a couple of weeks we'll figure out what we're going to do.\\n\\nMcCoy is 23-27 in three seasons, including a playoff win and loss in his first season, 2013. He has one year left on his contract.\\n\\nThe Chargers failed to beat a team with a winning record in posting their worst record since also going 4-12 in 2003. Overall, they've lost 18 of their last 26 games under McCoy.\\n\\nMcCoy has been criticized for conservative game plans and clock-management issues.\\n\\nA few hours after McCoy met with the media, the Chargers fired much of their offensive staff, including coordinator Frank Reich. Others let go were offensive line coach Joe D'Alessandris, tight ends coach Pete Metzelaars, wide receivers coach Fred Graves, defensive line coach Don Johnson and assistant offensive line coach Andrew Dees. Special teams coach Kevin Spencer on Dec. 2.\\n\\nThe Spanos family has a history of making curious coaching decisions. They kept Mike Riley after he went 1-15 in 2000 and fired Marty Schottenheimer after he led the Chargers to a 14-2 record in 2006 and the AFC's top seed in the playoffs, where they were upset at home by the New England Patriots. Dean Spanos sided with then-general manager A.J. Smith, who had a power struggle with Schottenheimer.\\n\\nDean Spanos' son John, the president of football operations, said in a statement that he has utmost confidence in McCoy and general manager Tom Telesco.\\n\\nTelesco received a contract extension during the summer but the team tried to keep it secret. Word of that deal leaked out in December.\\n\\nNeither John Spanos nor Telesco returned messages seeking comment about McCoy.\\n\\nSan Diego has missed the playoffs five times in six seasons. Even with Philip Rivers at quarterback, the Chargers have lost eight straight and 10 of their last 12 games against AFC West rivals.\\n\\nRivers said bringing back McCoy was the right thing to do.\\n\\nAs the quarterback I was certainly supportive of that, hoped that was going to be the case, Rivers said. We know and Mike knows, everybody in this building knows, it wasn't good enough this year, any of us. I wasn't good enough, Mike, none of us were.

They would rather have time off. They all love competing, but the All-Star Game hasn't been competition for a long while.\\n\\nThe game has become the annual NHL convention. We all show up, talk to players on Friday about the state of the game, and then celebrate the sport with a skill demonstration on Saturday and Sunday. Usually, what players say on Friday is more interesting than the rest of the weekend.\\n\\nThe NHL All-Star concept is outdated, and there doesn't appear to be anything the league can do about it. If there was, it would have been done by now.\\n\\nThe league is trying to spice it up again this season by making it a three-on-three competition. The novelty might help a bit, but it can't change the fundamental reason the All-Star concept doesn't work anymore.\\n\\nNo player wants to play hard enough in an exhibition to risk injury that would take them out of their regular competition. And no owner or general manager wants his players competing hard in an All-Star Game for the same reason.\\n\\nIt's no one's fault that the All-Star concept doesn't work. It's a byproduct of the evolution of the sports.\\n\\nAs pay has increased for players, it makes less sense for them to risk injury in games that don't affect the standings. The NHL doesn't want to cancel the event because it is still a major economic boon, and cities still want them for the same reason. Despite the lack of competition, fans still want to see these events.\\n\\nThe only way to make this game competitive again would be to mix in nationalism. It isn't logical for players to risk injury in international tournaments, either, but players do because nationalistic pride takes charge of their thinking. That's why owners are fearful of players going to the Olympics, and every player wants to go there.\\n\\nIf you wanted the All-Star Game to be a true competition, you could have NHL All-Stars face a Kontinental Hockey League All-Star team and a real game might break out. But that won't happen.\\n\\nFive reasons why the USA fell to Russia at the World Junior Championships\\n\\nThat's why no one should be outraged by Scott being voted in. The idea of fan balloting is allow the fans to pick the players they want.\\n\\nThey have said they want the 6-8 Scott, who has five goals, 11 points and 542 penalty minutes in 285 career games.\\n\\nThe chief complaint is Scott isn't a true fan selection, that the campaign to get him elected started as an act of comedy because he seemed like the least likely person to be an All-Star.\\n\\nSo what? Who cares why it started? If fans believed this idea was fun enough to make it work for Scott, why shouldn't we laud them for their successful campaign?\\n\\nIt's not as if the NHL should have been surprised by fans finding a cause in the balloting process. Vancouver Canucks defenseman Rory Fitzpatrick nearly made it in 2006. Last season, Latvian fans worked overtime to successfully get their countryman, Zemgus Girgensons of the Buffalo Sabres, into the game.\\n\\nI can't wait to see who fans anoint as their candidate for next year's All-Star Game. Maybe electing a unique player will become part of All-Star tradition.\\n\\nI might feel differently if Scott was offended by this. But he appears to have decided to have fun with it. He said he is going to attend the game. Good for him.\\n\\nTruth is, America loves an underdog. Maybe we should see it as fitting that a journeyman player finally is recognized. It would be better if the journeyman player were a sixth defenseman who played regularly, not a guy who has been a healthy scratch more than he has played.\\n\\nBut we can't have everything. Maybe it's enough that Scott's presence will ensure that at least one All-Star will be overwhelmingly thrilled to be there.\\n\\nJANUARY'S TOP PERFORMANCES:"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nASHBURN, Va. (AP) — Looking mighty spiffy in his Washington Redskins retro, ketchup-and-mustard-colored, Starter pullover jacket, Kirk Cousins strode to the podium on Wednesday to speak to reporters about his first NFL postseason start.\\n\\nWell, I didn't do a press conference before the last playoff game, Cousins noted with a smile, referring to his role as the backup to Robert Griffin III when both were rookies in 2012.\\n\\nIt has a different feel being the starting quarterback, (but) you just try to stay focused on the same processes I have all year long. I'd be a fool to change something now.\\n\\nTruth is, of course, Cousins has changed quite a bit over the course of this season. He went from a turnover-prone, second-guessing player to a guy who is considered one of the Redskins' strengths as the NFC East champions (9-7) head into their wild-card game against the visiting Green Bay Packers (10-6) on Sunday.\\n\\nA significant factor in the fourth-round draft pick's improvement has been the group of receivers he has at his disposal — and a willingness to let those pass-catchers use their talents to help him.\\n\\nHe seems more confident and aggressive on the field. Before, you weren't really expecting him to throw the ball in tight, tight situations, tight end Jordan Reed said.\\n\\nNow that he's feeling good, he's fitting those balls in tight coverage, and giving us a chance to make plays.\\n\\nIn addition to Reed, whose 87 catches, 952 yards and 11 TDs all topped the team in the regular season, Cousins has developed quite a rapport with speedy-as-they-come wideout DeSean Jackson, right-place-right-time receiver Pierre Garcon and rookie slot man Jamison Crowder.\\n\\nThe first thing they've done to help is they get open, Cousins said. They're talented, but they work hard. They prepare hard during the week. They communicate well with me. And all of that leads to success on Sundays.\\n\\nI feel very fortunate to have the group of receivers that I have to work with, because it makes my job as a distributor a lot easier.\\n\\nHe sure made it look easy over the second half of the season. Looking just at the past 10 weeks, Cousins threw 23 touchdowns and only three interceptions.\\n\\nIn all, he led the NFL with a 69.8 completion rate and ranked fifth in passer rating at 101.6, ahead of more-heralded QBs such as Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers, Pittsburgh's Ben Roethlisberger, New Orleans' Drew Brees and Carolina's Cam Newton.\\n\\nEverybody, in general, has a better feel of where to go, how to get there, Redskins coach Jay Gruden said, and Kirk is doing a great job of knowing who to get it to.\\n\\nReed, who led NFC tight ends in catches, is the go-to player who certainly appears to be impossible for defenders to cover, especially if a linebacker or safety is left to try to deal with him.\\n\\nJackson is one of the league's top deep threats.\\n\\nAs far as the success that me and Kirk have had, it's just really been building trust and just knowing where I'm going to be at, said Jackson, whose 77-yard TD against Buffalo in Week 15 was his 20th score of at least 60 yards, tied for third-most in NFL history. I'm just doing my job, he's doing his job, and we're having fun doing it and winning at the same time.\\n\\nNotes: No one missed practice; CB Dashaun Phillips (stinger) was a full participant. ... A day after being activated off IR, C Kory Lichtensteiger (neck) got back in the flow of things, getting in some extra hitting after the formal practice ended. A couple of the practice squad D-linemen were nice enough to put the pads on and bang around a little bit with me, he said.

{"original": "Jimmy Hascup\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nTwo former fourth overall picks are changing teams in a trade that will have a major affect on the landscape of the NHL now — and at least several years to come.\\n\\nThe Columbus Blue Jackets shipped embattled center Ryan Johansen, the 2010 No. 4 pick, to the Nashville Predators in exchange for defenseman Seth Jones, the 2013 No. 4 pick, on Wednesday night.\\n\\nWhy it makes sense for Predators\\n\\n— In dire need of a frontline forward. The Predators rank 18th in goals per game and aren't getting enough production from their forwards. They lack enough game-breakers to back down defenses. Entering Jan. 6, only two forwards (Mike Ribeiro and Craig Smith) ranked in the top 100 in points per 60 minutes at even strength among forwards with at least 400 minutes. They have two forwards in double digits in goals, James Neal (15) and Filip Forsberg (10). In a down year, Johansen is tied for second on the Predators with 26 points. His puck luck (six goals on 88 shots) should improve as he's a career 11% goal scorer. Johansen would've led the Predators in goals and points the past two years.\\n\\nPredators acquire Ryan Johansen for Seth Jones\\n\\n— Johansen has star ability. It's very rare to be able to acquire a first-line center talent through a trade. The best centers are often drafted and retained. Johansen appeared to be on the brink of becoming one of the game's best after he recorded 26 goals and 71 points as a 22-year-old. He also has the size (6-3, 203 pounds) teams covet down the middle.\\n\\n— Trading from strength. The Predators boasted the deepest defense in the league. For as good as Jones is and can be, he was receiving the second-lowest even-strength ice time among regular blue liners. Only Barret Jackman received less. Led by Roman Josi and Shea Weber, this corps is still very good. Anthony Bitetto will get his chance now.\\n\\n— Johansen is affordable. He has two years left on a deal that carries a $4 million cap hit. Then he'll become a restricted free agent. General manager David Poile still has more than $7.5 million in cap space with which to upgrade the offense if needed. He will also do his best to lock up Johansen long-term.\\n\\nWhy it makes sense for the Blue Jackets\\n\\n— Cornerstone defenseman. Jack Johnson is miscast as a top defenseman. Ryan Murray has top-pair ability but has mirrored the team's struggles this year. Jones is scratching the surface of his potential, even if the one goal and 11 points don't fully show it. He had eight goals and 27 points as a 20-year-old in 2014-15. It's not often you can add a defenseman with Jones' all-around ability. He also has a right-handed shot and should thrive with more responsibility. Jones is also still in the final year of his entry-level contract.\\n\\n30 things we've learned from NHL's first half\\n\\n— Blue Jackets' problems start on defense. Columbus has given up the most goals in the NHL at 3.17 per game. It's not all on the goaltending either. Jones has driven play at a 58% clip, 8% better than Columbus' best possession blueliner, Dalton Prout. Jones also suppresses shot attempts very well and is a heady player, making the smart first passes out of the defensive zone. He will be a lockdown presence into the future.\\n\\n— Auston Matthews effect. The Blue Jackets are losing their most talented offensive player. But they could gain an all-world talent in the next draft. Their 33 points are the fewest in the NHL. Adding a promising defenseman won't do enough to change their course this year. They would seem to be in good position to give themselves the opportunity for the first pick, where Matthews is the favorite. They'd still only have a 20% chance of making it happen, though.\\n\\n— Pieces didn't fit. There were bad feelings between Johansen and the Blue Jackets ever since the start of negotiations on his current contract. Johansen didn't want a bridge deal. Then the Blue Jackets slumped, brought in coach John Tortorella and he questioned Johansen's fitness level. Johansen even spent time on the fourth line and was a healthy scratch.\\n\\nThe edge\\n\\n— You can't win in the NHL without horses down the middle, and you can't win without dependability on defense. That being said, I'll take the 23-year-old center who has flashed his potential over the kid defenseman who has yet to fully display his."}

We all should be up here together. She jokes about her film's title – It was called 'The Wife': No wonder it took 14 years to get made – but was emotional when talking about her mom.

All we have to do is talk and not judge people by their differences. We all want the same thing.\\n\\n10:44: Olivia Colman gets the royal treatment, taking best actress in a comedy or musical for her role as Queen Anne in The Favourite.

I have to write some thank-you notes, she says, wrapping up her speech and worrying she forgot some folks.\\n\\n10:14: Nobody told me I had to follow Jeff Bridges. Who wants to do that? Harrison Ford deadpans, coming out to present the best director honor. The Globe goes to Alfonso Cuaron, giving Roma its second win of the night. He says the movie was really directed by his family and his country of Mexico, this very complex lab that created me.\\n\\n10:02: Chris Pine comes on stage to honor His Dudeness, Jeff Bridges, with the Cecil B. DeMille Award. Jeff, you are not only a master craftsman but also a truly kind and wonderful gentleman, Pine says of his Hell or High Water co-star before a Bridges highlight reel narrated by Sam Elliott. Bridges strolls up to a standing ovation and gives out a Woooooo! and an Aw, man! He thanks his sweetheart, wife Susan, and brother Beau, plus shows off his late father Lloyd's cuff links that he's wearing. We can make a difference. We can turn this ship in the way we want, man, with love, Bridges says in closing.\\n\\n9:55: Darren Criss wins his first Globe, for best actor in a limited series for The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. I feel like I won a fan contest. Brian May's over there, Criss says pointing out the Queen guitarist. He dedicates the award to his firecracker Filipino mom, who he says is hugely responsible for his success.\\n\\n9:50: Roma takes best foreign-language film, which should shock no one. Cinema is at its best when it tears down walls and builds bridges, and shows us how much we have in common, says Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron.\\n\\n9:43: Look at all of us! What a bunch of lucky buggers we are, Vice star Christian Bale says to the audience accepting the award for best actor in a comedy or musical.

When the show comes back from commercial, Samberg asks her, Was it fun to win? Her straight-faced response: I have no idea what's happening.\\n\\n9:17: Regina King takes supporting actress in a movie for If Beale Street Could Talk. Amy, thank you for the prayers, sweetheart, King says to her fellow nominee, Amy Adams. This is so fantastic. She adds that it's the first movie her son could see himself in. ... Thank you, God, for letting me be a witness. She also vowed in the next two years that any film she produces will have 50 percent women. I challenge anyone out there in a position of power to challenge yourself to do the same.\\n\\n9:06: Not a surprise, Shallow gets the original song trophy for A Star Is Born and Lady Gaga is very emotional. As a woman in music, it is very hard to get taken seriously, Gaga says, and her three male co-writers lifted me up.\\n\\n9:04: Justin Hurwitz wins best score for First Man. (He also won two years ago for La La Land.)\\n\\n8:53: Steve Carell presents the inaugural Carol Burnett Award to ... Carol Burnett! (She beat out Christian Bale, Charlize Theron and Antonio Banderas – fake nominees courtesy of Carell.) Carol Burnett lives up to every expectation you'd have for Carol Burnett, Carell says. She takes the stage and also pays tribute to Carell and the HFPA. Does this mean I get to accept it every year? She had childhood dreams of making people laugh, no matter what the medium, and reminisced about her variety show: We became a happy family for 11 years. Burnett says people on TV are given an opportunity to do something special (and) make people laugh, or cry, or both.\\n\\n8:46: Samberg and Oh bring out a bunch of faux doctors to give out flu shots. Willem Dafoe seems pretty down for getting one.\\n\\n8:43: Patricia Arquette gets best actress in a TV limited series for Escape at Dannemora. I'm like that snot-nosed girl in class, still with my piece of paper, she says accepting her award, also calling director Ben Stiller a dream come true.\\n\\n8:40: Supporting actor in a TV series goes to Ben Whishaw of A Very English Scandal. He thanks co-star Hugh Grant for such an exquisite performance and dedicates the honor to the man he plays, Norman Scott. He's a true queer hero and icon.\\n\\n8:29: The Americans takes best TV drama for its final season, besting Bodyguard and Killing Eve.\\n\\n8:27: Bodyguard star Richard Madden snags his first Globe for TV drama best actor.

Michael Douglas wins for lead actor in a TV musical or comedy for The Kominsky Method. Chuck thinks getting old is funny, Douglas says, thanking show creator Chuck Lorre. Douglas dedicates the honor to his 102-year-old dad Kirk.\\n\\n8:00: Hosts Sandra Oh and Andy Samberg team up for the first joke of the night: One lucky audience member gets to host the Oscars! Also they break out some slams for the audience: Oh shouts out, Bradley Cooper ... you are hot, and to buff Creed star Michael B. Jordan, Your character's name is Adonis ... and it is apt. Someone also is carrying a very large bottle of Pepcid. Someone should send some over to the 'Kominsky Method' table. Lots of acid reflux, Samberg says, making a jab at the show with Alan Arkin and Michael Douglas. The hosts also kick Jim Carrey out of the film section and to the TV tables; Carrey counters by saying he just did a Sonic the Hedgehog movie. Oh gets serious at the end, about the significance of an Asian female awards host: Right now, this moment is real ... I see all these faces of change and now so will everyone."}

In the seven years since I had my first kiddo, the range of gadgets and gizmos that purport to make life easier for parents and their offspring has just exploded. Whether you're looking for a smart thermometer, a cordless breast pump, or the newest games and apps for your family's tablet, 2020 will deliver some major innovation for parents and kids.\\n\\nI combed the aisles of this year's CES Tech Show in Las Vegas to find the newest—and greatest—products for parents and kids. Our Editors' Choice Award winners come from a variety of categories, but these are the 10 family-oriented products that stood out the most, and that all parents are going to want to purchase as soon as they're available.\\n\\n1. Baby Brezza Formula Pro Advanced WiFi\\n\\nCredit: Baby Brezza / Reviewed Baby Brezza's new Formula Pro offers Bluetooth connectivity.\\n\\nI used the OG Formula Pro with my daughter, but the newest version takes formula feeding to a whole new (awesome) level. The WiFi-enabled device pairs with a smartphone app so that you can make warm formula bottles with just the tap of a finger. Got a baby who consistently wakes up to be fed at 4:17am? You can program the Formula Pro to have that bottle ready and waiting before your babe lets out their first cry. You can track your baby's feeding, control the bottle size and temperature of the water, and even auto-order formula to be delivered to your door all through the app. The Formula Pro Advanced is launching in June, but you can pre-order it today on the babybrezza website.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n2. Pali Bedtime Buddy\\n\\nCredit: Happy Tykes The Pali Bedtime Buddy is a clock for kids that parents can control via smartphone.\\n\\nWhile there are a number of clocks on the market that claim to train kids to stay in their beds until a certain time in the morning, I've yet to find one that actually works. The Pali Bedtime Buddy sleep training clock combines all the components of existing sleep trainer clocks with new features such as a digital countdown timer and a reward drawer where parents can tuck treats or tokens. The Pali Bedtime Buddy pairs with an app via Bluetooth, through which parents can set and control sleep and wake-up times, and even remotely lock the reward drawer so that kids can't access treats on days they get up too early.\\n\\n3. Willow Generation 3 Breast Pump\\n\\nCredit: Willow The Willow 3 breast pump is completely cordless and hands-free.\\n\\nWorking moms everywhere rejoice: 2020 is the year of the wearable, portable breast pump. The Willow 2 was one of our award winners last year, and their newer model, the Willow Generation 3, is even better. The third version features an extended range of pump sensitivity settings, plus a reusable milk container, and it pairs with Willow's retooled app to help moms maximize their pumping output. The Willow makes it possible for pumping moms to pump anywhere, as it fits right inside a nursing bra and doesn't require any cords or tubes.\\n\\n4. myFirst Camera 3\\n\\nCredit: myFirst The myFirst Camera 3 prints instant black-and-white photos and saves images to be downloaded later in full color.\\n\\nWhile it's certain to appeal to kids just based on the design and colors alone, the newest iteration of the myFirst Camera, myFirst Camera 3 features both a front and back lens in case your kid is all about that #selfie life (and whose isn't?). Like others in the line, it spits out black-and-white prints of whatever photos your child snaps in just 10 seconds. But perhaps the most amazing feature of the myFirst Camera 3 is that it saves the snapshots to a memory card so that parents can print out high-quality, color versions of the photos on their home photo printer. There are no pixelated photos here: The shots that your budding shutterbug takes print beautifully in larger sizes. It's the Polaroid camera for the modern generation.\\n\\n5. Lexilight\\n\\nCredit: Lexilight This light may make reading easier for kids with Dyslexia.\\n\\nThe Lexilight is a portable desk light designed just for kids (and adults) who have Dyslexia. The majority of people with Dyslexia have two dominant eyes—instead of one—which causes both eyes to send simultaneous information to their brain, thereby creating mirror images of letters. The Lexilight emits pulsed and modulated light to suppress the mirror effect, which it claims makes reading far less difficult for kids who struggle. If it works as well as the founders claim, this could be some serious life-changing tech for those with Dyslexia.\\n\\n6. PlayShifu\\n\\nCredit: Play Shifu Tacto Elements is a fun way to learn basic chemical equations.\\n\\nThere were a lot of coding toys at CES this year, but I found many of them far too complicated for the average kid. PlayShifu, a new line of STEM toys, offers simple, well designed games that kids will love. I was particularly impressed with their soon-to-be-released chemistry game, Tacto Elements, which makes learning chemical equations fun (no, really). Designed for kids on the older side—think 4 and up—each of PlayShifu's gaming sets come with one playboard and one companion app.\\n\\n7. Tori\\n\\nCredit: Tori Tori pairs DIY crafts with technology.\\n\\nTori is another STEM toy that I found fun and not too complicated, and I love that it combines crafty DIY with interactive play. Each of Tori's kits include a craft project that lets kids exercise their artistic side, and once assembled, these gizmos are used to play games that teach basic STEM concepts. The way it works is really pretty cool: A special magnet is placed inside your child's DIY creation, and once it's paired with the Tori game board, can be used to play a variety of games. I love that Tori combines art and tech into just-right-for-kids games.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n8. Doodlematic\\n\\nCredit: Doodlematic Doodlematic turns a child's drawing into their very own video game.\\n\\nTurn your child's drawing into a simple video game with the Doodlematic kit and app. Whether your child is a regular Rembrandt or can barely draw a stick figure, the Doodlematic will work for them, and kids will love seeing their creations come to life. Scan your child's artwork into the Doodlematic app, which recognizes colors to create rudimentary video games around the brightest parts of the drawings (think: Frogger). Doodlematic is one of the simplest ideas I saw at CES, and that's why it's a winner—it uses technology in a way that's accessible for kids of all ages.\\n\\n9.

Users can search by specific criteria such as teaching philosophies or student-teacher ratio. Every childcare provider listed on Winnie is licensed by the state, and reviewed by real parents who've use the facilities. As if I needed another reason to love Winnie, here it is: The company is run by women who are working moms.\\n\\n10. Hamelin and Scribzee\\n\\nCredit: Hamelin Kids can take flashcards on the go with the Scribzee app.\\n\\nI think it's so cool when traditional companies find a way to integrate modern technology into their business. Hamelin invented a way to pair their paper products with smartphones and tablets using their Scribzee app. Kids can make flashcards on Hamelin's new Flash 2.0 notecards, and then use the app to scan them into their smartphones or tablets, so they can study on the go. The Flash 2.0 cards come in both 3-by-5 and 4-by-6 sizes, and 12 colors, so it's easy for kids to organize their cards by subject. Hamelin also offers college-ruled notebooks and graph paper books that pair with Scribzee as well, so your device-obsessed kids can never again claim they forget their notes at home.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) — Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz is facing a challenge from an unlikely opponent: his neighbors.\\n\\nA Feb. 6 trial is scheduled in a lawsuit that pits the nation's longest-tenured college football coach and his wife against the three other families who live along a private road outside Iowa City. A judge is expected to decide whether the Ferentzes breached a 2001 agreement and trespassed by planting trees and installing landscaping items that neighbors say encroach onto Saddle Club Road.\\n\\nThe lawsuit is part of a long-running dispute in which Ferentz and his wife, Mary, have been portrayed as difficult, stingy and privacy-obsessed, clashing with their image as friendly philanthropists who support the Iowa Children's Hospital.\\n\\nA judge ruled in September that the Ferentzes aren't required to join the homeowners' association that their neighbors formed in 2015 to share road maintenance costs. That freed the Ferentzes from having to pay a $9,400 assessment for road repairs and dissolved a lien the association obtained on their property to collect payment.\\n\\nThe Iowa Supreme Court recently declined to hear the neighbors' appeal, setting up trial on remaining claims.\\n\\nOne neighbor has testified that they bent over backward to reach agreement with the Ferentzes but were rebuffed repeatedly. The Ferentzes' attorney has argued that the case is about property rights, saying owners cannot be subjected to restrictions to which they haven't agreed.\\n\\nLawyers for both sides declined to comment for this story.\\n\\nFerentz has led the Hawkeyes since 1999 and is Iowa's highest-paid public employee. His contract will pay $5.2 million this year, including a $500,000 bonus for an eight-win season.\\n\\nThe dispute dates to early in Ferentz's tenure, when his family bought land on the single-lane gravel road.\\n\\nNeighbors John and Ann Marie Buatti proposed subdividing their 20-acre property for a development that would include a road resurfacing and extension. They wanted space for their children to ride bikes.\\n\\nMary Ferentz objected, saying she wanted the road kept gravel and the neighborhood to remain rural for privacy reasons.\\n\\nWhat I remember distinctly is she looked at me and said, 'No, you don't understand who I am.' ... I was a little bit taken back, John Buatti testified. For me it was the safety of my children, not who she was or why that would matter.\\n\\nTo resolve the conflict, the neighbors signed a 2001 agreement that called for the formation of a homeowners' association to establish procedures for sharing road maintenance costs. It said that if any party changed the roadway surface to something other than gravel, they couldn't force others to pay for it.\\n\\nThe Buattis subdivided their property once and developer Gary Watts moved in. Saying the road was filled with potholes, Watts paid in 2003 to change the gravel surface to chip and seal. Mary Ferentz was opposed.\\n\\nIn 2015, the neighbors agreed the road needed repairs. They founded the Saddle Club Road Homeowners' Association, saying it was called for in the 2001 agreement. The association assessed each neighbor for a $37,000 repair project and established a $5,000 annual maintenance fund, partly to trim obstructive branches from the Ferentzes' trees.\\n\\nThe Ferentzes told their neighbors in a letter they weren't required to join because the 2001 agreement required a unanimous vote to form the association. They noted they opposed the 2003 road resurfacing, which brought more stalkers and gawkers to the neighborhood. The couple added that their road maintenance costs have doubled but they'd be willing to pay under a less formal agreement.\\n\\nThe association sued, alleging the couple violated its bylaws, breached the 2001 agreement and trespassed. The Ferentzes countersued, seeking an order declaring they aren't association members.\\n\\nJudge Kevin McKeever ruled that the 2001 agreement required the Ferentzes to join an association but not the one formed because it was structured differently than what had been envisioned. He ordered the other claims to go to trial.\\n\\nIMAGES FROM THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL BOWL SEASON"}

You can't change without a understanding of what GROWTH means, he wrote.

{"original": "Rhonda Abrams\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nEach year, one of the most popular new year's resolutions is quit my job and start a business. If one of your goals in 2016 is to start your first small business, then I've got an important tip on how to succeed: start with a training-wheel business.\\n\\nAs the head of my fourth small business, I'm what's called a serial entrepreneur. I'm not alone: many successful entrepreneurs build more than one company.\\n\\nThat's good to know, because many start-up entrepreneurs believe they have to be a huge success the first time they're the boss. You don't. Or that they'll only have one idea for a business. You won't.\\n\\nWhy? Because you'll learn a lot your first time out. You'll get used to dealing with customers, making sales, devising marketing plans, handling finances, and adjusting to the risk and responsibility.\\n\\nMoreover, as you learn more about your market, product or service, and you make additional contacts, you'll almost certainly decide to change many aspects of your small business and see new opportunities and needs. Eventually, you may choose to close your first company and start another.\\n\\nSince it's your first business — not your last — why not think of this first small business as what I call a training-wheel business?\\n\\nBy training-wheel business, I don't mean to be insulting or that it's a business for kids. I mean a type of business that provides enough support to the first-time entrepreneur so that when you make mistakes — and inevitably you will — you won't fall so hard.\\n\\nMy own training-wheel business was my management consulting practice. It was a real business — if I didn't attract and keep clients I couldn't keep a roof over my head. But my consulting business was also a perfect example of a training-wheel business. It cost little to start: I just needed a computer, business cards and a phone. It cost little to run: I worked out of my home. I was in business quickly, giving me more time to learn.\\n\\nService businesses, in particular, lend themselves to being training-wheel start-ups. You can typically work at your customers' homes or places of business and often need little equipment or start-up capital.\\n\\nIt's not just service businesses where you can start small and on the cheap. Making a product? Create inexpensive prototypes or make them in small quantities to sell at local crafts fairs first instead of trying to get widespread wholesale distribution right from the start.\\n\\nKeys to a training-wheel business\\n\\n• Low start-up costs. Look for companies that need little equipment, facilities or staff to launch. Otherwise, you'll need to raise funds, borrow money or use your savings.\\n\\n• Low overhead. Low fixed expenses make it easier to pay your monthly bills. Avoid businesses such as manufacturing and retail, which require inventory, raw materials, high rent or high labor costs. Instead, choose businesses with low overhead, such as independent sales, consulting and most service businesses.\\n\\n• Proven product or service. It's hard to sell customers on a new idea or new product. By selling a proven product or service — even if you have competition — it's easier to make sales sooner.\\n\\n• Established marketing channels. If you have to be creative to reach customers, it'll cost a lot and take time. It's much easier to sell products or services through proven methods such as trade shows, networking events and online direct sales.\\n\\n• Simple sales structure. Many first-time entrepreneurs are attracted by multilevel — or network — marketing programs. These have complicated sales structures, focusing on building down lines. Instead, look for businesses where you sell directly to customers and there are few layers between the manufacturer and the customer.\\n\\n• A niche. It's much easier to compete for customers when you specialize. By clearly targeting a specific market — a particular industry or demographic group — you'll make the most of your marketing dollars and can command higher prices.\\n\\n• Fast startup. Look for businesses you can start quickly rather than ones where you have to rent and remodel premises, import goods or figure out difficult production processes.\\n\\nIf you're new to business, a less complicated business gives you the chance to learn and improve. After all, as I've found myself, you'll likely have other chances with future businesses.\\n\\nAmong Rhonda Abrams' recent books is the 6th edition of Successful Business Plan: Secrets & Strategies.

{"original": "Maurie Backman\\n\\nThe Motley Fool\\n\\nWill 2018 be a busy year on the housing front? It's too early to say. But thanks to some key changes in the tax code, homeownership in some areas of the country has seemingly become less affordable overnight. If you're thinking of buying property this year, here are a few points you need to be aware of.\\n\\n1. Your housing costs shouldn't exceed 30% of your take-home pay\\n\\nRegardless of how the recent tax changes end up impacting you, a homeowner's housing costs should never exceed 30% of take-home pay. Different folks have their own interpretations of what peripheral expenses that 30% threshold should encompass, but at a minimum, it should cover known costs like property taxes and homeowner's insurance. For better protection, however, I'd recommend that that 30% mark include maintenance, as well.\\n\\nThe typical U.S. homeowner spends anywhere from 1% to 4% of their home's value on maintenance each year. If you're buying for the first time, there's no way to know where you'll fall in that range, but if you aim for 2.5% -- smack down the middle -- and are looking at a $400,000 home, that's roughly $833 per month in maintenance.\\n\\nIf you then take that $833 and add it to your monthly mortgage payment, property tax payment, and homeowner's insurance payment, your total should not be greater than 30% of your monthly income. If it is, you're leaving yourself with limited wiggle room for unplanned expenses that may arise in the future.\\n\\nMore: Got $1 million in bitcoins?

You can still deduct your mortgage interest -- to a point\\n\\nThe mortgage-interest deduction has long been criticized for favoring the rich, and so some legislators have been arguing to eliminate it for years. Thankfully, this key deduction is still intact for the current tax year -- albeit at a lower threshold.\\n\\nIt used to be that you could deduct interest on your mortgage for loans valued at up to $1 million. But as a result of the new tax changes, that limit has been lowered to $750,000. If you're an average earner looking to buy a modest home, you should be able to deduct your mortgage interest in full. But if you're looking at pricier homes, or live in an expensive area of the country where home prices are inflated, you may want to be more cognizant of that cap.\\n\\nOf course, if you're not planning to itemize on your tax return, there's no need to worry about the mortgage interest deduction, or any deduction, for that matter. As it is, the majority of taxpayers don't itemize, and since the new tax rules effectively double the standard deduction, it's estimated that fewer filers will do so going forward. But if your intent is to itemize, then be aware of the aforementioned limit.\\n\\n3. Your property tax deduction may be capped\\n\\nJust as the new tax laws limit the mortgage interest deduction, so, too, do they limit the extent to which you can deduct property taxes. In fact, going forward, your total SALT (state and local tax) deduction maxes out at $10,000, whereas prior to 2018, it was unlimited. If you're thinking of buying a home in a low- or no-income tax state, and you don't expect your property tax bill to be particularly high, then the $10,000 cap won't impact you. But if you're buying a home in, say, New Jersey, which boasts the highest property taxes in the nation, you may come to find that a portion of your property tax bill is non-deductible.\\n\\nAgain, if you're not planning to itemize on your tax return in the first place, then there's no need to worry about this change. But one thing you should be aware of is that some experts say that home values may soon start to drop as a result of the new laws, since, by taking away a portion of the tax breaks buyers once enjoyed, they make ownership less affordable in some parts of the country.\\n\\nIf you're buying a home because you plan to live there for quite some time, this may not be too concerning. But if your plan is to buy a home, flip it, and unload it in a year or so, prices could start to fall when more buyers see their tax breaks go down and their tax bills go up.\\n\\nBuying a home can be a wise financial decision that serves you well, not only at present, but for many years to come. Just be sure to know what you're getting into before signing that mortgage.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

{"original": "Eric Titner\\n\\nThe Job Network\\n\\nDoes the following scenario sound like an all-too-familiar weekly routine for you?\\n\\nAfter a long and stressful workweek and Friday approaches — and finally arrives — you feel a palpable, positive shift in your overall sense of mental well-being. Your mood lifts, your outlook on life and the world improves, it's almost as if you're a completely new person, just in time for the weekend!\\n\\nAnd then … Sunday hits and you're faced with the notion of another workweek. Sunday morning may start out fine, but as the day wears on your thoughts turn to Monday, and all of the things waiting for you at work — the tasks, the meetings, the stress. And suddenly, your new outlook on life isn't so new and improved anymore, and starts to revert to your usual, not-so-positive workweek mode.\\n\\nThis might perfectly encapsulate this week for you, or last week, or any other workweek that you can conjure up in your memory. And trust us, if this sounds like you then rest assured that you're not alone. There's even a term for this — the weekend effect — and it's a common phenomenon afflicting countless workers across industries and jobs. It can have a wide range of negative consequences on your professional and personal life, beyond ruining at least half of your weekend!\\n\\nAre you a victim of the weekend effect? Why does this happen? Is there any way to fight it? Great questions! If you're eager to learn more and discover some helpful strategies for freeing yourself from the dreaded weekend effect, then keep reading!\\n\\nMore: Workplace: How to stay focused at work during the holidays\\n\\nMore: New year's resolutions for career success in 2018\\n\\nMore: What Warren Buffett's eating habits can teach about your career\\n\\nCauses of the weekend effect\\n\\nOkay, so now we know that lots of people, regardless of where they're at in their lives or careers, suffer from the weekend effect. But where does it come from? The weekend effect directly stems from how you perceive your current job. All of the elements of your job factor into this equation — your current position in relation to your overall career aspirations, your job role and responsibilities, your physical workspace, your perception of your coworkers and feelings about your boss, even your thoughts about your daily commute enter into the mix.\\n\\nIf you're looking to diagnose yourself to determine if you're a victim of the weekend effect, first take a careful mental inventory of your thoughts on all of the above job-related items. This only works if you're completely honest, so make sure you pull no punches while taking stock of your work feelings.\\n\\nYou should also check your physiological reactions when thoughts of work enter your mind. Does your pulse quicken and blood pressure rise? Is a headache or slow churning in the pit of your stomach never far off when you start focusing on your work life? Do you feel a surge of negative thoughts and emotions take hold when thinking about your average work day or week?\\n\\nA great way to figure out if you're the victim of the weekend effect is to take a daily mental inventory across an entire workweek and look for trends. Do negative thoughts, feelings, emotions, and physical symptoms worsen at the beginning of the week and gradually ebb as the weekend approaches? Do your friends, family, or colleagues notice concerning trends in your behavior or mood based on the day of the week?\\n\\nDoes this pattern seem to repeat itself every week? If so, then you may be caught in a vicious weekend effect cycle, and despite its relatively harmless-sounding name it can have a tangible, measurable, and harmful effect on your life — everything from your work performance and interactions with coworkers to your personal pursuits and relationships outside of work can suffer. Even your physical health isn't safe from its effects!\\n\\nIf you think you're a victim of the weekend effect, you have every reason to take things seriously and take matters into your own hands in an effort to escape this. Keep reading for some helpful strategies for freeing yourself from this vicious cycle!\\n\\nHow to combat the weekend effect\\n\\nA great strategy for combating the weekend effect is to attack it at its roots. According to a recent report by Psychology Today, the key causes of the weekend effect are a perceived lack of workplace autonomy, a disinterest in work activities, a disconnection from professional responsibilities and relationships, and feelings of a general lack of competency on the job, whether real or imagined.\\n\\nDo any of these sound like you? If so, make a real effort towards positive change in these areas. Overhauling your entire work life all at once may seem daunting, but small, positive steps and incremental change can make a world of difference. Consider the following approaches to help fight the dreaded weekend effect.\\n\\nFocus on the positive\\n\\nSure, there are things at work that bring out negative feeling and emotions, we all have them, but the key is to try not to let them take over your thoughts completely. Try making a list of things that you feel positive about regarding your current work situation, and set your focus there. It can contain things that are large (like one of your primary work responsibilities) or relatively small (maybe you like the fact that your desk is by a window with a nice view?). Some people find that just being appreciative that they even have a job in a tough job market helps them through stressful times. The list itself doesn't have to be particularly long, the only criteria is that it contains items that elicit positive feeling and emotions. Once you have your list, make sure to turn to it whenever your thoughts about work start to turn negative, and hopefully you'll start seeing a shift in how the idea of work makes you feel.\\n\\nChange what you can\\n\\nThis might seem obvious, but so many of us have become so good at putting off making positive change in our lives, and accepting a less positive version of reality, that it really bears mentioning. You know all of the things that make you feel angry, frustrated, and negative when it comes to your work world, and the truth is that some of those things aren't in our immediate power to change (if only we were able to choose our bosses…). That said, there are certainly things at work that bother us that we can change, and these are the things you should focus your energy and effort on. We suggest you start small. Decorate your workspace so that it's more cheerful. Try improving your communication and relationship with at least one colleague each week. Take regular breaks during the day (but don't overdo it!) in an effort to combat burnout. You'll soon start seeing a wave of positive work-related feelings wash over you. Then take on larger things, like those work responsibilities that you consistently dread or your interactions with your boss. Remember — every positive step you make involving work, no matter how small, will help keep the weekend effect at bay.\\n\\nFocus on the fundamentals\\n\\nanother obvious one, perhaps, but many people don't seem to connect the dots between living a healthy life and having a positive relationship with our jobs. Taking care of the fundamentals—getting plenty of sleep, eating a healthy diet, and engaging in plenty of exercise — will not only improve the quality of our personal lives, it will also help make us happier and more productive employees. Trust us on this one.\\n\\nIf all else fails — life is short, and none of us get an unlimited supply of weekends to stress out through. If you just can't seem to shake the weekend effect, consider making a job or career change. We're not endorsing anything impulsive, but it couldn't hurt to start making plans for a future shift — sometimes the simple act of setting a new goal, no matter how far off the finish line is, can bring about a wave of positive feelings to help combat the weekend effect.\\n\\nSay goodbye to the weekend effect!\\n\\nNow that you know what the weekend effect is, and whether or not you're among its unfortunate victims, you can start working towards eradicating it. Use the strategies mentioned here and take back control of your weekends.\\n\\nThe post Are you a victim of the weekend effect? appeared first on TheJobNetwork.\\n\\nThe Job Network is a USA TODAY NETWORK content partner, providing career and job-hunting advice.

{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nEAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) — Todd Bowles remained confident, even as the losses and criticism mounted.\\n\\nHe believes he's still the right man to lead the New York Jets, and the team apparently agrees with the coach.\\n\\nAfter ending a dismal season on a winning note with a 30-10 victory over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, the Jets are making no changes in leadership heading into what appears will be a busy offseason.\\n\\nI'm not going to take away from the team win today, Bowles said. I knew I would be here, so it really wasn't a big deal.\\n\\nBowles is 15-17 in his two-year tenure with New York, which hired him in January 2015 after firing Rex Ryan. He had been the subject of increased criticism by some fans and media in recent weeks because of a few ugly losses and questions about his in-game management and handling of the locker room.\\n\\nBut owner Woody Johnson opted to stay the course and give both Bowles and general manager Mike Maccagnan a third year.\\n\\nThat's great, cornerback Darrelle Revis said. It was a disappointing season this year and next year, Coach can get another stab at it and change some things around next year.\\n\\nAs for the fans who lost faith in Bowles and are unsure he should be back, the coach had a message.\\n\\nIt's not about losing faith in me, Bowles said. It's about winning ballgames. We don't win ballgames, the stands aren't full. We didn't win ballgames starting out. I understand that the fans are frustrated. We're frustrated as well.\\n\\nMeanwhile, in Buffalo, Anthony Lynn is waiting to see if he'll return with the Bills.\\n\\nTwo people with direct knowledge of the situation told the AP before the game that Lynn is the clear favorite to take over the job permanently.\\n\\nOne person called Lynn's succession to replace Ryan— fired earlier in the week by Buffalo — as being the working plan. Another person said the final decision on general manager Doug Whaley's recommendation rests solely with owners Terry and Kim Pegula.\\n\\nUntil they tell me I'm not employed anymore, Lynn said, then I have to go back and get these evaluations done and look at our team and what we have to go after in the offseason.\\n\\nA third person with direct knowledge of the discussions told the AP that former Jacksonville coach Gus Bradley is a candidate to become the Bills' defensive coordinator under Lynn.\\n\\nGuys respect him, defensive tackle Kyle Williams said of Lynn. He's revered in the room when he walks in. He commands the room. If he would be the guy, I'd be happy for him, for sure.\\n\\nSome other things to know from the Jets' season-ending victory over the Bills:\\n\\nSHUTDOWN SAFETY?: Revis reiterated his interest in possibly moving to safety next season after having a down year, which he attributed to age — he's 31 — and injuries.\\n\\nRevis, once considered the top cornerback in the game, is not a lock to return to the Jets because he's scheduled to count $15.3 million against the salary cap next season. If he takes a pay cut, a change in positions with the Jets could be in the game plan.\\n\\nDEPARTING JETS?: Revis might not be the only big-name Jets player who could be gone in the offseason.\\n\\nRyan Fitzpatrick , who threw two touchdown passes against Buffalo, is a free agent and played in what was likely his final game for New York. He came back on a one-year deal for $12 million, but struggled mightily.\\n\\nWide receiver Brandon Marshall, center Nick Mangold, left tackle Ryan Clady and right tackle Breno Giacomini could be salary cap casualties. Defensive lineman Sheldon Richardson could be trade bait.\\n\\nBUFFALO'S QB STANCE: Like the Jets, the Bills are facing lots of uncertainty at the quarterback position.\\n\\nTyrod Taylor was inactive because of a groin injury and the Bills could opt out of his five-year extension after this season. It's unclear, however, if they would still have that flexibility if Taylor has a long-term injury.\\n\\nEJ Manuel , who was 9 of 20 for 86 yards and lost a fumble in the start, is scheduled to be a free agent. That leaves just Cardale Jones, who was 6 of 11 for 96 yards and an interception after replacing Manuel to start the fourth quarter.\\n\\nGROUND AND POUND: Despite the question at quarterback, the Bills had one of their best seasons with the running game.\\n\\nWith a touchdown run by Mike Gillislee, Buffalo increased its season total to 29 rushing TDs, extending a single-season team record. It's also the most by an NFL team since Carolina had 30 in 2008.\\n\\nThe Bills might have gotten more if LeSean McCoy hadn't left on the first play of the second quarter with a high right ankle sprain. X-rays were negative and he was upgraded to a probable return, though he didn't get another carry.\\n\\nTURNOVER SPREE: The Jets entered with just 11 takeaways and threatened the franchise mark of 13, set in 2014. New York recovered two fumbles in the third quarter and Revis got his first interception of the season in the fourth.\\n\\nDoug Middleton also recovered a kickoff in the end zone after Gillislee allowed the ball to bounce, giving New York a 30-3 lead.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow in Buffalo, New York, contributed.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

{"original": "Howard Megdal\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY Sports\\n\\nBreanna Stewart, the finest college women's basketball player in the world — now, and probably ever — plans to spend New Year's Eve on campus, ahead of what will be The Year of Breanna Stewart.\\n\\nI don't really have New Year's resolutions, per se, Stewart said in a phone interview. But I want to make sure that this year is even better than last year. Because I think, saying things like that, it makes you excited for what's to come.\\n\\nSo much lies just ahead for Stewart: an opportunity to complete the four titles in four years for Connecticut she boldly declared as her goal when she was a freshman. She has three Most Outstanding Player awards from three Final Fours to go with those trophies.\\n\\nNo one who has seen her expand her game — she's now a 44% shooter from three-point range, and her lanky 6-4 frame allows her to block more than three shots per game and grab 2.4 steals per game, to go along with her 4.4 assists and 22.9 points per game — doubts she's the best player in college basketball. It's merely a matter of by how much.\\n\\nBut therein lies the key question as we complete a year in which female athletes were celebrated and seen as never before: How much will we see Stewart?\\n\\n2015 is being called the Year of Women's Sports in many circles, and it's usually meant in a positive, supportive way. But there's something patronizing about it, too, and reflective of a deeper problem within sports media: the idea that covering women's sports is a special occasion, a one-off, a brief detour from the real work of covering sports — you know, men's sports. That must change.\\n\\nI don't think there's a specific year in women's sports, Stewart said. Because, as half the population, you don't say there's a specific year for men's sports. Female athletes, women in sports, need to be highlighted all the time.\\n\\nSports predictions for 2016: The silly, serious and sublime\\n\\nOne need only watch the Connecticut women's basketball team to understand what happens with regular coverage. For the better part of two decades, Connecticut newspapers have treated that team as a major league beat. Accordingly, fans are well-versed in the basics of the team and its players, the larger narratives and smaller moments.\\n\\nAnd the crowds, as a result, are consistent. Hartford's XL Center was filled on the Saturday after Thanksgiving — a full house for women's hoops on a holiday weekend at an off-campus venue and against a non-conference opponent (Nebraska).\\n\\nAnd yet nationally, even in this so-called Year of Women's Sports, the breakthrough athletes at the very highest of achievements received notice only at their peak points. We saw and heard from the U.S. women's national team during Fox Sports' admirably thorough coverage of the World Cup last summer.\\n\\nBut 22 of the 23 members of that team returned to their club teams, in the domestic National Women's Soccer League, and few reporters followed. Fans who had found idols didn't have the ability to follow their new heroes' every move, or even — unless working hard to seek it out — know what happened in most of the games.\\n\\nThis is the greatest barrier women's sports face today. A lack of prominence on general sports shows, in newspapers and on major websites means that while the larger sports-watching population becomes familiar with LeBron James, Stephen Curry, Mike Trout, Cam Newton and many others, a precious few beyond the WNBA's audience experienced Elena Delle Donne's revelatory season for the Chicago Sky.\\n\\nWithout women's sports in the mainstream — understanding the greatness of Carli Lloyd, Tamika Catchings and Hilary Knight— picking up the games, the teams, the fandom becomes harder for everyone not specifically seeking it out. It's the difference between learning a foreign language because it is spoken at home and seeking out an adult, night-school course. And only the news media can change that. It's our responsibility to do so.\\n\\nStewart does something every game that makes a viewer jump out of his or her seat — or would, if Stewart's highlights occupied an equivalent perch in the landscape to Ben Simmons' highlights. Just because we are used to the Ben Simmonses of the world getting all the publicity doesn't mean it makes sense in a world with dramatically more women playing collegiate athletics all the time, and a hierarchy of coverage that reflects yesterday's sports world.\\n\\nAnd when we do see coverage for women equal that for men, the audiences that follow are breathtaking. Witness the 26.7 million who watched the World Cup final this summer, or the audience for Serena Williams vs. Venus Williams in the U.S. Open, twice what any men's match received. So let's put that tired old argument, blaming women's sports itself for not being more popular, to rest.\\n\\nThe year ahead promises so much for Stewart. She'll march to an unprecedented level of accomplishment in the college game. She'll be the top overall draft pick in the WNBA, where she's expected to join young star Jewell Loyd and former Connecticut great Sue Bird, whom you'll see on State Farm commercials between sports highlights and way too infrequently on the sports highlights themselves. Then at the Olympics, Stewart is expected to be a key contributor for the U.S. team in Rio.\\n\\nSo let's enjoy The Year of Breanna Stewart. And let's make the celebration of her exceptional accomplishments ordinary, the way we do Curry's jump shot and Bryce Harper's home run swing.\\n\\n2015 shouldn't be The Year of Women's Sports. The Year of Breanna Stewart should be every year. It's time for the new normal. Just give people a chance to watch Stewart, and so many other women, all the time.\\n\\nReally, it's that simple. And it's overdue."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — When David Johnson's left knee bent perilously during a first-quarter tackle, the Arizona Cardinals worried their meaningless season finale had acquired a horrible new importance.\\n\\nBut their star running back appeared to avoid a major injury, and the Cardinals' day only got better — particularly for Larry Fitzgerald.\\n\\nCarson Palmer threw touchdown passes to Jeremy Ross, Darren Fells and Fitzgerald, and the Cardinals wrapped up a frustrating season with a 44-6 victory over the freefalling Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\\n\\nFitzgerald caught five passes and took the overall NFL lead with 107 catches in perhaps his final game for the Cardinals (7-8-1). He couldn't enjoy the first half of the game after Johnson left the field on a cart, but Fitzgerald and his teammates all loosened up when Johnson returned to the sideline in the second half, putting weight on his leg.\\n\\nWe're praying it's all positive, and I can block for him in the Pro Bowl in the next couple of weeks, Fitzgerald said.\\n\\nJohnson gained 100 yards from scrimmage in an NFL-record 15 straight games for the Cardinals while becoming the first player in team history with 2,000 yards and 20 touchdowns. The Cardinals had no immediate update on his prognosis, although coach Bruce Arians is optimistic it isn't serious.\\n\\nThe inept Rams were less frightening than Johnson's injury to the Cardinals and Fitzgerald, who intends to take his time with his decision on retirement following his 13th NFL season.\\n\\nHe returned to the field in the fourth quarter to score while taking the NFL receptions lead amid chants of Larry! Larry! from the Coliseum crowd. Fitzgerald hadn't scored since Week 5 against San Francisco.\\n\\nIt's disappointing, but we really finished the season on a high note, said Fitzgerald, who moved ahead of Pittsburgh's Antonio Brown and New England's Julian Edelman with his last catch.\\n\\nI always stay in the moment, and the game wasn't over yet. I was still honed in and focused on what we had to accomplish. ... I approach the offseason the same way all the time: It's jet-setting time. Where's Waldo?\\n\\nThe Cardinals missed the playoffs one year after reaching the NFC championship game despite an offense and a defense ranked in the top quarter of the league. Arizona still finished the season strong with wins over NFC West champion Seattle and Los Angeles (4-12), which has lost seven straight.\\n\\nThe Cardinals sacked Jared Goff seven times — three by Markus Golden — and allowed just 122 yards by the Rams, who wrapped up their homecoming season with their worst record since 2011.\\n\\nI'm not sure there is much of a bright spot to this season, Goff said. Maybe that we have a change coming that is going to be positive and bring a lot of positive energy.\\n\\nJustin Bethel capped the blowout with a 68-yard TD return of Sean Mannion's interception with 8:06 to play.\\n\\nLos Angeles lost 11 of its final 12 games in an incredible pratfall. Interim coach John Fassel went 0-3 after replacing the fired Jeff Fisher late in this franchise's 13th consecutive non-winning season.\\n\\nThis isn't the culture you want to live in, offensive tackle Rodger Saffold said. I've been here seven years and still haven't had a winning season. I know I've worked hard enough to deserve better.\\n\\nGOFF'S LAST GASP\\n\\nGoff wrapped up his winless rookie season by going 13 of 20 for 120 yards while getting physically clobbered by yet another defense. The No. 1 overall pick went 0-7 with seven interceptions and five TD passes for the Rams, who lost their final six home games after winning their ballyhooed opener in September.\\n\\nSIMPLY THE WORST\\n\\nThe Rams managed 482 yards in their final three games under Fassel, including 81 yards in the first three quarters against Arizona. They will finish as the NFL's 32nd-ranked offense for the second straight season.\\n\\nHEISMAN RETURN\\n\\nPalmer went 20 of 38 for 255 yards in a solid return to the stadium where he won the Heisman Trophy 14 years ago with Southern California. He hadn't been back inside the Coliseum since throwing four touchdown passes to beat Notre Dame in November 2002. He posed for photos with his family on the field after the game, as did another USC product, defensive lineman Frostee Rucker.\\n\\nTYPICAL STRUGGLES\\n\\nThe Rams went nowhere on offense for their first 5 1/2 drives before back-to-back big gainers, but even that went wrong. After Todd Gurley caught a 29-yard pass, Tavon Austin ran 38 yards for a TD on a direct snap to the wideout — but it was wiped out by an illegal motion penalty against Goff, of all people.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Chris Korman\\n\\nFor The Win\\n\\nDana Holgorsen signed 16 players to letters of intent on Dec. 19, the first day of the early signing period.\\n\\nAccording to reports, he himself will sign a new deal in the coming days, one that will make him the head coach at Houston ( which signed 14 players on the first day of the early period) instead of West Virginia.\\n\\nSo now 30 players are bound by their National Letters of Intent to play where the coach they chose is no longer in charge. Chances are, in fact, none of the coaches who recruited them will remain in place.\\n\\nMiami also signed 14 players in the early period. Those recruits thought they'd be playing for Mark Richt, but he retired (at age 58) rather than continue trying to rebuild the Hurricanes program. His former defensive coordinator, Manny Diaz, is taking over, so at least there's that bit of continuity.\\n\\nExcept that Diaz had already left, on Dec. 13, to become the head coach at Temple, where he promptly signed a class of 17 players - many of whom, of course, had been wooed by Geoff Collins before he exited, on Dec. 7, for Georgia Tech ( which signed 18, but at least those kids had almost two whole weeks to decipher whether the new coach was a good fit.)\\n\\nTo review: millionaire coaches can switch schools when and how they'd like — even twice in one month! — but high school athletes who were pressured into early commitments are tied to their schools.\\n\\nOf all the ways college sports is flawed — or, more precisely, built to turn student-athletes into cogs — this is the most offensive one.\\n\\nIt's enabled by the murky National Letter of Intent, which is a voluntary form the athletes can sign that guarantees them a scholarship for one year if they promise to play for that school for one year. Breaking your NLI promise means you have to sit out that year before being allowed to sign again.\\n\\nWhile it is true that players could opt to not sign an NLI, only the most talented of prospects would still be assured scholarships. For the vast majority of college football (and basketball) recruits, signing on the dotted line — as early as possible, generally — is the only way to secure a spot.\\n\\nHaving college football's early period come a few weeks after the regular season ended was supposed to limit the number of players who experience a coaching change after signing, but this year is proof of how flawed that theory was.\\n\\nThis isn't some new issue, of course. Here's an amazingly vintage ESPN Page 2 Transcript of an Outside the Lines episode (seriously, they just printed the transcript) on this very issue.\\n\\nAnd while proposals for amending transfer rules have been gaining traction lately, there's really no need to complicate any of this. The National Letter of Intent program exists to make life easier for coaches at the expense of athletes. It should be discarded, with players instead signing a direct scholarship with the institution of their choice.\\n\\nAnd then those schools should have no ability whatsoever to limit a student's movement — just as they do not with a music or engineering or business major (early decision agreements are the closest corollary, but those are, in many ways gentleman's agreements and don't extend past initial enrollment, anyway). There's no reason it should be any different for students who happen to play sports — other than making things easier on coaches and more palatable for fans who supposedly would hate for college sports to have the equivalent of free agency.\\n\\nThe new year could bring us court rulings that force college athletics into embracing basic free market concepts, like allowing athletes to negotiate their own compensation.\\n\\nLet's start with a reasonable and long-overdue step: Give kids who sign because of what a coach tells them a chance to change their minds when that coach is no longer there."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nDURHAM, N.C. (AP) — Grayson Allen was back for No. 8 Duke after an indefinite suspension for his latest trip of an opponent wound up being one game.\\n\\nAllen had 15 points and seven assists in the Blue Devils' 110-57 rout of Georgia Tech on Wednesday night — the final game for Hall of Fame coach Mike Krzyzewski before he takes a leave of absence to have back surgery.\\n\\n(Krzyzewski) ultimately felt that I was ready to come back, and I felt good coming back, Allen said. And so I accept all the discipline that came my way, and I know that it was my fault.\\n\\nAllen was suspended indefinitely Dec. 22, one day after he was caught tripping an opposing player for the third time in a calendar year. This time he was caught tripping Elon's Steven Santa Ana on a drive in the first half of a 72-61 win.\\n\\nAt the time, Krzyzewski said he would suspend the preseason AP All-American guard and his team's second-leading scorer until I feel good about the entire situation where he is at.\\n\\nAfter the game, Krzyzewski said he and athletic director Kevin White discussed the suspension and found that it was appropriate to reinstate him.\\n\\nKrzyzewski is scheduled to have the operation Friday and the school expects him to be back in roughly four weeks. Associate head coach Jeff Capel will be in charge during Coach K's absence, with his first game coming Saturday against Boston College.\\n\\nAllen watched from the bench in street clothes Saturday as Virginia Tech routed the Blue Devils 89-75. After that game, Krzyzewski revealed that he had stripped Allen of his team captaincy.\\n\\nAllen was also caught tripping Louisville's Ray Spalding and Florida State's Xavier Rathan-Mayes during games in February 2016. The trip of Spalding earned him a flagrant foul; there was no foul whistled after Rathan-Mayes hit the floor, though that move did earn Allen a reprimand from the Atlantic Coast Conference.\\n\\nIn a scheduling twist, Allen and the Blue Devils visit both the 12th-ranked Seminoles and ninth-ranked Cardinals next week.\\n\\nAllen's suspension was one of the latest twists in an already drama-filled first two months of the season for a Duke team picked No. 1 in the preseason on the strength of a roster that includes Allen and four immediate-impact freshmen, and one that now will have to deal with not having the winningest men's coach in Division I history for a while.\\n\\nUntil now, the full roster has been available at the same time for only about three days, with three of the newcomers — Harry Giles, Marques Bolden and Jayson Tatum — sidelined to start the year with injuries. Giles, the highest profile of the bunch, missed the first 11 games before making his debut on Dec. 19 — two nights before Allen's latest tripping episode.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets, who were coming off a 75-63 upset of then-No. 9 North Carolina on Saturday, couldn't make it two in a row against the Tobacco Road powerhouses. They allowed 11 3s in the first half after previously not allowing more than that in any entire game.\\n\\nDuke: Joining Allen in the starting lineup was Giles, who made his first start. So, now that the Blue Devils have a relatively full roster of players, the focus shifts to how they'll respond to being without their Hall of Fame coach for a while.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nGeorgia Tech: The Yellow Jackets' brutal schedule continues with a home game against No. 9 Louisville on Saturday.\\n\\nDuke: Capel's first game of the season in charge of the Blue Devils comes Saturday when Boston College visits. After that: Road games at No. 13 Florida State and No. 9 Louisville — Allen was caught tripping players from both teams in Durham last season.\\n\\nTHIS WEEK IN COLLEGE SPORTS:"}
{"original": "Stephen Legomsky\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nOur asylum laws have some gaping holes. These gaps endanger many groups, but none more so than women and girls who are fleeing domestic violence, honor killings, mass rape in wartime, gang rape by criminal gangs, and other gender-related violence. Congress must explicitly recognize gender-based persecution as a potential asylum ground.\\n\\nAsylum requires a well-founded fear of being persecuted. But not just any persecution will do. The persecution has to occur for one of five specific reasons — your race, your religion, your nationality, your political opinion, or what the law calls your particular social group. Gender is notably missing from this list.\\n\\nThat omission is not surprising. U.S. asylum laws, like those of most other western countries, track the language of an international refugee convention that was adopted in 1951. Gender-related violence was simply not on the public radar at that time.\\n\\nBut it is now 2019. The historical excuse will no longer wash. With women's marches, the MeToo movement, the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process and women's stunning midterm electoral successes, gender-related violence is now part of our national consciousness.\\n\\nRead more commentary:\\n\\nAs a Syrian refugee in US, I watched my country collapse. But there is a path to hope.\\n\\nRefugees at US-Mexico border are treated like criminals\\n\\nBring more refugees to America. They'll fill vacant jobs and boost our economy.\\n\\nWithout specific congressional recognition of gender-based persecution, women and girls fleeing the most horrific violence imaginable have had to argue that they will be persecuted because of their particular social group. Today that is easier said than done. The nation's highest administrative tribunal that decides asylum claims — the Justice Department's Board of Immigration Appeals — has been adding more and more roadblocks to asylum claims that are based on particular social group.\\n\\nThis was not always the case. In 1985, the board defined particular social group as one in which membership is immutable. Gender, of course, meets that definition.\\n\\nThe immutability test makes perfect sense. If you will be persecuted only because of an innocuous characteristic that you can easily change, then you don't need asylum. But if that characteristic cannot be changed, you have no other practical way to protect yourself. The immutability test thus allows asylum for those who need it and withholds it from those who don't.\\n\\nJustice constraints are harmful, irrational\\n\\nBut the board could not leave well enough alone. Along the way it invented two additional requirements. One is social distinction. If you claim persecution because of your membership in a particular social group, you must now prove that your home society describes that class of individuals as a group. Second, you must now prove what the board calls particularity. By this it means you must prove that your home society can figure out whether hypothetical other individuals are members of the group.\\n\\nThere are only four problems with those requirements: The board has no convincing legal authority to impose them. No one really understands what they mean. They are nearly impossible to prove. And they make no policy sense: why should the U.S. decision whether to grant asylum to someone depend on whether her home society thinks of the particular class as a group, or on whether the home society can tell which other individuals belong to that group?\\n\\nLast June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions made this bad situation worse. Overruling board precedent, he announced that, henceforth, anyone fleeing domestic violence (or, for that matter anyone fleeing gang violence) will generally be unable to prove either social distinction or particularity and therefore should be denied asylum. Although a federal court has blocked that decision for now, the Supreme Court will likely determine its ultimate fate.\\n\\nBut the problems go beyond that specific case. First, the artificial constraints that the board has imposed for all claims based on particular social group are both harmful and irrational. Second, it is only because gender is not on Congress's list of specifically protected grounds that women and girls have had to fit their claims into particular social group in the first place.\\n\\nWomen would still prove need for asylum\\n\\nWhat arguments could possibly be made for protecting people from racial or religious persecution but not from gender persecution?\\n\\nPerhaps the fear is that domestic violence is too endemic, that allowing asylum would open the floodgates. We need not worry, for a woman or girl fleeing domestic violence has multiple legal burdens that minimize the numbers: She must prove that her fear is both genuine and well-founded, that the harm she fears is severe, that her government is unable or unwilling to protect her, that no place anywhere in her country would be safe, and — even if gender is added to the list — that the persecution will be inflicted because of her gender. These are all high bars, and proof requires meticulous, persuasive documentation. Canada has recognized domestic violence asylum claims since the 1990s, and no floodgates have opened.\\n\\nThe U.S. cannot singlehandedly eradicate all violence against women and girls — even here at home. But we can at least avoid being an accomplice. When women and girls arrive at our shores asking only that they not be beaten, raped or murdered, delivering them to their tormentors is not an option. Congress should restore the original meaning of particular social group, and it should recognize that gender, like race and religion, belongs in the list of specifically protected grounds.\\n\\nStephen Legomsky is a professor emeritus at the Washington University School of Law, the principal author of Immigration and Refugee Law and Policy, and the former Chief Counsel of US Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama Administration."}

Here's what you need to know to make the most of your miles this month.\\n\\nAlaska and Virgin America provide reciprocal benefits. The latest in domestic airline mergers, Alaska and Virgin America have tied the knot, becoming the fifth largest airline in the country. Their individual loyalty programs are taking the first step in alignment, meaning fliers can earn and burn miles on either carrier as well as enjoy elite-level perks like priority boarding and check-in. One of the most valuable changes is that Virgin America fliers can now earn miles based upon distance flown rather than dollars spent when flying Alaska flights (Alaska still awards miles based upon distance flown for its fliers). In the new year, Virgin America fliers will be asked to create Alaska Mileage Plan accounts as a next step toward creating a combined mileage program where 1.3 Mileage Plan miles will be equivalent to one Virgin America Elevate point or vice versa.\\n\\nAlaska Air begins merger with Virgin America, promises 'more to love'\\n\\nRocketMiles will pay you in miles for unwanted, wacky holiday gifts. Not keen on that funky iPhone case or strange paperweight you received for the holidays? RocketMiles.com wants it! The travel website, which doles out airline miles for using its hotel reservation system, will give you a 500-mile bonus (in the airline program of your choice) on your next hotel booking if you mail your unwanted gift to them before Jan. 20. Send that ugly sweater to RocketMiles, 641 W. Lake Street, Ste. 102, Chicago, IL, 60661. Used or poorly handmade gifts are not eligible, and items must be received by Jan. 20. Only one bonus is eligible per customer, and be sure to include your name and email address associated with your RocketMiles account.\\n\\nAmerican adds another elite layer. American's Concierge Key fliers, a status reserved for fliers that spend the most with the carrier, got a nice present on Jan. 1. Previously, they were grouped into the top priority level with Executive Platinum members. In 2017, Concierge Key members will be part of a new elite tier that receives higher priority than Executive Platinum members when it comes to upgrade and standby wait lists. This is great news for the biggest spenders, but other elite fliers may see a few extra names ahead of them on the wait list.\\n\\nNew to mileage programs? Delta has a bonus for you! If you are new to Delta's SkyMiles program, Delta has some bonus miles for flying. All it takes is to fly internationally within the first six months of enrollment. Earn 5,000 miles for qualifying economy-class fares and 10,000 bonus miles for premium cabin fares.\\n\\nAlaska adds more to Mileage Plan benefits.In an era of diminishing benefits, here's a positive change: Alaska is introducing a new one-way price of 5,000 miles for short-haul flight redemptions of less than 700 miles in travel distance. Also, the airline is adjusting its partner mileage-earning charts, giving a boost to the number of miles earned on flights with airlines like Icelandair and Emirates.\\n\\nBonus American miles for flying Down Under. American has a great bonus offer for travelers flying to Sydney or Auckland. Book by Jan. 31 and fly between Feb. 1 and May 31 in a premium cabin or on certain economy-class fares to earn as many as 50,000 bonus miles. Be sure to use promotion code SPF16 and register for the promotion before travel."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nMIAMI (AP) — When the Miami Heat return home from their road trip, the season will officially be half over.\\n\\nIt's already seemed like a marathon.\\n\\nBarely seven months removed from being a game shy of the NBA's Final Four, the Heat were the first team this season to reach the 25-loss mark. Only Philadelphia and Brooklyn are keeping Miami from having the league's worst record, and it's a paper-thin buffer right now between the Heat and the cellar. Injuries have piled up as well, further adding to the struggle of rebuilding.\\n\\nIt's not so much frustration, Heat forward Justise Winslow said, talking about the team's collective mood. It's more just like sympathy.\\n\\nBanged-up and usually beaten, the Heat start a six-game trip in Phoenix on Tuesday night. The good news is that the first three games on this swing are against teams that are like the Heat, well below the .500 mark. The bad news is that Miami hasn't beaten anybody on the road in more than a month, and seems to have a different lineup every night.\\n\\nJust in Sunday's loss to Detroit alone, the Heat were without Goran Dragic, Hassan Whiteside, Dion Waiters, Josh McRoberts and Winslow. McRoberts is out indefinitely with a stress fracture in his left foot, and Whiteside (scratched right eye) and Winslow (right shoulder stinger) did not travel with the team Monday — though that doesn't mean they can't meet the Heat somewhere on this trip.\\n\\nWe'll get guys back, coach Erik Spoelstra said.\\n\\nDion Waiters hasn't played since late November because of a torn groin muscle; he was on the team flight Monday, a sign that his return might finally be coming. Whiteside got poked in the eye during Miami's game at Boston on Friday, when Winslow got hurt on the final play of the game.\\n\\nAt this rate, there will be a point where Miami starts thinking more about the future than the present. Plenty of trade talk in the next few weeks will involve the Heat, who have a ton of salary-cap space to use this summer and will undoubtedly hear from contending teams looking to add a player or two for the looming playoff runs.\\n\\nAnd unless there's some seismic improvement, Miami's NBA draft lottery odds might look pretty good as well.\\n\\nI know this about Erik's teams: They're going to play really, really hard, Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy said of Spoelstra, his longtime friend going back to when they were both part of the Heat staff.\\n\\nJust take some examples from Sunday's loss: James Johnson dove on the floor to salvage what looked like a sure turnover, setting up a 3-pointer. He leaped into the Detroit bench a couple minutes later to save a ball, and the Heat got another 3 out of that possession. Rodney McGruder thwarted a 4-on-1 Detroit fast break later in the game as well, though the Pistons wound up scoring on that possession.\\n\\nThat's sort of the theme for the Heat season so far. Even when things go right, it's not right enough.\\n\\nI'm seeing the guys out there diving on the floor, making winning plays, putting their bodies out there, putting themselves out there, captain Udonis Haslem said. That's how you become a championship team.\\n\\nEven with Whiteside's numbers looking good — averages of 17.3 points and 14.3 rebounds per game — he's far from a lock for the All-Star team, in part because there's no true center designation in the roster-choosing process. No one currently playing for the Heat has ever been an All-Star, and it's probably reasonable to think that won't change in the next few weeks.\\n\\nFor comparison's sake, last year's Heat lineup featured players with a combined 38 All-Star trips.\\n\\nDwyane Wade's now in Chicago, Joe Johnson is in Utah, Luol Deng is with the Lakers, Amare Stoudemire is in Israel and Chris Bosh is in basketball exile, sidelined by concerns about his blood-clot situations and now seen with Heat teammates only in photos from New Year's Eve gatherings.\\n\\nIt is what it is, Winslow said. Take it with a grain of salt. Not going to make any excuses. We're all basketball players. We get paid to do this. We get paid to show up on time, get paid to have your brother's back on the court."}

But Zoey's was saved, and a new season of the series (Tuesday, 8 EST/PST, ★★★ out of four) is just as delightful as the lovely first, if a little more somber.\\n\\nDespite its sunny San Francisco setting and brilliantly choreographed musical numbers (choreographer Mandy Moore remains one of the best in the business), Zoey's has always been a dark, reflective series. Its super-powered protagonist (Jane Levy) hears the inner turmoil of her friends, her family and even strangers as covers of pop songs. Lonely ballads, songs of heartbreak and grief are frequently on her playlist.\\n\\nIn Season 1, Zoey was dealing with the decline of her father, Mitch (Peter Gallagher), who was dying of a degenerative disease. The season ended with Mitch's funeral (don't worry, he reappears). Still grieving at the start of Season 2, which picks up six weeks later, Zoey tries to return to work and her relationships, but it's messy and difficult. She has two men interested in dating her, Max (Skylar Astin) and Simon (John Clarence Stewart), a boss (Lauren Graham) who wants her to take on more responsibility and a best friend (Alex Newell) who won't let her wallow in self-pity.\\n\\nHer powers had taken a break, but when she returns to her tech company office she's greeted with a rousing rendition of Hello Dolly!, perhaps the series' most shamelessly Broadway-inspired musical number.\\n\\nMore:'Hello, Dolly!': Zoey is back where she belongs in exclusive Season 2 clip from 'Zoey's Extraordinary Playlist'\\n\\nAs Zoey copes with her new reality, the series again balances its comedy and tragedy. The musical devices allow grief, and plenty of other emotions, to play out in bold, unsubtle ways. And for those frustrated with the love triangle in Season 1, which threatened to overstay its welcome, resolution in Zoey's love life happens sooner rather than later (but not simply happily-ever-after, of course).\\n\\nLauren Graham's Joan appears in the premiere before departing for a job in Singapore (the actress only signed on for a recurring role) and the hole in the office crew is filled by new coder George (Harvey Guillén of What We Do in the Shadows), whose adorable absurdity fits right in at the fictional SPRQ Point.\\n\\nIn the three episodes made available for review, Zoey isn't really using her powers to help a stranger of the week, as she did in Season 1, echoing CBS' 2003-05 series Joan of Arcadia (which, like ''Zoey's, also starred Mary Steenburgen as the mom). It's not an unwelcome change. The series has a strong group of actors playing increasingly well-rounded characters, and focusing on them instead of guest stars makes the series, created by Austin Winsberg, more confident and engaging.\\n\\nThe show's ability to exist in a world where grief, joy, frustration and elation exist at once makes it particularly apt for our current era. The new season is all about Zoey and her family trying to make the best of their circumstances, a familiar mantra for all of us during the COVID-19 pandemic. It helps that these moments of deep reflection are buttressed by laugh-out-loud funny sequences.\\n\\nPlenty of worthy shows never get a second season; it would have been a real shame if Zoey had stopped singing for good.\\n\\nMore:The 30 best TV shows to watch on Peacock right now"}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) — What's expected to be an offseason makeover for the Seattle Seahawks is starting with its coaching staff.\\n\\nThe Seahawks fired offensive coordinator Darrell Bevell and offensive line coach Tom Cable on Wednesday. Bevell was in charge of calling plays, while Cable was responsible for a run game and offensive line that failed to meet expectations.\\n\\nIt was a stunning sweep for head coach Pete Carroll, who has been immensely loyal to his assistants during his tenure. Carroll's only other significant firing was offensive coordinator Jeremy Bates following the 2010 season, Carroll's first in Seattle.\\n\\nWe are challenged by change, but excited to attack the future with great purpose, Carroll said in a statement. I want to thank both Tom and Darrell for their role in helping take this program to a championship level. I will always be grateful for the opportunity to coach and compete alongside these great men.\\n\\nSeattle has been backsliding since appearing in the Super Bowl three years ago. The Seahawks missed the playoffs for the first time since 2011 after going 9-7 this season. It was clear there would be significant personnel changes going into 2018 and it started with the coaching staff.\\n\\nBevell and Cable had been with the team since 2011, responsible for developing an offense that was good enough to appear in two straight Super Bowls but that had regressed since. Bevell was let go on Tuesday night, according to ProFootballTalk.com, which first reported the move, and Cable was dismissed a day later. It seemed unlikely Cable would be retained after Bevell was let go.\\n\\nMaking wholesale changes is a massive departure for Carroll. Both in the college ranks at Southern California and during his successful tenure in Seattle, there was never the need to completely remodel the coaching staff. If coaches left, it was because they were getting better opportunities elsewhere, something Carroll has relished.\\n\\nCarroll hinted that changes were likely when he recapped the 2017 season last week. It may be his last chance to refashion the Seahawks into a championship contender. Carroll is the oldest coach in the league at 66 — although he often acts like the youngest — and has two years remaining on his contract.\\n\\nI think a lot of respect is to be dealt to these guys, Carroll said. They've got families and lives and careers and dreams and hopes as we all do, and we'll see what happens. I've always been here to help our guys and I want them to go and do what they're capable of doing and meet their challenges of their lifetime as well, and I'm up for that. When it works out, I do everything I can to help them. We'll see what happens, but other than that there's not much to be said about that at this point.\\n\\nWhile Bevell was able to develop Russell Wilson into a top quarterback and create an offense good enough to win a Super Bowl, he was never able to escape the shadow of the play call made at the conclusion of the Super Bowl against New England. Rather than a run from the 1-yard line in the final minute, Bevell called for a pass that was intercepted by Malcolm Butler and cost Seattle its chance at a second straight title.\\n\\nWhile it's not a direct correlation, Seattle's drop from the top of the NFC started the moment that play happened. There was bitterness in the Seattle locker room that Marshawn Lynch didn't get the ball on the play, and the stigma hung over Bevell even as Carroll tried to take blame for the call.\\n\\nCable took nearly as much heat for his inability to develop an offensive line capable of properly protecting Wilson and establishing the power run game Carroll desired. Cable was given resources in the draft and occasionally in free agency, but the line never had the consistency for Seattle's offense to perform at its best.\\n\\nThe decision to remove both coaches may appease Seahawks fans who have grown frustrated with Seattle's offensive woes — including using the #FireBevell hashtag on Twitter — despite claims from players that the coaching staff was not to blame for the struggles.\\n\\nWide receiver Doug Baldwin launched into a passionate defense of Bevell's performance after the season.\\n\\nWe don't execute as a team. Offensively that's what we've seen time and time again is we do not execute the way that we should, Baldwin said. That's on us as players. You guys can blame (Bevell) as much as you want to. Truth is (Bevell) is not the problem.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "A group of 11 sitting and incoming Republican senators, led by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, announced in a joint statement Saturday that they will join Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri and object to the certification of President Donald Trump's loss to President-elect Joe Biden when a joint session of Congress meets Wednesday.\\n\\nHawley will be joined by Cruz and six other senators: Sens. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, James Lankford of Oklahoma, Steve Daines of Montana, John Kennedy of Louisiana, Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee and Mike Braun of Indiana.\\n\\nIn addition, four senators-elect, who will be sworn in Sunday as members of the new Congress, will join the team objecting to the certification of Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory. They are Sens.-elect Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming, Roger Marshall of Kansas, Bill Hagerty of Tennessee and Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, according to the joint statement.\\n\\nLive politics updates:Cruz, other Republican senators to join Hawley in objection to certification of Biden election win\\n\\nThe election of 2020, like the election of 2016, was hard fought and, in many swing states, narrowly decided, the statement said. The 2020 election, however, featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities.\\n\\nTrump and many of his supporters have alleged the election was stolen by Biden and the Democrats, though they have presented no credible evidence of widespread fraud and their legal challenges have been consistently rejected by the courts. While the senators who plan to object did not cite a basis for the allegations of fraud, they argued that the doubts sown by Trump and his allies have taken deep enough hold that they require debate.\\n\\nWhether or not our elected officials or journalists believe it, that deep distrust of our democratic processes will not magically disappear. It should concern us all. And it poses an ongoing threat to the legitimacy of any subsequent administrations, they wrote, lamenting that the Supreme Court rejected two cases challenging the election without hearing arguments.\\n\\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified,' they wrote, demanding the completion of an emergency 10-day audit.\\n\\nThey called for the audit to be conducted by an Electoral Commission appointed by Congress with full investigatory and fact-finding authority. Its task would be to audit the returns in the disputed states.\\n\\nHawley was the first senator to express any plans of objecting to the Electoral College results, which were certified by the states in early December.\\n\\nIn a statement Dec. 30 announcing his decision, Hawley said he can't vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws.\\n\\nHawley also claimed there had been an unprecedented effort of mega corporations, including Facebook and Twitter, to interfere in this election, in support of Joe Biden.\\n\\nMore:Congress is set to certify Biden's election win Jan. 6. Here's what to expect.\\n\\nAlong with the 12 senators, over 100 Republican members of the House may object to the certification of the electoral votes during Wednesday's joint session, Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., said in an interview with The Bulwark Podcast. Both CNN and Axios have reported it could be as many as 140 Republican House members. Last month, more than 120 GOP representatives signed a brief in support of a lawsuit seeking to overturn the election in a handful of swing states where Biden won.\\n\\nMany of those Republicans now see Wednesday's vote as their last chance to help hand Trump the win.\\n\\nIn their joint statement Saturday, the objecting Republican senators called Wednesday's upcoming vote the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud.\\n\\nDespite the growing support for Hawley's efforts, several congressional Republicans have expressed their disapproval, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who discouraged members of the Senate from heeding House Republicans' calls to object to the 2020 election results.\\n\\nMcConnell warned that an objection isn't in the best interest of everybody, according to a report by The Hill.\\n\\nThe GOP leader also called the Jan. 6 vote to certify the results the most consequential I have ever cast, according to Axios.\\n\\nMcConnell isn't the only Republican to disagree with the call to challenge the election result, which left the GOP with more House seats and a solid chance of maintaining hold of the Senate.\\n\\nSen. John Thune of South Dakota is also skeptical of the movement to object, which has no realistic hope of success, and its advocates.\\n\\nI think the thing they've got to remember is it's not going anywhere. I mean, in the Senate, it would go down like a shot dog, Thune told CNN. I just don't think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be.\\n\\nIn a lengthy Facebook post, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., explained why he chose not to participate in Hawley's plans and why he has to urge his colleagues to reject this dangerous ploy.\\n\\nLet's be clear what is happening here: We have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage, Sasse said in his post. But they're wrong – and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.\\n\\nRep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., also took a shot at those fueling the baseless fraud claims, calling the allegations a grifting scam Sunday on CNN's State of the Union.\\n\\nIt is a scam. It is going to disappoint the people that believe this election was stolen, that think this is an opportunity to change it, Kinzinger said.\\n\\nThe movement to oppose the election certification has been strongly condemned by Democrats.\\n\\nIt is a sad and tragic day for our country that 140 members of the House of Representatives, 13 senators and a defeated president are attempting to undermine American democracy and our Constitution. They will not succeed, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., said in a tweet in response to the GOP senators' statement Saturday.\\n\\nThe political equivalent of barking at the moon. This won't be taken seriously, nor should it be, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., wrote in a tweet responding to Hawley's announcement. The American people made a decision on November 3rd and that decision must and will be honored and protected by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives.\\n\\nThough Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., did not directly address the group of objecting senators, shortly after their statement he tweeted, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be President and Vice President of the United States in 18 days."}
{"original": "Here's what really stinks about another round of NFL coaches walking the plank:\\n\\nSteve Wilks is gone. Steve Keim stays.\\n\\nVance Joseph is gone. John Elway stays.\\n\\nTodd Bowles is gone. Mike Maccagnan stays.\\n\\nDirk Koetter is gone. Jason Licht stays.\\n\\nSee the pattern?\\n\\nAs fired coaches head into 2019 as symbols of failed opportunities — and please, let's not forget about the tremendous ripple effect that includes assistant coaches and their families — it is more than merely striking that so many general manager and other power brokers with highbrow titles will keep collecting their paychecks while their fall guys search for new work.\\n\\nSure, it's a results-driven business. Coaches, as they say, are hired to be fired. But the devil is dancing in the details.\\n\\nI'm just as responsible, if not more responsible, Elway, the Denver Broncos' president of football operations and GM, said Monday as he explained the move with Joseph.\\n\\nYeah, right. For years, Joseph dutifully climbed the ladder of the coaching ranks. After a few years of establishing himself as an up-and-coming candidate, he finally got his big shot — and lasted just two seasons before Elway pulled the plug.\\n\\nMore:32 things we learned heading into the 2018 NFL playoffs\\n\\nMore:Ranking NFL head coaching vacancies: Browns' job is attractive but not No. 1\\n\\nSimply put, Joseph wasn't the only reason the Broncos went 11-21 during his tenure.\\n\\nNow Elway begins the search for what will be his fourth coach in six years. His recruitment of Peyton Manning a few years ago netted a Super Bowl crown. But his miscalculations on other quarterback matters cannot be ignored: He drafted the bust Paxton Lynch in the first round. He gave a job to troubled Chad Kelly, who was waived after his arrest on a trespassing charge. He refused to take a second look at Colin Kaepernick — who was attractive enough of an option for Elway before he sparked the protest movement in the NFL, but not afterward.\\n\\nElway deserves only so much credit for publicly stating the obvious during a news conference, then pledging to do better. Being responsible sounds good, but apparently it doesn't mean being accountable to the point where it costs you your job without ample time to get it right — or wrong.\\n\\nAnd that's on NFL ownership to change.\\n\\nGiven the league calendar, teams often wait to make moves on GMs, personnel directors and scouts, aren't made until after the NFL draft. What a bad look. Coaches are traditionally booted after Week 17, while others can buy time and improve perception by picking some hot new prospects in the spring who may or may not pan out. It's an inherently weird residual of the NFL's culture.\\n\\nStill, at least Elway didn't have the worst optics on the so-called Black Monday, which had a double meaning when considering that five of the eight minority coaches who began the season at the helm are gone.\\n\\nWith Ozzie Newsome stepping down from his role with Ravens following the playoffs, the league that has gone to great lengths to promote a level playing field for minority candidates in the key leadership positions will have just one African-American GM.\\n\\nChris Grier was promoted by the Dolphins to oversee football operations in a move that bucked multiple trends on Monday as coach Adam Gase was fired and executive vice president Mike Tannenbaum was reassigned. Yes, it proves that despite the NFL calendar, it's possible to make front office decisions, too, when the season ends, and still proceed with the draft process.\\n\\nBut back to Wilks. Go ahead, have some empathy for a man canned after just one year on the job in Arizona — which would be sad whether he was African-American (which he is), white, purple, or green.. One-and-done, even with the 3-13 record now attached to Wilks' resume, is ruthless.\\n\\nWhen you fire a coach after just one year — which in recent years was also the fate of Jim Tomsula, Hue Jackson, Mike Mularkey, Chip Kelly and Rob Chudzinski — it means that you really didn't believe in your hire when you made it in the first place.\\n\\nClearly, coaches are expected to change the culture and get results quickly. The second-year L.A. coaches — Sean McVay and Anthony Lynn — get points for that. But not every coach brings the presence that, say, Bill Parcells did.\\n\\nI'm certainly not calling for last-place finishers Jon Gruden (4-12) and Matt Patricia (6-10) to get axed after one year with the Raiders and Lions, respectively — although it was reasonable to expect some quick, Parcells-like magic from Coach Chucky, given that 10-year, $100 million contract. Both coaches need more time with their rebuilding jobs. But their cases, in comparison, makes the Cardinals' handling of Wilks that much more tragic.\\n\\nEven worse, when Cardinals president Michael Bidwill sat there Monday, Keim was at his side. It wasn't Wilks who signed quarterback Sam Bradford to a $20 million deal while they sought to develop a long-term prospect (which turned out to be Josh Rosen). And it was Keim who had the five-game suspension this year after his guilty plea for extreme DUI.\\n\\nIt just looks like a twisted double standard that Bidwill would stick it out with Keim yet have such short patience with Wilks. Bidwill, though, read the same type of script that Elway used. He declared that the fired coach was a good man. Lamented the wins and losses. Pledged to do better with the next coaching search.\\n\\nWhat, do they pass along these boilerplate statements on the dark NFLntranet?\\n\\nWhen Bidwill mentioned that the Cardinals lacked the competitiveness under Wilks that he's looking for, he sounded so silly. The Cardinals lost on Sunday, but the Seahawks won on a field goal as time expired. That's competitiveness. Wilks' team never quit on him.\\n\\nAnd it's ironic that the Cardinals are considering ousted Packers coach Mike McCarthy for the job, per reports. McCarthy would be good for Rosen. At the moment, though, it doesn't appear that the No. 10 overall selection was a better pick by Keim than Lamar Jackson, who was taken 32nd overall by the Ravens and won the AFC North crown.\\n\\nMaybe the Cardinals didn't rank Jackson so high because, with all of that running he did at Louisville, the Heisman Trophy winner didn't look like the prototypical NFL quarterback — even as the game has increasingly evolved to feature mobile passers. Newsome seems to know better. Quarterbacks come in different sizes, shapes and hues. The bottom line is winning.\\n\\nWilks, by the way, took his team to Green Bay and beat McCarthy's team. Apparently, that didn't count much on Bidwill's scale of competitiveness. Now McCarthy might wind up with Wilks' old job.\\n\\nThe coach is gone. The GM stays. That's not the case everywhere. The Vikings and Jaguars are keeping their coach/GM combinations, although it's expected there will be other staff changes, as is the case with the Falcons, who fired all three of their coordinators — on offense, defense and special teams.\\n\\nBut the next time you hear representatives from some NFL team spout that they've made some organizational decision while explaining a key decision, just remember all the coaches who walked the plank without their GMs at their side on Black Monday.\\n\\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell."}

You're on a monthly rate plan of say $40 a month per line for service, but after the requisite taxes, surcharges and fees are piled on, you're paying a lot more.\\n\\nAt CES, T-Mobile said it is eliminating such excess fees under an all-in T-Mobile One plan that is supposed to remove sticker shock at the end of the month.\\n\\nNo, the government isn't suddenly given you a free pass on taxes. It's just that T-Mobile says it will absorb them, along with other fees. So if your plan says you'll pay $70 for service, your bill will amount to seven-zero.\\n\\nExceptions to the rule: You'll still be saddled with late fees. And new customers still pay for a SIM starter kit.\\n\\nTaxes and fees aren't going away, we're investing in our customers, insists T-Mobile CEO John Legere, who says wireless customers now fork over $17.2 billion in such fees yearly.\\n\\nT-Mobile also promised to never change the price you pay under T-Mobile One, unless you choose to change it yourself for some future plan. And it said that when you use 2 GB or less in a given month, you'll get a $10 credit on your next month's bill per line.

{"original": "WOODLAND PARK, N.J. – None of the patients who may have been exposed to HIV or hepatitis as a result of infection-control problems at a New Jersey surgery center have tested positive so far, the surgery center said Friday.\\n\\nBut the center – HealthPlus Surgery Center in Saddle Brook – has succeeded in contacting only one-third of the patients at risk, its officials said. And the test results for fewer than 10 percent of the affected patients are known.\\n\\nWe are developing a program to call and otherwise contact all patients in a way that protects their privacy, the center said in a statement released by Ron Simoncini, a spokesman.\\n\\nThe center was shut down by state Health Department officials for three weeks in September after an inspection revealed problems with the sterilization of surgical instruments, rusty tools, and poor hand-washing and management of anesthesia medications.\\n\\nAs part of its correction plan, the center was required to notify patients who had received injections or undergone surgery at the facility between Jan. 1 and Sept. 7 last year that they may have been exposed to HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C.\\n\\nMore:Do they have HIV? Unsanitary surgery center's patients left waiting for results\\n\\nHealthPlus sent certified letters to 3,778 patients starting in late December.\\n\\nOn Friday, HealthPlus said more than 2,262 letters are awaiting retrieval from the post office or delivery. More than 1,360 were accepted by the addressee and 156 have been returned, the HealthPlus statement said, probably due to a change of address or incorrect information on the medical records.\\n\\nIn addition, two patients who were treated at the center during the critical time period have not received notification and have retained an attorney.\\n\\nPaul Said, 40, of Fairview received epidural injections at the center in April and June.\\n\\nI never received a letter from the facility, he said in an interview Friday. I double-checked to make sure that was the actual facility and the dates, and discovered that he was one of the at-risk patients. He scheduled a blood test for Monday through his personal physician, he said, because he did not feel comfortable doing it through HealthPlus.\\n\\nGisela Santana, 65, of Queens said she had arthroscopic shoulder surgery at HealthPlus in June but also did not receive notification of the need to be tested. When she saw a report on Telemundo about the center, she said, she checked her medical records and became concerned. Her blood test was performed Thursday, but results were not available Friday.\\n\\nThere obviously are more than 3,778 victims, said Sanford Rubenstein, a Brooklyn attorney who represents Said and Santana. He urged patients who were seen at HealthPlus during the relevant period to consult their personal physicians and get their blood tested.\\n\\nHealthPlus was responsible for identifying the patients to be notified based on its records, a Health Department spokeswoman said.\\n\\nThe state Health Department is aware there have been some issues where patients may not have received their notification letter, said Donna Leusner, a spokeswoman. HealthPlus maintains the patient address database, so they will have to address this issue further.\\n\\nSo far, test results have been received for 344 patients – fewer than 10 percent of patients that the center said may have been exposed to the blood-borne diseases, HealthPlus officials said. Of those patients, no positive results (are) known to be associated with HealthPlus at this point, the statement said.\\n\\nPreviously, HealthPlus had reported one case of chronic hepatitis identified, which it said likely was present before any treatment at HealthPlus.\\n\\nThe Health Department specified the list, or panel, of seven tests each patient should have, HealthPlus statement said, and determined that patient who had the recommended panel of tests … do not need to be retested.\\n\\nAn infectious disease specialist agreed.\\n\\nThese are the correct tests to determine is someone was recently infected, said Ronald G. Nahass, president of Infectious Disease Care, the state's largest medical practice for the specialty of infectious diseases. The panel would provide assurance three months after the exposure as to whether (the patients) they were safe or not.\\n\\nA class-action lawsuit filed Thursday, however, described the actions by HealthPlus as wholly inadequate, given the seriousness of the diseases, ... the nature of the danger, and the standard of medical care for persons potentially exposed to such diseases.\\n\\nThe lawsuit is the fourth to be filed in connection with the infection-control problems at the center. It was filed on behalf of David Kinlock, a Newark resident and patient at HealthPlus.\\n\\nAny positive results of the blood tests must be confidentially reported to local public health agencies by law, HealthPlus noted in its statement. That allows the agency to trace possible contacts of the infected person and make sure that they receive proper testing and treatment."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) — Tennessee owner Amy Adams Strunk shot down speculation that Mike Mularkey's job is at risk, saying her coach is going nowhere after helping change the Titans' culture and getting their first playoff victory in 14 years.\\n\\nNational reports first had Mularkey potentially fired if the Titans lost their regular-season finale and again if Tennessee lost its AFC wild-card game at Kansas City. Instead, the Titans pulled off a major comeback after trailing 21-3 at halftime.\\n\\nStrunk tried to stop all the talk with her statement on Mularkey's job security Sunday .\\n\\nI regret that outside rumors gained a life of their own, Strunk said. No one has been a bigger supporter of Mike Mularkey than I have over the last two-plus seasons. ... Just to eliminate any distractions moving forward, Mike Mularkey is our head coach and will be our head coach moving forward.\\n\\nStrunk made Mularkey interim head coach in November 2015 after firing Ken Whisenhunt who went 3-20 in his short tenure. Mularkey went 2-7 before Strunk gave him a three-year contract as head coach in January 2016, two days after hiring Jon Robinson as general manager.\\n\\nMularkey addressed the national reports that his job was on the line after the Titans beat Kansas City 22-21 on Saturday.\\n\\nNo, Mularkey said. I haven't had any support to say that I was (secure). No. I just assumed the worst.\\n\\nHours after his owner's statement of support, Mularkey said that the Titans absolutely are on the same page together. He also called Strunk's statement nice and that he had only wanted to talk about the Titans beating a good team in their own backyard after the game.\\n\\nAsked if the statement has put his mind at ease, Mularkey said he's addressed the situation with his staff and won't talk about it anymore.\\n\\nI'm already onto New England, Mularkey said. It's been addressed, and I'm full-speed ahead getting ready for New England with our staff.\\n\\nStrunk credited Mularkey and Robinson with changing the culture of the organization and said she's so happy they've been able to win 19 games over the past two seasons, including the first playoff victory since Jan. 3, 2004. She said the Titans have plenty of work ahead starting with the AFC divisional round, visiting No. 1 seed New England (13-3) on Saturday night.\\n\\nI am looking forward to the journey, Strunk said.\\n\\nWith the win over the Chiefs, Mularkey now has a victory in his first postseason game. He also is 21-21 since taking over the Titans. Their latest win needed an amazing comeback from a 21-3 halftime deficit, tying for the second-largest rally by a road team in the playoffs. They tied Dallas' comeback from an 18-point deficit in 1972 in the divisional round to beat San Francisco.\\n\\nOnly Detroit's rally from 20 points down in 1957 to beat the 49ers in the divisional round was bigger than Tennessee's comeback.\\n\\nTennessee rallied by sticking with the run. The Titans set a postseason franchise record by running for 202 yards against the Chiefs. Derrick Henry ran for a career-high 156 yards, while Marcus Mariota added 46.\\n\\nCornerback Logan Ryan, a free agent signee this past offseason, says the Titans have done a lot with the first playoff appearance since 2008 and first playoff win in 14 years.\\n\\nThat's a pretty good coach to me, Ryan said.\\n\\nNOTES: Mularkey says RB DeMarco Murray, who has missed the past two games with an injured right knee, will be day to day this week and might have a limited role. Mularkey says having an extra day would have helped. The coach also needs to see Murray run.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL .\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Teresa M.

But they were more than empty words of praise. On the second drive, with the Colts already leading 7-0, Mack took a handoff from Luck on a counter play with two pulling linemen leading the way. Rookie Quenton Nelson shoved All-Pro lineman Jadeveon Clowney back and opened a hole for Mack. Five yards up the field, Ryan Kelly steamrolled an overmatched defensive back.\\n\\nIt might have been the easiest 25-yard run of Mack's career.\\n\\nThose guys helped me today, Mack said of the offensive line. They got me to the second level.\\n\\nAnother example came later on that second drive. On second-and-goal from the Houston 2-yard-line, Mack bounced it to the left side, where there was a wall of three offensive linemen – Nelson, Anthony Castonzo and Joe Haeg – and tight end Mo Alie-Cox waiting to escort him into the end zone.\\n\\nIt might have been the easiest 2-yard touchdown run of Mack's career.\\n\\nI knew Mo was going to come off and get that corner block for me, Mack said. After that I knew it was pretty much going to be an easy touchdown for me. Once he set it for me, it was easy.\\n\\nMack, of course, deserves his share of the credit, too. His quick cuts, change of direction and ability to fit through small spaces at 6-foot and 210 pounds makes him dangerous in almost any situation. Some of the big runs we have, he's only hitting it in a space this big, center Kelly said, holding his hands shoulder width apart. He slides through and goes right up there. He's just trusting, man.\\n\\nThis was not just any defense the Colts were facing on Saturday, either. Led by Pro Bowl selections in Clowney, J.J. Watt and middle linebacker Benardrick McKinney, the Texans came into the game No. 1 in the NFL in yards per rush at 3.4.\\n\\nThe Colts, as a team, averaged 5.7 yards per carry on Saturday, going for 200 yards. Mack rushed for his 148 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries for a 6.2 average. That is a formula that can work, especially in what figures to be a chilly Kansas City next week against a defense that is second-to-last in the NFL in yards per rush (5.0).\\n\\nWe came into this game saying we need to dominate up front, we need to play, we need to run the football, and we need to stop the run, Colts' coach Frank Reich said. To roll off 200 yards against that defense is unbelievable. That's just a real credit to the offensive line and our running backs and tight ends. I can't say enough about that.\\n\\nMack's 148 yards topped the previous Colts' playoff record of 147 set by Zack Crockett against the San Diego Chargers in 1995.\\n\\nThe Colts' balance was beautiful early. First drive: Seven passes, two rushes. Touchdown. Second drive: Seven rushes, two passes. Fourth drive: Two rushes, five passes. Touchdown.\\n\\nWe know we have an elite quarterback, and we can throw it for 400 yards when we have to, Reich said. But what we talked about is the margin for error in playoff football when you try to do it that way is very thin. It is a very thin margin for error. But when you can run it like this, when you can win running the ball and stopping it, that's just everything.\\n\\nThe Colts did not score after taking a 21-0 lead into halftime, but the Texans were never able to completely slow down Mack. After Houston missed an opportunity to cut into the Colts' 21-7 lead with 4:09 left, Mack picked up a first down on a third-and-2 play by the nose of the football. He then broke runs of 15 and 26 yards before the Colts went into victory formation.\\n\\nThat's been the catalyst of the season, Kelly said of the running game. You look back to the Buffalo game (220 rushing yards in a 37-5 win on Oct. 21) and it really ignited our offense. When we stopped throwing the ball 50-60 times a game is when we started winning.\\n\\nMack, who rushed for 908 yards in 12 regular season games, said there has been a learning process from a rookie season that saw the fourth-round pick rush for 358 yards behind veteran starter Frank Gore.\\n\\nYou sit there and you learn a lot, Mack said. I think that's what happened to me. I watched him and learned the game. Frank just told me to go hard and play the next play. He wasn't a talker, he just went out there and did his job. You always try to follow a guy like that. He's a legend and Hall of Famer.\\n\\nMack, 22, is far from that status at this point of his career. But he is a major piece of what could be a special playoff run.\\n\\nCall Star reporter Kyle Neddenriep at (317) 444-6649."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) — Coach John Tortorella hates talking about it, but the Blue Jackets' improbable 16-game winning streak has Columbus and the NHL buzzing.\\n\\nA win on Thursday night in Washington will tie Columbus with the 1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins of Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr for the longest streak in league history. The team's surprising success and the streak have given long-suffering Blue Jackets fans much to cheer about lately. Just don't ask Torts about it.\\n\\nI just want us to keep our heads down, and I just want us to play, he said after Tuesday night's 3-1 win over Edmonton. You know what we are? We're a group of businessmen, as far as I'm concerned.\\n\\nColumbus hasn't lost since a 2-1 setback at Florida on Nov. 26. The Blue Jackets won all 14 games in December and their 27-5-4 record is the NHL's best. Boasting the league's best power-play unit, they sit atop the rugged Metropolitan Division with reigning NHL champs Pittsburgh and the New York Rangers trailing.\\n\\nAs soon as our game was over (Tuesday) night, guys were checking to see if they won or not. We had it on, said Washington defenseman Brooks Orpik, who will try to slow down the surging Blue Jackets on Thursday. If anyone says they weren't (paying attention) they're lying because we had it on in the change room.\\n\\nWhat's even more astounding is that Blue Jackets were among the league's dregs last season, finishing 34-40-8. Without any blockbuster trades or big name free-agent signings in the offseason, expectations for the 2016-17 bunch were fairly low.\\n\\nBut a mixture of experience and youth — outstanding first-line defenders Zach Werenski and Seth Jones are 19 and 22, respectively — along with terrific goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky has lifted the Blue Jackets to unprecedented heights and has them eyeing the Stanley Cup playoffs for just the third time in the 16-year history of the franchise.\\n\\nTortorella preaches never getting too up or too down about anything that happens. Captain Nick Foligno said there hasn't been much talk about the streak in the Blue Jackets locker room.\\n\\nAs you get closer, I think that's when you start to taste it a little bit more, understand it a little bit more, he said. But for us, it's just knowing how we're going to go about our business. That's what I'm so proud of. It's easy to get your eye off the goal when you're going through something like this. But for us the goal isn't the streak, it's what's coming ahead and what's coming down the road.\\n\\nCam Atkinson leads the team with 18 goals and 38 points through 36 games and scored the opening tally against Edmonton on Tuesday.\\n\\nI think we're just rolling, he said. I personally don't think about (the streak), other guys might. Obviously, it's really cool if you think about it, but right now we're just focusing on trying to get (another) two points.\\n\\nBut a lot of other people are talking about it, including Scotty Bowman, who was coach of the 1992-93 Pittsburgh team that won 17 straight. Bowman, now a senior adviser to the Chicago Blackhawks, said the Blue Jackets' string of wins is unbelievable considering the parity in today's game.\\n\\nThey've got a lot of things going for them, a heck of a power play, and they've got a goaltender that's helped, Bowman said.\\n\\nThe 1979-80 Philadelphia Flyers own a record 35-game unbeaten streak that will almost certainly never be matched because they played when overtime didn't exist in the regular season. The Flyers won 25 games and tied 10 more from Oct. 16, 1979, until Jan. 6, 1980.\\n\\nFor now, the Blue Jackets are just looking ahead to the Capitals. And after Tuesday's win in front a vocal near-sellout crowd, even the irascible Tortorella was in a decent mood.\\n\\nEverything feels good right now, he said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Sports Writer Stephen Whyno in Washington and freelance writer Mark Didtler in Tampa, Florida, contributed.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Mitch Stacy at http://twitter.com/mitchstacy"}
{"original": "PORT WASHINGTON, Wis. – The pharmacist suspected of intentionally spoiling 500 doses of COVID-19 vaccine at a Wisconsin hospital because he believed they were unsafe was released from jail Monday, after a prosecutor indicated he's not positive the vaccine was actually destroyed.\\n\\nSteven R. Brandenburg, 46, of Grafton, had concerns the vaccines could change people's DNA, an unfounded claim that has been debunked. His estranged wife said in a divorce record that in early December, he brought her a water purifier and 30-day food supply because the world was crashing down due to government cyberattacks and power grid shutdowns.\\n\\nLast week, she said she no longer felt safe around him, and a court commissioner temporarily ordered the couple's children not stay with Brandenburg.\\n\\nBrandenburg was arrested last week and had been ordered held on a probable cause statement from Grafton police that he likely committed two felonies – first-degree recklessly endangering safety, and criminal damage to property.\\n\\nYour COVID vaccine questions, answered:I already had COVID, should I get the vaccine?\\n\\nMisinformation around the COVID-19 vaccines has surged online with false claims circulating on everything from the vaccines' ingredients to its possible side effects.\\n\\nOne of the earliest false claims suggested that the vaccines could alter DNA. Experts have said there is no truth to the claims that the vaccines can genetically modify humans.\\n\\nHe appeared via Zoom from the Ozaukee County Jail for an initial court appearance Monday afternoon, as did his attorney, Jason Baltz of Mequon. Baltz said later that neither he nor his client wanted to comment to news media.\\n\\nBut Ozaukee County District Attorney Adam Gerol told Circuit Judge Paul Malloy that the hospital had walked back some of the information on which police had relied, that the vials in question have not since been destroyed, but are still in the hospital's possession and might even still be viable.\\n\\nHe said he's working with Moderna to possibly test that evidence. If the vaccine is still good, Gerol said, the most he could charge Brandenburg with would be attempted criminal damage to property, a misdemeanor. There is no crime of attempting to recklessly endanger someone.\\n\\nGerol said he is working with the U.S. Attorney's Office as well which could try to charge Brandenburg with a federal crime. A spokesman with that office said Monday federal prosecutors had no comment.\\n\\nMalloy ordered Brandenburg to turn over any weapons, not work in healthcare or distribute medication of any kind, or have any contact with Aurora Health Center while free on the signature bond.\\n\\nGerol said Brandenburg, whom a Grafton police detective described as an admitted conspiracy theorist, had made a full confession to Grafton police that he intentionally tried to ruin the vaccines because he didn't believe they were safe. He told a detective he was concerned the vaccine could alter the DNA of people who took it.\\n\\nThe Moderna vaccines are messenger RNA vaccines. Instead of introducing a weakened version of the virus so the body will try to build defenses, the mRNA delivers instructions for our cells to make a piece of protein like that found on COVID-19, and the body then begins building immunities against that and the coronavirus.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 vaccines are the first to use the mRNA process, though scientists have been studying it for decades and experts have endorsed the new vaccines as safe. They have no impact on someone's DNA.\\n\\nFDA officials, asked to respond to Brandenburg's actions, referred to its statement Dec. 18, the day Moderna's vaccine received emergency use authorization.\\n\\nGuided by science and data, the agency's career staff determined that the vaccine's known and potential benefits clearly outweigh its known and potential risks..., said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., Director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research.\\n\\nYour COVID vaccine questions, answered:What happens if I miss the second-dose of vaccine?\\n\\nToday's authorization demonstrates our steadfast commitment to the health of the American people, with the assurance that our scientific standards and the integrity of our review process have been maintained.\\n\\nGerol, the prosecutor, said some of the pharmacists' coworkers told investigators they believed he had brought guns to work at least two times, though Gerol was unsure when those instances occurred.\\n\\nBrandenburg was arrested early Dec. 31, the day after Aurora Health Care Medical Group officials said his failure to refrigerate the vials of Moderna vaccine a week earlier – first reported to have been a mistake or oversight – was in fact intentional.

But environmental advocacy organizations who have condemned the deal's failure to consider climate change are raising alarm about moving forward without binding standards on Mexico to regulate pollution.\\n\\nThe deal does not even mention climate change, fails to adequately address toxic pollution, includes weak environmental standards and an even weaker enforcement mechanism, the organizations said in a letter sent to Congress ahead of the House of Representatives' approval.\\n\\nLawmakers in the House who approved the Trump Administration's negotiated deal last month did authorize $300 million for clean-up efforts along the U.S.-Mexican border, where failing sewer systems pump toxic discharge into rivers threatening both ecosystems and lives.

Sample various products\\n\\nCredit: Amazon Try sample size products and earn credits toward future purchases.\\n\\nSeveral of these features are offered exclusively to Prime members, making the $120/year (or $12.99/month) investment well worth it. For instance, Prime members can get Prime Samples, a.k.a. sample-size cosmetics, snacks, pet food, and more that range from $2-$4 per item. Plus, when you purchase one of their Sample Boxes, which range from $4.99-$19.99, you earn credits that can be applied to a full-size purchase.\\n\\nGet the Dog Food and Treat Sample Box for $11.99\\n\\n3.

In select markets, AmazonFresh will deliver fresh groceries right to your door, saving you a trip to the market. Currently, only Prime members can use this service, and it costs an additional $15 a month. But if you factor in the time you spend driving to and from the store and dealing with crowds and long lines, the monthly expense is more than worth it.\\n\\n9.

I can see this being quite helpful if I'm ever in the market for a new vehicle.\\n\\n11.

As we move forward, General Manager Jason Licht will oversee the process for finding our next head coach.\\n\\nThe presence of Winston makes the Bucs a prime job for the next coach, if the team hasn't picked one already. But the impatience of ownership may be cause for concern. The team has now dismissed three head coaches in a little more than four years.\\n\\nIf the Bucs decide to promote from within — offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter is the most logical candidate — the switch would have parallels to 2009, when the team fired coach Jon Gruden and promoted 32-year-old defensive coordinator Raheem Morris to take his place.\\n\\nNFL coaching carousel: Breaking down every hire\\n\\nMorris was 17-31 in three seasons before he was replaced by Greg Schiano, who lasted two seasons and went 11-21.

Sometimes — because college football is supposed to be fun — it's about trick plays.\\n\\nEach weekend this season, editors at USA TODAY Sports selected four calls from across the nation that we determined were among the best decisions for the Amway Coach's Call of the Week.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Promises, promises, and still no foreseeable sign of the Buffalo Bills ending the NFL's longest active playoff drought any time soon.\\n\\nAs consistency goes for a franchise stuck in an ever-deepening rut, missing the postseason for a 17th consecutive year and hitting the reset button are the few things that have remained the same.\\n\\nThe rinse-and-repeat cycle of change began last week when owner Terry Pegula fired Rex Ryan a week short of completing his second full season. Ryan became the fall guy after his big bluster and vows to build a bully fell well short of expectations, particularly on defense, which was supposed to be his specialty.\\n\\nInstead, the Bills wrapped up a 7-9 season by embarking on their seventh coaching search since Wade Phillips was fired following an 8-8 finish in 2000.\\n\\nObviously, that wasn't the plan, Pegula told The Associated Press , noting he grew dismayed during a season in which Buffalo's defense showed no signs of progress.\\n\\nPegula then found it important to defend his team from critics by saying there is no dysfunction within the organization.\\n\\nHe expressed full confidence in Whaley, who is leading the coaching search. And Pegula defended the fourth-year GM by refuting suggestions that Whaley had friction with Ryan or his predecessor, Doug Marrone, who opted out of his contract following the 2014 season.\\n\\nDoug got along very well with Rex, Pegula said. I don't know why Marrone left. You can ask him that question.\\n\\nAssurances aside, an overwhelming sense of skepticism prevails over a franchise with a spotty drafting history, continued uncertainty at quarterback, and a general manager who had difficulty explaining his exact role during a 40-minute end-of-season news conference on Monday.\\n\\nIn saying he spoke for ownership and Bills President Russ Brandon, Whaley provided no definitive answers on Ryan's dismissal. He said he had no input in the decision, no knowledge of Ryan's job being in jeopardy, and had no reaction when informed Ryan was out.\\n\\nAll he could offer was a hope the next coach will succeed.\\n\\nWe're searching for that continuity, Whaley said. We're searching for that coach that can be here for 10-15 years\\n\\nCOACHING CANDIDATES: Interim head coach Anthony Lynn is considered the front-runner to take over. Elevated to offensive coordinator after Greg Roman was fired following an 0-2 start, Lynn has familiarity with an offense that led the NFL in rushing for second consecutive season. Should Lynn land the job, former Jacksonville coach Gus Bradley is in the discussion to serve as defensive coordinator.\\n\\nThe Bills are expected to interview between five and six candidates, including Panthers defensive coordinator Sean McDermott and Cardinals offensive coordinator Harold Goodwin.\\n\\nQUARTERBACK QUESTIONS: Tyrod Taylor's future is in question after the second-year starter was inactive for Buffalo's mean-nothing season-ending 30-10 loss at the New York Jets. Taylor has a 15-14 record and the Bills have two months to determine whether to pick up or opt out of a five-year contract extension signed in August.\\n\\nTaylor acknowledged he viewed the Bills' decision to bench him as a sign of the team losing confidence in him.\\n\\nBackup EJ Manuel isn't expected to be re-signed. Buffalo's only other quarterback on the roster is rookie fourth-round pick Cardale Jones.\\n\\nROSTER TURNVOVER: The Bills have 24 players eligible to become free agents this offseason. It's a group that includes starting cornerback Stephon Gilmore, linebackers Lorenzo Alexander and Zach Brown and receiver Robert Woods.\\n\\nEven before Ryan's dismissal, the team's offseason needs were receiver and safety to replace Aaron Williams , whose future is uncertain because of a season-ending neck injury sustained in a 28-25 loss at Miami on Oct. 23.\\n\\nON THE RUN: The defense's largest letdown was an inability to stop the run. Buffalo allowed opposing running backs to top 200 yards three times this season — including Miami's Jay Ajayi twice (214 and 206).\\n\\nThey also gave up a franchise-worst 236 yards rushing to Pittsburgh's Le'Veon Bell. The three outings rank among the six-best performances against Buffalo.\\n\\nON THE OFFENSIVE: The LeSean McCoy-led running attack finished with 2,630 yards rushing, the third-highest total in team history, and scored a franchise-best 29 TDs. ... Buffalo's 399 points scored rank seventh on the team list, and most since 400 in 1998. ... Taylor finished with 3,023 yards passing in becoming Buffalo's first player to top 3,000 yards in consecutive seasons since Ryan Fitzpatrick's three-year run from 2010-12.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Miriam Krinsky and Lisa Foster\\n\\nOpinion contributors\\n\\nAmericans owe billions in unpaid court debt.\\n\\nAnd while the new year is a chance for optimism and a fresh start, for millions of Americans 2019 will only bring continued despair as they struggle under the monetary weight of the justice system.\\n\\nOver the past eight years, virtually every state has increased the cost of fines and fees within the justice system. And for many jurisdictions, money collected through court-assessed debt plays a major role in keeping government in business.\\n\\nFinancial penalties are imposed not only for felony and misdemeanor offenses, but also for minor traffic and municipal code violations. In 43 states, defendants are charged for public defender-related fees, causing many to waive this critical constitutional right. And in most states, fines and fees are even assessed against youth for minor infractions such as skipping school — leaving parents, guardians and, in some cases, the youth themselves with added financial burdens and the threat of incarceration.\\n\\nFortunately, 2019 also brings newly elected prosecutors who are rethinking justice. These new leaders recognize the unfairness and inherent conflicts in relying on penalizing poor people to fund the justice system and are working with their communities on reform.\\n\\nRead more commentary\\n\\nMORE:Top Policing the USA columns of 2018\\n\\nCOLUMN:As FIRST STEP Act raises bar on reform, ending ban on prison Pell Grant becomes imperative\\n\\nPenalties perpetuate incarceration\\n\\nFor people who cannot afford to immediately pay fines and fees, the consequences are harsh. Interest charges and collection fees are typically imposed, and several jurisdictions even charge fees to set up payment plans. People are forced to return to court repeatedly to make payments on their debt or explain why they have not been able to pay the amount in full.\\n\\nIn 17 states, voting rights are restricted until all debts are paid. And in more than 40 states, if you can't afford to pay the fines and fees imposed, your driver's license is suspended. People need to drive to get to work and to take their children to school or a family member to the doctor. But driving on a suspended license can bring additional criminal charges, further monetary penalties and, in the worst cases, incarceration. The system is rigged against those who struggle most and offers no solutions.\\n\\nFines and fees are highly regressive and disproportionately impact low-income communities of color — serving mainly to perpetuate cycles of debt and incarceration. This troubling starting point reflects ever deeper systemic problems.\\n\\nMany jurisdictions raise substantial revenue from fines and fees, creating perverse incentives that depend on people committing crime to fund government. For example, North Hills, New York, a village on Long Island, derives 25 percent of its revenue from fines and fees.\\n\\nThis framework diverts critical law enforcement resources from the job of solving serious crimes to the task of hunting down people and using scarce resources to collect revenue.\\n\\nFind fine alternatives\\n\\nThere are jurisdictions and prosecutors working toward better options.\\n\\nIn Durham County, North Carolina, newly elected District Attorney Satana Deberry, who begins her term this month, advocated for a misdemeanor citation system during her campaign to divert more people from court and its associated fees.\\n\\nIn Chicago, the Illinois attorney's office has avoided placing financial burdens on those who come in contact with the justice system by not charging a fee for diversion programs that offer an alternative to jail time. That policy opens alternatives to those who may benefit the most.\\n\\nAnd in Tampa and Jacksonville, Florida, state attorneys Andrew Warren and Melissa Nelson have created programs to restore driving privileges and eliminate prosecutions for driving with suspended licenses.\\n\\nProsecutors have a key role to play in ending the poverty trap of fines and fees and should speak out about the injustices those costs cause. They should advocate aggressively for assessing fines and fees on a sliding scale, ending driver's license suspensions for unpaid fines and fees, and eliminating fines and fees for children and young people. Prosecutors should also find alternative mechanisms to fund courts fully and fairly.\\n\\nThese are just a few steps prosecutors can take to lead with compassion and ensure justice is served in 2019.\\n\\nLet's hope that a new year will bring a new, more compassionate and more sensible way of approaching these and other issues of great importance to our justice system.\\n\\nMiriam Krinsky is a former federal prosecutor and the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution, a national network of elected prosecutors committed to new thinking and innovation.

We will not stand for it in Los Angeles.\\n\\nThe lawsuit seeks penalties, restitution and a prohibition against practices that lead to worker exploitation, according to the complaints.\\n\\nRepresentatives at NFI and California Cartage did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday about the suits filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\\n\\nI would question the standing or merit of this lawsuit, but that is for the courts to decide, said Weston LaBar, chief executive officer of the Harbor Trucking Association, who called the state's history of judgments in favor of port truckers completely one-sided.\\n\\nThis most recent effort by the city attorney does nothing more than validate that in my mind, LeBar said.\\n\\nThe USA TODAY Network previously reported that more than 1,100 California port truck drivers have filed labor complaints in civil court and with the state labor commissioner since 2008. That year a new California environmental law required trucking companies serving state ports to replace old trucks with new, cleaner rigs.\\n\\nTo avoid the cost, many companies pushed their independent drivers into lease-to-own contracts that they didn't understand and could not afford.\\n\\nWhen drivers got sick or fell behind on payments, trucking companies fired them, seizing their trucks and tens of thousands of dollars they had paid toward buying them.\\n\\nMonday's legal action is the latest in a wave of changes affecting the port trucking industry in recent months following the USA TODAY Network's coverage.\\n\\nSince the network began reporting last spring drivers have filed 23 new California Labor Commissioner cases and six lawsuits, including three class actions, against port trucking companies.\\n\\nTrucking companies exposed in the network's reporting have lost business. At least one executive resigned. State and federal agencies have launched investigations into potential worker exploitation and forced labor, and lawmakers have introduced sweeping national and state reforms to curb systematic labor abuse in the industry.\\n\\nThe revelations about the abuse of workers in the port trucking industry should outrage every American, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wrote in a November letter to President Donald Trump, calling for an executive order to investigate port trucking companies and ban government agencies from contracting with them. It is time for us to end this exploitation.\\n\\nSanders is one of several high-profile lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, of California, and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who have launched public pressure campaigns to reform the industry.\\n\\nIn August they sent letters to 16 retailers and manufacturers named in the network's reports, demanding independent investigations and answers.\\n\\nPort trucking companies' brazen disregard for federal transportation safety standards and workers' safety and rights is shameful, wrote the senators, led by Brown.\\n\\nAs a result, manufacturers, shippers and at least six major retailers — including Target, Home Depot and Walmart — launched internal audits of their supply chain to ferret out port trucking companies with labor violations. So far two, including Costco, have cut ties with their trucking companies.\\n\\nMore:'Rigged' investigation prompts new bill\\n\\nMore:USA TODAY NETWORK investigation uncovers enterprise corruption and mistreatment of hundreds of truckers in the U.S.\\n\\nPacific 9, one of the biggest trucking companies at the port, changed its business model, dropping the lease-to-own program and rehiring dozens of independent drivers as protected employees.\\n\\nWeeks after one of the network's reports, the president of Fargo Trucking resigned, its board filed for bankruptcy, and the company lost one of its biggest clients, international steamship giant OOCL, after receiving tremendous pressure to minimize exposure from the articles, according to an email sent to the trucking company's executives.\\n\\nIn July, House members on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, led by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., demanded more oversight from the Department of Transportation, which pledged to investigate the allegations of abuse.\\n\\nCiting the network's coverage, DeFazio and nine others in Congress introduced two bills, including the Port Drivers Bill of Rights, and other legislation to grant local governments more power to regulate port trucking companies.\\n\\nLocal and state lawmakers also have taken action.\\n\\nLast year California Democrats signed a unanimous resolution calling on the mayors in Los Angeles and Long Beach to end the sweatshop working conditions in the harbor.\\n\\nLos Angeles Councilman Joe Buscaino, who has led Los Angeles City Council hearings on the issue, praised the city attorney's decision to sue port trucking companies.\\n\\nNo company is allowed to gain an unfair advantage by exploiting human beings for the sake of corporate profits, Buscaino said in a statement.\\n\\nAfter a November special hearing that attracted more than 200 people, the Los Angeles council approved a plan for a city report on the financial possibility of banning companies that violate labor laws and an industrywide audit of lease-to-own contracts.\\n\\nThe city's Bureau of Contract Administration has since opened three investigations against port trucking companies.\\n\\nCouncil members also told the city attorney to look into mandating basic work standards and fair pay for workers at companies that operate on city property.\\n\\nI remain haunted by the testimony, Councilman Mike Bonin said after hearing port truckers speak about their experience. It's as close to modern-day sharecropping as I've heard in my time in office."}
{"original": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\\n\\nAlabama\\n\\nMontgomery: State medical groups are sponsoring a video contest to explain why it's important to wear a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Alabama Department of Public Health, the Alabama Hospital Association and the Medical Association of the State of Alabama are sponsoring the Mask Up Alabama video contest. A Health Department news release says the contest is for Alabamians of all ages to share why they feel it is important to wear a mask. The videos should be 30 seconds or less and need to highlight basic information related to mask-wearing and COVID-19. The deadline for submissions is noon Jan. 11. There is no fee to enter the contest, and the full rules can be found on the Health Department website. A statewide panel of judges will pick the top 10, and then the five winners will be chosen through a public online voting process. The first-place winner will receive $600, and the second- and third-place winners will receive $400 and $200 respectively. Two other honorable mention videos will be posted online along with the winners' videos for use by media outlets and on social media.\\n\\nAlaska\\n\\nJuneau: The Alaska Department of Health and Social Services says it has allocated $3.2 million in federal coronavirus relief aid to hire two public relations firms based in Anchorage to help with coronavirus communications across the state. Blueprint Alaska LLC was first contracted in June and is expected to work until April, and Brilliant Media Strategies was first contracted in October and is expected to work through June, Alaska's News Source reports. Blueprint Alaska was initially awarded a two-month, $440,000 contract approved by department communications director Clinton Bennett and deputy commissioner Sana Efird through emergency procedures that allowed the firm to bypass the normal competitive bidding process. The contract has since been extended three times, and the firm can be paid up to $1 million for its services, department officials said. Elizabeth Manning, department communications manager, said those services include messaging on social media, mailing information to residents, and setting up events related to safety guidelines and vaccine distribution.\\n\\nArizona\\n\\nPhoenix: State health officials have reported 5,158 new cases of COVID-19 and three additional deaths. The latest figures released Monday by the Arizona Department of Health Services come as the number of people hospitalized due to the virus hits a new high. Officials say 54% of inpatient hospitalizations across the state are COVID-19-related. The number of patients in intensive care units due to the virus is also at a record high for Arizona. According to state health officials, only 7% of ICU beds remain available. The crush of COVID-19 patients has caused some Phoenix- and Tucson-area hospitals to suspend elective surgeries and turn away ambulance patients or transfers from other hospitals, while still accepting walk-in patients needing emergency care. Hospital officials have discussed triage protocols that the state could order to decide which patients get access to limited resources.\\n\\nArkansas\\n\\nLittle Rock: The number of hospitalized patients with the coronavirus remained at a record level Sunday as Arkansas continued to grapple with a surge in virus cases. There were 1,234 people hospitalized with the virus Sunday, up from Saturday's record level of 1,216 hospitalizations, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. The state also saw 2,033 more cases of the virus and 20 more deaths, Hutchinson said. New cases lead to increased hospitalizations, which affect anyone needing treatment in a hospital, not just those with COVID-19, he said. Over the past two weeks, there were 1,056 new cases per 100,000 people in Arkansas, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. That ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins. One in every 162 people in Arkansas tested positive for the virus in the past week.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nLos Angeles: The pandemic is getting worse in Los Angeles as the coronavirus spreads rapidly within households and Californians let their guard down, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said Sunday that the nation's most populous county is recording a new COVID-19 case every six seconds. Garcetti said on the CBS program Face the Nation that he's concerned news of a vaccine rollout has made everybody so hopeful that they feel they can relax their behavior. We cannot. We cannot let up, the mayor said. This is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion. Overall, Los Angeles County is seeing high compliance of mask-wearing and people abiding by stay-home orders, Garcetti said. Despite that, the state is reporting enormous numbers of new cases, including more than 12,400 in Los Angeles County on Sunday. This is the fastest acceleration of new cases than at any other time during the pandemic, the LA County Department of Public Health said in a weekend statement. The county, which has a fourth of the state's population of nearly 40 million, has seen 40% of its virus deaths.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nDenver: A statewide relief fund for those in need because of the coronavirus pandemic has been taken offline after raising nearly $23 million since March. The Colorado COVID Relief Fund website indicates contributions aren't currently being accepted, and a statement on the site says that over 12,000 generous Coloradans have stepped up to support our neighbors at times of greatest need. The website provides an email address for those who want to continue contributing to relief efforts. Elizabeth Kosar, a spokeswoman for Gov. Jared Polis, wrote in an email to The Denver Post that a seventh round of grants was recently distributed. Conversations are underway with the philanthropic community and the Legislature about the best way to sustain support for Coloradans for the recovery phase of the pandemic in a more permanent infrastructure, so this will likely be our last round, she said. The fund was started in March with $2.8 million. At the time, the governor said the money would be spent on medical supplies, volunteer services, nursing home and homeless shelter staffing, cleaning supplies, and helping struggling workers, families and small businesses to help weather the storm of coronavirus.\\n\\nConnecticut\\n\\nHartford: The leader of Connecticut's largest teachers union is urging school superintendents statewide to switch all classes to remote learning until at least the middle of this month, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Jeff Leake, president of the Connecticut Education Association, said many students and educators were to return to classrooms Monday, before potential virus surges from the holiday season are over. He said many school districts already have moved to strictly distance learning through mid-January. While no one is more eager to return to the classroom than Connecticut's dedicated teachers, detecting and stopping the spread of COVID-19 must be the top priority, Leake said in a statement Sunday evening. He also called on the state to mandate more coronavirus testing and said a new survey by his union and the American Federation of Teachers shows that schools are not the safest places for children or educators amid a pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont and state education officials have been allowing local school officials to decide whether to switch to all-remote learning but have been advocating for schools to be kept open, saying it's better for students.\\n\\nDelaware\\n\\nDover: The state's poultry processing plants and health officials say they are well-prepared for a winter surge of coronavirus cases. Dr. Rick Pescatore, the Delaware Division of Public Health's chief physician, said the implementation of best practices is mostly complete. DPH cultivated a close relationship with the plants as they rolled out coronavirus testing for employees in late spring. We've been able to strengthen our relationships with the poultry companies and others, and so we've been able to empower them throughout the year to take this on, Pescatore said. Poultry workers also fall into the category of critical infrastructure personnel. Pescatore said they would be some of the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine. But vaccination will most likely be on a volunteer basis and not required as a condition of employment.\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia\\n\\nWashington: More than 2,000 faith leaders and religious activists are calling on members of Congress to honor the result of November's election and avoid a delayed and drawn out objection this week when President-elect Joe Biden's win is set to be certified. Signatories to the statement released Monday include many prominent religious liberals, such as Barbara Williams-Skinner, co-convener of the National African American Clergy Network, and the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of Washington's Episcopal diocese. Also signing on are a handful of evangelicals who have criticized President Donald Trump despite his overwhelming popularity among white evangelical voters, including World Vision president emeritus Rich Stearns. As faithful citizens, we are praying for a peaceful, smooth, and dignified transfer of power, said the statement, whose signatories were shared with the Associated Press ahead of their release. A delayed and drawn out objection on January 6th would not overturn the will of the American people and change the outcome of the election, it said.\\n\\nFlorida\\n\\nTallahassee: The state posted nearly 10,400 new coronavirus infections, and the state's death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic ticked upward by nearly 100, the Florida Health Department reported Sunday. Since the outbreak began, the state has recorded more than 1.3 million of its 21 million residents infected with the disease. In all, 21,987 have died. As of Sunday morning, 6,956 people were hospitalized because of COVID-19. The new numbers come after a record surge in new cases. On New Year's Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. On Saturday, health officials reported a two-day total 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus and 217 new deaths.\\n\\nGeorgia\\n\\nAugusta: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 21.2% as 56,334 cases were reported. The previous week had 46,488 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Georgia ranked No. 8 among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Within Georgia, the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Upson, Pike and Hancock counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Gwinnett County, with 5,089 cases; Cobb County, with 4,226 cases; and Fulton County, with 4,153. Weekly case counts rose in 137 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Gwinnett, Cobb and DeKalb counties. The share of Georgia test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.1% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows. In the latest week, 218,514 tests were administered; a week earlier, that figure was 277,425.\\n\\nHawaii\\n\\nHilo: Hawaii's optional coronavirus notification app is expected to launch statewide Wednesday. The AlohaSafe Alert app aims to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by notifying users about potential exposure to someone who tests positive for the virus, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. When the app senses another app in use nearby, the devices will exchange a secure, random, anonymous code. A person's location, name and other identifiable information would not be included. A user who tests positive would get a text message with the option to notify other app users who may have been exposed. The notification would go out to all users who were within 6 feet of the person who tested positive for at least 15 minutes. The app has already launched on the Big Island, Lanai and Maui. For me, the big takeaway is this is one other way that we can start protecting our island against the coronavirus and keep all of us safe, Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said. He acknowledged that not everyone will use the app but called it an extra tool that will speed up contact tracing.\\n\\nIdaho\\n\\nBoise: U.S. officials have released a new plan involving methods to deal with a microscopic pest in southeastern Idaho that threatens the state's billion-dollar industry that supplies a third of the nation's potatoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture late last week released the final rule that takes effect at the end of January. It sets out years­long criteria for killing off the pests and reopening quarantined fields to production. The new rule follows a 2018 court decision in a lawsuit filed by potato farmers that found the U.S. government illegally quarantined some Idaho potato fields infested with the pale cyst nematode first discovered in 2006. Farmers with quarantined fields aren't allowed to sell potatoes grown in them. Nematodes feed on potato roots and can reduce crop production by 80%. When the pests were first discovered, Canada, Mexico and Korea would not accept Idaho potatoes, and Japan banned all U.S. potatoes. The countries ultimately lifted their bans, the latest coming late in 2017 when Japan opened its market again.\\n\\nIllinois\\n\\nSpringfield: The Central Illinois Foodbank plans to use an anonymous donor's $500,000 gift to expand its reach during a time of growing need amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, its leader says. Outside of grants, the donation is the single largest gift in the food bank's 38-year history, and the gift's timing is impeccable, said Pam Molitoris, its executive director. She said the donation will be used to address the growing need for food assistance throughout the group's 21-county service area as the pandemic's economic impact continues into 2021. The timing is impeccable as we think of gearing up for possibly an extended period of time of high need, Molitoris said. This gives us that motivation and that inspiration that we can get it done. The food bank distributes over 10 million pounds of food annually to more than 160 food pantries, soup kitchens, residential programs and after-school programs in its region. Since March, the group has provided food at 85 drive-thru distribution events in underserved urban and rural areas. The food bank has increased its distribution by nearly 2 million pounds, a 25% increase since the same time last year.\\n\\nIndiana\\n\\nWhiting: Some Illinois residents fed up with their state's second ban on indoor dining amid the pandemic are heading to restaurants in adjacent Indiana so they can dine out with others. Restaurants in Illinois towns like Calumet City and Lansing that border northwest Indiana say they are seeing customers lured away by Indiana eateries not subject to the same restrictions, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Sylvia Coco, who owns Kilroy's and Dixie Kitchen and Bait Shop in Lansing, said her business is off substantially, perhaps more than than 50%, and one constant has been the looser rules for restaurants and bars in the Hoosier State. Indiana is pretty much open and doing whatever they want, Coco said. Tom Dabertin, a board member of the Whiting-Robertsdale Chamber of Commerce, said he's noticed the influx of Illinois diners. We're seeing increased business in both restaurants and stores, even at local drive-thrus, he said. We're seeing a lot more traffic and revenue due to the bans in Illinois. People come here to eat a meal and then shop.\\n\\nIowa\\n\\nDes Moines: As Iowans on food stamps are set to receive increased benefits under a new stimulus package signed into law Dec. 27, those seeking to use their electronic benefit transfer cards to order groceries online are seeing their options grow. Aldi, in partnership with the delivery service Instacart, on Dec. 17 became the latest grocery chain to offer the service to Iowa participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. The chain joined two large retailers, Amazon and Walmart. During the pandemic, more retailers in Iowa have joined other states in a pilot program to allow for grocery delivery and curbside pickup to participants in SNAP, an option long unavailable for them. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend limiting visits to grocery stores and using online services when possible. Food Bank of Iowa president and CEO Michelle Book said that in addition to helping people remain safely at home during the pandemic, broadening options for ordering groceries online using EBT payments will help those who lack transportation and would have to spend considerable time on a bus to travel to a supermarket.\\n\\nKansas\\n\\nTopeka: Topeka Presbyterian Manor began giving the COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff Saturday, as part of a watershed moment in nursing homes' fight against the coronavirus that has ravaged their communities. As part of a partnership with CVS, the retirement community began administering the first round of vaccinations Thursday to at-risk residents in health care and assisted living, as well as essential health care workers. There's no doubt the senior population has been hit hard by the virus, along with the health care workers who've treated them, Heather Pilkinton, executive director at Topeka Presbyterian Manor, said in a release. We couldn't be happier to know there's finally a bit of light at the end of such a difficult year. As part of the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, CVS is administering the Pfizer version of the COVID-19 vaccine to Kansas' retirement homes and communities. Nursing homes first began distributing shots Dec. 28. All of those receiving vaccines in the next few days will need to receive a second dose 21 days after their first inoculation.\\n\\nKentucky\\n\\nFrankfort: After months of watching mostly from the sidelines as Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear doled out pandemic relief and issued orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus, Republican lawmakers are ready to put their own imprint on policymaking in Kentucky. Republicans begin this year's legislative session in an increasingly dominant position after expanding their House and Senate supermajorities in the 2020 election. Wielding the power to override any Beshear veto, Republicans will be able shape legislation to their liking, including bills dealing with COVID-19 or policies for the post-pandemic world as vaccines roll out to more people. They've signaled their intent to rein in some of the governor's emergency powers. The General Assembly convenes its 30-day session Tuesday. Passing another state budget tops the agenda – a heavy lift after lawmakers opted to pass a one-year budget, rather than the traditional two-year spending plan, in 2020 because of uncertainties caused by the pandemic. Other virus-related issues are also expected to receive considerable attention. Those include efforts to provide protections from lawsuits for businesses that followed virus protocols.\\n\\nLouisiana\\n\\nBaton Rouge: The state has unveiled the list of 107 pharmacies that will begin offering the coronavirus vaccine this week to people ages 70 and older. With demand certain to outstrip limited supplies and interest running so high, the state website crashed within minutes of the information's release Monday. The Louisiana Department of Health quickly reworked the website to get the list back online. Hoping to avoid long lines seen in other states with people awaiting vaccination, the agency stressed that appointments for the immunizations are required. Still, people started showing up at their local pharmacies and inundating them with phone calls days ahead of the expanded eligibility, seeking vaccines for themselves or elderly family. Gov. John Bel Edwards' administration called for patience. Patients who arrive without an appointment will not be vaccinated. Do not arrive at a location without an appointment, the health department said as it announced the list. An estimated 640,000 people in Louisiana are newly eligible for the shot this week, but only about 10,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine were initially shipped to the state's pharmacies for this cohort, leaving each pharmacy with no more than about 100 doses available to their customers.\\n\\nMaine\\n\\nAugusta: A group of Republican lawmakers plans to travel to the Statehouse on Tuesday to call on their colleagues to get back to work, accusing Democratic leaders of dragging their feet. Legislative leaders countered that the work already is underway and that the appropriations committee is meeting Tuesday. Republicans protested in the summer and fall when the Legislature failed to reach a consensus for reconvening during the pandemic. The current plan is for the bulk of committees to convene in a few weeks. Republican Rep. Shelley Rudnicki, of Fairfield, said her group will gather in the House Chamber to make a point. We are a co-equal branch of government, and the governor is making decisions without any input from the Legislature. It's time for us to get to work, said Rudnicki, who accused the governor of unprecedented and draconian actions while the Legislature was sidelined. Republicans decried some of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' executive orders imposed because of COVID-19, but the Legislature failed to reconvene when Republicans and Democrats couldn't agree on the scope of work to be conducted. Rudnicki acknowledged Tuesday's action is a symbolic gesture since both chambers are controlled by Democrats.\\n\\nMaryland\\n\\nBaltimore: Students in central Maryland will continue to attend school virtually at a time about half of the students in the nation will be able to go back to their school buildings. The Baltimore Sun reports there is no clear idea of when those Maryland students might get back to in-person classes. Few students in suburban Maryland counties have been back inside a school during the pandemic. Experts say the reasons include politics, union opposition, and the failure of federal and state leaders to set clear guidelines as the pandemic began. Meanwhile, a contingent of some parents are furious that schools aren't open. And they say they've sent emails and letters and held protests with no success. Maryland's governor and state superintendent have advocated for schools to reopen. But they have stopped short of ordering schools to open because they say that it is up to local school boards and superintendents.\\n\\nMassachusetts\\n\\nBoston: Dozens of positive coronavirus cases have been traced back to Christmas services at a church, authorities said. The Woburn Board of Health has been working with the state to notify people who attended one of four services Dec. 23-24 at Genesis Community Church in Woburn, Mayor Scott Galvin told The Boston Globe. The church is cooperating with authorities, the mayor said. At least 44 cases have been traced to the church, authorities said. Genesis said in a statement that it is encouraging anyone who attended the services to get tested, whether symptomatic or not, and helping those who need to quarantine to prevent further transmission. Services are now being held online. We are deeply saddened to learn that people within Genesis tested positive for COVID-19 and we are doing all we can to make sure this does not spread any further, the statement said. Under state guidelines, houses of worship are limited to 25% of capacity. The church said it took proper precautions, including preregistration to attend and requring masks and social distancing.\\n\\nMichigan\\n\\nMarquette: The state's Upper Peninsula turned into a COVID-19 hot spot during the latest surge as nearly 1,400 children got sick from the virus, overall infections tripled, and deaths spiked even more – all while many infected Yoopers went to work, church and weddings when they were symptomatic, ignored social distancing and refused to cooperate with contact tracers, according to new data obtained through open records requests. In the past two and a half months alone, more than 13,500 people in the U.P. contracted the novel coronavirus, a threefold increase since the pandemic began in March, the data shows. The death toll during this second wave was even starker: 337 dead in 10 weeks, compared to 46 deaths in the previous seven months. Children were especially hard-hit: 1,388 schoolchildren got COVID-19 in the second wave, compared to 149 in the previous seven months. This harrowing U.P. snapshot is based on new, demographical data obtained by Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation's Documenting COVID-19 project in collaboration with the Detroit Free Press.\\n\\nMinnesota\\n\\nVerndale: A central Minnesota restaurant owner has turned one of the state's favorite winter shelters into an indoor-outdoor dining experience during the coronavirus pandemic. Brian Hagen, who owns the Pirates Den on busy U.S. Highway 10 in Verndale, is serving his meals in fish houses. As the temperature last week dipped into single digits, patrons could be seen basking in the glow of space heaters in the kind of village usually spotted on wintertime Minnesota lakes, the Star Tribune reports. We love it! It just feels so Minnesotan, said Becky Munston, who made the 30-mile trip from Perham to celebrate the birthdays of her husband, Mike, and their friend Tim Wacker. Hagen said his phone has been ringing off the wall since he posted his plan on Facebook. Also the owner of a fish house manufacturing company, Hagen said the idea came to him when he looked at some unsold fish houses in his inventory. People are fed up with the COVID and the shutdown, he said. They want to get out, have a cocktail, have a meal prepared for them.\\n\\nMississippi\\n\\nHattiesburg: A new device aimed at helping in the recovery of people with COVID-19 shows promising results, says a doctor who has been using the device. Dr. Brian Rifkin, a nephrologist with Forrest General Hospital in Hattiesburg who is working with pulmonologist Dr. Steven Stogner, said the Seraph 100 Microbind Affinity Blood Filter has helped most of the patients who have received the treatment as part of their recovery. We have treated 17 patients to date, he said in an email. Twelve have been discharged, four are still hospitalized and one died of complications unrelated to COVID or Seraph treatment. In general, it only takes one treatment, which lasts four to six hours, to begin seeing results, Rifkin said, with patients beginning to see improvement in the first 48 hours after treatment. The filter works in a manner similar to dialysis, which removes blood from a patient, filters it and reintroduces the cleansed blood to the patient's bloodstream. A dialysis filter has pores to remove waste and water from the body in a patient with kidney failure, Rifkin said. The Seraph filter, in contrast, has coated beads that bind various particles.\\n\\nMissouri\\n\\nO'Fallon: A 32-year-old assistant prosecutor in the Kansas City area has died from the coronavirus. Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney Jean Peters Baker said on Twitter that JoEllen Engelbart died Saturday. Engelbart is among 5,562 Missourians who have died from COVID-19. The state passed the 400,000 mark in confirmed cases over the weekend and added another 1,196 cases Monday, bringing the total to 402,957. The state reported no new deaths Monday. Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox said Monday's numbers may have been affected by limited reporting from counties due to the New Year's holiday. While many hospitals across Missouri remain dangerously crowded with COVID-19 patients, the numbers have stabilized enough in recent weeks that St. Louis County on Monday allowed indoor dining to start again, albeit with restrictions. Under the new order, capacity is limited to 25%. Another provision requires the establishments to maintain records of a customer's name and contact information in case contact tracing becomes necessary. That provision has drawn criticism from some, including Republican County Councilman Tim Fitch.\\n\\nMontana\\n\\nHelena: New Gov. Greg Gianforte has signaled he won't continue a statewide mask mandate in place since July, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against COVID-19. If Gianforte, a Republican, reverses former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock's mask order, Montana will be just the second state after Mississippi to lift its mandate. Thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. I trust Montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones, Gianforte said in a recent interview with Kaiser Health News. The state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then I do trust Montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family. Gianforte has said he plans to announce his COVID-19 policy for the state the week he assumes office, according to the Associated Press. He was sworn in Monday, becoming the state's first Republican governor in 16 years. Montana is the only state where control of the governor's office is changing parties as a result of November's election. And among the 11 governors being sworn in this month, Gianforte will be the only one new to managing his state's response to the pandemic.\\n\\nNebraska\\n\\nOmaha: Officials who are leading the state's pandemic response said Monday that they expect a large increase in coronavirus vaccinations over the next two weeks after a slowdown over the holidays. Nebraska has given 36,360 vaccinations so far out of the 94,697 doses in its possession, according to new data on the state's tracking portal. Most who have received initial doses at this point are front-line health care workers who were given first priority. Nebraska began vaccinating people Dec. 15 but saw sharp drops in daily doses administered Dec. 25 and the two following days. The numbers rose to roughly 3,000 per day afterward but dropped again to 1,579 on Jan. 1, according to the data. Certainly we would like to see more vaccines go out more quickly, but if you look at relative to what's going on in the rest of the country and the holidays and everything, we expect we'll see a pickup in the pace of vaccines, Gov. Pete Ricketts said at a news conference. Ricketts said the slowdown was compounded by health care workers who took time off for the holidays and weren't available to get vaccinated.\\n\\nNevada\\n\\nLas Vegas: Instruction resumes Monday in Las Vegas-area schools, but most students won't be in classrooms. Nearly all the more than 330 campuses in the sprawling Clark County School District will return to the distance-learning programs adopted last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The district is among the largest in the U.S., with more than 300,000 students, and a Las Vegas Review-Journal report found that most of the other nine have restored at least some in-person instruction. Clark County school trustees are approaching a decision Jan. 14 about whether to adopt a phased-transition timetable for reopening Las Vegas-area campuses, even with COVID-19 case numbers continuing to surge. An agreement last month between district administrators and the teachers union calls for a phased return to in-person classes, starting with preschool through third graders. District Superintendent Jesus Jara has said a date for resuming in-class instruction will be depend on the coronavirus pandemic, and the best-case scenario could see some students in class in February.\\n\\nNew Hampshire\\n\\nConcord: Turkey sightings are on the rise in the state, possibly because of the coronavirus pandemic. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said results from its 2020 winter survey reflect 2,309 flocks totaling 40,476 turkeys statewide. That was more than four times as many turkeys counted in 2019 and twice as many as reported in 2018. With many people spending more time at home last winter, there was an increase in backyard bird feeding as well as bird watching, which may have contributed to the uptick in reports, said Allison Keating, a state turkey biologist. More than 46,000 people have tested positive for the virus in New Hampshire, including more than 1,300 confirmed cases announced Sunday that include numbers for several days. Eleven additional deaths were announced, bringing the total to 780. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Hampshire decreased over the past two weeks, going from 766 new cases per day Dec. 19 to 750 new cases per day Saturday.\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nTrenton: The state Attorney General's Office has convened a grand jury that is investigating state-run veterans homes – where 202 people have died from COVID-19 – for possible criminal charges. A subpoena and letter dated Oct. 23 from the office's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit demand that a records custodian from the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus supply a litany of documents to investigators and possibly appear before a state grand jury to give testimony. It is not known whether the grand jury is focusing exclusively on the veterans homes in Paramus, Menlo Park and Vineland or is also looking at other nursing homes statewide with high numbers of deaths, as Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced he would do last spring. Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, said Monday that he would not offer any specifics on the investigation. The Paramus and Menlo Park facilities have seen a combined 191 residents and two caregivers die from COVID-19 since the pandemic began in March – among the highest COVID-19 death tolls at nursing homes across the nation.\\n\\nNew Mexico\\n\\nSanta Fe: More than 230,000 residents have signed up since the state launched its vaccination registration website two weeks ago, state health officials said Monday. The New Mexico Department of Health said the site has been updated to allow people to complete a comprehensive profile that includes personal medical conditions, employment information and other data. Officials said the site was created to help manage distribution once more vaccines become available. Those who register will be notified when they become eligible and shots are available in their area. Health Secretary Dr. Tracie Collins has said the state is working on plans for distribution to groups beyond the initial waves of front-line health care workers and staff and residents at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Our highest priorities remain the same: ensuring that vaccine goes to those who are most exposed to infected people or infectious materials, and preventing vaccine from going to waste, Collins said in a statement issued Monday. The state also plans to launch a call center to provide additional support for those who wish to register or ask questions about the process.\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that he won't receive the coronavirus vaccine until the general public – including Black, Hispanic and poor New Yorkers in his age group – is able to receive it. Cuomo made the pledge during recorded remarks to the congregation at Abyssinian Baptist Church. Race or income will not determine who lives and who dies, he said. I move around a lot and come into contact with many people, and I would feel much safer if I took the vaccine, but I will not take the vaccine until the vaccine is available for my group in Black, Hispanic and poor communities around the state. Cuomo is considered an essential, public-facing worker and would be eligible to receive the vaccine in the second phase of distribution, along with high-risk, elderly members of the general public. Subsequent phases will prioritize high-risk and low-risk members of the general public. Cuomo noted that the pandemic has exposed racial disparities in the health care system, both in the availability of testing and in the rates of infection and fatalities. Black people have died at double the rate of whites and Hispanics at one and a half times the rate, he said.\\n\\nNorth Carolina\\n\\nRaleigh: State education officials recently estimated educators can't account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students' learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms. David Stegall, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction's deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers last month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state's 1.5 million K-12 public school students are unknown. This happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class. If a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in North Carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them.\\n\\nNorth Dakota\\n\\nBismarck: The state's efforts to make its legislative session safer during the coronavirus pandemic should also make it easier for citizens to observe the proceedings and participate in government, leaders and longtime observers say. Legislative leaders have spent more than $2.6 million in federal COVID-19 relief money to beef up livestreaming and remote technology to allow people to watch committee meetings and floor sessions in real time. The public will be able to give remote testimony and not have to worry about driving to Bismarck in the middle of winter. They will be able to follow certain issues that they're interested in from the committee room to the chamber, and if it passes and goes to the next chamber, they'll know everything that's said, everything that's done, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner, who spearheaded the upgrades. House and Senate floor sessions have been livestreamed, archived and indexed online since 2013, The Bismarck Tribune reports. But much of the action, including hearings on bills, takes place in committee meetings, North Dakota Newspaper Association attorney Jack McDonald said.\\n\\nOhio\\n\\nColumbus: The newly elected state Senate president will be sworn into office from his home Monday after contracting COVID-19 over the holidays. Senate President Matt Huffman experienced mild symptoms before the new year and is doing well, spokesperson John Fortney said. Huffman, a Republican from Lima, joins a list of more than a dozen Ohio lawmakers who have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began in March. Huffman was chosen to succeed former Senate President Larry Obhof for the 134th General Assembly following a session filled with pandemic-related hurdles, a federal bribery scheme and infighting within the majority party. Fortney said Huffman will return to the Statehouse after following CDC quarantine guidelines and Senate policy. The Ohio Statehouse has become the scene of a partisan divide over mask-wearing in recent months, with Republicans continuing to push down Democrats' motions to require all Statehouse staff to wear masks while in session and committees.\\n\\nOklahoma\\n\\nOklahoma City: The state has set a new record for COVID-19 deaths in a week, as health officials on Sunday reported more than 8,000 new cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus over two days. Oklahoma had 170 deaths from COVID-19 over the prior seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous one-week record of 168 deaths was set in early December. State health officials recorded 5,002 new cases of the virus Saturday and another 3,015 on Sunday, as well as 20 additional deaths. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. There were more than 36,000 active cases of the virus in Oklahoma and 1,910 people hospitalized with it Sunday, according to the State Department of Health. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Oklahoma has come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nOregon\\n\\nSalem: An anti-mask rally is planned for Saturday outside the WinCo Foods store in south Salem after an employee allegedly denied service to a customer who refused to wear a mask. WinCo stores, like many businesses, have adopted a policy requiring customers and employees to wear masks inside the store. Their policy allows for some medical exemptions. It is unclear whether a video of the incident – titled Senior Citizen Denied Food at WinCo Grocery Store for Not Bowing to the Mask Police – is connected to a string of videos showing people entering businesses in Oregon and refusing to put on masks while filming employees. The video was posted on YouTube and Parler, a microblogging website favored by conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists and those fleeing what they claim is censorship on other social media sites. The rally, set to take place outside the store at 1 p.m. Saturday, comes in the wake of a string of right-wing protests that have resulted in violence, arrests and property damage in Salem.\\n\\nPennsylvania\\n\\nHarrisburg: Along with once again being able to dine indoors, Pennsylvanians were able to go to the gym or watch a movie at a theater starting Monday, under an easing of restrictions by Gov. Tom Wolf. The updated state guidance is the next step in the state's relaxation of the closures Wolf put in place in December to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Our mitigation efforts over the past several weeks are working, and I thank everyone who abided by the restrictions put in place to protect us, Wolf said. Every time we make a small decision to avoid risk – or take steps to make our actions a little bit less risky – we are helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. But just because a business or church can open doesn't mean it will. Wolf has encouraged Pennsylvanians to stay home as much as possible and continues to urge vulnerable residents, such as those over 65 or with preexisting medical conditions, to remain home as much as possible. And while much of the focus has been on the restaurant industry, museums, aquariums and wedding reception venues are among the other businesses allowed to reopen.\\n\\nRhode Island\\n\\nProvidence: A recently retired state Supreme Court justice has tested positive for the coronavirus, prompting a change in at least two swearing-in ceremonies. Francis X. Flaherty, who retired Dec. 31, was supposed to swear in new Rhode Island House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Warwick Mayor-elect Frank Picozzi on Tuesday. News of the positive test came in a news release about Picozzi's ceremony. On his Facebook page, Picozzi said he has spoken with Flaherty, and he's as disappointed as I am. District Court Judge Stephen Isherwood will take Flaherty's place. House spokesman Larry Berman said Monday that Flaherty called Shekarchi on Saturday to advise him that he would not be able to administer the oath of office to him. Supreme Court Justice Maureen McKenna Goldberg will step in for Flaherty to swear in the speaker.\\n\\nSouth Carolina\\n\\nColumbia: The superintendent of the state's public schools said Monday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and was experiencing mild symptoms but would continue to do her work from home. Cases of the virus have rocketed to record highs in South Carolina recently, and the news of Superintendent Molly Spearman's positive test came the same day the state's 780,000 public school students returned to classes following the holiday break. In a tweet, Spearman said she learned Sunday that she had tested positive for the virus Dec. 31 and is fortunate to have only mild symptoms. Spearman said she had already been quarantining after her husband and son tested positive earlier last week. While isolating, Spearman said, I plan to continue to work from home and meet virtually as so many others in the education community have done this school year. Just before Christmas, Gov. Henry McMaster's office announced that the 73-year-old Republican had tested positive and would receive outpatient monoclonal antibody treatment for mild symptoms. His wife, 73-year-old Peggy McMaster, also tested positive but was asymptomatic. A spokesman said Monday that both were out of isolation and feeling well.\\n\\nSouth Dakota\\n\\nRapid City: One of the state's largest hospital systems announced Monday that it is planning to increase testing for the coronavirus, as the state saw a drop in new cases but a high positivity rate of testing. Monument Health, the largest health care provider in western South Dakota, plans to test more people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19, including running mass testing events. Hospital administrators said the availability of testing supplies has improved in recent weeks. The state Department of Health reported 111 new coronavirus infections and no new deaths Monday after the New Year's holiday weekend, for the lowest daily tally in three months. But the positivity rate of RT-PCR tests, which detect the virus's genetic material, topped 16%. Emily Leech, Monument Health's director of laboratory services, said a community's test positivity rate should ideally be below 5%. We're doing everything we can to increase testing in our communities, she said in a statement. Monument said its volume of testing in December was about half the rate in November, when the state saw a surge of cases.\\n\\nTennessee\\n\\nNashville: The city's once-thriving party scene – a hefty chunk of its economic base – took yet another direct hit in the Christmas morning bombing that tore up blocks in the center of downtown. In the hours after the attack, tourism and marketing officials rushed to cancel a new ad campaign, already delayed as coronavirus cases surged, aimed at luring out-of-town visitors. Now the question of when tourists will be welcomed back is weighing heavy on minds and pocketbooks across town. We're predicting January and February tourism to be virtually nonexistent, said Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. CEO Butch Spyridon. The only thing I know is it will be bad. Many honky-tonks, bars and restaurants that managed to limp through the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns are now unsure when they can safely reopen. Honky-tonk owner Steve Smith said he's so frustrated that he's losing sleep and called on Mayor John Cooper to reinstate regular hours. The city is in the third phase of its COVID-19 reopening strategy, and bars and restaurants must have last call at 10 p.m. Downtown business owners have argued for months that it's safer to allow them to operate as much as possible with social distancing measures so people aren't having parties at homes or other places where they're in closer proximity.\\n\\nTexas\\n\\nAustin: The Texas Capitol, shuttered to the public since the coronavirus pandemic took root in March, reopened Monday with protocols in place aimed at minimizing the risk for new infections. At this time, a mask worn over the nose and mouth is required at all times inside the building, said an online message from the State Preservation Board, the agency that operates the buildings in the Capitol complex in the heart of Austin. The state will also provide no-cost coronavirus testing for anyone who wants it before they enter the building. Also, capacity will be limited, and social distancing is required. Only one of the four public entrances will be open. Before the building was officially reopened, a large tent was erected outside the entrance on the Capitol's north side to administer tests. Only a few visitors stopped by during the first hour of operation. The reopening comes just eight days before the start of the 2021 legislative session.\\n\\nUtah\\n\\nSalt Lake City: Republican Spencer Cox called for unity amid hateful rhetoric in national political discourse after being sworn in Monday as Utah's first new governor in more than a decade. Cox denounced misinformation and division that he said have further taken hold throughout the pandemic. As he stood in front of red rock in southwestern Utah, Cox referred to a group of anti-mask protestors who lined a road to the ceremony calling for an end to the state's coronavirus restrictions. We are more divided than at any time in our lifetimes as the news is filled with civil unrest and protests, including one right outside this venue here today, Cox said. We are facing a crisis of empathy, a scourge of contempt. Very little feels 'united' about the United States today. The new governor said that it's not too late and called on the state's residents to join together. Cox is succeeding Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who chose not to run for reelection after more than a decade in office. Cox, who became Herbert's lieutenant governor in 2013, won the gubernatorial election in November.\\n\\nVermont\\n\\nMontpelier: The Legislature is getting ready to kick off the 2021 session with almost all of the pomp and circumstance occurring remotely. Even as late as Monday, some of the moving parts of the Wednesday opening of the 2021 session were still developing. Once lawmakers are sworn in and settle into their jobs, the primary focus of this session is expected to be the state's continued response to the coronavirus pandemic. We are trying to make it a normal first day of session, except that we are on Zoom, said Democratic state Rep. Jill Krowinski, the presumptive incoming speaker of the House. All of the same traditions will be happening. The House will be governing remotely for at least all of January and February, she said. The Senate will also be meeting remotely, but Lt. Gov.-elect Molly Gray will be sworn into office Thursday in the Senate chamber. Gray said she would then preside over her first session from the podium in the Senate chamber while senators will be attending remotely. Republican Gov. Phil Scott will be sworn in for his third term Thursday, after which he is scheduled to give his inaugural address.\\n\\nVirginia\\n\\nNorfolk: More than 1,400 long-term care facilities in the state are expected to receive doses of the coronavirus vaccine in the coming weeks. The Virginian-Pilot reports CVS and Walgreens will administer the vast majority of the doses. The pharmacy chains are partnering with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take vaccines directly to the facilities so residents don't have to travel. Virginia is putting front-line health care workers and long-term care residents in the top-tier priority group for immunizations. The state has received 388,000 vaccine doses collectively from Pfizer and Moderna. State health officials said nearly 65,000 vaccinations had been administered before New Year's Day. But that number is believed to be low because of lags in reporting. No one has received the complete two-shot series because injections must be spaced three or four weeks apart, depending on the brand. Long-term care facilities are also rushing to get consent forms signed by residents or the individuals who make decisions for them.\\n\\nWashington\\n\\nSeattle: King County is starting 2021 with plans to buy as many as a dozen hotels to permanently house hundreds of homeless people and provide them with services. We have every reason to believe that homelessness will get a lot worse after this pandemic unless we take bold action, said Leo Flor, director of the King County Department of Community and Human Services. The initiative is called Health Through Housing, KING5 reports. It uses revenue from a 0.1% sales tax increase to develop a network of apartment-like shelters, with the goal of getting people out of tents, off sidewalks and into safe, clean homes. The county hopes to eventually house 45%, or 2,000 people, of its chronically homeless population of 4,500. The goal for 2021 is to create housing units for 1,500 people countywide, in former hotels and nursing homes throughout the county. Flor said hotel owners are already approaching the county and offering their properties, which are struggling to fill rooms during the pandemic.\\n\\nWest Virginia\\n\\nCharleston: Officials announced Sunday that an officer at the Saint Marys Correctional Center in Pleasants County died Saturday while under treatment for COVID-19. Cpl. Mark Rustemeyer, 58, had worked at the prison since 1998. The prison has 253 active cases of the new coronavirus. Rustemeyer's was the first virus-related death of a state corrections employee.\\n\\nWisconsin\\n\\nMadison: The Legislature kicked off its two-year session Monday with an inauguration unlike any before it, with Assembly Democrats skipping the event because they thought the COVID-19 precautions were inadequate. During the ceremony, Assembly Speaker Robin Vos of Rochester announced he had reached a deal with his fellow Republicans who control the state Senate on new coronavirus legislation. He said he wanted to act on the bill this week, but he did not immediately release a copy of it. It was unclear if it could win the support of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who renewed a call earlier in the day for compromise legislation. For the Assembly's inauguration, members of both parties wore masks. In the Senate, Democrats wore them, but many Republicans did not. In both houses, lawmakers kept one or two desks between them to limit the spread of COVID-19. Democratic Sen. Lena Taylor of Milwaukee pleaded with Republicans who eschewed masks to think about Wisconsinites who are more vulnerable. Anybody in this body not wearing a mask does not care about my father, who has the blood type that is most susceptible, Taylor said. I have the right to tell you I do not appreciate the disregard for life.\\n\\nWyoming\\n\\nGillette: After closing last March through May in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Devils Tower National Monument has set visitation records every month since September. August saw more 113,000 people visit the park that month alone, more than 13,000 visitors than in 2019. September saw a record number of visits at 68,726, 6,000 more for the month than 2019. October continued the trend with nearly 30,000 people coming to the park, up from October 2019's 17,290 visitors. November typically sees a steep decline in tourists to Devils Tower. In 2020, more than 9,000 recreational visits were recorded – a nearly 110% spike over 2019. Overall, the park had seen 420,330 recreation visits last year through November, down only 7% from 2019 despite the pandemic's impact, the Gillette News Record reports. Ogden and Rosanne Driskill, owners of Devils Tower KOA campground, both said 2020 was by far the best year they've ever had in terms of business. The vast majority were distancing in an RV, were tired of sitting in a city, locked in a room where they couldn't get any fresh air, Ogden Driskill said.\\n\\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports"}
{"original": "Kim Komando\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nQ: I got Amazon Echo for Christmas. It tells me the weather and plays music. What else can it do? It seems like a waste of money to me.\\n\\nA: At its core, Amazon's Echo is a Bluetooth speaker that responds to voice commands. Its abilities won't impress everyone, and calling it a virtual assistant may sound a little lofty. But I would encourage you to play with this device a little more before taking advantage of your gift receipt. If your house has smart appliances, for example, you may be able to control them remotely. If you lose your smartphone, Alexa may be able to find it for you. Alexa can even tell you jokes. Amazon's Echo isn't exactly a robot butler, but it has a number of tricks up its virtual sleeve. Click here to learn about Alexa's five unexpected skills.\\n\\nBreaking up with LinkedIn\\n\\nQ: I am tired of all the notifications I receive from LinkedIn. How can I delete my LinkedIn Account?\\n\\nA: Before you delete your account, remember that you have complete control over those notifications. You can reduce the number of emails sent, or you can terminate them altogether, but you don't have to recuse yourself from LinkedIn entirely. For many LinkedIn users, profiles lie dormant for months, but you never know when some curious CEO will discover your astonishing talents and send you an inmail. That said, you have every right to rid yourself of LinkedIn, and doing so is pretty easy. If you panic and change your mind, you also have a short period to revive your account without doing much damage, although some things will be lost. Click here to learn exactly how to permanently end your relationship with LinkedIn.\\n\\nAmazon vs. Netflix\\n\\nQ: I really like Amazon's original programming. Is it worth getting Netflix too?\\n\\nA: Amazon and Netflix are battling tooth and nail to become the dominant streaming video service, but the real winner is you. Both of these services are excellent, they both offer a rich archive of mainstream movies and television series, and they are both producing top-notch original programs at a breakneck pace. No matter what your taste, you can probably find a series to binge-watch on either platform. They both have drawbacks, of course: Amazon doesn't play on Apple TV, for example, and Netflix has been slow to offer recent movies. If you're planning to stay in this winter, there's no harm in subscribing to both. Click here to learn about five exciting new Netflix series in 2017.\\n\\nThe many uses of a tablet\\n\\nQ: I use my tablet for email, Facebook, games and watching shows. What else is it good for?\\n\\nA: After awhile, a tablet can feel like a stripped-down laptop. Many people curl up in an easy chair and use their tablet the same way as a regular computer, minus the keyboard. At most, the modest screen doubles as a very small TV. But most tablets are more than meets the eye: They can do all kinds of things, like operate appliances, wirelessly transfer data, and even control your actual television. The vast majority of tablet owners have no idea how powerful their devices are, but even professional musicians can benefit from these versatile platforms. Click here to read about five things you didn't know your tablet can do.\\n\\nCheap alternative to Microsoft Office\\n\\nQ: I am on a budget starting my own business and cannot afford Microsoft Office. Are there any other options for me?\\n\\nA: For many customers, the feeling is terrible: You buy your brand new PC, you excitedly lug it home, you set it up on your desk – and then, to your horror, you discover that Microsoft Office isn't already installed. You just spent $600 on a laptop, and now you have to shell out another $128 for a basic word processor and spreadsheet. The good news is, there are lots of cheap programs that imitate these staples. The bad news is, they might not be fully compatible when you finally do have the money to invest in Office. So what can you do? Try some open-sourced software.

{"original": "In between helping the Los Angeles Lakers win an NBA championship. LeBron James spent his energy on the NBA's quarantined campus speaking out on systemic racism.\\n\\nSo imagine James' feelings when Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced that no charges would be filed against the police officer that shot Jacob Blake, a Black person who was then left paralyzed.\\n\\nTo hear what happened in Kenosha today was a blow to the heart and to the gut, James said following the Lakers' 94-92 win over the Memphis Grizzlies on Tuesday night. Not only to that community, but to us and to every Black person that has been a part of this process and seeing these outcomes for so long. Not only in the Black community, but in the white community as well who see moments like this happen.\\n\\nThe NBA restarted the season last summer partly to salvage its television revenue during the pandemic and partly to use that platform to address systemic racism. Then, players and coaches routinely spoke out against recent cases of police officers killing unarmed Black people, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Teams and players also launched varying voting and community programs aimed to reduce racial inequality.\\n\\nIt sucks. We as a community tried to support the family and do everything we can to get justice for him, Lakers forward Anthony Davis said. For that to happen, it sucks for us. It feels like we let the family down.\\n\\nFor James, he took on a heightened role both because of his star power and his initiatives. He also launched More Than A Vote, an organization that reduces voting suppression and increased voting turnout in the Black community.\\n\\nIt's a blow to our community once again, James said. We've been here before. It sucks. We feel sorry for his family and that community itself. We want better. We believe we can get that.\\n\\nPICTURE PERFECT:Becky Hammon's historic moment as Spurs coach captured with great photo\\n\\nSPORTS NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get top sports headlines delivered daily\\n\\nThe NBA's players believed the same thing after the Milwaukee Bucks walked out on their scheduled playoff game against the Orlando Magic after video showed police officers shooting Blake seven times in front of his family. The Bucks had conference calls with local politicians in hopes to enact police reforms. Following a passionate discussion among players about whether they should resume or cancel the rest of the season, James spoke with President Barack Obama, who urged them to keep its platform intact.\\n\\nThen, the National Basketball Players Association received more commitments from the NBA. They pledged to have each teams' arena or practice facility open as a voting site before and on Election Day, a commitment 23 out of 30 NBA teams fulfilled. The NBA's Board of Governors and NBPA also formed the NBA Foundation with an initial $300 million contribution dedicated to creating greater economic empowerment in the Black community. Teams have pledged to donate $30 million each year to the foundation for the next 10 years.\\n\\nNo wonder Lakers forward Wesley Matthews considered Tuesday's ruling to be truly disheartening, especially with all the work everybody had put in.\\n\\nWe can't lose our heads. We can't start rioting. We have to be calculated. We have to continue to keep our foot on the gas, said Matthews, who played with the Bucks last season when they staged the walkout. The flame is already lit. It just has to continue to keep burning and burning the right way. Not where anything can be sidetracked; not where we're damaging anything so that all the media attention can go to look at what is happening over here. Look at the facts and let's address the issues head on.\\n\\nStill, the NBA and NBPA tried to address these issues already.\\n\\nThe NBA and NBPA formed a social justice coalition consisting of players, coaches and owners to promote civic engagement and advocate for police and criminal justice reform. The NBPA also hoped teams could leverage relationships with local and state officials with passing legislation aimed at these issues.\\n\\nI'm sure and am very confident that (owner) Marc Lasry and the Milwaukee Bucks are doing their due diligence right now, especially with it happening in their own backyard, Matthews said. I'm very confident in that. It really is just tough. It really is disheartening. But leaders have to be leaders. Everybody has to take ownership in their own community. It can't just be those that have the platform. It's got to be everybody.\\n\\nThe Bucks released a statement on Tuesday, saying, the organization remains firmly against excessive use of force by law enforcement. Graveley defended the police officers' reaction, saying it was incontrovertible that Blake was armed with a razor blade-type knife when he was shot seven times.\\n\\nReoccurring instances of excessive use of force and immediate escalation when engaging the Black community must stop, the Bucks' statement read. We will continue to work to enact policy change so these incidents no longer exist. As an organization, we remain strongly committed to address issues of social injustice and anti-racism and to make meaningful change for African Americans and all marginalized members of our community.\\n\\nJames vowed to remain just as committed.\\n\\nMore than a Vote partnered with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund to recruit 40,000 poll workers and helped register Florida voters with felony records so long as they were unrelated to murder or sexual assault. It also oversaw voting turnout initiatives for the Georgia runoff elections held on Tuesday. And James added, we're not going to stop; we're always looking for opportunities to continue to grow not only in my community, but all over the world.\\n\\nThe best thing we were able to do in the bubble is we were able to stand together in strength and numbers with everything that was going on in America and everything that was going wrong in America, James said. We were able to voice those opinions and voice those facts every single day.

Roughly 80% of all Latinos living in the USA are American citizens, but media coverage of Hispanics tends to focus on immigration and crime, instead of how Latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns.

Editors note: Video has been updated to remove a student who opted out of appearing in photos and video. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\\n\\nThe preschool dual-language program at Gates Street Early Education Center in Lincoln Heights, one of Los Angeles' oldest neighborhoods with dense populations of Latino and Asian residents, is part of a growing number of bilingual education models taking root in California and across the country. Many of them are designed to serve students from Spanish-speaking families, as well as students from other cultures, under mounting evidence that learning two languages can help people from all backgrounds become stronger students.\\n\\nRoughly 3.8 million students in U.S. schools are native Spanish-speakers who are not proficient in English. They make up the bulk of the approximately 5 million students nationwide identified as English language learners, the fastest-growing demographic in schools – and the lowest-performing, as judged by achievement tests and graduation rates.\\n\\nSixty-seven percent of students with limited English skills graduated high school after four years in 2016, compared with 84% of all students, according to federal data.\\n\\nLanguage experts recommend how to improve those outcomes: More high-quality, long-term dual-language programs can close the achievement gap in literacy between English learners and native English speakers after five to six years, according to research.\\n\\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition If we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime. Quote icon\\n\\nThe programs can be tough to implement. Hurdles include a debate over the best way to teach English learners, public hostility against those who speak a native language other than English, shortages of bilingual teachers and even the fact that dual-language programs often grow fastest in areas where upper-income parents ask for them. That's good for children who participate, but it worries advocates who want to see language-minority students have equal access.\\n\\nPressure is mounting in states where numbers of Latino English learners have surged. Mississippi, South Carolina, Kentucky, Kansas and Maryland have seen the number of English learners more than double from 2005 to 2015, according to federal data.\\n\\nIf we can make children feel more whole and more ready and more accepted and welcomed and validate their prior knowledge and prior learning experiences, then we've gone a long way to making them ready to learn over the course of a lifetime, says Tara Fortune, immersion program director at the University of Minnesota's Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition.\\n\\nRosa Ramirez is a preschool teacher at Gates Street Early Education Center in Los Angeles and teaches a class through a bilingual education program. Harrison Hill, USA TODAY\\n\\nWhat's the best way to teach language skills to students?\\n\\nFrom 2000 to 2015, the percentage of Latino students enrolled in public elementary and secondary schools swelled from 16% to 26%. The percentage of white students fell from 61% to 49%, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\\n\\nFederal law requires districts to identify students with limited English skills and to serve them with an equitable, research-based program. Practices vary widely between states and districts.\\n\\nSome schools use transitional bilingual programs, which teach academics such as science, math and social studies in Spanish for a few years before transitioning students to mainstream classes.\\n\\nMany use English as a Second Language instruction, a set of methods and techniques originally developed to teach English to foreign diplomats and university students. Instruction happens in English, and teachers have to be certified.\\n\\nThen there are English-only models, which call for separating language-minority children and having them learn all subjects only in English.\\n\\nIt's very political because the public doesn't really understand the process of second language acquisition, says Maria Coady, an associate professor of bilingual education at the University of Florida, a state where almost 300,000 students are learning English.\\n\\nBut the research is really clear on what works, she says. Students learning English benefit from high-quality, long-term bilingual instruction programs.\\n\\nNationwide, there were about 3,000 dual-language programs as of 2015, says Santiago Wood, executive director of the National Association for Bilingual Education. That's a big increase over about 300 operating around 2001, he says, but not enough to help the surging numbers of English learners.\\n\\nIn some districts, the popularity of dual-language programs has led to concerns that English learners, who often come from lower-income families, will be pushed out by native English speakers from more affluent families.\\n\\nAt Oyster-Adams Bilingual School in Washington, for example, just 24% of students are English learners, according to school data.\\n\\nOyster's program was created to serve the Latino population, but gentrification over the past 40 years drove low-income families from the neighborhood, says Vanessa Bertelli, co-founder of a grassroots organization that advocates for more dual-language programs.\\n\\nThere are more than 10,000 students learning English in D.C., and even if every one of those students enrolled in a dual-immersion school, there wouldn't be enough seats for them, says Bertelli of the DC Language Immersion Project.\\n\\nThere's a lot of energy wasted on trying to allocate the pie, when what we should be doing is making more pies, she says.\\n\\nYou might also like: Google Assistant gets bilingual and responds in the language pair you use\\n\\nSonya Bertini, a bilingual special ed teacher at Vineland High School in New Jersey, works with a student on Sept. 30, 2019.

Sometimes that works for very young kids. But for a 10th grader coming into high school only speaking Mandarin who needs to graduate in three years? There's no way that child has equitable access.\\n\\nIn the late 1990s and early 2000s, a focus on English-only instruction became more pronounced as a wave of anti-immigrant sentiment led to ballot initiatives in several states that effectively outlawed teaching in multiple languages.\\n\\nCalifornia voters approved a ban on bilingual education in public schools in 1998. Known as Proposition 227, the policy barred many children of Latino immigrants and Latino immigrant children from bilingual education, says Ramon Martinez, an assistant professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education in California.\\n\\nLed by California businessman Ron Unz and supported by the lobbying group ProEnglish, which favors English-only classes and the adoption of English as the official language of state and national government, similar restrictive bans passed in Arizona and Massachusetts.\\n\\nCopy text Copy this quote's text The quote has been copied Tweet Facebook LinkedIn Share this article on LinkedIn Reddit Share this article on Reddit Email Email this story Share Share this story Maria Coady, an associate professor of bilingual education at the University of Florida It's very political because the public doesn't really understand the process of second language acquisition.

Adam Monacelli, USA TODAY NETWORK\\n\\nEnglish learners make progress\\n\\nThe city of Vineland, New Jersey, about an hour south of Philadelphia, represents changing U.S. demographics. More than 60% of the 11,000 students in Vineland Public Schools are Latino, reflecting a long-standing Puerto Rican community and a swell of migrants from Central America in recent years. Many of those new arrivals are teens who came without their parents and have no recent history of attending school.\\n\\nSome of the school's parents work in the surrounding eggplant and cauliflower fields during the day. Some are highly transient, migrating with the seasons wherever the work is.\\n\\nLike many districts in New Jersey, Vineland hosts a transitional bilingual program for students who arrive with limited English skills. This year, about 800 students are enrolled. They learn their core academics in Spanish – often right next door to classes where the same content is taught in English – but they have time built into the day for speaking, reading and writing in English.\\n\\nMore: Vineland ESL, bilingual programs win state honors\\n\\nDuring the first week of school this fall at Vineland High School, students in a 10th grade bilingual algebra class solved problems written on the board while their teacher wandered around, greeting students and checking their homework.\\n\\nDid you finish them all, Rafael? she asked one student in English.\\n\\nShe turned and saw that another had neglected to carry a negative number through an equation. She tapped the student's answer: Y un negativo, no? she said.\\n\\nVineland's bilingual program has been bolstered by JoAnne Negrin, supervisor of bilingual education. Since she was hired seven years ago, she made sure that all new textbook purchases were available in both Spanish and English, so students in the bilingual program could learn at the same pace as their English-speaking peers.\\n\\nShe made sure bilingual teachers in the lower grades weren't delivering the same lessons in both languages over the course of the day.\\n\\nIf you're repeating lessons every day, you're never going to help these children make progress, Negrin says.\\n\\nVineland's English learners show some of the highest academic improvement scores in the district, she says. Last year, the students met all the targets outlined on the state report cards.\\n\\nPeople sometimes question, 'How are students going to learn English if they spend the whole day learning in Spanish?'  Negrin says. Well, our data shows that proficiency in literacy in the child's first language is a very good indicator of how well that child is going to eventually learn English.\\n\\nOther small victories are happening. Kevin Sanchez, 17, who arrived from the Dominican Republic last year with limited English, won first place in a regional science fair after investigating how windmills worked and building a model of one.\\n\\nSanchez almost backed out from the fair when he learned that participants were required to make an oral presentation to the judges.

The Rebels had a seven-game winning streak snapped on Saturday in an 83-61 road loss to Kentucky.\\n\\nThe new arena — called The Pavilion at Ole Miss — will undoubtedly be a huge upgrade over the 50-year-old Tad Smith Coliseum. The new venue has a capacity of 9,500, including more than 1,700 premium seats.\\n\\nIt's a project more than four years in the making since the school announced its intentions in 2011. Construction took about 18 months and pretty much everyone associated with Ole Miss has come away impressed with the final product.\\n\\nIt's a real game-changer for our program, Kennedy said.\\n\\nSaid athletic director Ross Bjork: There's definitely a wow factor when you walk into the building.\\n\\nThat likely will be enough to draw fans in the short term. Bjork said Ole Miss has sold about 5,000 season tickets for The Pavilion through the remainder of the year, compared to about 4,100 last year at Tad Smith Coliseum.\\n\\nBut basketball crowds have been historically fickle in Oxford. Even though Ole Miss has had relative success lately — making two out of the past three NCAA tournaments — it hasn't been a school that's particularly good or interested in basketball.\\n\\nMore winning wouldn't hurt as the Rebels introduce their new facility. Kennedy hopes his players don't get distracted by the hoopla surrounding the grand opening — or lose their home-court edge because of a rare mid-season venue change.\\n\\nI'm just trying to make sure our guys are focused on the task at hand, Kennedy said. And that's beating a very good Alabama team.\\n\\nOle Miss had been one of the more surprising teams in the league before its lopsided loss to Kentucky at Rupp Arena. The Rebels were cruising until running into the Wildcats, winning seven straight games, including an impressive road victory over Memphis.\\n\\nGuard Stefan Moody is the team's unquestioned star. The 5-foot-10 senior was moved from shooting guard to point guard early in the season after Sam Finley and J.T. Escobar struggled.\\n\\nMoody has managed to be the team's main scorer and facilitator at the same time — leading the SEC with 23.7 points per game while also handing out a team-high 4.1 assists.\\n\\nThe problem is Moody isn't getting a whole lot of help.\\n\\nForward Sebastian Saiz is averaging nearly a double-double with 11.7 points and 9.8 rebounds per game, but other consistent options haven't emerged.

{"original": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump is betting big on the Supreme Court in 2019 to revive controversial policies on issues ranging from immigration and border security to transgender soldiers in the military.\\n\\nSeeking to match the success he had at the high court on his immigration travel ban against predominantly Muslim countries last year, Trump is counting on the justices – including two that he picked – to reverse lower court losses at the hands of both liberal and conservative judges.\\n\\nHow the Supreme Court rules on the requests in the coming months will shed light on the justices' views about executive power, judicial discretion and Trump's proclivity for upending longstanding policies by whim, or even tweet.\\n\\nWaiting for word are more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children who could be threatened with deportation under Trump's policy. Also in play are some of the estimated thousands of transgender troops serving in the military and others seeking to join who face a partial ban.\\n\\nThe high court already is slated to hear a dispute over the Trump administration's effort to ask about citizenship in the 2020 Census. Other cases that could be headed there eventually include Trump's ban on asylum seekers who enter the country illegally and his threat to withhold federal funds from sanctuary cities that do not fully cooperate with immigration authorities.\\n\\nIn most of those cases, the Justice Department took the unusual step of seeking Supreme Court action before lower-court appeals had run their course. The administration railed against local judges issuing nationwide injunctions against Trump's policies. But the high court has been loath to jump over lower courts.\\n\\nThe executive branch is mistaken if it looks to the Supreme Court to provide a quick fix for their litigation problems, says Peter Margulies, a professor specializing in national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. The Supreme Court isn't designed to be a quick fix.\\n\\nUSA TODAY is on WhatsApp! Sign up to get our top news story delivered to you on WhatsApp daily. Click this link on your mobile device to get started\\n\\nWin or lose, the confrontations at the nation's highest court will shed light on whether\\n\\nAssociate Justices Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's two nominees, will make a major difference – or whether the president's battle with Chief Justice John Roberts over the independence of the federal judiciary will backfire.\\n\\nLosing streak at lower courts\\n\\nTrump enters 2019 with a poor track record in the federal courts.\\n\\nJust as he did early in his battle to limit travelers from majority-Muslim nations, Trump has lost most of his battles with judges on issues ranging from early skirmishes over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the revoking of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's White House press credential.\\n\\nMore:It's not just 'Obama judges'. Here are Republican appointees who have ruled against Trump\\n\\nThe Trump administration has consistently failed in the lower courts, and they've gotten some relief in the Supreme Court, says Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law in Houston who follows the high court closely.\\n\\nThat wasn't the case on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as DACA, which has helped more than 700,000 undocumented immigrants avoid deportation and get work permits. Trump sought to end what President Barack Obama began but was swatted down by federal district and appeals court judges who said he lacked the authority to do so.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court refused to block the lower court orders from taking effect but is scheduled to consider hearing the government's appeal at its Friday conference. If at least four justices agree to take the case, it could be heard in April and decided by the end of June.\\n\\nTrump hasn't had better luck at the high court with his asylum ban. After a federal judge blocked his effort to cut off asylum for migrants who enter the country illegally – and before the case went to an appeals court – the Supreme Court narrowly refused, 5-4, to step in. Both of Trump's high court nominees joined two other conservative justices in dissent.\\n\\nIt probably didn't help that Trump blasted federal district court Judge Jon Tigar as an Obama judge after his initial ruling, later upheld in a 2-1 opinion by federal appeals court Judge Jay Bybee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.\\n\\nWe do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges, Roberts said in response to the president's criticism. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\\n\\nRoberts later provided the deciding vote against reinstating Trump's asylum ban, but the issue could reach the Supreme Court later this year or in 2020.\\n\\nThe asylum ban case in particular raises distinct separation-of-powers concerns because Congress has spoken directly to the issue, which the court found was not the situation with the travel ban, says Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's immigrants' rights project.\\n\\n'Better chance' at high court\\n\\nThe administration's effort to add a question on citizenship to the 2020 Census ties in to the overall battle over immigration, since it could depress the official count of immigrants and cause their communities to lose federal aid and representation in Congress.\\n\\nThat battle is being fought in lower courts, but the Supreme Court has scheduled oral argument in February over a side issue: What evidence can be considered in a challenge mounted by state and local governments and immigrant rights groups? They want to expose the Trump administration's decision-making process, while the administration says it's irrelevant.\\n\\nIlya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, says the administration likely thinks Kavanaugh's replacement of retired Justice Anthony Kennedy is a plus.\\n\\nThey probably have a better chance at the Supreme Court than at the lower courts, Somin says.\\n\\nThe administration had been on a losing streak in its effort to ban transgender troops from serving openly in the military – another policy from the Obama administration that Trump sought to change 18 months ago with a tweet.\\n\\nThat's not a great way to start a process, Margulies says, noting former Defense Secretary James Mattis and top Pentagon brass were taken by surprise. That's not a very auspicious start.\\n\\nFour federal district judges blocked the new policy temporarily while it works its way through the court system. But last Friday, a federal appeals court reversed one of those rulings, reasoning that the administration's policy had evolved and was not a blanket ban.\\n\\nThe Justice Department has asked the Supreme Court to intercede now rather than wait for other appeals court rulings, and a decision could come this month.\\n\\nFighting nationwide injunctions\\n\\nOne of the administration's central arguments is that district court judges operating at the bottom rung of the federal judicial system should not be able to block executive actions nationwide. It's an argument that has won some support in legal circles.\\n\\nWhen a federal appeals court ruled in August against Trump's sanctuary cities policy, it nonetheless admonished a lower court for blocking the policy nationwide. And when the Supreme Court upheld Trump's travel ban in June, Associate Justice Clarence Thomas said the court should go further and consider stripping district judges of that authority.\\n\\nAt the same time, critics of the administration's legal efforts contend Solicitor General Noel Francisco routinely is seeking to circumvent Supreme Court rules that allow leapfrogging lower courts only upon a showing that the case is of such imperative public importance as to justify deviation from normal appellate practice.\\n\\nThe Justice Department has shown a remarkable lack of respect for the judicial process by repeatedly seeking to skip over the lower courts and, rather, go straight to the Supreme Court, New York's former acting attorney general, Barbara Underwood, tweeted in November.\\n\\nIf the strategy proves successful, it could lead to even more efforts by the Trump administration to seek Supreme Court bailouts of lower court rulings. One prime target: The Justice Department is seeking to quash a lawsuit that alleges the president has benefited illegally from his family business, including at the Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House."}
{"original": "DETROIT – General Motors' worker Adarrey Ace Humphrey was blindsided Sunday. That's when his life changed.\\n\\nHumphrey, 27, has been a part-time temporary worker at GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan for the last three years. On Sunday morning, he and about 250 of his co-workers crowded into UAW Local 598's union hall. Most thought they were there for a routine meeting.\\n\\nBut when the local's president stepped to the mic, the room listened in awed silence.\\n\\nHe said, 'As of tomorrow, you guys are full-time seniority employees of GM,'  Humphrey said. There was a gasp in the room for a few seconds. Some of us thought he misspoke. Then, we had to say, 'No, we heard him right!' It was amazing.\\n\\nOn Monday, GM made about 930 temporary workers permanent full-time employees at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented facilities in the United States. There are more to come in the months ahead, it said.\\n\\nFord Motor Co. also moved 592 temps to permanent full-time on Monday, the UAW said, and will do more conversions of temps next month. But Fiat Chrysler Automobiles is still working to implement its temporary worker conversions, said the UAW.\\n\\nThe action is in keeping with the terms struck in the 2019 four-year UAW contract that GM union members ratified in October after a 40-day nationwide strike. In it, temporary workers who gain at least three years of service will convert to permanent status starting this year. Their new wages are $21 to $24 an hour. Ford and FCA union members ratified their new contracts with similar terms.\\n\\nStill, thousands remain temporary workers at GM facilities and their chance of reaching permanent status is long and uncertain.\\n\\nConversations continue\\n\\nThe UAW said it wants more temps permanently hired.\\n\\nUAW members sacrificed during our 40-day strike to create a defined path for temporary workers to seniority members in the 2019 National Agreement, Terry Dittes, UAW vice president General Motors, told the Free Press in an email. We remain in conversations with General Motors at several locations where we believe additional members should be moved to seniority status under the agreement.\\n\\nThis move is a good start, said Dittes, but the union will be vigilant to make sure that all hardworking temporary employees see their advancement to seniority status.\\n\\nAbout 50 temps at GM's Marion Metal Center in Indiana were let go recently when the pickup program they were hired to work on ended. GM said it warned the workers in early December that they would be released because the production of previous-generation pickup parts ended the week of Dec. 8. GM warned the employees of the production timeline last January, and it has repeated that regularly, a GM spokesman said.\\n\\nThere are the newly hired temps, too, who have a long way to go to reach the three-year seniority mark. They also face contract pitfalls such as being laid off for too long, thereby derailing whatever seniority they've accrued.\\n\\nMat Bard is a temporary worker at Flint Assembly, where he's worked since May 29. Bard is one of those temps who faces a long path to permanency. He said he will hang in there, but laments, I don't think anything is going to change real soon for me. My chances of being hired are pretty low.\\n\\nReport:Cancer death rate in the US sees largest one-year drop ever\\n\\nMore to come\\n\\nGM confirmed that it made more than 900 GM temporary hourly employees regular full-time employees and said there will be more hiring at more locations and additional opportunities to attain permanent full-time status later this year.\\n\\nGM declined to provide a breakdown of how many temps were converted to permanent at each facility, but a person familiar with GM's hiring process confirmed it did include Flint Assembly and Lansing Delta Township.\\n\\nThese are great, experienced employees, said David Barnas, a GM spokesman. Their transition to full-time regular status will help create more engaged and motivated teams in our plants, which is foundational to improving job satisfaction, health and safety, and the quality of our products for our customers.\\n\\nTemps make up about 7%-10% of GM's workforce over the course of any given year. They accounted for about 4,100 workers at the end of 2018 and a similar figure at the end of 2019, a person familiar with the numbers said. Ford had about 3,400 temps at the end of 2018, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles had 4,800, the UAW said.\\n\\nStrike sticking point\\n\\nThe pathway to permanency was a sticking point in negotiations and drove the strike, too. In 2018, UAW leaders surveyed members about the critical issues to address in 2019 contract talks. Hiring temp workers as permanent employees topped the list, union members said.\\n\\nIt's a really big deal, said John Ryan Bishop, a GM UAW worker at Flint Assembly who started as a temp in 2012 at GM's Orion Assembly plant. A lot of people who were hired in started as temps. They remember what it was like being a temp.\\n\\nIt's the No. 1 contract request from workers:And GM, UAW can't agree on it\\n\\nTemps are union members, but they often work alongside permanent employees, doing the same work for half the pay and far fewer benefits. The UAW agreed to let automakers increase the use of temps a decade ago as the Detroit Three headed into the Great Recession.\\n\\nA better life\\n\\nBut over the years, many temps remained stuck in a temporary status, lacking any clear path to being hired permanently.\\n\\nTake Humphrey. He started as a temp at Flint Assembly — where his father, Charles, has worked full time for many years — in June 2016. GM laid off Humphrey around Thanksgiving of that year. He returned to his temporary job in January 2017 and has worked in that status ever since.\\n\\nOn Sept. 16, Humphrey joined his union brothers and sisters on the picket line in the hopes of getting a permanent job.\\n\\nNow that he is permanent, Humphrey's pay moved from $15 to $17 an hour as a temp to about $20, he said. A UAW document from the Lansing Delta plant said any temp making $17.53 an hour will move up to $21 an hour.\\n\\nPermanent status also means Humphrey gets paid time off. He gets better health care that includes dental and vision.\\n\\nIt opens up a door for me to think about going to the doctor or dentist, too, because I have that insurance now, so it doesn't come out of my paycheck, Humphrey said. I can think about getting a house, too.\\n\\nMost important to Humphrey, he now gets tuition assistance. He wants to go to college and study electrical engineering, he said, adding he dreams of being an inventor one day.\\n\\nThis helps us better our future, our careers and our families, Humphrey said. I almost shed a tear when I heard the news because you finally achieved that goal that you waited three years for and you showed up every day for.\\n\\nFollow reporter Jamie L.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Through 17 minutes, the Minnesota Timberwolves watched the Orlando Magic shoot 76.4 percent and open a 19-point lead. Returning home after a trip was looking like another letdown for Minnesota.\\n\\nThen the Timberwolves started playing team defense.\\n\\nKarl-Anthony Towns had 29 points and 15 rebounds, and Jeff Teague added 23 points and 10 assists in his return to the Minnesota lineup in the Timberwolves' 120-103 comeback victory Friday night.\\n\\nTaj Gibson added 14 points and 10 rebounds for Minnesota. The Timberwolves recovered from a 19-point deficit midway through the second quarter with a 44-12 run through the 5:51 of the third quarter.\\n\\nOnce we started playing defense, Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. I thought the last five minutes of the second quarter we got going. We got some stops. I thought (Anthony Tolliver) gave us a big lift. He hit a couple big 3s and that gave us the energy, gave us a lift, and the defense, I thought, in the second half was very good.\\n\\nNikola Vucevic had 22 points for Orlando, but just eight after the first quarter. The Magic, who had won three of four, hit 26 of their first 34 shots (76.4 percent) before fading.\\n\\nTerrence Ross scored 13 points off the bench for Orlando, but he missed his final four 3-pointers after starting 3 of 5 from beyond the arc during the Magic's hot start. Evan Fournier added 21 points.\\n\\nThis game was ours to take, to be honest, Fournier said. It was really ours. When you're up 20 on the road, you should be winning those games.\\n\\nMinnesota found a way to slow Orlando in the second and continued the momentum into the second half. The Magic missed 12 of their final 14 shots of the first half and were 7 of 23 in the third quarter.\\n\\nTeague and Towns took over offensively in the second half. Teague had nine points and four assists in the third, and Towns had 21 points in the second half after first-half foul trouble.\\n\\nIt was just lazy, undisciplined and soft, Orlando forward Aaron Gordon said. We didn't have it tonight on the defensive end. It's not OK at this point in the season.\\n\\nThe Wolves came back from a halftime deficit for the sixth time in 22 games this season. Friday matched their best comeback of the season and five of their six wins when trailing at the half have come at home.\\n\\nWe came in here, at halftime, we said, 'hey, we've got to change the game,' Towns said. We did that. In essence, we came in here and mostly slapped each other and said, 'Wake up.'\\n\\nTIP-INS\\n\\nMagic: F Jonathon Simmons returned after missing two games because of a sprained left ankle. Simmons scored six points in 21 minutes off the bench. ... Orlando set a season high with the 68 first-half points. The franchise record is 78, set on Nov. 3, 2010, against Minnesota.\\n\\nTimberwolves: F Robert Covington missed his second straight game with a right knee bone bruise and is sidelined indefinitely. G Derrick missed his fourth straight game because of a sprained right ankle. ... Towns had his 25th double-double in 39 games this season. ... Without Covington, Tolliver played for the second straight game and matched his season high with 11 points. ... Minnesota is 13-6 at home this season and 5-15 on the road.\\n\\nTEAGUE COMEBACK\\n\\nTeague wasn't rusty in his return after missing nine games due to left ankle inflammation. Teague was 8 of 10 from the field and hit all three of his 3-pointers, including a quick shot from 28 feet to beat the 24-second clock on one third-quarter possession.\\n\\nIt was Teague's fourth game of the season with at least 20 points.\\n\\nTeague lived in the paint, Magic coach Steve Clifford said. He set the tone early in the game right away, and we were never able to stop his penetration, pick-and-roll or anything else.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Benched earlier this season and questioned for years, Tyrod Taylor and Blake Bortles have a chance to change public perception on the NFL's playoff stage.\\n\\nTaylor helped Buffalo end the longest, current postseason drought in North American pro sports (17 years) while Bortles led Jacksonville to its first playoff berth since the 2007 season.\\n\\nWhichever one wins the next game could do wonders to his image.\\n\\nThe Jaguars (10-6) host the Bills (9-7) in an AFC wild-card game Sunday, a win-or-go-home matchup that means as much to the quarterbacks as anyone.\\n\\nThe Bills were in talks with free agent Brian Hoyer in March and ready to part ways with Taylor until he agreed to restructure his contract extension and make it a two-year deal worth $30.5 million. He has one year remaining, but the team could save $10 million by moving on after this season.\\n\\nNo one would be surprised to see it happen, especially after coach Sean McDermott benched Taylor in favor of rookie Nathan Peterman in November. Peterman threw five first-half interceptions in a 54-24 loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, and Taylor has been the team's starter since .\\n\\nI don't focus on things that I can't control, and I'm going to continue to be that way, said Taylor, who has 14 touchdown passes and four interceptions this season. All I can control right now is my preparation, my focus, my work ethic to putting it all in for this week. It's a one-game season right now, and that's for everyone.\\n\\nI can't allow distractions or thinking too far ahead.\\n\\nBortles has taken a similar approach despite constant bashing — and not just the typical criticism from fans and media.\\n\\nTennessee defensive end Jurrell Casey told a Nashville radio station this week, As long as Bortles is back there, if the ballgame is in his hands, he's going to choke.\\n\\nCasey tried to clarify his comments two days later, writing on Twitter, Chill, y'all. I was just hyping our defense. If we put the pressure, some QBs will choke.\\n\\nHearing talk such as that is nothing new for Bortles, who's been publicly ripped by Houston defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, Seattle safety Earl Thomas and Cincinnati linebacker Vontaze Burfict in the past two months.\\n\\nPlayers or peers talking about you is a little new, said Bortles, who is a big reason Jacksonville is hosting its first playoff game since 1999.\\n\\nI've never been somebody that felt that is the way you should handle things, but guys are different. I had the chance, was fortunate enough to play for George O'Leary in college and playing for Coach O'Leary, you learned very quickly how to take criticism. I had four years of practice doing that, so there's nobody that can say anything worse to me than he did.\\n\\nI got benched every other day.\\n\\nJaguars coach Doug Marrone actually benched Bortles in the preseason, stirring speculation that his days in Jacksonville were numbered.\\n\\nBut Bortles regained the starting job a week later and has been better than expected since , although five interceptions in the past two games — both losses — have some questioning him again.\\n\\nHis first playoff game — Taylor went to the 2013 Super Bowl as Baltimore's backup — could leave outsiders looking at him differently.\\n\\nPlaying a playoff game in Jacksonville hasn't happened in a while, so having that opportunity to play in front of our fans and our city and our stadium, I think, is awesome, Bortles said. I think everyone realizes it's your last chance. If you lose, you go home, it's over.\\n\\nHere are some other things to know about Buffalo and Jacksonville:\\n\\nSTAR STATUS: Bills running back LeSean McCoy is questionable with a right ankle injury. McCoy said he was feeling a lot better Thursday, but declined to make any guarantees about playing. McCoy accounts for nearly a third of Buffalo's offense.\\n\\nOLD FACE, NEW PLACE: Jaguars defensive tackle Marcell Dareus insists he harbors no ill will toward his former team. His actions might say otherwise. The 340-pound run-stopper will face the Bills for the first time since they traded him in October for a late-round draft pick.\\n\\nMARRONE'S MAKEOVER: Jaguars coach Doug Marrone bolted on Buffalo in 2014, opting out of his contract and getting $4 million to walk away. Marrone landed in Jacksonville and will face Buffalo in his first playoff game as a head coach.\\n\\nLONG TIME COMING: Jacksonville's first home playoff game since January 2000 will be a packed house. The Jaguars sold every ticket available and even received permission to remove tarps covering four upper-deck sections to help satisfy demand.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

{"original": "Kevin Allen, and Jimmy Hascup\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nBy the end of this week, the majority of NHL teams will have reached the halfway point of their schedule. Thus, it's a perfect time to reflect on what has transpired. Here are 30 takeaways (one for each team) from the first half of the season (stats through Jan. 6):\\n\\nBest Washington Capitals team ever? It's too soon to know. The 2009-10 Capitals won the President's Trophy, and the 1997-98 team reached the Stanley Cup final. But this team appears to be set up better for a long playoff run than the 2009-10 Capitals. Under coach Barry Trotz, they play a Chicago Blackhawks-like balanced style that wins in the postseason. It helps that goalie Braden Holtby is playing like Carey Price did last season. (Kevin Allen)\\n\\nA return to 100 points? Nobody told Dallas Stars forwards Jamie Benn (52 points) and Tyler Seguin (50 points) that offense was down, but 100 points are within their grasp. The 2009-10 season was the last one that saw more than one player get to the century mark. With Patrick Kane at 59 points, we could have three. (Jimmy Hascup)\\n\\nNHL names All-Star rosters for 3-on-3 tournament\\n\\nLos Angeles Kings primed for deep run. Very little not to like with this roster. Possession game is elite again, Drew Doughty is in the Norris Trophy discussion and Jonathan Quick's even-strength/adjusted save percentages are a career-best. Scary to think they're only 15th in scoring. (JH)\\n\\nJaromir Jagr deserves more love. Jagr, who turns 44 next month, has been most important to the success of the Florida Panthers. He is the team's goals leader (14), points leader (29) and inspirational leader. He has netted four goals in four games to help the Panthers extend their winning streak to 10 games. (KA)\\n\\nDoug Armstrong needs to add offense. The St. Loius Blues are 23rd in scoring and in dire need of a top-six winger who can bring punch to the second line. Paul Stastny's shooting percentage is half of his career average, so expect him to score more at some point. But the Blues are looking at more playoff disappointment if they fail to address this. (JH)\\n\\nMarian Hossa is still playing at a high level. Five goals and 17 points don't tell the entire story of his impact. Hossa's shot rate is still over three per game, though his scoring rate is about one-third off his career. Hossa is still a strong defender and one of the best possession drivers on the roster. (JH)\\n\\nMinnesota Wild due for a slip. Would you characterize the Wild as possessing a top-level finishers or goaltending? Yet their PDO — a sum of five-on-five save percentage and shooting percentage — is 101.6, the highest among West teams. Factor in middling possession numbers (19th, 48.9%) and the correction could be coming. (JH)\\n\\nTravis Hamonic deal on back burner. Although you still hear rumblings about teams wanting to acquire Hamonic, it's in the New York Islanders' best interest to wait until the summer to accommodate his wishes to move to a Western team. More importantly, the Islanders have a shot at winning the Stanley Cup. They can't afford to give up Hamonic, especially now that Johnny Boychuk is sidelined by injury. (KA)\\n\\nSloppy play in Big Apple. The euphoria over the Rangers' good start has now been erased by the team's gross inconsistency for the past several weeks. They are 6-11-2 in their past 19 games and the team's veteran defensive corps has looked leaky to ordinary. The Rangers' Corsi rating (47.4%) ranks near the bottom of the league. This may be the first major test for first-year GM Jeff Gorton. Will he make a trade to change the look? (KA)\\n\\nNHL, NHLPA launch sexual assault, domestic violence training initiative\\n\\nPetr Mrazek is the answer. Detroit Red Wings coach Jeff Blashill has started Petr Mrazek the past three games and it seems as if he is Detroit's No. 1 goalie. He has stopped 240 of the past 258 shots (.930 save percentage) he has faced. Meanwhile, Jimmy Howard has been pulled in his past two starts. He's given up up seven goals on 20 shots. (KA)\\n\\nWaiting for Price. The Montreal Canadiens may need Price as much for a psychological boost as for what he does on the ice. After they played their best game of the season in the Winter Classic, they lost to the Philadelphia Flyers in their next game. Brendan Gallagher is back, but Dale Weise is gone for a couple of weeks. The Canadiens simply need to get healthy before we know exactly where they are. (KA)\\n\\nNew Jersey Devils still start with 'D'. Jacques Lemaire left, Scott Stevens and Marty Brodeur retired, and Lou Lamoriello jumped to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and yet the Devils' success is still about defense and goaltending. No one expected the Devils to be contending for a playoff spot, and yet they are doing it with a defensive style and stellar goaltending that is giving up 2.28 goals per game. Cory Schneider (.928 save percentage) should be in the Vezina hunt. (KA)\\n\\nPressure on Nashville Predators' defense to do it all. Among players with at least 400 minutes of ice time, Predators forwards rank as follows in points per 60 minutes (even strength): Mike Ribeiro (32), Craig Smith (98), James Neal (109), Colin Wilson (128), Filip Forsberg (139) and Calle Jarnkrok (145). That won't get the job done. (JH)\\n\\nIt's about Auston Matthews. What else can the Columbus Blue Jackets do? It's clear that their mix isn't as impressive as we thought it was coming into this season. Columbus fans have to start thinking about the 2016 draft. The Ryan Johansen fallout is extensive to the point that trading him seems like the best solution for all parties. The problem with the all-in-on-Matthews strategy is that even finishing last only gives a team a 20% shot of landing him in the lottery.\\n\\nUPDATE: The Predators and Blue Jackets completed a trade Wednesday night. Nashville traded defenseman Seth Jones to Columbus for center Ryan Johansen, whose 26 points tie him with Forsberg for the most among Nashville forwards.\\n\\n'Z' still a big plus. It's not like anyone is going to overlook a 6-9 player, but Zdeno Chara has been a vital contributor to the Boston Bruins' better-than-expected season. At 38, he leads them in ice time (24:27) and plus-minus (+10). He's on a pace to register about 40 points this season. He has blocked 54 shots, and he's a mainstay on a Boston penalty-killing unit that ranks eighth. (KA)\\n\\nSidney Crosby is back. After suffering through the worst offensive slump of his career, Crosby has rediscovered his magic. He has scored five goals in the past four games. He boasts 12 points in the past eight games, more fitting for a player averaging 1.33 points per game in his career. Crosby has only been a minus-player once in the past 16 games. (KA)\\n\\nMore lucky than good. The Senators' ability to hang in playoff contention is impressive, considering that statistically they aren't measuring up to true contenders. The Senators have the worst possession numbers (46.5%, according to war-on-ice.com) in the Eastern Conference. Plus, their penalty killing ranks 28th (76.3%) and their goal-against per game average (2.90) is 26th. They have survived on the strength of the eighth-best offense. (KA)\\n\\nAllen: NHL All-Star Game more of a celebration than competition\\n\\nTobias Rieder overlooked in the desert. Rieder might be the most complete young forward on the Arizona Coyotes' roster. He is one of four with at least two points per 60 minutes at even strength, and he's their best possession player, as the Coyotes control the play more than 5% better with him on the ice. He's on pace for 17 goals and 48 points. (JH)\\n\\nJonathan Drouin saga just a blip. Drouin's trade request isn't close to the Lightning's biggest problem. GM Steve Yzerman and coach Jon Cooper's priority is to figure out why Tampa Bay's offense ranks 21st after leading last season. The return of Ondrej Palat from injury helps. The Lightning need more from Tyler Johnson (four goals, 11 points in 27 games), Valtteri Filppula (four goals, 17 points) and Ryan Callahan (five goals, 13 points). (KA)\\n\\nColorado Avalanche's 2013 success is blinding. Don't let the 19-18-3 record fool you. Teams should be judged on process and not just results, and coach Patrick Roy hasn't made the necessary adjustments. A below-average possession team has gotten worse the past few seasons, to a league-low 44%. (JH)\\n\\nAnaheim Ducks are lurking. Despite the terrible start, the Ducks are three points behind the Coyotes for second in a weak Pacific Division. With a a talented roster and league-low 97.3 PDO, they're due for a hot streak. (JH)\\n\\nShayne Gostisbehere provides a spark. The most impactful minor-league call-up in the Eastern Conference goes to Gostisbehere, a 22-year-old defenseman for the Philadelphia Flyers. The puck-moving defenseman has created a buzz around the league with his offensive knack. He has scored seven goals (with 16 points) in his 22 games. He freshened up a team that seemed a bit stale. (KA)\\n\\nNothing going on with Eric Staal. It would seem to be in the Carolina Hurricanes' best interests to trade Eric Staal if they can't re-sign him, but Staal will decide his fate because he has a no-trade clause. He hasn't decided what he wants to do, meaning this could go all the way to the trade deadline. Staal could help several teams, including the Predators. (KA)\\n\\nVancouver Canucks should sell, now. They're six points out of a playoff spot with four teams to jump. The prudent move for general manager Jim Benning is to realize this team isn't close to contending and that it needs a wave of new, young talent. Radim Vrbata and Brandon Prust are the only major unrestricted free agents next season, but Benning should sweeten deals with veteran players whose deals don't expire until 2017-18. (JH)\\n\\nSan Jose Sharks banking on Logan Couture. The moves GM Doug Wilson made in the offseason indicate the Sharks are in win-now mode. They've suffered without Couture, who has played only seven games because of injuries. Couture is dynamic, and he will single handedly change the complexion of this offense. (JH)\\n\\nSix teams that should trade for Lightning's Jonathan Drouin\\n\\nMike Babcock should be Jack Adams candidate. This is a rebuilding Toronto Maple Leafs team with an uninspiring roster, and yet somehow Babcock has it at .500. The Maple Leafs have gone 7-2-2 in their past 11 games. Babcock's ability to improve this team's defense (13th in goals-against average) should be enough to earn him coach-of-the-year consideration. (KA)\\n\\nKarri Ramo holds the keys. If the Flames want to be a contender, their goaltending is going to have to be much better. Their 90.9 save percentage at five-on-five is the worst in the NHL. Ramo has been much better since early December. (JH)\\n\\nConnor Hellebuyck is an emerging star. It won't be long before the Winnipeg Jets rookie netminder gets mentioned with the league's best. For now, he needs to start the majority of games for the Jets' playoff push. Among goalies with at least 12 games, Hellebuyck is tops in save percentage and adjusted save percentage. His .935 overall save percentage would be second if he logged enough games. (JH)\\n\\nConnor McDavid is a wild card. McDavid's return to the lineup could change the playoff picture. Could he lead the Edmonton Oilers' charge? If he does, how will that affect his Calder Trophy candidacy? Even if the Oilers don't make the playoffs, adding McDavid to Taylor Hall and Leon Draisaitl will make them a difficult opponent. (JH)\\n\\nDon't rule out Jack Eichel. Chicago's Artemi Panarin and Detroit's Dylan Larkin are receiving much of the attention for the Calder Trophy, but Buffalo Sabres center Jack Eichel will be in this race at the end. He has four goals and six assists in his past six games. With 13 goals, Eichel could reach 30 by the end of the season. Historically, what happens later in the season carries more weight in Professional Hockey Writers Association balloting. (KA)"}
{"original": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. — When it was over, the first Titans playoff win in 14 years and the latest Kansas City Chiefs playoff debacle and a game that probably will stand as the wildest of the bunch when this postseason is over, coach Mike Mularkey collected hug after hug like he was in a wedding receiving line.\\n\\nHe basked for those moments in a 22-21 comeback win Saturday at dead-quiet Arrowhead Stadium, then ran to the locker room to celebrate more with a team that has earned the right to play free and loose until this run ends. But let's go back one night.\\n\\nMore:Marcus Mariota, Derrick Henry lead epic playoff comeback\\n\\nJohnny's Tavern in downtown Kansas City, filled Friday evening with Titans fans, awaited Mularkey. The coach's planned arrival was never announced to the crowd of a couple hundred, but Titans employees told media members to be ready for it. Much of the bar knew as the clock approached the target time of 10:50. Already, Titans radio announcers Mike Keith and Dave McGinnis had riled up the crowd – McGinnis predicting the Titans would kick the Chiefs' ass in the wild-card game at Arrowhead Stadium.\\n\\nThe anticipation built, and then it died. The word came: Mularkey had decided at the last minute to bail, forfeiting an opportunity to build some good will with a fan base that has largely turned on him this season. These particular folks were buzzing and ready to cheer him, but this is what he has become – indecisive and uncertain, entering the weekend with a playoff team and not assured he would leave it with a job.\\n\\nBack to Saturday. Asked after the win of his career if he felt secure in his job entering the game, Mularkey was brutally honest, saying: No, I haven't had any support to say that I was. So no, I just assumed the worst.\\n\\nBut he gets to keep the job another week now, right? And Titans fans are OK with that? Mularkey didn't pick up the microphone Friday, but he dropped it Saturday, engineering a stunning comeback upset of the Chiefs to bring his two-season record as the full-time head coach to 19-14. This after the Titans went 5-27 the previous two seasons.\\n\\nIf you're a fan and you're doubting a head coach that just got to the playoffs, then there's something wrong, said Titans safety Kevin Byard, who led Dick LeBeau's defense to a second-half shutout. I don't really have anything to say to the fans, but to my head coach, I'm proud of him.\\n\\nMore:Titans report card: With job on the line, Mike Mularkey oversees epic comeback in playoffs\\n\\nThe Titans stormed back from a 21-3 halftime deficit and rode star performances from quarterback Marcus Mariota (205 yards and two touchdowns passing, 46 yards rushing, one monster block late) and running back Derrick Henry (23 carries, 156 yards, one touchdown). They benefited from the second-quarter loss of Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, but there was nothing through 30 minutes to suggest they could even make this a game.\\n\\nIt's this team, Mularkey said. I wish you guys would give them a little credit for it. They stick together and they got each other's backs and they always have.\\n\\nThey got this done after a Henry fumble that was returned for a potential game-winning touchdown was overturned because he was down. And despite two missed 2-point conversions, one returned for an apparent 2-pointer for the Chiefs that was called back because Mariota was ruled down. And despite not reaching the end zone until a third-quarter Mariota pass was batted back to him – a touchdown pass and reception for him.\\n\\nWhatever. Mularkey just got the franchise to its first playoff game in nine years. And he just won its first playoff game since 2004. The No. 5 seed Titans will head to No. 1 seed New England or No. 2 seed Pittsburgh next weekend to play for a spot in the AFC championship game because the Titans never stop playing under Mularkey.\\n\\nMore:Titans fans keep the faith at Saturday's playoff watch party\\n\\nThere's so much that can be written about these players and the way they bounced back from a three-game losing streak to earn a playoff bid against AFC South champ Jacksonville last week, then took out the loaded Chiefs.\\n\\nBut in Kansas City, the only story line is that the Chiefs continue to disappoint in the postseason and still haven't won a home playoff game since Joe Montana was starting at quarterback in 1994.\\n\\nAnd in Nashville, it's all Mularkey, all the time. NFL Network's Ian Rapoport came with another pre-game claim that Mularkey would be coaching for his job – tweeting that a loss could end his tenure, as the team prepares for a run at Patriots (offensive coordinator) Josh McDaniels.\\n\\nComedy to me, Byard said.\\n\\nRidiculous, Mularkey said of the circumstances. I can say I don't think it's fair to my family. So when it has an effect on my family, it has an effect on me. So yeah, I'd say it had a big effect on me.\\n\\nMcDaniels has worked with Titans general manager Jon Robinson in New England. Robinson refused comment after the game, but a separate team source confirmed after the game that Mularkey's job is safe.\\n\\nSeriously, how can it not be safe at this point? I can hear it now if he beats the Patriots or Steelers next week: Hey, Mike, great job, now just win the Super Bowl and make sure Mariota throws for more than 400 yards and that half of those yards come on run-pass options and you're good, OK?\\n\\nHe should be secure in his position based on the job he has done and on the risk involved in any coaching change, with the understanding that Mularkey and a potentially retooled offensive staff must make major strides in 2018.\\n\\nThe offense needs to look more like it did in the second half Saturday when it took over the game, battered the Chiefs up front and converted all seven third-down opportunities. And if the decision already has been made to pursue McDaniels – who is far from a sure thing – well, a decision isn't final until it's final. Just look at Mularkey, who changed his mind Friday night and got to changing the minds of others on Saturday.\\n\\nReach Joe Rexrode at jrexrode@tennessean.com and follow him on Twitter @joerexrode."}
{"original": "Shefali Luthra\\n\\nThe 19th\\n\\nThis story was published in partnership with The 19th, a nonprofit, nonpartisan newsroom reporting on gender, politics and policy.\\n\\nCarly Evans never missed her weekly appointment with her therapist. She called it her maintenance – it kept everything in her life running smoothly.\\n\\nThat changed in September, when Evans, a high school English and drama teacher and mother of three, found herself juggling an impossible burden: educating students in a pandemic while stewarding her own family through the crisis.\\n\\nI wish I could say 'I'm handling it so well and am on it every day,' she said. I'm not.\\n\\nEvans' district in Sudbury, Massachusetts, has been operating since September on a hybrid model of teaching, so she splits her time between working on campus and remotely from home. Her two youngest children, who are in second and third grade, need adult supervision with their own online schooling, a responsibility she splits with her mother, who lives with the family. (Evans' husband, also a teacher, has to show up in-person for his job at a private school.)\\n\\nEvans, 42, keeps a color-coded daily schedule to make sure nothing falls through the cracks. But, of course, things do. And top of the list? Taking care of herself.\\n\\nSince September, Evans said, she has canceled more therapist appointments than she has kept. With everything going on, she said, it's that much harder to justify giving myself that hour every week.\\n\\nShe isn't sleeping. Before the pandemic, she suffered migraines every few months and called in sick on those days. Now, she has one a week, an increase she attributes to stress. She makes herself work through the pain – there aren't enough substitute teachers to go around, and already, she said, I have so little time with her students. She's exhausted, she said, but she has to keep going.\\n\\nYou power through and do what you've got to do, she said. I keep telling my own children this is temporary. It doesn't feel like it, but it is.\\n\\nSince summer, experts have warned that the mental health of the nation's teachers – a category dominated 3-1 by women – could suffer when school resumed. That prediction appears to be bearing out. Many say their psychological well-being is suffering in ways they've hardly ever experienced.\\n\\nBecause of the pandemic, about three-fourths of the 100 largest school districts opted for complete remote learning, an October study found, and a little over a quarter of all districts began the year with a hybrid approach. But as COVID-19 case counts climb, districts across the country have ricocheted from remote to in-person to hybrid models, and many that started with even a semblance of in-person learning have fallen back to remote education.\\n\\nBetween the unpredictability, the isolation and the newfound challenges in reaching their students – who mental health experts worry are also struggling – what little mental health support is extended to teachers feels like nowhere near enough.\\n\\nI spend all day staring at a screen and kind of generating enthusiasm into the void that Zoom is, and I end the day so tired, and so done, and so frustrated, said Emma Wohl, a middle school teacher in Washington state whose district has been fully remote this year. The moments of joy I used to have are so much more rare.\\n\\nLast August, the National Education Association, a major teachers union, found that 28% of educators said the pandemic made them more likely to leave teaching. A study from Louisiana tracked early childhood educators' mental health last spring, finding that rates of depression almost doubled, with more than a third of those educators indicating depressive symptoms. In a survey from August to September by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, the vast majority of teachers reported working longer hours, and only a quarter said their school offered adequate support for mental health.\\n\\nStill, there is little data tracking depression or anxiety among teachers, especially over the past few months, meaning there's no clear picture of just how educators are faring. Experts say all signs point to a crisis on par with the kind of trauma experienced after national disasters.\\n\\nI saw that kind of level of strain and stress because of natural disasters creating havoc. I saw it after 9/11 in New York City. You see it after crises, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, describing what she has heard from members of her union. The only time we've seen it on a sustained level like this is obviously when you had a war.\\n\\nResearch shows that high stress can trigger symptoms of anxiety and depression. Already, women were at greater risk for both conditions. As of the end of November, about 48% of all women exhibited symptoms of one such condition, an increase of 8 percentage points from this April and above what is normally seen, according to data collected by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 37% of men reported the same.\\n\\nTeachers have reached out to me and said, 'For the first time in my life I have to see a therapist,' said Amy Bintliff, an assistant teaching professor at UCLA, who has been trying to track teacher mental health since the pandemic began.\\n\\nBut therapists covered by teachers' insurance plans may not have evening hours, and they don't necessarily have the time – or spare money – for weekly appointments.\\n\\nThere are access issues to mental health services, Bintliff said.\\n\\nIt's a theme that has emerged repeatedly since March, said Laura Wangsness Willemsen and Elisheva Cohen, two researchers who have been tracking teachers since the coronavirus pandemic began, focusing on a cohort of elementary school teachers in Minnesota. Their research didn't initially focus on mental health, they said, until teachers kept bringing up the topic on their own.\\n\\nThe level of stress isn't sustainable, they said. Teachers have been operating in crisis mode since spring. By now, any surge of energy that fueled them through the pandemic's initial months has been depleted.\\n\\nWe see a deeper exhaustion going into the school year, and that hasn't resolved, Wangsness Willemsen said.\\n\\nThe sources of stress and fatigue are complex. Many teachers have had to switch back and forth between in-person and online learning, often with only a few days' notice.\\n\\nEvans said she has heard as late as Saturday that a recent student exposure to COVID-19 means her Monday lesson is switching from in-person to virtual. She used to plan her lessons out a month in advance but now gives herself only a week at a time. It's simply not worth the chance that she may have to change things at the last minute.\\n\\nTeaching from home is also a fundamentally different exercise, one that is simultaneously more invasive but also lonelier. Students on Zoom lessons often have their cameras off and microphones muted, making it harder to engage or connect with them. Normally, teachers can rely on their colleagues for consistent emotional support in quick lunch room chats. That sort of spontaneous support isn't an option right now.\\n\\nThe challenges are greater for mothers. Research has shown that in many families, moms are more often the ones supervising a child's virtual education. Teachers experience that dynamic two times over – instructing their students virtually while also working as the primary parent to ensure that their own children don't fall behind in their own distance learning.\\n\\nEvery mom I know is holding all of the weight, said Erin Herda, a middle school ethnic studies teacher and mother of two in Washington state. I'm still the one monitoring all (my daughter's) online dance classes and then having to throw tantrums to get other people to do chores. That definitely impacts my mental health, and my children's, when I have to throw tantrums.\\n\\nHerda's younger daughter, who is 8, frequently comes to her for help with assignments – often while Herda is in the middle of a Zoom session with her own students. We've had to learn how to work with accepting those moments, and just say this is what it means to be working from home, she said.\\n\\nAnd all the while, many teachers carry the knowledge that their students – who often rely on in-person school for meals or for social support – are struggling, too. Research has shown that teachers' mental health declines when their students are doing poorly.\\n\\nDistricts and teachers unions have put forth benefits and programs meant to help support teachers' psychological well-being. American Federation of Teachers launched a trauma benefit this year, which includes counseling for teachers who have experienced events including infection by contagious disease or major disaster. There are mental health webinars, wellness town halls and even online yoga.\\n\\nIn practice, though, it's all scratching at the surface. The trauma benefit has been used by some teachers, Weingarten said, but not as much as she had hoped, which she attributes to stigma against recognizing mental health problems and a lack of awareness that the resource exists.\\n\\nFor teachers who are stretched thin, those kinds of offerings provide little recourse. They require time and energy, which are in short supply.\\n\\nI don't want to go to a webinar to think about my mental health, Wohl said. In my (school) building, people try to organize a get-together after school, but it's over Zoom, and I'm done with Zoom for the day.\\n\\nOther resources that might once have been available, and that could have provided some relief – calling in sick, for instance, if a teacher is feeling physically ill or needs a mental health day – are no longer tenable, teachers said.\\n\\nIn many districts, there simply aren't enough substitute teachers to meet the need. Substitutes are typically retired teachers, and for districts using any hybrid or in-person model, the risk of coronavirus exposure poses a heightened threat. And especially in a pandemic that is straining everyone's mental health, teachers said, the chance to actually see one's students is too precious to abandon.\\n\\nThese kids, they only get to come so much of the time, and they want to see me. They don't want to see a sub, Evans said.\\n\\nFor schools that are remote, getting a substitute set up for online learning poses its own set of logistical challenges – getting a Zoom, transferring it over, making sure the substitute is comfortable navigating online learning software. For many, that burden factors in when determining whether to call in sick.\\n\\nHerda took one day off in October, and it was more stress than imaginable, she said. Her district still hasn't developed a clear system for arranging substitute teachers over video chat. So she had to alert human resources, tech support and her principal a week in advance of her absence. And still, she was fielding questions from the school on her supposed day away.\\n\\nWith that in mind, she said, the idea of taking a day off for mental health is difficult to conceive.\\n\\nI don't feel confident there's any measures in place that would help make sure my students have anything guaranteed to help them, that would take the pressure off of me, she said. It would still rely on me doing all of the work even if I was very sick.\\n\\nMeanwhile, federal support has lagged. Outlining his own health agenda, President-elect Joe Biden vowed to make it safe for schools to reopen by the end of his first 100 days in office – assuming Congress and state and local governments took measures to support school teachers and to curb the coronavirus spread.\\n\\nBut those are tremendous assumptions and promise a safe return to the classroom only when the school year has almost ended. News of a vaccine could offer some hope that, even if things are bad now, they will eventually improve. A top CDC panel, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, has recommended that teachers be part of the next wave of Americans vaccinated, meaning they could be immunized by some time in February.\\n\\nBut for many, it feels too far away to really make a difference, especially as winter looms.\\n\\nIt's like that trauma response where you cannot look forward. You just live day to day, Herda said. That's the way I'm making it through."}

{"original": "The venue was packed with more than a thousand people waiting to see Pete Buttigieg, and a chant had broken out for the Democratic presidential candidate a few minutes before he took the stage.\\n\\nKasey Peters, inside the hall, did not chant along. He did not hold up a sign for the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, like some around him, or outwardly applaud Buttigieg's remarks. The 31-year-old compliance analyst was there just to listen.\\n\\nThe Saturday event was only Peters' second time seeing a candidate in person this Iowa caucus cycle. He saw Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts nearly a year ago, when she first announced her bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. Peters had effectively tuned out the crowded race since then, and he's still undecided.\\n\\nThings will change in the weeks ahead, as Peters goes to other candidate events and reads up on policy proposals.\\n\\nNow that we're getting closer to caucus, I'm diving in, he said.\\n\\nWith a month to go before the Feb. 3 caucuses, Iowans like Peters appear to be everywhere. Multi-candidate events draw large turnouts from fervent supporters, but there are also those in the first-in-the-nation caucus state who are not sure which candidate to support. They're only now beginning to venture out to see the candidates in person, despite the inundation of political ads on television and nearly 2,000 public events candidates have hosted in Iowa in 2019.\\n\\nI am one of the undecided, declared Jenny Burton, a social worker who attended the West Des Moines Buttigieg event. Burton noted that she had met author Marianne Williamson in Des Moines a few days earlier. Burton is actively considering multiple candidates, including Williamson and Warren.\\n\\nI'm trying to get in with anybody who's coming to the community, Burton explained about her caucus strategy in the weeks ahead.\\n\\nBurton added about the candidates: I respect all of them, almost equally. That's why it's so difficult for me to narrow it down to one.\\n\\n'Undecideds' spark hope for low-polling candidates\\n\\nIn September, a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom Iowa Poll showed just one in five likely Democratic caucusgoers said their minds were made up, while 63% said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.\\n\\nAn Iowa Poll released in November showed an uptick in decision-making: More respondents — then at 30% — said they had a first choice and their minds were made up. But 62% who said they had a first choice also said they could still be persuaded.\\n\\nThat indecision has been a lifeline for several presidential hopefuls in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, despite a shrinking debate stage that has limited some candidates' exposure.\\n\\nDave Waters of Boone saw Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey speak in Adel on Dec. 20. The senator, who failed to make it onto the debate stage in Los Angeles the day before, was on Waters' list of possible picks.\\n\\nWaters said he has usually decided which candidate to caucus for by now.\\n\\nThere's too many good ones, Waters said about his dilemma this time.\\n\\nSome likely caucusgoers are in no rush to figure things out.\\n\\nJim Oxendale, who saw Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota at a Dec. 22 event in Ida Grove, said he won't make a final decision until the last 15 minutes before the caucuses.\\n\\nI think this is a very serious thing, said the 70-year-old Oxendale, who also lives in Ida Grove. And it makes me nervous to commit to somebody too early because we're a long way from February.\\n\\nAfter hearing former Vice President Joe Biden speak in Tipton on Saturday, West Liberty resident Faye Petersen said she is beginning to think that perhaps he's the one.\\n\\nEven so, Petersen added, she is still undecided — she also likes Klobuchar, Booker and entrepreneur Andrew Yang — and she fully expects to change her mind at least a few more times before she attends her caucus.\\n\\nI will make it up before then, she said, dismissing any pressure to choose.\\n\\nEvery darn one of them is way better than what we have, Petersen said.\\n\\nStill a lot of candidates to choose from\\n\\nPeters, who attended the Buttigieg event in West Des Moines, said he tuned out for most of last year because there were so many candidates in the race. That number has dropped only a little, from a high of more than two dozen to 15 candidates.\\n\\nPeters said while his interest in Warren has subsided, he likes Buttigieg. He is also intrigued by former Rep. John Delaney from Maryland.\\n\\nHe's someone I'd like to look a little more into, Peters said of Delaney. … He's kind of been someone I've paid attention to the whole time he's been in the race.\\n\\nPeters said he knows several friends who are undecided like him. He said some have expressed interest in Sen. Bernie Sanders from Vermont and Yang.\\n\\nEverybody is still exploring, he said.\\n\\nRachel Foubert is also undecided, but that wasn't always the case.\\n\\nThe 25-year-old teacher had committed to caucus for Kamala Harris. Now that thesenator from California is out of the race, Foubert is actively looking for the next person to support. She attended a Biden event in Williamsburg on Dec. 27, in part because it was close to her home in North English, about 30 miles away.\\n\\nBut Foubert has found no favorites yet that resonate with her the way Harris did. So she plans to see as many candidates in person as she can. The Biden event was the first for her. She said she was drawn to Biden's experience with foreign diplomacy.\\n\\nI just want someone who can beat Trump, Foubert said.\\n\\nSometimes the decisions come unexpectedly.\\n\\nMathew Kelly came to see Buttigieg at a town hall in Knoxville on Sunday with his young daughter. Kelly said he liked Buttigieg and Klobuchar, and he planned to give himself some time to make a decision.\\n\\nI think I just need to hear them speak and do more research, he said before Buttigieg addressed the crowd.\\n\\nAfter the event, Kelly signed a card committing to caucus for Buttigieg.\\n\\nRegister reporters Brianne Pfannenstiel and Austin Cannon contributed to this report.\\n\\nBarbara Rodriguez covers health care and politics for the Register.

{"original": "PADUCAH, Ky. — With a preseason frontcourt tandem of Marvin Bagley III and DeAndre Ayton — arguably the top sophomore and junior, respectively, in the nation — it didn't matter that Hillcrest Prep's backcourt was full of unheralded prospects.\\n\\nBut after Bagley's unexpected move along with his younger brother following their father's departure as an assistant coach, Hillcrest (Phoenix) needed to change philosophy and that led to increased roles for the guards.\\n\\nWhile any program would want to build around the 7-foot Ayton, it's the guards for the school in its first season against a national schedule that have bolstered the defense — its bread and butter.\\n\\nWe need some more post presence, but our guards have that tenacity and defensive will power to get everything else going, coach Kyle Weaver said. In warmups, we look tiny, and we have that underdog look. Our fight is so big, though. We have that X-factor and that heart that I don't think any other team in the country has. We don't care who you are, we are coming at you. We won't back down. We'll be in your grill the full 32 minutes and thats what I try to push our guys to do.\\n\\nRELATED: Marvin Bagley transfers to Sierra Canyon in California\\n\\nThe success of the team starts with Ayton, who virtually every elite college program after his services. Still just a junior, Ayton is barely underway in the recruitment process. He said he is not making a decision until the last semester of his senior year.\\n\\nRather than recruiting or what might have been, Ayton said he is focusing on winning and trying to be the best leader he can be.\\n\\nAyton transferred from Balboa City in San Diego after Bagley had joined the Hillcrest program.\\n\\nThey look up to me in tough times. I have to keep my head, he said. I can't be mopey on the court or cry. I have to talk to the refs, talk to the coaches and keep it going, execute our plays, talk on defense and just be positive all the time.\\n\\nWeaver calls Ayton a fierce competitor who will outwork opposing players and do whatever it takes to win.\\n\\nI have seen him develop so much since October. He's hands-down the No. 1 player in the country, but I have seen him develop so much offensively, Weaver. And defensively, a lot of teams don't want to drive on him because when he jumps vertically it's almost 10 feet.\\n\\nWeaver says he feels the program has really rebounded well (from Bagley's transfer). Bagley was being home-schooled after he left Hillcrest and recently transferred to Sierra Canyon in California. He has not been deemed eligible to play at this point, pending a ruling by the CIF's Southern Section.\\n\\nA big part of that rebound has been doubling down on defense. Joining Ayton on the Hillcrest squad is Dontez Thomas, who is averaging around 18 points per game while guarding the opposing team's top perimeter player most nights. Defensive-minded guards Chanel Banks and Darien Knowles are also key for Hillcrest's stout defense.\\n\\nWeaver would be the first to tell you — he wasn't a good defensive player in college at Colorado Christian University. It wasn't until he graduated college when he understood the importance of defense, and that's been what he's trying to instill in his underdog team.\\n\\nOn Friday at Mustang Madness in Paducah, Ky., Hillcrest used that defense to get by Quality Education, 57-55, despite a subpar offensive night .\\n\\nI truly believe we have the best defensive basketball team in the nation, Weaver said. (Against Quality Education), especially with size, we were missing two bigs so it showed with how bad we played offensively, but the team was carried by our defense.\\n\\nEven Ayton, who possesses a rare ability to knock down the 3-pointer as a 7-footer, struggled on Friday, but he found other ways to score by pouring in a team-high 22 points. Surprsingly, Ayton is averaging around four threes a game.\\n\\nI love entertaining. I don't want to sit on the block all the time, said Ayton. Today wasn't quite fun shooting the ball. I was getting bumped a lot, I got thrown off my game a lot, but we got the win. I stayed down low, executed and did what I had to do.\\n\\nConsistently putting three players onto the court at 6-foot-2 or smaller, along with the 6-foot-4 Banks and the lone big man in Ayton, Hillcrest isn't a team that wows its opposition in size, but it has ridden its grit-and-grind philosophy to a 10-2 record on the year — the most recent game also coming at Mustang Madness, a 72-60 loss to an Advanced Prep International team it beat earlier in the season.\\n\\nSince Hillcrest's first loss of the season, back in November, the Bruins have bought in to Weaver's defensive attitude.\\n\\nOur first loss it was more of us trying to find our identity as a team, but it's been nothing but progress since December, said Weaver. We beat two really good teams in Lexington, played well in Las Vegas and then in Arizona. We're making good progress.\\n\\nBut a cloud still hangs over Hillcrest, as the NCAA made an October visit to Starshine Academy, where the players are housed and receive education. At the time, Hillcrest Prep athletic director Matt Allen said that the NCAA was seeking information on the academic schedule to determine whether the coursework would be approved.\\n\\nWeaver said his school is doing things the way it should be done.\\n\\nA lot of heat is coming our way. Everyone wants us out of the picture, he said. They think we're doing it the wrong way. We're doing it the clean way though. There is no lies behind it."}
{"original": "Jon Swartz\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO — Steve Jobs proudly offered one of the first iPhones backstage, beaming as he asked for feedback on Apple's groundbreaking smartphone.\\n\\nIt was a decade ago today, at the Moscone Center here, and Apple's iconic co-founder had a hunch it was about to change computing as we know it. In a sit-down interview with USA TODAY, Jobs made a convincing case, demonstrating how iPhone users could make calls while viewing content on the Web and exchanging e-mail — all at the same time.\\n\\nThis is a revolutionary product that has the chance to really impact people's lives, Jobs told me, comparing the iPhone to the original Macintosh and iPod. This is the ultimate digital device.\\n\\nJobs unveils long-awaited iPhone - USATODAY.com\\n\\nJobs' words proved prophetic.\\n\\nAnalyst Tim Bajarin, who was in the audience that Tuesday morning, was instantly convinced Apple would create a new category in mobile computing. We had mini computers, desktop computers and now with the iPhone, pocket computers, he recalls. I felt it could be Apple's biggest hit ever.\\n\\nIn the decade since its inception — it was announced in Jan. 9 but did not ship until June 2007 — iPhone redefined the burgeoning smartphone market, kick-started Apple into years of hyper-growth and became the flagship product of the company known for bringing Macintosh to the world. Roughly two-thirds of Apple's revenue comes from iPhone.\\n\\nAlong the way, Apple ushered in the App Store and sold more than 1 billion iPhones, propelling it to a current market value of $628.7 billion.\\n\\niPhone set the standard for mobile computing in its first decade and we are just getting started, Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a statement. The best is yet to come.\\n\\nThe rise of iPhone meant the demise of BlackBerry, at one time the leading mobile device, and a reordering of smartphone designs. Samsung was among several vendors to closely hew the iPhone's distinctive design, leading to a years-long legal dispute that ended in the U.S. Supreme Court. (Samsung won.)\\n\\nThe iPhone completely changed the way businesses connect with their customers. We've only scratched the surface in terms of mobile engagement and personalization, says Localytics CEO Raj Aggarwal, who worked alongside Jobs on the launch of the iPhone.\\n\\nThe FBI also had a keen interest in the phone, and its contents, when it pressed Apple to unlock the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, Calif., terrorists. Apple declined, sparking a national debate on the security vs. privacy of consumers. (Apple won.)\\n\\nThe engineering is in the background, so the front end is really easy to use, with just a swipe or a poke of the finger, says Peter Krapp, professor of film & media studies at the University of California, Irvine. That's the success of the iPhone and why it's has been so colonizing over the last decade.\\n\\nNot every product is unflappable, however.\\n\\nAs the worldwide smartphone market saturated and copycat competition from cheaper models intensified in Asia, iPhone sales slackened the past few quarters, depressing Apple's overall revenue.\\n\\nAnalysts accustomed to blow-out iPhone sales began to scale back their estimates.\\n\\nEven iPhone, which wowed consumers and corporations with technology such as an all-touch interface; Siri; Touch ID, its fingerprint identity sensor; and dual-lens Portrait photo mode, has been criticized for incremental innovation updates of late.\\n\\nIndeed, the death of Jobs in October 2011 underscored such sentiment. His passing, for some, symbolized the end of a brilliant decade-long stretch in which Jobs introduced iPod, iPhone and iPad.\\n\\nBut, like Apple and Jobs, iPhone may be in store for a comeback.\\n\\nThings could change dramatically in September when Apple is expected to unveil the 10th-anniversary iPhone, which could feature a radical redesign and augmented- and virtual-reality features, says Crawford Del Prete, an analyst at market researcher IDC.\\n\\nAR and VR would certainly differentiate the iPhone platform to get people excited and jumpstart sales, Del Prete says.\\n\\nIt just might be the kind of evolutionary consumer-electronic blockbuster it was in the beginning.\\n\\nJust as Jobs predicted 10 years ago today.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY San Francisco Bureau Chief Jon Swartz @jswartz on Twitter.\\n\\nThe 10 biggest moments in the history of iPhone"}
{"original": "With Raphael Warnock projected to win one of the two U.S. Senate runoff elections in Georgia and fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leading in the other, among the myriad possible outcomes of a change in control of the Senate is how the NCAA will fare in its effort to get a Congressional solution to issues surrounding college athletes' ability to make money from their names, images and likenesses.\\n\\nDemocrats will continue to have a majority in the House of Representatives. And a bill introduced in the last session of Congress by Democratic Sens. Cory Booker (New Jersey) and Richard Blumenthal (Connecticut) would go far beyond bills driven by Republican senators and congressmen that were centered more narrowly around name, image and likeness (NIL).\\n\\nSen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., who has chaired the chamber's Commerce Committee, introduced one NIL bill. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., introduced another.\\n\\nOn the House side, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez, R-Ohio, offered one with Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, D-Mo. In addition, Reps. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill., introduced a companion bill to Blumenthal and Booker's.\\n\\nA spokesman for Gonzalez said he plans to reintroduce his bill in the new session, and a spokesman for Wicker said last week his plans were uncertain.\\n\\nBlumenthal recently said his and Booker's measure will be reintroduced in the new session. While changes could be made, the previous version had provisions that included athletes annually receiving money directly based on the revenue surpluses they help their teams generate. He and Booker also want athletes to have long-term health care and a set of educational protections.\\n\\nAs written for the last session, their bill would mandate not only individual NIL rights, but also athletes' ability to market themselves as a group. That step, among other impacts, would begin to create a mechanism for athletes to be legally depicted in once-popular video games that were discontinued amid NIL litigation against the NCAA.\\n\\nFederal legislators' feelings about the NCAA and college sports do not always follow party or ideological lines. But Tom McMillen — a former Congressman who now serves as president and CEO of the LEAD1 Association, a group representing Football Bowl Subdivision athletics directors — predicted that control of the Senate would have a significant impact on the NIL debate's direction.\\n\\nSpeaking during Tuesday's election day in Georgia, McMillen said that if the Democrats gained control of the Senate, you're going to have a much bigger push for a comprehensive bill, probably far beyond NIL.\\n\\nMcMillen predicted that there will have to be some type of compromise between the Booker-Blumenthal plan and the versions advanced by Wicker and Gonzalez for a bill to get through Congress. But it's worth remembering that, in August, when Blumenthal and Booker put out a blueprint for what became their bill, they were joined in that statement by a group of senators that included now-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris.\\n\\nIn addition, Democratic control of the Senate likely includes Democrats chairing committees instead of Republicans, although a 50-50 split may result in equal party representation in the membership of committees. This matters in the college-athlete context because Wicker has been leading the Commerce Committee, and his version of a bill was referred to that committee. The bill from Booker and Blumenthal was crafted in a fashion that resulted in it being referred to the Judiciary Committee, a panel on which both of them serve.\\n\\nHow quickly any action in Congress will occur remains to be seen.\\n\\nCongress is not getting to this any time soon, McMillen said. I mean, the ramp-up of COVID is just taking all the air out of the Congress. ... I personally don't see it till later this year.\\n\\nWhen the time comes, if the Democrats are in charge, McMillen said: I think you're going to have to see more things done on medical and health care and so forth. I think those and the athletes will have these rights. The details between that and the rest of it are ... going to depend. But some compromise will have to come out of here."}
{"original": "Cynthia P. Schneider\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nIn breaking with President Donald Trump's threats to attack cultural sites in Iran and vowing to follow the laws of armed conflict, Defense Secretary Mark Esper was continuing the distinguished tradition of U.S. military protection of cultural heritage, best known through the Monuments Men of World War II. Belatedly, so is his commander in chief.\\n\\nEsper might also have kept himself and Trump out of jail if the president had not walked back his tweets (I like to obey the law, Trump said Tuesday).\\n\\nWhile international protocols, notably the Geneva Conventions (signed in 1949 and amended in 1977) outlawed attacks on historic monuments, works of art or places of worship, this had not been put into practice until 2017, when Ahmad al-Faqi al-Mahdi was convicted of destroying cultural heritage as a war crime for his desecration of historic sites in Timbuktu. Al-Mahdi still has seven years left of his jail sentence imposed by the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands.\\n\\nUnlike Trump, then-Gen. Dwight Eisenhower recognized the universality of cultural heritage and urged his commanders to protect it in 1944: Shortly, we will be fighting our way across the Continent of Europe in battles designed to preserve our civilization. Inevitably, in the path of our advance will be found historical monuments and cultural centers which symbolize to the world all we are fighting to preserve. It is the responsibility of every commander to protect and respect these symbols whenever possible.\\n\\nTrump should be more like Ike\\n\\nEisenhower made it clear that protecting lives took precedence over monuments, but he also understood the importance of the cultural heritage of Italy and Germany to their people and to the world.\\n\\nBy contrast, in the Iraq invasion in 2003, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signaled a disrespect that may have sown the seeds of today's resentment toward the American presence: First, in planning the invasion, Rumsfeld dismissed information on the locations of cultural sites offered by delegations of archaeologists and other experts that had been passed up the chain of command to his office. In the aftermath, former Iraqi National Museum Director Donny George was unable to persuade American troops to protect the museum because they had no orders to do so. Yet, while the unguarded National Museum and Archives were looted of priceless treasures and irreplaceable documents, the oil ministry was protected by dozens of tanks — sending an unmistakable message about U.S. priorities.\\n\\nAny notion that America would express regret for neglecting to secure the sites of Iraqi (and global) heritage disappeared with Rumsfeld's infamous comment about the widespread looting. Stuff happens! he said at a news conference on April 11, 2003. As if that weren't enough, he went on to deride Iraq's cultural heritage, including the Uruk vase from 3,000 B.C., one of the seminal objects of human civilization (looted but later recovered).\\n\\nThe images you are seeing on television you are seeing over, and over, and over, and it's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 20 times, and you think, 'My goodness, were there that many vases? Is it possible that there were that many vases in the whole country?'  Rumsfeld said to laughter from the press corps.\\n\\nMore:Trump's threats against Iranian cultural sites may unite Iran more than Suleimani's death\\n\\nLater, the U.S. military recognized the importance of respecting and preserving Iraq's cultural heritage, and established comprehensive training programs to prevent blunders such as establishing the military installation Camp Alpha atop the ruins of Babylon.\\n\\nThey destroyed the whole country, commented the head of the Babylon museum about U.S. forces in Iraq. So what are a few old bricks and mud walls in comparison?\\n\\nMilitary and civilian personnel now serving in conflict zones from Iraq and Afghanistan to West Africa have been instructed in the hows and whys of respecting and preserving cultural heritage by organizations such as the U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield and the Smithsonian Institution.\\n\\nPioneering military archaeologist Laurie Rush developed the ingenious program of distributing decks of cards with information about cultural heritage in Iraq and Afghanistan to enlisted men and women serving there.\\n\\nArchaeologist Laura Tedesco has served for a decade in the State Department as a cultural heritage specialist. She began her tenure at the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, where she was hired in response to a State Department inspector general report. Imagine that. The analysis concluded that cultural preservation was so important, the embassy needed an archaeologist.\\n\\nUse heritage to undermine regime\\n\\nWhen in 2011 he announced U.S. support for a new National Museum in Kabul, then- Ambassador to Afghanistan Karl Eikenberry, previous commander of U.S. forces in the country, spoke of cultural heritage as critical to rebuilding Afghan national identity and a peaceful civil society, and as foundational to the social reconciliation process.\\n\\nMy Afghan translator brought his words to life when he accompanied me on a tour of the museum. The visit, his first, transformed his image of his country.\\n\\nI never knew Afghanistan was such an important historic and cultural center in Asia, and I didn't realize Afghanistan was once a Buddhist country,  he said after we left the museum.\\n\\nOf course, he knew the Taliban had destroyed the Bamiyan Buddhas, but it is not the same as recognizing that his country once was Buddhist and had an illustrious, pluralistic history far different from the Taliban's fundamentalist Islamic straitjacket.\\n\\nAll the worst traits: Trump crisis mismanagement on full display with roll of dice on Iran, Iraq and Suleimani\\n\\nBecause of its capacity to shape identity and inspire pride and unity, cultural heritage — in Iraq, Afghanistan, Mali and elsewhere — is a powerful weapon against violent extremism. Eisenhower recognized this, and today, so do jihadists. That is why they destroy cultural heritage sites from Mosul to Palmyra to Timbuktu.\\n\\nFrom Persepolis to the Cyrus Cylinder, Iran's cultural heritage could play a moderating and unifying role if regime change, for which thousands of protesters have risked their lives, ever comes about.\\n\\nExtremists get why culture matters. Why did it take a prompt from his Defense secretary for Trump to get it? Instead of aping extremists in wanting to destroy culture, why doesn't the president undermine the fundamentalist Iranian regime by praising Persian cultural heritage?\\n\\nCynthia P. Schneider, a professor in the practice of diplomacy at Georgetown University, served as U.S. ambassador to the Netherlands from 1998-2001.

The majority of athletes feel it is very important that we respect each other as athletes.\\n\\nOlympic leaders have long sought to keep political displays out of the international competition. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter, which serves as the foundational rulebook for the Games, prohibits athletes from any kind of demonstration or political, religious or racial propaganda.\\n\\nBut the three-page document published Thursday by the IOC sought to provide more detail and nuance to that long-standing rule. It specified the locations where protests will not be allowed, including the field of play, the Olympic Village and during medal ceremonies and opening and closing ceremonies.\\n\\nIt also outlined times that athletes will be allowed to express political views: In press conferences, at team meetings or on digital media platforms.\\n\\nIt should be noted that expressing views is different from protests and demonstrations, the guidelines say.\\n\\nThe IOC added that disciplinary action for any breaches of Rule 50 in Tokyo will be taken on a case-by-case basis as necessary, in consultation with the athlete's national Olympic committee and the relevant international federation.\\n\\nThursday's guidelines come a little more than a week after IOC president Thomas Bach, in a written New Year's message, went out of his way to stress the importance of keeping politics out of sports.\\n\\nWe stand firmly against the growing politicisation of sport because only in this way can we accomplish our mission to unite the world in peaceful competition, Bach wrote.\\n\\nSome, however, have argued that the Olympic movement has already politicized sports. Global Athlete, which describes itself as an athlete-led movement whose aim is to inspire and lead positive change in world sport, pointed to the IOC's promotion of a unified South and North Korean team at the 2018 Winter Games in Pyeongchang as one specific example.\\n\\nThis ship has sailed, Global Athlete said in a statement. The IOC has already politicized sport.\\n\\nThe IOC's guidelines come roughly five months after two American athletes were put on probation by the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee for protesting during medal ceremonies at the Pan American Games. Fencer Race Imboden kneeled, and hammer thrower Gwen Berry raised a fist.\\n\\nThe most famous Olympic protest by American athletes, of course, came at the 1968 Games in Mexico City, when sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised their fists on the medal stand.\\n\\nThe Tokyo Games are now less than 200 days away, with the opening ceremony slated for July 24.\\n\\nContributing: The Associated Press\\n\\nContact Tom Schad at tschad@usatoday.com or on Twitter @Tom_Schad."}
{"original": "How does a person dine out without encountering hosts, servers or chefs?\\n\\nIt's an impossible question. The hospitality industry is, at its core, hospitable. A friendly smile is shrouded behind a mask. A handshake is impossible from 6 feet apart. Pulling out a chair, handing over a menu, pouring a drink and plating a meal all require the thing we were emphatically told not to do this year: be in close contact with others.\\n\\nBut in 2020, we still tried to dine out. Boy, did we try. (And the hundreds of thousands of people who rely on the restaurant industry for employment thank us for that.)\\n\\nTents, igloos, picnics, plexiglass, indoor nooks and outdoor greenhouses – restaurants tried dozens of creative ways to give diners a semblance of safety.\\n\\nBut were these methods safe enough?\\n\\nIt's a spectrum, said Dr. Henry F. Raymond, associate professor and epidemiologist at the Rutgers School of Public Health. The best place to dine is at home in your bubble. The next best place is at a picnic with your bubble in a wide-open space.\\n\\nSo our early months of contactless delivery placed on doorsteps and drive-by pickup orders chucked into open trunks were likely the safest.\\n\\nThough, Raymond admits, we have precious little data to determine the safest way to dine out. More extensive contact tracing would lead to more precise data on how disease spreads. But, as of now, scientists have little research on how and if COVID-19 cases spread in restaurants, Raymond said.\\n\\nWhat we do know, he said, is that COVID-19 spreads mainly through large respiratory droplets that are expelled when people sneeze or cough. The more airflow to move those droplets away, the better.\\n\\nFood trends:20 ways restaurants, dining out will change in 2021\\n\\n'What's a heater gonna do when it's 30 degrees':Restaurants face bleak winter during COVID-19\\n\\nAnd outside, there's plenty of airflow. In early summer, states began allowing outdoor dining. Entrepreneurial minds got to work.\\n\\nIn New Jersey, municipalities including Hoboken, Ridgewood, Rutherford, Montclair, Hawthorne, Summit and Millburn closed off swaths of streets, opening them up for outdoor dining. Rows of tables shaded by umbrellas were placed on sidewalks and in parklets. Suddenly, downtowns started to look a lot more European.\\n\\nOther restaurants converted parking lots into dining spaces. Some simply propped up a white tent and threw some durable tables and chairs underneath. Others brought the comforts of indoor dining outdoors.\\n\\nElia, a fine Mediterranean restaurant in East Rutherford, New Jersey, filled its billowing white tents with cream-colored couches, dainty chandeliers and terra-cotta pots sprouting banana leaves and palms.\\n\\nOur clients that come in love the indoor space, that Greek atmosphere, the feel of being on the island and lounging on the couches, said owner Anna Rosati. So she re-created that outside.\\n\\nAcclaimed restaurant Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, New York – which specializes in meticulous fine dining and ultra-local ingredients sourced by chef Dan Barber – had its own solution to serving outdoors during a pandemic: picnic baskets. Guests could choose from what was fresh and available at Blue Hill that day to go in their baskets: waxed beans, mahi-mahi tartare, a crusty loaf of bread and more to be eaten on Blue Hill's patio.\\n\\nThe baskets were very much following what the restaurant has been doing for years, said director of operations Philippe Gouze. Basically, serving what the farmers have for us.\\n\\nWhat wasn't in the basket – grilled meats, dishes that needed to be served hot or frozen – was served to diners on a wooden pizza peel while the server stood a few feet away. Blue Hill stopped offering picnic baskets only a few weeks ago, when the weather got too cold.\\n\\nThere's so much beauty in outdoor dining, Gouze said. That was the lesson for us. Whatever happens in the future, we're not going to be as snooty about how we serve.\\n\\nAt the end of summer, the igloos came.\\n\\nThese clear domes that sheltered a single group during their meal popped up outside Germantown Garden Grill in Philadelphia. And in New Jersey at Blossom in Palisades Park, Congress Hall in Cape May, Fig and Lily Garden in Morristown, El Tango Argentina Grill in Moonachie and more.\\n\\nIgloos became a solution for chilly autumn and early winter days. The clear plastic trapped in heat from the sun, and some restaurants installed electric heaters inside the domes as well.\\n\\nStory continues below the gallery\\n\\nAsbury Festhalle & Biergarten in Asbury Park, New Jersey, has been installing igloos on its rooftop bar area for five years. Usually, they're just a way for customers to drink and dine outside during the winter (their bubbles are warmed with electric heaters). This year, they guarded against germs, as well.\\n\\nThe single-party igloo is a pretty safe option, Raymond said, if it's being cleaned in between and aired out.\\n\\nAccording to Asbury Festhalle & Biergarten general manager Nick Falco, after each reservation, the staff uses an aerosol-based disinfectant on the PVC cover and disinfects with hospital-grade hydrogen peroxide. The igloos are aired out for at least 15 minutes before a new party is seated.\\n\\nThey've always been popular, Falco said. Everyone wants those 5 to 8 p.m. reservations on Fridays and Saturdays.\\n\\nRestaurants without igloos had to rely on heating lamps and firepits to provide warmth to outdoor diners. Some spots offered blankets to ward off the cold.\\n\\nWe gave out blankets pre-COVID, said Andrew Tyler, general manager of The Hill in Closter, New Jersey. I have about 20 blankets, so during COVID, I only offered them 20 times, one use per blanket. After that, they haven't been used.\\n\\nInstead, handy firepits were the key to comfort at the ritzy restaurant's outdoor tables.\\n\\nThe year in food:Online delivery changed how we eat in 2020\\n\\nMore:Barstool Sports founder donates money to help New Jersey restaurant\\n\\nPaul Vagianos, owner of It's Greek to Me in Ridgewood, New Jersey, put his own spin on outdoor dining by constructing greenhouses warmed with electric wall heaters and decorated with string lights and wreaths.\\n\\nWe have to stay ahead of the curve. The regular business model doesn't work, Vagianos said.\\n\\nBetween groups, the greenhouses are disinfected and aired out with a sanitary air blower. The 6-foot-by-6-foot structures stay nice and toasty, fit perfectly on the sidewalk and have room for a four-person table.\\n\\nI want everyone in Ridgewood to use these, he said. We could have a Christmas village all winter long. Without innovation, all you've got is takeout.\\n\\nAs states began allowing indoor dining, that innovation moved indoors. Arrows were taped on floors to direct the flow of traffic. Plexiglass barriers were installed between tables. Air filtration systems were purchased. Windows were left open to increase airflow. Tables were spaced 6 feet apart and dining capacity was reduced.\\n\\nIn Philadelphia, Jose Garces' The Olde Bar constructed nooks inside its library-themed room. Fourteen dining nooks shielded by two solid walls were built in the seafood restaurant, known for its iconic snapper soup. QR codes were placed inside books at each table in lieu of menus. Vintage lamps, rows of classic books and quirky works of art jazzed up the redesigned space. (The city has since shut down all indoor dining through January.)\\n\\nThere are likely still stones left unturned – ways to revolutionize restaurant dining to make it as contact-free as possible while retaining some semblance of hospitality. But with every evolution of dining we saw in 2020, truly contactless dining is still impossible. As is supporting local businesses without introducing risk into your life. As is keeping a restaurant open with a fraction of the customers and staff. As is supporting one of the country's largest industries without adequate assistance.\\n\\nAs we enter a new, hopefully, kinder, year, Raymond compares the restaurant industries' efforts in 2020 to airport security.\\n\\nDoes taking off our shoes at the airport really help us? So much of what TSA does is theater based on some educated guesses, he said. The situation with restaurants is similar. We can do the best we can do – but it's hard to figure out how much is keeping us safe and how much is just making us feel better.\\n\\nRebecca King is a food writer for NorthJersey.com."}
{"original": "Charisse Jones\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nThe new year is expected to bring the highest gasoline prices since 2014, with the possibility that U.S. drivers could be collectively shelling out $52 billion more at the pump than they did in 2016, according to one prominent price tracker.\\n\\nThe average cost for regular, unleaded gas is expected to spike to $2.49 per gallon this year, up from $2.13 in 2016. That significant uptick is in marked contrast to the steady price drops consumers have mostly seen over the past four years.\\n\\nThe era of falling prices from year to year is likely to be over,'' says Patrick DeHaan, GasBuddy's senior petroleum analyst.\\n\\nInstead, U.S. drivers are projected to spend $354.6 billion on gas this year, a jump from the $302.5 billion doled out in 2016. While a potentially stronger jobs picture may make a steeper gas tab a bit less painful to individual consumers, it could take a toll on the overall economy.\\n\\nThe national average for a price of a gallon of regular gas on Tuesday was $2.347 a gallon, up from $1.992 a gallon a year ago, AAA's Fuel Gauge Report shows.\\n\\nThis is removing $52 billion in one year's time from motorists' wallets,'' says DeHaan. Some motorists have been saving and putting into the bank whatever they're not spending on fuel. And ... it may be an expense that creeps up on them and causes them to cut back in other areas.''\\n\\nThe key reason for the price increases is the November decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to pare back oil production, and the group's subsequent success in convincing Russia and several other major oil producers to do the same. On Tuesday, a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude closed at $52.49, down $1.24 a barrel or 2.31%.\\n\\nJust two years ago, gas prices plunged after OPEC's announcement that it would produce as much crude oil as it could. The attitude change in 2014 opened the door to cheap gas,'' DeHaan said, and the meeting this past November is shutting the door.''\\n\\nA cross country drive may be most expensive in May, with the average gas price projected to peak at $2.67 a gallon nationally, while February is expected to feature an average price of $2.32 per gallon, the lowest of the year.\\n\\nTed Evanoff: Say goodbye to $1.75 gas\\n\\nThose are the traditional months when drivers see highs and lows at the pump, with refineries often offering discounts to gas stations in February to drain their remaining winter gasoline supplies, while prices surge in the spring when refineries do maintenance and switch over to summer gas formulas that can be more expensive.\\n\\nWarm-season gasoline is also a primary reason why motorists in some major cities may see particularly steep price increases. For instance, Los Angeles, Chicago and New York are among the areas that have different formulations, a prime example of the logistical challenges that add to the prices we pay every spring,'' says DeHaan.\\n\\nStill, higher oil prices may get dormant oil drillers in the U.S. back to work, and that would create a ceiling to how high oil prices can go, keeping them from soaring to the $3.34 a gallon that was the national average in 2014, DeHaan says."}
{"original": "CLEVELAND — Of course, the Browns' 18-year wait would be excruciating in its final eight days, in its final three hours, in its final three minutes.\\n\\nOf course, wrapping up their first playoff berth since 2002 would require players reaching into their wells of toughness and resilience that the challenges of COVID-19 might have seemingly dried up.\\n\\nBut a day long anticipated, surpassed in the dreams of Browns fans and current and former players only by a Super Bowl parade, finally arrived Sunday.\\n\\nMidway through the third quarter, the Browns shook off their lethargy — or was it their fear? — and hung on by the nubs of their nails for a 24-22 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers at FirstEnergy Stadium.\\n\\nMore:Giants knock out Cowboys to stay alive in NFC East as questionable decisions doom Dallas\\n\\nMore:NFL playoff picture in Week 17: Field taking shape as Ravens, Browns clinch wild-card berths\\n\\nThe Browns are back in the postseason and one could almost hear Kelly Holcomb and Tim Couch, Derek Anderson and Brady Quinn, Dennis Northcutt and Kevin Johnson cheering from their couches.\\n\\nThe result sets up a rematch between the sixth-seeded Browns and the third-seeded Steelers (12-4) next weekend in Heinz Field.\\n\\nI'm very happy for Northeast Ohio, for Browns fans all over the world, Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said afterward on Zoom. They are not far from our minds when we win. The 12,000 strong, they got to see it live. We know that many people around the country and the world are watching and we feel their support. We are in the dance, but I feel we have a lot of work to do this week and we want to keep this thing going.\\n\\nBefore kickoff, Eric Metcalf tweeted he felt like he was about to play, juices are flowing!!! Now-Florida International coach Butch Davis, who directed the Browns in their last postseason appearance, sent his well-wishes via social media to some of the most loyal and great fans in sports!!!\\n\\nThis wasn't just the Browns' biggest game since 2002, when they defeated the Atlanta Falcons in the regular-season finale to clinch a playoff berth, then suffered a 36-33 wild-card loss to the Steelers. Arguably this was the franchise's biggest day since the 1980s, when Bernie Kosar was throwing to Reggie Langhorne, Webster Slaughter and Brian Brennan.\\n\\nThat's how long it's been since the Browns maintained a level of respectability they cemented Sunday by completing an 11-5 regular season. There have been years of futility since 1999, 10 general managers (counting Davis in a dual role), 10 full-time head coaches and two more interim coaches. Now comes the hope of competency and professionalism and sound, calm judgments from the triumvirate of Kevin Stefanski, General Manager Andrew Berry and Chief Strategy Officer Paul DePodesta.\\n\\nThe culture change is no longer a goal, but a reality.\\n\\nAsked how that happened, left guard Joel Bitonio, the longest-tenured Brown along with long snapper Charley Hughlett, gave multiple reasons.\\n\\nHonestly, just the top-down structure, everybody's pulling in the same direction, Bitonio said afterward on Zoom. Coach Stefanski does a good job of taking it one day at a time, one week at a time. Playing for each other. We set a standard and win, lose or draw, if you don't play to a standard, there's corrections to be made, things to be done to benefit the team and we're all trying to work to those goals. We have the talent now. Now it's just about execution and we've done enough this year to get into the playoffs.\\n\\nThe feeling that the Browns were building something special was there in 2002, when Davis put together a talented roster despite some questionable decisions in the 2001 and '02 drafts. Defensive tackle Gerard Warren at No. 3 over future Hall of Fame running back LaDainian Tomlinson at No. 5 in 2001? Running back William Green at No. 16 over future Hall of Fame safety Ed Reed, whom Davis coached at the University of Miami, at No. 24 in 2002?\\n\\nBut in February 2003, Davis got rid of five veterans — center Dave Wohlabaugh, linebackers Dwayne Rudd, Jamir Miller and Earl Holmes and cornerback Corey Fuller. They came under the guise of cost-cutting, but smacked more of ego.\\n\\nDavis stepped down in 2004 after a panic attack, and the franchise has been in panic mode ever since. The questionable hires since owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam took over in 2012 made a mockery of continuity and front office leadership.\\n\\nIt now appears the days of dysfunction are over. Although the road to respectability turned out to be a mirage in 2002, this seems different. It feels like Stefanski and Berry have formed the type of partnership that can succeed for years to come.\\n\\nBrowns receiver Jarvis Landry, acquired in a March 2018 trade with Miami, gets that sense.\\n\\nIt felt good. This is a special time for this organization, for these guys that come here and work day in and day out, but we have more to do, Landry said.\\n\\nHeaded to his car to call injured Browns star receiver Odell Beckham Jr., Landry said he would most remember the look on the faces of those who endured so many painful days and seasons to get to this point.\\n\\nThe moment that was the most special to me was seeing the smile on JC Tretter's face, Myles Garrett, Joel Bitonio, Jimmy [Haslam]. Seeing those smiles throughout these hard times that have been here in Cleveland, Landry said.\\n\\nThis season, moments to savor have come with more regularity.\\n\\nBeckham's scream-inducing 50-yard touchdown run during his three-score day at Dallas. Safety Ronnie Harrison's 47-yard pick-six against the Indianapolis Colts, when the Browns survived without Pro Bowl running back Nick Chubb. Chubb and running back Kareem Hunt both going over 100 yards in Chubb's first game back from a knee injury against the Houston Texans. A thrilling 41-35 victory at Tennessee when Baker Mayfield threw for 334 yards and four touchdowns.\\n\\nThen the best of all, the COVID-19 depleted Browns turning back the Steelers, who rested quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, center Maurkice Pouncey and defensive stars T.J. Watt and Cameron Heyward. The victory wasn't assured until tight end Stephen Carlson recovered a Steelers onside kick, grabbing the ball between his legs, and Mayfield rushed for a 3-yard gain and a first down.\\n\\nHere We Go Again! played over the stadium's loudspeakers in a throwback to past glory and fans took selfies in the stands, hesitant to leave.\\n\\nIt's now time to forget about Dwayne Rudd's helmet toss and Bottlegate, about Johnny Manziel's swan and Josh Gordon's missteps, about a coach or GM being fired hours after the season finale almost every year. It's time to burn that jersey bearing the names of the 30 Browns starting quarterbacks since 1999.\\n\\nAll of that may make what happened Sunday sweeter.\\n\\nNow it's time to embrace joy. It's time to embrace the hope of a promising, more stable future. This time it feels real."}

{"original": "On the eve of key Senate runoffs, a Georgia election official accused President Donald Trump's legal team of intentionally misleading voters about voter fraud and said the president persists despite evidence to the contrary.\\n\\nGabriel Sterling, Georgia voting system implementation manager, explained to reporters Monday how voting was secured during the Nov. 3 election and detailedhow the complaints from Trump and his allies were wrong. He specifically explained how Trump's legal team inaccurately described a video of vote counting in Fulton County, which he said was observed by representatives from each party and by reporters.\\n\\nThe president's legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and then –from our point of view – intentionally misled the state Senate, the voters and the people of the United States about this, Sterling said. It was intentional, it was obvious, and anybody watching this knows that.\\n\\nThe accusations are crucial because Georgia has two Senate runoff elections ending Tuesday that will determine which party controls the chamber. Trump and President-elect Joe Biden each were traveling to Georgia on Monday to campaign for their candidates.\\n\\nSterling explained how officials investigated complaints from the Nov. 3 election that alleged that thousands of ineligible voters including felons, underaged voters or people from other states, had cast ballots. But he said the outstanding complaints number in the dozens rather than the tens of thousands that Trump's team alleges.\\n\\nNone of that is true, not a whit, Sterling said of an accusation that pieces of voting machines were removed and replaced. This is all obviously, easily, provably false. Yet the president persists and, by doing so, undermines Georgians' faith in the election system, especially Republican Georgians in this case, which is important because we have a big election coming up tomorrow, and everybody deserves to have their vote counted if they want it to be.\\n\\nA reporter asked Sterling whether he considered Trump's call Saturday an attack on democracy, when the president asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find votes for Trump to win against President-elect Joe Biden.\\n\\nI personally found it to be something that was not normal, out of place, Sterling said. Nobody I know who would be president would do something like that to a secretary of state.\\n\\nBiden won the state by a margin of 11,779 votes, or 0.24%, of the roughly 5 million ballots cast, according to the results Georgia certified.\\n\\nGeorgia officials tallied votes for the presidential election three times, including in an audit required by state law and a recount requested by the president. Each count determined that Biden won the state, the first Democrat to do so since 1992.\\n\\nBut during a call Saturday, Trump asked Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to alter the result of the election. Trump added that the people of Georgia are angry and that there would be nothing wrong with admitting that you've recalculated.\\n\\nI just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state, Trump said.\\n\\nTrump blamed his loss in Georgia on widespread voter fraud. But the Justice Department found no evidence of fraud that would change the outcome of November's election.\\n\\nRaffensperger, a fellow Republican, told Trump that he was wrong.\\n\\nRespectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true. The truth will come out, Raffensperger said.\\n\\nSterling said Raffensperger recorded the phone call out of an abundance of caution, noting the political situation and Trump's history of sometimes not necessarily characterizing things as they actually occurred.\\n\\nCongress is scheduled to count Electoral College votes Wednesday that will determine Biden the winner. Based on state-certified results, Biden got 306 Electoral College votes to Trump's 232.\\n\\nTrump and Biden each were traveling Monday to Georgia, to campaign for candidates in runoff that will determine control of the U.S. Senate. Voting ends Tuesday.\\n\\nTrump supports Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and former Sen. David Perdue, whose term expired Sunday with the start of a new Congress.

{"original": "Don Williams\\n\\nLubbock Avalanche-Journal\\n\\nLUBBOCK, Texas — Texas Tech's football coaching staff turnover between the 2018 and 2019 seasons will wind up costing its athletics department nearly $6.6 million.\\n\\nAlmost two-thirds of that amount are payments to cover the contract buyout of Kliff Kingsbury, fired after the 2018 season, but Tech also made payments to 16 other former staff members after the coaching change.\\n\\nDefensive coordinator David Gibbs, offensive coordinator Kevin Johns and co-offensive coordinator Clay McGuire, all of whom lost their jobs with Kingsbury's dismissals, continued to receive monthly payments from Tech throughout 2019 while they coached elsewhere.\\n\\nIt's something that was budgeted for, so prepared for, Tech senior associate athletics director Robert Giovannetti said. It's part of the business, right? You understand it's a part of the business and you chalk that up to cost of doing business and don't let it affect the way you run your operation.\\n\\nTech provided the detailed breakdown to A-J Media this week, days after the Jan. 5 due date on Kingsbury's buyout amount for 2019. Giovannetti said that payment of $1.95 million, less applicable taxes and withholding, recently was deposited into Kingsbury's account.\\n\\nGiovannetti said the buyouts due multiple former staff members are taken from athletics department reserves and factored into the annual operating budget. The cost of the coaching transition is $2.289 million in fiscal year 2019, $2.24 million in fiscal year 2020 and $2.05 million in fiscal year 2021.\\n\\nTech's athletics budget for the current fiscal year is $93.6 million.\\n\\nUltimately, Kingsbury will receive $4,283,807 in severance pay. Tech paid him $283,807 in January 2019 for the uncompleted year of his contract after his dismissal. The last two years of his contract contained 50 percent guaranteed money in the event of his being fired without cause, as happened.\\n\\nThe $1.95 million was half the $3.9 million he would have made for coaching Tech in 2019, and he is due $2.05 million in January 2021, half the $4.1 million he was to make for coaching the Red Raiders in 2020.\\n\\nAfter being let go by Tech, Kingsbury briefly worked last winter as offensive coordinator at Southern California, but then was hired as head coach by the Arizona Cardinals. He just finished his first year with the NFL team, which improved from 3-13 in 2018 to 5-10-1 this season.\\n\\nTech fired Kingsbury on Nov. 25, 2018, and hired Matt Wells four days later. Subsequent to that, it continued to pay nine of Kingsbury's 10 on-field assistants, his strength and conditioning staff, chief of staff and director of player development.\\n\\nIt finished paying most in January or February, but three former assistants remained on the payroll throughout 2019. Tech paid Gibbs $429,557, Johns $216,071 and McGuire $118,750.\\n\\nDuring the 2019 season, Gibbs was defensive backs coach at Missouri, Johns was offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Memphis, and McGuire was offensive line coach at Texas State.\\n\\nSeveral assistants had clauses in their contracts reducing Tech's obligation by the difference between what they were guaranteed by Tech and what they were paid in subsequent jobs. In that way, Tech saved $1.57 million on nine of the former assistants.\\n\\nKingsbury's contract did not have such a clause, meaning Tech is obligated to pay him the full buyout regardless of his subsequent earnings from USC and the Arizona Cardinals.\\n\\nIn addition to paying former staff members, Tech also paid Wells and current assistants Mark Tommerdahl and DeAndre Smith a total of $887,429 so they could make buyouts to their former schools in the process of joining the Red Raiders.\\n\\nTexas Tech coaching transition\\n\\nA financial breakdown of Texas Tech's payments related to the football coaching staff transition between the 2018 and 2019 seasons:\\n\\nObligations paid\\n\\nHead coach\\n\\nKliff Kingsbury $2,233,807\\n\\nPayments: $283,807 in February, $1,950,000 in January 2020\\n\\nAssistant coaches\\n\\nDavid Gibbs $429,557 (paid all year)\\n\\nKevin Johns $216,071 (paid all year)\\n\\nClay McGuire $118,750 (paid all year)\\n\\nAdam Scheier $82,341 (last paid in March)\\n\\nClay Jennings $44,841 (last paid in February)\\n\\nTerrance Jamison $40,000 (last paid in December 2018)\\n\\nBrett Dewhurst $21,506 (last paid in January 2019)\\n\\nBrandon Jones $6,448 (last paid in December 2018)\\n\\nEmmett Jones $3,968 (last paid in December 2018)\\n\\nTotal: $963,482\\n\\nChief of staff\\n\\nKenny Bell $30,246 (last paid in January 2019)\\n\\nDirector of player development\\n\\nManny Ramirez $24,603 (last paid in February)\\n\\nStrength and conditioning staff\\n\\nRusty Whitt $22,395 (last paid in January 2019)\\n\\nAdam Hymel $19,762 (last paid in February)\\n\\nJeffery Earls $13,914 (last paid in February)\\n\\nDwain Bradshaw $11,706 (last paid in February)\\n\\nScott Salwasser $10,889 (last paid in January 2019)\\n\\nRemaining obligations\\n\\nHead coach\\n\\nKliff Kingsbury $2,050,000 (due by Jan. 5, 2021)\\n\\nTotal contractual to former staff: $5,380,806\\n\\nIncoming staff related to transition\\n\\nEstimated moving expenses for new staff: $310,200\\n\\nBuyouts for coaches Matt Wells, Mark Tommerdahl and DeAndre Smith: $887,429\\n\\nTotal: $1,197,629\\n\\nBreakdown by fiscal year\\n\\nFiscal year 2019: $2,288,628\\n\\nFiscal year 2020: $2,239,808\\n\\nFiscal year 2021: $2,050,000\\n\\nGrand total: $6,578,435\\n\\nAmounts saved by contract mitigation\\n\\nBrandon Jones $371,429\\n\\nDavid Gibbs $328,776\\n\\nZac Spavital $325,556\\n\\nKevin Johns $227,262\\n\\nClay McGuire $207,917\\n\\nEmmett Jones $46,032\\n\\nTerrance Jamison $42,341\\n\\nClay Jennings $16,667\\n\\nBrett Dewhurst $2,899\\n\\nTotal: $1,568,877"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Flexibility and a willingness to change are traits generally associated with youth.\\n\\nThere lies the true greatness of Nick Saban.\\n\\nAt 67 — an age when retirement plans are formed, a comfortable routine firmly established — the Alabama coach has undergone a remarkable transformation this season, one that has taken the Crimson Tide to the cusp of another national title.\\n\\nStep aside, Defensive Genius.\\n\\nMake room for Mr. Offense.\\n\\nIt's hard to overstate the astonishment that comes from watching a Saban-coached team scampering up and down the field like it just came into possession of Steve Spurrier's Fun 'n' Gun playbook, seemingly as content to win a high-scoring shootout as it is a defensive standoff.\\n\\nAlabama has surrendered more than 20 points on six occasions, including its come-from-behind victory over Georgia in the Southeastern Conference championship game (35-28) and the Orange Bowl track meet with Oklahoma in the playoff semifinals (45-34).\\n\\nNot to worry. Blessed with the most dynamic quarterback of his coaching career, Saban adapted to today's high-octane offensive world with the ease of a chameleon switching colors. After winning so many games with a stifling defense complemented by a punishing ground game and just enough passes, the Tide (14-0) has been pumping out point totals more suited to the basketball court.\\n\\nAlabama hung 65 points on Arkansas, 62 on Ole Miss. Five other times, the Tide raced into the 50s, going into Monday night's championship showdown against perennial opponent Clemson with an eye-popping average of 47.7 points a gane.\\n\\nSaban knew he had something special in Tua Tagovailoa, especially after he came off the bench to rally Alabama to a memorable overtime victory over Georgia in last year's national title game.\\n\\nThe coach wasn't about to waste a talent of that magnitude.\\n\\nI think Coach Saban has helped us a lot by allowing us to do what we want to on the offensive side and not worrying too much about it, Tagovailoa said Saturday. Just letting us kind of do what we want.\\n\\nIt seems like a lifetime ago that Saban won the first of five national titles as Alabama's coach with Greg McElroy as his quarterback, a guy whose primary job was to hand off to Mark Ingram, avoid any silly mistakes and put the game largely in the hands of a monstrous defense that featured four first-round NFL draft picks-to-be among its starting 11.\\n\\nMcElroy threw 17 touchdown passes during Alabama's perfect season in 2009.\\n\\nTagovailoa surpassed that total by the sixth week of 2018. He comes into the title game with 41 TDs.\\n\\nEven Tagovailoa seems a bit surprised by Saban's embrace of a wide-open, spread-style offense.\\n\\nI came in just wanting to do whatever they were doing and whatever was going to help the team become successful, the sophomore QB said. I would have never been able to tell that they were going to change the offense up a little bit and run it the way we are.\\n\\nRemember, too, it was only a year ago that Saban infamously chewed out then-offensive coordinator Brian Daboll on the sideline during the Sugar Bowl semifinal against Clemson. With the Tide comfortably ahead 24-6 early in the fourth quarter — and the Tigers doing nothing offensively — Saban wanted his team to run the ball, and the clock.\\n\\nInstead, Daboll called a couple of passing plays, neither of which was successful. After Alabama was forced to punt, Saban tore into his coordinator for the whole world to see.\\n\\nMake no mistake, the D in Saban's DNA will always stand for defense.\\n\\nEven when relegated to a supporting role, his team still ranks among the national leaders in most major defensive categories.\\n\\nI do probably spend more time with the defense than other parts of our team, Saban said during media day. I do try to help coach the secondary. I think now when you're playing five and six defensive backs, sometimes the secondary coach needs a little help, so I kind of always classify myself as his (graduate assistant) in terms of maybe taking guys at a certain time in practice and trying to help their development.\\n\\nBut, of course, he's always watching that other side of the line, too.\\n\\nBack in the late 1980s, while serving as secondary coach for the NFL's Houston Oilers, Saban went against that team's run-and-shoot offense in practice. It was perhaps his first exposure to where the game was going offensively.\\n\\nIt probably was the start, the advent of maybe the spread in general, Saban said. But it's developed so much through the years that there's not even a lot of similarities left in how you have to defend, what you have to do, and the kind of patterns that people run, what they do from it, the multiples that they have. The rules have changed relative to RPOs (run-pass options), blocking downfield on passes behind the line of scrimmage. I think those things have really made a huge impact on how people play offense, so it's created a lot of adjustments and adaptability on defense.\\n\\nAdjustments and adaptability.\\n\\nThose traits are right up Saban's alley.\\n\\nI'm always looking ahead, he said. I'm always sort of focused on the next challenge. Don't really look back much. Always have the goal to try to get the team that we have now, the players that we have now, to play and be the best people they can be, the students they can be, the players they can be, to try to help them be successful.\\n\\nIn the end, that's what makes Nick Saban the greatest coach ever to strut a college sideline.\\n\\nThat's what makes him timeless.\\n\\n___\\n\\nPaul Newberry is a sports columnist for The Associated Press.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nCINCINNATI (AP) — The Bengals resolved their biggest offseason question when they gave coach Marvin Lewis a two-year extension through 2019 on Tuesday, providing him yet another chance — a 16th, actually — to try to get a playoff win.\\n\\nThere are a lot of issues to work through before they can even think in those terms.\\n\\nThe contract extension came after two days of discussions between Lewis and owner Mike Brown about how the franchise has to change.\\n\\nIt's unclear if Brown — a traditionalist who likes to stay with the familiar, including head coaches — will cede much control to Lewis.\\n\\nLewis has been the head coach for the past 15 seasons — the second-longest active tenure in the NFL to New England's Bill Belichick — and was the key to changing Cincinnati from a down-and-out team to respectability.\\n\\nHe hasn't been able to take it to that next step — win a playoff game. Lewis is 0-7 in the playoffs, the worst coaching mark in NFL history. He wanted to make sure that he and Brown were on the same page about making changes coming off a 7-9 season that ended with their stadium half-empty.\\n\\nPlayers realized that a coaching change could ripple through everything.\\n\\nYou're going to be going with a new head coach, it could be a completely new staff ... there's just a lot of uncertainty with that, quarterback Andy Dalton said. I think that's the biggest thing is just the unknown.\\n\\nInstead, Brown decided to stay with what's familiar. And now, there are some big offseason challenges.\\n\\nWHO'S COORDINATING? Lewis' assistants are up for contract renewals, too. The biggest question is who will be the offensive coordinator next season. Dalton and the offense were best when Hue Jackson was the coordinator in 2015 — Dalton led the AFC in passer rating. Jackson went to Cleveland, and the offense became less creative and less productive under Ken Zampese, who was fired after an 0-2 start this season. Replacement Bill Lazor was confined by Zampese's system, but got more out of it. Still, the Bengals finished last in the NFL in offense for only the second time in club history. They need a coordinator who can redesign and rejuvenate the offense.\\n\\nWHAT ABOUT THE O-LINE? The Bengals knew that the offensive line was going to be a work in progress with two inexperienced tackles. It was far worse than they'd hoped, unable to protect Dalton or open holes for a running game that was the worst in club history. The offensive line is the first focus of the offseason.\\n\\nDALTON'S BACKUP: The Bengals have been fortunate at quarterback, with Dalton avoiding significant injury over his career. The one time he got hurt — a broken thumb near the end of the 2015 season — AJ McCarron took over and led the team into the playoffs, giving them a sense of comfort should Dalton go down.\\n\\nMcCarron's contract is up, and there's a dispute over whether he's a restricted free agent — which gives the club some control — or unrestricted, which means he can go wherever he wants. McCarron wants to start somewhere, and he knows that it won't be in Cincinnati. A ruling on his status will come down mid-February and set everything in motion.\\n\\nWHAT TO DO ABOUT BURFICT? The Bengals' most valuable defensive player was again one of its least dependable because of suspension, ejection and injuries.\\n\\nLinebacker Vontaze Burfict's no-holds-barred style of play got him another three-game suspension, an in-game ejection, and a series of injuries, limiting him to 10 games. He finished with only 1½ sacks. In 2016, he missed five games because of suspension and injury. He's not going to change his style of play, which means the defense is never sure how much it can count on him week to week.\\n\\nTHE FANS: Attendance dropped significantly at Paul Brown Stadium, which was half-empty for the final game. The Bengals aren't going to sell tickets until fans are convinced that significant changes are on the way. How do the Bengals get them back while bringing back Lewis?\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "Rick Steves\\n\\nSometimes in travel, the journey is the reward. And that is particularly true in Europe, where travelers can enjoy special trains, buses and boats that link destinations near and far, high and low, urban and rural, often through spectacular scenery.\\n\\nOne of my favorite journeys is called Norway in a Nutshell, a series of coordinated bus, train and ferry rides that connects the cities of Oslo and Bergen — all while weaving its way through Norway's fjord country to show off the full tapestry of its scenic grandeur.\\n\\nThe journey starts with a five-hour train ride from Oslo to a high-mountain station called Myrdal. This is simply the most spectacular train ride in northern Europe. The scenery crescendos as you climb over the crest of Norway's mountainous midlands. After a mild three hours of deep woods and lakes, you're treated at last to the glaciers and barren tundra of the Norwegian highland. At Myrdal, a super-scenic tourist train takes you down to the fjordside hamlet of Flåm, winding past waterfalls and through 20 tunnels in 55 thrilling minutes.\\n\\nFlåm is the departure point for the two-hour ferry ride on two breathtaking fjords to the village of Gudvangen. As you cruise through the world's narrowest fjord, you'll feel the mist falling from black cliffs high above, and — especially on a sunny day — the hillsides appear to be within arm's reach. From Gudvangen, a bus zips you scenically through the mountains to the town of Voss, where you'll board a train to your destination, Bergen — a less impressive but still plenty picturesque finale to the Nutshell tour.\\n\\nMore:Trains, glorious trains: Best rail photos and galleries\\n\\nIf any country rivals Norway when it comes to the marriage of amazing scenery and efficient transportation, it's Switzerland. While most train rides in Switzerland are photogenic, four are aggressively marketed as the most spectacular. Of those rail journeys, my pick is the Golden Pass.\\n\\nThis route cuts a swath diagonally across the pristine center of the country, connecting Luzern with Lake Geneva. The five-hour journey has three segments, with two transfers. Some of the trains offer panoramic cars with huge windows that curve back into the roof of the train car, allowing for views of high mountains from a wider angle.\\n\\nMy favorite part is the two-hour trip between Zweisimmen and Montreux (the final stretch, if you're coming from Luzern). Those who reserve a VIP seat in the first car enjoy an unobstructed view of pristine alpine scenery coming right at you.\\n\\nLeaving Zweisimmen, the train rolls through varied landscapes, starting in the German-speaking region before entering French Switzerland. With the change in language comes a change in culture and architecture. French-style stone houses start to replace half-timbered, woodsy, German-style chalets.\\n\\nAt one point, the train surges through Jaman Tunnel, engulfing you in nearly 2 miles of darkness. When you emerge, you're in another world, leaving the feudal Middle Ages and entering the 19th-century belle époque. The train passes through a series of sharp bends as it descends from the mountains down to Lake Geneva. Palm trees, vineyards, gardens and many resort spas indicate that you've arrived in the warmer climate of the Swiss Riviera.\\n\\nAnother scenic journey that never gets old is along Germany's Rhine River. It's storybook Germany, a fairy-tale world of legends and robber-baron castles. After 30 years of cruising the Rhine gorge on nostalgic old riverboats, I still get a thrill.\\n\\nThe Rhine flows about 750 miles north from Switzerland to Holland, but the 36-mile stretch between Mainz and Koblenz hoards all the touristic charm. The whole section can be done by boat (about five hours downstream, eight hours up). With limited time, focus on the most scenic hour — from St. Goar to Bacharach. Sit on the top deck and enjoy the parade of castles, towns, boats and vineyards.\\n\\nWhile you'll glimpse many castles along the Rhine, several are particularly notable. Marksburg Castle, the best-looking of the bunch, stands bold and white, and is restored to look like most Rhine castles once did, with their slate stonework covered with stucco to look as if they were made from a richer stone. Perched above the pleasant town of St. Goar, the mighty ruins of Rheinfels Castle, which ruled the river for more than 500 years, still exude a hint of menace. Near Bingen, Rheinstein Castle has a medieval-as-can-be, 13th-century exterior with a 19th-century duke's hunting palace inside.\\n\\nThe shipshape Pfalz Castle (built in the middle of the river in the 1300s) worked effectively to tax medieval river traffic, raising its chains when boats came, and lowering them only when merchants had paid their duty. Those who didn't pay spent time touring its prison, on a raft at the bottom of its well. Along the Rhine, it seems each castle comes with a story.\\n\\nRick Steves writes European travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio.

{"original": "Is one win at UFC 232 really enough to make Amanda Nunes the greatest of all time? Will Jon Jones' legacy suffer if he never goes up to heavyweight? And what was the UFC thinking in not re-signing Jimmy Smith as a commentator?\\n\\nThat and other pressing questions in this week's Twitter Mailbag. To ask a question of your own, tweet to @BenFowlkesMMA.\\n\\n* * * *\\n\\nWhy are we so quick to call someone the new GOAT? Cyborg is undefeated for almost a decade and a half and finally loses once and now Nunes is unquestionably the GOAT?! Will whoever beats Nunes next be the new GOAT? Please speak some sense into this — David Lautaret (@Chaelshero) January 2, 2019\\n\\nI see your point, but you've got to step back and look at the big picture here.\\n\\nAmanda Nunes didn't just beat Cris Cyborg. She also beat Ronda Rousey, Miesha Tate, Valentina Shevchenko (twice), and Germaine de Randamie, all of whom were or currently are UFC champions. If she's not the greatest, who is?\\n\\nAnd I get it, we do tend to get carried away in the immediate aftermath of a big fight, especially one with a shocking result. But Nunes was already a champion before she knocked out the most feared and dominant fighter in all of women's MMA. If you don't want to call her the greatest, fine. But then you're probably going to have to give that title to someone she's already beat.\\n\\nGranted, that's how it looks now, at this moment. A lot could change depending on what Cyborg does next. Maybe she redeems herself in a rematch. Maybe she goes on a long losing streak that makes this loss seem more like a harbinger of inevitable decline rather than a final verdict.\\n\\nBut for now, there just aren't any other options. That's because Nunes has beat them all.\\n\\nWhat fight are you most disappointed never happened? (lookin' at you, Jon Jones & Anthony Johnson) — Mike Vanlieshout (@LCMikeVan) January 2, 2019\\n\\nFeels like I'm going to out myself as an MMA old-timer here, but so what. I've got to be true to myself and admit that it's Fedor Emelianenko vs. Randy Couture, with Emelianenko vs. (pre-diverticulitis) Brock Lesnar as a close second.\\n\\nYou might have noticed a common theme in my top two choices. Yeah, it's Fedor. He was great in his time, with an aura of invincibility that typically never lasts long in the heavyweight division. But still I have to admit that we did not always see him matched up against the best the sport had to offer.\\n\\nYes, he beat former UFC heavyweight champs like Tim Sylvia and Andrei Arlovski. Yes, he beat Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira and Mark Hunt, too. He also beat Hong Man Choi and Zuluzinho, so let's not pretend like PRIDE's motivations were always pure.\\n\\nFor me, Couture vs. Emelianenko – a fight Couture tried to angle for back when he thought he could just resign as UFC heavyweight champ when he no longer liked his contract situation – will always be the one that got away.\\n\\nThey were both more or less at the height of their powers then. Stylistically, both had something different to offer the other. And it just never even got close to happening. Such is life in combat sports, I guess.\\n\\nWhat's the significance of the Dillashaw Cejudo fight for the 125 pound belt, if the UFC is closing that division? — Benny Papa (@BennyPapa987) January 2, 2019\\n\\nLet me answer your question with a question: What's the significance of any of these champion vs. champion bouts if no one is permitted to hold onto two UFC belts at the same time? Every champ-champ we've seen in the UFC was forced to give up one title, usually as soon as the company had another fight in that division lined up. So why keep doing it?\\n\\nThe answer is pretty clear: marketing. It's simply a way to give a title fight a little more promotional juice. If one belt on the poster is good, two must be even better.\\n\\nIn the case of the UFC's flyweight division, it seems like company executives want to leverage that belt for a few extra eyeballs one last time before shutting it down. If you're going to get rid of the division anyway, might as well squeeze everything you can out of it before dies. It's not like you're saving it for anything at this point.\\n\\nWhat to make of Jon Jones seeming lack of motivation to go up to the HW division? He feels he's already the all-time goat (and I agree) but will history dock him a few points if he's never a two division champ? — Mr. Burrito Bowl (@mrburritobowl) January 2, 2019\\n\\nGenerally, I don't think we should pressure our champs to go up a division or hold it against them if they refuse. We have weight classes for a reason. You ought to be able to dominate your own and be appreciated for that without having to fight up a division just to prove you're really great.\\n\\nThat said, light heavyweight is tricky right now. Jon Jones is clearly the greatest fighter in the weight class. The second-greatest is up at heavyweight. The third-greatest just got beat up at UFC 232. And after that there's a heated battle between guys like Anthony Smith and Corey Anderson to be one the contender of tomorrow, with a steep drop-off in talent after that.\\n\\nIf Jones were a lightweight, he wouldn't need to go anywhere. He'd be surrounded by talented fighters, with more coming up all the time. That's not really the case at 205 pounds, which only increases the pressure to move up.\\n\\nIf Jones doesn't eventually become a heavyweight, I think he'll find there's a game of diminishing returns in his own weight class. He can keep beating up the same few guys over and over, or he can revitalize fan interest by taking on a new challenge. I suspect that sooner or later he'll opt for the latter, even if it's mostly just for financial reasons.\\n\\nHappy New Year! And speaking of new year, do you have a gif that expresses your thoughts on UFC not renewing Jimmy Smith? — Paolo A. Santos (@paolosan_) January 2, 2019\\n\\nhttps://media.giphy.com/media/13bdZafj52a5qM/giphy.gif\\n\\nNow that the PFL has made its inaugural set of millionaires, what's going through the mind of fighters in other organizations? For example, Corey Anderson just made $65k/$65k, but has a win over Sean O'Connell. — Nick (@sippnandliftn) January 2, 2019\\n\\nGood question. Seeing someone you beat cash that $1 million prize has got to make you think twice about some of your career moves. Then again, let's not forget that when a lot of us heard about this plan back before the tournament started, we weren't overwhelmed with confidence that this moment would ever actually come.\\n\\nBut then it did. Sean O'Connell became one of big PFL winners, then promptly retired, which is about as good a happy ending as most fighters could ever possibly hope for. Now you know there are other fighters watching him ride happily into the sunset and wondering if now is a good time to ask about subsequent tournament openings.\\n\\nFor the most part, I'd have to say that the million-dollar prizes served their purpose for PFL. It got us to notice and care about a multi-divisional tournament that otherwise would have had a hard time making noise in a crowded space. It made everything feel like it actually mattered. It also did so at a considerable cost.\\n\\nIs it sustainable for a smaller player in the MMA space? I don't know. I doubt it. But then, there is something extra special about that payout when it goes to the Sean O'Connells of the MMA world.\\n\\nBen Fowlkes is MMAjunkie and USA TODAY's MMA columnist.

They've now lost their last six playoff games there, typically in heartbreaking fashion. The next time Kansas City clinches a playoff spot, the starters should be shut down for as long as necessary to lock the team into a wild-card spot, ensuring a fighting chance to win on the road.\\n\\n3. The NFL's concussion protocol continues to be a fiasco. Even after the league and NFLPA mandated last month that players struggling to stay upright be taken to the locker room for evaluation, the Panthers seemingly failed to adhere to the new guideline when Cam Newton appeared dazed in the fourth quarter. Carolina contended the quarterback, who missed one play, was being treated for an eye injury even though Fox cameras seemed to show Newton struggling to stay on his feet on the sideline even after trainers attended to him on the field. The league withheld comment amid discussions with the team's medical staff.\\n\\n4. A disappointing offense has been the focal point of the 2017 Falcons. But their emergent defense might be the difference between this season's playoff run and last year's failure, when the D wore out in the face of the Patriots' ball-control Super Bowl blitzkrieg. Since then, Atlanta has added DT Dontari Poe and first-round OLB Takk McKinley to a talented, athletic bunch that mostly lacked depth and experience. And don't forget, DE Adrian Clayborn and No. 1 CB Desmond Trufant were on IR during Super Bowl LI. In their last six games, the Falcons have limited some of the league's best offenses (Rams, Panthers, Saints twice) to an average of 16.3 points and 319.2 yards.\\n\\n5. Rams RB Todd Gurley made the most of his 18 touches Saturday, gaining 111 yards. But he wasn't involved enough. L.A. was 9-0 this season when he had at least 20 combined carries and receptions. When he didn't, the Rams were just 2-5. The Falcons clearly tried to put Saturday night's game on the right arm of Rams QB Jared Goff rather than let Gurley beat them. The strategy worked as Goff's playoff inexperience was evident at times.\\n\\nMore:Falcons at Eagles NFC divisional playoff preview: Three things to know\\n\\nMore:Saints at Vikings NFC divisional playoff preview: Three things to know\\n\\n6. Atlanta QB Matt Ryan is INT-free in his past four playoff games, his last pick coming in the 2012 NFC Championship Game loss to the 49ers. However Ryan's last game with more than two TD passes was last year's NFC Championship Game, an 18-game drought. Though Atlanta's defense seems to have turned a corner, this team no longer looks capable of keeping pace in a shootout.\\n\\n7. According to BookMaker.eu, the Falcons will open as three-point favorites for Saturday's game against the top-seeded Eagles. Philadelphia would be the first No. 1 seed to be an underdog against a No. 6 seed and the first top seed to be an underdog in the divisional round since 1985.\\n\\n8. We wish he had a little less to say sometimes, but for our money, Jacksonville's Jalen Ramsey is the NFL's premier corner, full stop. His brilliant anticipation allowed him to ice Sunday's win as he ended Buffalo's final drive with an INT of QB Nathan Peterman. Should be fun watching Ramsey match up with Steelers WR Antonio Brown next weekend.\\n\\n9. That said, we understand the frustration of Bills coach Sean McDermott after replay review upheld Ramsey's INT just two weeks after the Bills were controversially stripped of a TD in New England. We'd say the officiating department in New York made the correct call on Ramsey, though it's reversed plenty of plays that seemed to offer less evidence than this play did.\\n\\n10. Titans QB Marcus Mariota has taken a lot of flak, much deserved, for his disappointing third NFL season. But he showed a lot of resolve by playing much of the year with a hamstring injury. And his restored mobility, grit, awareness (surely you saw his TD pass to himself in Saturday's win at Kansas City) and toughness — his block sprung RB Derrick Henry for a game-icing 22-yard run on Tennessee's final series — are why his teammates absolutely adore him.\\n\\n11. It's time for the Titans to move on from RB DeMarco Murray, whose knee injury has cost him the past two games. This isn't so much a dig at the veteran as much as an endorsement of Henry, whose wrecking-ball style was on full display Saturday. He's better off getting the kind of heavy workload that allows him to get into a rhythm and can crack a defense late. Henry piled up 114 of his 156 rushing yards against the Chiefs after halftime.\\n\\n12. No one is going to pick the Titans to beat the Patriots. But let's give Tennessee a puncher's chance. Establishing Henry is a key. So is stopping a Patriots run game that's averaged 138 yards over the last six games (the Titans ranked fourth stopping the run this season and just held Kansas City to 69 yards). And Mariota is the type of dual-threat quarterback that has given New England problems.\\n\\n13. Of course, the big story this week in New England will be the Patriots vs. the Patriots in the wake of ESPN's detailed report on organizational tension. An us-against-the-world mentality usually galvanizes the five-time champs. It will be interesting to see how this manifests if an us-against-us dynamic truly has permeated the NFL's only dynasty of the past two decades. Still, the Patriots are 9-1 in divisional round games at Gillette Stadium. Their only loss was to the New York Jets during the 2010 playoffs.\\n\\n14. Either Travis Kelce is the Chiefs' MVP, or the team simply lacks sufficient playmakers beyond the Pro Bowl tight end, RB Kareem Hunt and WR Tyreek Hill. Kansas City was up 14-3 when Kelce (4 catches, 66 yards, TD) left Saturday's game right before halftime and took a 21-3 edge seven plays after he was concussed. But with Hunt largely bottled up by the Titans, and Hill — he has plenty of work to do to become a polished receiver — dropping balls right and left, Kansas City couldn't score in the second half, when it managed just 21 offensive snaps and 61 yards.\\n\\n15. That said, some NFL team will be lucky to get Alex Smith, who will almost surely be traded so the Chiefs can give the offensive keys to first-round QB Patrick Mahomes. Smith dropped to 2-5 in his hard-luck postseason career despite playing fairly well. His all-time playoff numbers now include 14 TD passes, just two INTs and a 97.4 QB rating. Is he an elite quarterback? No. Is he good enough to win a ring in a place like Jacksonville or revitalize teams like the Jets, Browns or Cardinals? Definitely.\\n\\nMore:Jaguars at Steelers NFL divisional playoff preview: Three things to know\\n\\nMore:Titans at Patriots AFC divisional playoff preview: Three things to know\\n\\n16. While we're on the Smith topic, Jaguars QB Blake Bortles passed for 87 yards and rushed for 88 in Sunday's win over Buffalo. Maybe Jacksonville should deal for Smith and convert Bortles, who's averaged 6.3 yards per run during his four-year career, into a change-of-pace option behind Leonard Fournette. Or maybe Jacksonville should go full triple option with Bortles on the trigger. Yet given their own QB dissatisfaction, perhaps the Bills could make a play for Smith first.\\n\\n17. Still, let's give Bortles and Jags coach Doug Marrone due credit. Gutsy call by Marrone going for the TD on fourth-and-goal at the end of the third quarter with the game tied 3-3. But Bortles hit TE Ben Koyack in the back of the end zone with his best throw of the day on the game's decisive play.\\n\\n18. The loss of Saints LG Andrus Peat, who was carted off the field Sunday with what was described as a shin injury, could be huge. He's a major component to a Saints offensive line that struggled to run the ball without him Sunday. New Orleans also relies on Peat's mass (6-7, 316) to give shortish QB Drew Brees plenty of room to see and throw through passing lanes.\\n\\n19. The Saints earned a rematch with the Vikings, who beat New Orleans 29-19 in a Week 1 contest that wasn't as close as the score indicates. But so much has changed. Saints star rookie RB Alvin Kamara was stuck at the time behind since-traded RB Adrian Peterson. And Minnesota's starting backfield in the opener was QB Sam Bradford and RB Dalvin Cook. The prologue really won't provide much insight for a preview to the divisional round.\\n\\n20. Chiefs coach Andy Reid is 0-2 in playoff games his team leads by at least 18 points at halftime (Kansas City's 45-44 loss to the Colts in the 2013 playoffs was the other). The rest of the coaches in NFL history are a combined 67-2 under the same circumstance.\\n\\n***\\n\\nFollow Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis\\n\\nPHOTOS: NFL wild-card action"}

While many candy alleys throughout Japan have been swallowed up by inevitable change, the one in Kawagoe is still a major tourist attraction and meeting point for locals. Here are 10 stops you won't want to miss.

They bake their own manju in house, and the most popular variety comes stuffed with red bean paste and sweet potato. Careful attention goes into each bite-sized manju coming out in the shape of a traditional Kawagoe storefront. On the boxes, you can see a hand-drawn image of the storefronts, which are still omnipresent in the area to this day.\\n\\nPhoto courtesy of Brian Cicioni Confectionery Umon Tokinokane Sweet potato fries are the specialty at Umon Tokinokane and they come coated with salt, sesame or sugar. If you're trying to save room for the more than a dozen other stops along Kawagoe's candy alley, you can try a free sample of their hard, crunchy fries. If you approve, get a bag to go. According to their staff, they'll stay fresh for at least two months if you don't open the bag, so they can make an excellent gift to take home as they'll still taste the same regardless of whether or not they get crushed in transit. Sticking with the sweet potato theme which is omnipresent throughout Kashiya Yokocho, Umon sells soft sweet potato ice cream in the adjacent stall.\\n\\nPhoto courtesy of Brian Cicioni Lemonade by Lemonica Lemonade by Lemonica offers a touch of modernity mixed in with the pre-internet nostalgia of Kashiya Yokocho. In this over-sized lemonade stand, the young staff of mostly twenty-somethings scoop lemonade out of an old-fashioned lemonade jar for their hip clientele. While anyone over 30 might feel old inside this place, that's no reason to skip it. After all, what's more refreshing than a cup of fruit-infused lemonade in between sampling different sweet and salty Japanese candies? Lemonade by Lemonica offers twenty different variations of the 700-year-old Mongolian refreshment. Lemonade soda is their most popular drink, followed by original. Other variations include coca-cola, cream cheese and fruit-infused. 10Best Shave ice is actually an ancient dessert from Japan 10BEST Shave ice is actually an ancient dessert from Japan\\n\\nPhoto courtesy of Brian Cicioni Matsuriku Confectionery When you see stacked bags of fugashi bread for 500 yen, you'll know you're at Matsuriku.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nLAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — Fifth-ranked Kansas will be without center Udoka Azubuike for the remainder of the season after an MRI exam Sunday revealed the 7-footer tore ligaments in his right hand during practice.\\n\\nJayhawks coach Bill Self said in a statement that X-rays taken after Friday's practice did not show the severity of the injury. The MRI exam revealed the tendon tear, which is similar to a torn tendon Azubuike had in his opposite hand in December 2016 that sidelined him the remainder of his freshman season.\\n\\nThe surgery date will be set early this week, Self said. The doctors expect a complete recovery and Udoka will be able to resume full basketball activities at some point this summer.\\n\\nThe injury is a significant blow to the Jayhawks' interior depth, not to mention their national title aspirations. The nation's preseason No. 1 already has been playing without sophomore forward Silvio De Sousa, whose eligibility remains in question after his name surfaced in the FBI probe into apparel company adidas.\\n\\nSelf said recently that there has been no change in De Sousa's status.\\n\\nThe Jayhawks (12-2, 1-1) lost 77-60 to Iowa State on Saturday in their first game without their bruising center from Nigeria. But that was a byproduct of 24 turnovers and some patchy work on defense rather than any issues in the paint, where Kansas had a dominant plus-15 advantage on the boards.\\n\\nWe've been living on the razor's edge a lot, Self said. Granted, we don't have a lot of where we can go to guarantee us having a great possession. We really don't have good ball-handlers right now.\\n\\nAzubuike had been rounding into the sure thing before his injury.\\n\\nAfter missing time earlier this season with a sprained ankle, he had been on a tear the past couple of games. He had 23 points and nine boards in a blowout of Eastern Michigan, then had eight points and nine more rebounds in a comfortable win over No. 23 Oklahoma to begin defense of the Jayhawks' Big 12 title.\\n\\nThe only other true center on the Kansas roster is relatively raw freshman David McCormack, which means Self could be forced to use smaller lineups again. He prefers to run with two big men but has leaned on four-guard lineups the past couple of seasons because of the configuration of his roster.\\n\\nThe starting lineup Self used Saturday featured Dedric Lawson in the post, with Marcus Garrett joining starters Lagerald Vick, Quentin Grimes and Devon Dotson in a four-guard backcourt.\\n\\nWhether that sticks when Kansas returns to the floor against TCU on Wednesday night remains to be seen.\\n\\nWe've got a lot of stuff we've got to hammer out, Self said, and hopefully we can do it relatively soon. .... There's no question, eventually you're going to play like you practice. So certainly, we've got to be better in practice, I think, and that will probably translate to better performances in the games.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}

But he caught the go-ahead TD pass in Seattle's 23-17 win over San Francisco in the NFC championship game. The Seahawks went on to beat Denver in the Super Bowl.\\n\\nSo don't be surprised if the big play this weekend comes from someone other than A.J. Green, Antonio Brown, Russell Wilson or DeAndre Hopkins.\\n\\nHere are potential unsung heroes for each team this wild-card weekend:\\n\\nCHIEFS: Running back Spencer Ware. Charcandrick West became the primary back after Jamaal Charles went down for the season, but Ware had a better average (5.6) and more TDs (six). He'll probably get fewer touches against the Texans, but should make the most of them. Look for Ware to get the ball in short-yardage and goal-line situations.\\n\\nTEXANS: Offensive lineman Chris Clark. He fills in for two-time Pro Bowl left tackle Duane Brown, who sustained a season-ending injury in Week 17. Clark has a tough task going against Chiefs linebacker Justin Houston, who returns after missing five games with a knee injury. Clark is no ordinary backup. He started four games this season and 21 over the previous two with Denver. He's familiar with Kansas City and a strong game from him cold help the Texans advance.\\n\\nSTEELERS: Wide receiver Markus Wheaton. He was the fourth-leading receiver on the team. While the defense focuses on Brown and Martavis Bryant, Roethlisberger could look to him for a clutch catch or two. The Steelers are missing DeAngelo Williams, so expect them to pass, pass, pass against the Bengals.\\n\\nBENGALS: Quarterback AJ McCarron. He isn't an unknown because of the position he plays and the fact he won two national titles at Alabama. But he has only three career starts and isn't expected to do much. His big-game experience could help him take a 1-0 lead over Andy Dalton in playoff victories.\\n\\nSEAHAWKS: Wide receiver Tyler Lockett. The rookie gets overlooked behind Wilson, Marshawn Lynch, Doug Baldwin and Jimmy Graham. But he had six TD catches and returned one punt and one kickoff for scores. He can change the game on one return.\\n\\nVIKINGS: Peterson's masseuse. Peterson missed practices to rest a back injury suffered in a victory in Green Bay last weekend. He needs to be at his best for the Vikings to beat Seattle so whoever is taking care of his back has an important job.\\n\\nREDSKINS: Running back Pierre Thomas. The veteran only joined the team last month and is behind Alfred Morris and Matt Jones on the depth chart. But Thomas has turned into a key third-down back and one conversion in a critical spot could help the Redskins knock off the Packers.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi"}
{"original": "John H. Jackson and Derrick Johnson\\n\\nOpinion contributors\\n\\nCongratulations on your nomination to be U.S. education secretary, Miguel Cardona. You are poised to take this position at a critical point in American history. As you know well, for generations we have lived through a system of separate and unequal education. COVID-19 has greatly exacerbated the learning loss disparities experienced by children of color. Now, with Congress failing to deliver to schools, educators, students and parents the much needed learning and PPE resources, and states cutting their 2021 budgets, things are primed to get a lot worse.\\n\\nWhen one couples the historic impact of structural racism on education with the challenges brought on by COVID-19, it is clear we are in a maze without a clear exit. But in times of uncertainty, the past can be a guiding light. One important lesson from the past: the positive impact of targeted economic stimulus packages.\\n\\nImportance of stimulus packages\\n\\nWe know stimulus packages can make a difference. For example, according to the Department of Education, President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act helped save or create an estimated 325,000 education jobs. The stimulus needed now must go well beyond protecting teachers' jobs, which are undoubtedly important, and extend to transforming learning and investing in families and community-based institutions. The bottom line is we cannot facilitate change and remedy years of divestment without an infusion of stimulus resources.\\n\\nA stimulus moves us away from the scarce resources frame that too often dominates when confronting the need to invest in children. The bipartisan Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Assets Relief Program, a $700 billion fund to purchase toxic assets from banks, didn't force banks or their CEOs to compete for needed resources to stabilize their operations. Instead, it provided them with well-calculated, targeted resources needed to do the job. Likewise, we are at a moment when the public education system, its students and educators are in dire need of resources to stabilize operations and eliminate the toxicity of racial disparities.\\n\\nA targeted, multi-year $1-2 trillion Education Stabilization Program is a vital part of a larger Racial Equity Stimulus Package proposed by one of us, John Jackson, and other civil rights leaders. This education-focused stimulus would allow for the critical racial equity investments needed from birth and throughout the public preK-12 education system. It would serve as a stabilization fund for states whose education budgets are challenged by COVID-19-caused revenue shortfalls, while also requiring a maintenance of effort by states. It would also include investments to enable the expansion of community schools, address student mental health and socio-emotional needs, support states moving toward tuition-free community college, and make significant investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions that serve minorities and lead the nation in graduating students of color.\\n\\nCOVID and schools:Why your kids' schools could stay open this winter if we ramped up COVID-19 testing\\n\\nStimulus resources are especially needed to address the significant learning loss caused by the pandemic, felt most deeply in communities of color. These targeted funds can contribute to making gains on eliminating racial disparities in education by liberating learning, upending the constraining structures and paradigms in the educational system which have led to learning disparities identifiable by race and ethnicity.\\n\\nInequality in education\\n\\nBlack students and other students of color have long faced a host of challenges where education is concerned — disproportionately under-resourced schools, school closures, criminalization in schools, a lack of teachers who look like them and curricula too often not culturally relevant to them. These biased policies and practices undeniably continue to limit education outcomes for Black and brown students and those from tribal communities. While most students have access to free public education, they remain shackled in achieving their learning potential. As such, it is impossible to address the systemic learning gaps without addressing the racially disparate learning constraints within the education system or, said another way, without liberating their learning.\\n\\nIn this moment of far-reaching change, we must pause to examine whether we are committed to investing in the future. That is the question we must pose to elected officials and those on whom the hopes of children and families rest.\\n\\nSchool snow days:Even virtual schoolchildren need the lessons of snow days\\n\\nIf the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and structural racism experienced in 2020 have shown us anything, it is that there must be a radical shift in how we interact with those around us, and that should force us to rethink how we invest in and educate all students. It has exposed not only past education inequities but the danger of prolonged future disinvestment. While leadership by Congress and the president are needed to move the Racial Equity Stimulus package, your leadership is needed, Secretary Cardona, to target education investments to ensure that we liberate learning for all students and flatten the curve of structural racism so damaging to student learning in America.\\n\\nJohn H.

{"original": "Marco della Cava\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nSAN FRANCISCO – The city of the future has had countless fantasy blueprints, from The Jetsons' pleasant hive of automated efficiency to Blade Runner's dystopian tangle of urban chaos.\\n\\nBut the reality is the city of future is closer than you think, as tech companies and automakers floor the pedal on projects ranging from cars that drive themselves to apps that aggregate transportation options.\\n\\nConversations with mobility experts here and abroad paint a picture of an urban revolution that is already underway in a patchwork of cities from Seattle to Stockholm. The main thing with automated and connected tech is to make sure it's reliable first, says Chris Hendrickson, director of the Traffic21 Institute at Carnegie Mellon University. But the opportunities for change are impressive.\\n\\nSo what could a successfully networked city of the transportation near-future look like? Picture this.\\n\\nYou wake up and open an app that tells you how to leverage the city's various transit options to get to your appointment. Maybe it's a walk to a bicycle, which you pedal to a bus. Or an autonomous taxi to the downtown perimeter to hail a ride-hailing service, driven by a human. Or borrowing a car that belongs to your apartment building's small fleet.\\n\\nOnce outside, you'll notice community gardens and playgrounds where parking lots once stood. The air will be cleaner and you might hear birds chirp, both due to the preponderance of electric vehicles. Emergency vehicle sirens are less common as automotive accidents decline thanks to on-board car sensors that track moving objects and humans. Trucks don't crowd the streets because deliveries are made at night by self-driving vehicles.\\n\\nFord is first to test self-driving cars at fake Michigan city\\n\\nIn many ways, we'll be moving back toward the city of the past, and much like in the 18th century we'll be designing around people who are walking, biking and even growing their own food, says Gabe Klein, author of Start-Up City: Inspiring Public and Private Entrepreneurship, Getting Projects Done, and Having Fun.\\n\\nIn less than two decades, researchers say cities could become safer for pedestrians and cyclists and what cars do exist will be small, electric and largely driverless. Under this optimistic forecast, public transit will be efficient, and smart traffic signals will keep the system moving along.\\n\\nNot that this vision is either guaranteed or without potentially damaging potholes. Hurdles aren't likely to be technological but municipal. Civic and business leaders will have to agree on costly infrastructure projects that allow sensor-driven vehicles to recognize each other, not to mention pedestrians. There is also the matter of working out insurance issues so that accidents involving driverless transportation and humans can be resolved. And perhaps the biggest conflicting interest will be jobs.\\n\\nFord is first to test self-driving cars at fake Michigan city\\n\\nFor example, ride-hailing giant Uber has already stirred such debate in cities around the world over its classification of drivers as contract workers who don't enjoy the variety of job benefits extended to regular employees. What's more, it is now feverishly developing its own team of autonomous-car engineers with an apparent aims to replace the most expensive part of its business proposition, the driver.\\n\\nThere are some 14 million job in the U.S. that involve driving, so getting to this city of the future will be painful due to job losses, says Klein. Right now there's probably an element of mistrust on all sides of this equation. Many worry all this change is just for a profit motive.\\n\\nBut where cities can find common ground among myriad competing interests, you could see revitalized downtowns trumpet a dazzlingly retro quality of life.\\n\\nTesla's new software helps Model S drive itself\\n\\nWhat's needed most to realize this vision is coordination above all, says Mathieu Lefevre, executive director of the Paris-based New Cities Foundation, a non-profit focused on rethinking urban renewal.\\n\\nIn many ways, urban transportation of the future is already here, between driver-assisted cars, ride sharing, car sharing, mapping devices and these sorts of things, and all that remains is a one-swipe pass that connects them all, says Lefevre, noting that Paris recently had a car-free day. Of all the issues we look at, transportation is the most exciting.\\n\\nBut he points out that there could be resistance to the car-free future among some countries with newly minted middle class residents. In places like China and India, the car remains a symbol of having made it in life, says Lefevre. It's not great (for urban change). But it's the reality.\\n\\nAN END TO DOWNTOWN PARKING LOTS\\n\\nHelping push this makeover in the U.S. are Silicon Valley startups such as car-parking service Luxe, which operates in half a dozen U.S. cities. Luxe recently made a deal with a San Francisco developer that decided against building costly and space-consuming parking for its future residents. Instead, it will provide Luxe's app-based valet service, which shifts cars between existing garages depending on capacity.\\n\\nParking is at the intersection of transportation and real estate, says Luxe CEO Curtis Lee. Parking lots are terrible for society, and many growing urban centers are experiencing a crunch of cars.\\n\\nA host of American cities have embraced the challenge to make their downtowns hum with efficiency, and in so doing have realized it's not as risky as we might have thought, says Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California-Berkeley.\\n\\nThe Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) are among the leaders in bike and car sharing services, Indianapolis has BlueIndy (a fleet of rentable electric vehicles), and Austin (where Google is now testing its prototype driverless car) has lots of app-makers focused on this space, like RideScout, says Shaheen.\\n\\nRideScout was started by two Army veterans who wanted an app that could present commuters with a range of transportation options – train, bus, taxi, bicycle – to a given destination. Last year, Daimler bought RideScout, one of the German automaker's many transportation-related acquisitions that include car2go, a car-sharing service now in more than a dozen U.S. markets.\\n\\nAudi recently announced an addition to its own car-sharing program, Audi On Demand. Called Audi at Home, the service starts soon in two exclusive apartment buildings in Miami and San Francisco, whose residents can get access to the buildings' assortment of Audi cars by the hour or day.\\n\\nIt's all about giving people additional ways to connect with our brand, says Thomas Schneider, business manager for Audi Mobility, who says the company's Audi Urban Future initiative is tasked with finding ways for the automaker to remain competitive in a world where car ownership may decline.\\n\\nWhich mode of transportation is safest? It's complicated\\n\\nMost transportation researchers agree that livability in urban centers is directly tied to reducing the number of vehicles in those cities, says Paul Mackie of Mobility Lab, a research startup funded by Arlington County, Va.\\n\\nIt all starts with technology, he says. Transit data has to be open and shared, so we all know what (transportation) is where. We've been programmed for so long not to consider public transit options because we aren't sure if we can count on them. Once we can efficiently get somewhere by transferring between a variety of options, everything will change.\\n\\nFINLAND TARGETS MOBILITY AS A SERVICE\\n\\nSome cities are reconsidering the role of cars within city centers. London long ago instituted a fee-based system for motorists wishing to access downtown with their personal vehicles, and recently officials in Oslo said their downtown would be car-free by 2019.\\n\\nScandinavian countries in general are getting aggressive on reinventing their capitals, perhaps in part because the projects are easier to tackle given the relatively modest size of their urban centers (Oslo has 600,000 residents, about the size of El Paso, Texas).\\n\\nIn Helsinki, public agencies, academic institutions and private companies are working with a non-profit organization called ITS Finland to coordinate the gradual rollout of a transportation-focused option.\\n\\nThe goal is enabling a good life for all citizens even if you don't have a car, says ITS Finland CEO Sampo Hietanen. He dubs the pay-as-you-go approach to networked transportation options MaaS, or mobility as a service, a variation on cloud-computing's SaaS, software as a service.\\n\\nWe're not looking to force anyone to do anything, but instead to try and create a system that can get you from point A to B in a variety of ways of your choosing, says Hietanen. Of course the hardest part of doing this isn't the technology, but the negotiations between services that obviously want to keep their customers.\\n\\nGoogle self-driving car prototype meets the press\\n\\nThe enticement is huge. By ITS Finland's calculation, urban transportation companies will share about ten times what is currently split between the various telecommunications companies battling for monthly cell phone accounts. The average revenue per user for cell phones is around $30 a month, but for transportation it's around $300 a month, he says.\\n\\nCities have always been about the fast and efficient flow of commerce. In the end, the incentive to remake the world's urban capitals will likely come from the combined desire to both accommodate and profit from the rising generation of millennial workers whose demands for urban life center on health, efficiency and savings. Put another way, the city of the future will be green — both in terms of its footprint and its ability to generate profits.\\n\\nSays Hietanen: When it comes to the new transportation model, there's a lot of money out there to share.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter @marcodellacava."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nNEW YORK (AP) — Billy King's bold moves often seemed made with little regard for the future.\\n\\nNow Brooklyn's future isn't King's concern.\\n\\nThe Nets reassigned their general manager and fired coach Lionel Hollins on Sunday in the midst of their worst season since moving from New Jersey.\\n\\nThe Nets said assistant Tony Brown will serve as the interim head coach, and the GM position will remain open until a replacement is hired.\\n\\nIt's clear from our current state of affairs that we need new leadership, owner Mikhail Prokhorov said in a statement. With the right basketball management and coach in place, we are going to create a winning culture and identity and give Brooklyn a team that it can be proud of and enjoy watching.\\n\\nThe Nets have lost four in a row overall and nine straight at home, where attendance has dwindled at the $1 billion Barclays Center. The Nets made the playoffs every year since relocating for the 2012-13 season, but they are 10-27, better only than the league-worst Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference.\\n\\nKing had been GM since 2010, orchestrating a number of high-profile moves that led to just one playoff series victory. Hollins was in his second season as coach.\\n\\nKing worked hard to fulfill Prokhorov's goal of winning a championship within five years of buying the team in 2010, making blockbuster trades that brought in Deron Williams, Joe Johnson, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett.\\n\\nOnly Johnson remains, as the Nets decided to cut costs after at one point owning the largest payroll in league history. But they haven't been competitive now and have little hope of a quick fix in the future, as their first-round pick next season goes to Boston as part of the payment from the deal that brought Pierce and Garnett in 2013.\\n\\nAt every step of the way, he has been aggressive in his quest to build a winning team and has been a key factor toward the Nets making the playoffs for each of the last three seasons, Prokhorov said about King, who was in the last year of his contract.\\n\\nProkhorov is scheduled to hold a news conference Monday. The Russian billionaire recently agreed to a deal with developer Bruce Ratner to buy the remaining portion of the team he didn't already own and now wants to strengthen it.\\n\\nWe have learned a great deal during the past six years and our experiences will guide us for the future, Prokhorov said. Following the consolidation of team ownership last month, I can assure you that I'm more determined and committed than ever to build a winner.\\n\\nKing's win-now approach to deals started with the package sent to Utah in 2011 for Williams, whose contract was bought out last summer with two years remaining. A swap with Portland for Gerald Wallace cost the Nets the pick that turned into Damian Lillard, and they don't control their own first-round choice until 2019 thanks to the trade with Boston.\\n\\nHollins went 48-71 and, like predecessors Avery Johnson, P.J. Carlesimo and Jason Kidd, didn't last long in Brooklyn. The former Memphis Grizzlies coach got the Nets to the No. 8 seed in the Eastern Conference last season, but they dropped their first seven games in this one and haven't won at home in a month.\\n\\nThose home struggles and a roster loaded with lesser names have created a big drop in interest in Brooklyn, where there have been empty seats all over the arena this season. It will be hard for the new regime to change much quickly, unless the Nets can score a big name in free agency.\\n\\nProkhorov thanked the fans in his statement and said bright days are ahead.\\n\\nWe have learned a great deal during the past six years and our experiences will guide us for the future, he said."}
{"original": "After millions of votes and dozens of lawsuits, the end of the election is in sight: the final step to affirm President-elect Joe Biden's victory is this week.\\n\\nCongress will meet Wednesday, Jan. 6 at 1 p.m. EST, to formally count the votes cast by the Electoral College – 306 for Biden, 232 for President Donald Trump. It takes 270 to win the White House.\\n\\nThe meeting, required by the U.S. Constitution, also marks one of the last opportunities for Trump and his allies to protest his loss.\\n\\nFor months, Trump has unsuccessfully tried to overturn election results in six battleground states, falsely claiming the election was stolen despite no evidence of widespread fraud.\\n\\nThe Supreme Court has twice refused to take up Trump-endorsed lawsuits that sought to reverse the results. Federal and state courts have also dismissed his claims of voter fraud nearly 60 times.\\n\\nThe joint session on Wednesday is all but certain to result in one more defeat for Trump, even though several of his Republican allies have indicated they will object to the certification of electoral votes for Biden.\\n\\nOutside the Capitol, protests are expected by supporters of Trump.\\n\\nHere's what to expect when the lawmakers meet.\\n\\nWhat is the procedure for the count?\\n\\nMembers of the House of Representatives and U.S. Senate will meet in a joint session at 1 p.m. in the House Chamber. The procedures for the session come from the Electoral Count Act of 1887.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence will preside in his role as president of the Senate. Leaders of both major parties will appoint lawmakers from both chambers to serve as tellers.\\n\\nPence will open certificates of the electoral votes from each state – whose electors met to cast their ballots on Dec. 14 – and hand them to the tellers to read aloud. As they read a state's certificate, Pence will call for objections to the state's votes.\\n\\nTo be considered, objections must be made in writing and endorsed by at least one member of both the House and Senate.\\n\\nAny objection that meets that criteria will result in a suspension of the joint session, at which time the House and Senate will convene separately to consider the issue.\\n\\nThe debate on each objection is limited to two hours. Each member may only speak for one, five-minute stint. After debate concludes, the House and Senate will vote.\\n\\nA simple majority in both chambers is required to uphold the objection and throw out the state's votes. Short of that, the objection is disposed of and the state's electoral votes are counted as cast.\\n\\nRebecca Green, an election law expert at the William and Mary School of Law, told USA TODAY that the sole purpose of this convening is for Congress to determine which ballots are the ballots that were certified by the states.\\n\\nThis is not a trial where Congress will look at evidence of fraud in the election, Green said. There are no witnesses. There is no evidence presented. And there's a very limited opportunity to speak for that reason.\\n\\nAfter all votes are counted, it falls to Pence to declare the winner of the election.\\n\\nSo far, Pence – who has not acknowledged that Trump lost his bid for reelection – has remained relatively quiet on his role in the electoral vote count process.\\n\\nOn Dec. 28, Republicans including Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in federal court to authorize Pence to pick and choose which electoral votes to accept or reject. In a filing on Dec. 31, Pence asked the judge to dismiss the suit, which his brief called a walking legal contradiction.\\n\\nLegal experts have also predicted the suit will fail, saying it is a based on a far-fetched premise that the Constitution affords the vice president complete authority to decide an election.\\n\\nWill there be any objections?\\n\\nMultiple House Republicans have indicated that they will object to some state's electoral votes, citing alleged electoral fraud, though there is no proof to back any of their claims.\\n\\nRep. Mo Brooks, R-Ala., has led the charge. He and other conservatives met with Trump and Pence at the White House on Dec. 21 to discuss the effort.\\n\\nAfter the meeting, Rep. Jody Hice, R-Ga., and Rep. Brian Babin, R-Texas, announced that they planned to object to electoral votes.\\n\\nOthers who have committed to object to votes include Rep.-elect Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Texas, Rep-elect Ronny Jackson, R-Texas, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-N.J., Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C, and Gohmert.\\n\\nThere are plans by dozens of House members to challenge the results in at least six states, according to Brooks.\\n\\nWe're going to sponsor and co-sponsor objections to the Electoral College vote returns of Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and maybe more depending on where we collectively want to go, he said on Fox & Friends.\\n\\nTop Senate Republicans, including Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have discouraged their members from backing objections to electoral votes.\\n\\nMcConnell, who himself has recognized President-elect Biden, told colleagues that an objection isn't in the best interest of everybody, according to a report from The Hill.\\n\\nNonetheless, Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., announced on Dec. 30 that he plans to raise an objection to electoral votes in at least one state – Pennsylvania.\\n\\nI cannot vote to certify the electoral college results on January 6 without raising the fact that some states, particularly Pennsylvania, failed to follow their own state election laws, Hawley wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nHawley told reporters at the U.S. Capitol that a number of offices have reached out to say they, too, are interested in objecting.\\n\\nI don't know yet, he said of whether more senators will join him. I would think that there would be more, but there may not be, I don't know. Too early to say.\\n\\nSen.-elect Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, has also indicated he may object to some votes.\\n\\nYou'll see what's coming, he said earlier this month. You've been reading about in the House. We're going to have to do it in the Senate.\\n\\nIt's possible that some, but not all, of the objections raised by members of the House will obtain the backing of a senator. Each objection that receives both will elicit its own two-hour debate and vote, potentially turning the meeting into a marathon affair.\\n\\nHave there been objections before?\\n\\nThere have been previous objections to electoral votes. At times, members of the House have attempted to raise objections without support from the Senate.\\n\\nIn 2017, half a dozen House Democrats objected to electoral votes for Trump, citing voter suppression and potential interference from Russia.\\n\\nBut Biden, then-vice president and president of the Senate, repeatedly slammed his gavel and rejected the effort, since they lacked a Senate sponsor.\\n\\nIt is over, he said, to applause from Republicans.\\n\\nJust twice – in 1969 and 2005 – have there been objections that met the criteria to require the House and Senate to debate and vote.\\n\\nIn 1969, the objection was over a faithless elector from North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon. It was rejected by both chambers.\\n\\nIn 2005, the objection was over electoral votes in Ohio, cast for George W. Bush.\\n\\nSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., joined Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, in the action, which they said was to raise awareness about voter suppression.\\n\\nThis objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning the victory of the president, Tubbs Jones said at the time. But it is a necessary, timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy.\\n\\nThe objection was roundly defeated, receiving a single vote in the Senate, from Boxer herself, and just 31 votes in the House, all from Democrats.\\n\\nCould an objection succeed this year?\\n\\nIn short, no. Like previous objections, there is virtually no chance that any objections lodged will succeed.\\n\\nThe most straightforward reason the objections will fail is that they must be approved by both chambers, and Democrats control the House.\\n\\nThe Senate is harder to predict. The runoff for seats in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate is set to take place just a day before, on Jan. 5.\\n\\nBefore those members are seated, Republicans will maintain a majority.\\n\\nGiven the lack of support from leaders like McConnell, though, it's unlikely that Senate Republicans will rally behind an objection to the certification of Biden as the winner.\\n\\nEarlier this month, Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters that an objection would go down like a shot dog in the Senate.\\n\\nI just don't think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be, said Thune, who is from South Dakota.\\n\\nOther Republicans in the Senate have also indicated they disagree with Trump's continued efforts to overturn the election.\\n\\nSen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., took to Facebook to rebuke GOP lawmakers who plan to participate in what he called a dangerous ploy on Jan. 6 to contest the results.\\n\\nFor President-Elect Biden's 306-232 Electoral College victory to be overturned, President Trump would need to flip multiple states. But not a single state is in legal doubt, Sasse wrote.\\n\\nAll the clever arguments and rhetorical gymnastics in the world won't change the fact that this January 6th effort is designed to disenfranchise millions of Americans simply because they voted for someone in a different party, he added. We ought to be better than that.\\n\\nRegardless of the outcome in the Senate, without the approval of the House, objections will not affect vote totals.\\n\\nThough the challenges are doomed to fail, they will extend the vote counting process far longer than normal.\\n\\nThe joint session took just 23 minutes in 2013 and 41 minutes in 2017, according to the Congressional Research Service. Not this time.\\n\\nIf all six planned objections from the House receive support from a member of the Senate, total debate time could exceed 12 hours. Speaking to POLITICO, Brooks predicted that the proceedings will last even longer, clocking in at 18 hours.\\n\\nIf that's case, the meeting will wrap up sometime on Jan. 7 – and at long last, end the presidential election."}
{"original": "The NHL just announced the full roster for the 2016 All-Star Game and while a lot of familiar names are on the list, like Steven Stamkos, Jonathan Toews and John Tavares, there's one glaring omission: Sidney Crosby.\\n\\nWhy would the NHL leave one of its star players off the roster for a marquee event? Here are four good reasons.\\n\\n1. Sidney Crosby isn't playing like an All-Star\\n\\nIt hasn't been the easiest season for the Pittsburgh Penguins center. The Pens are still languishing in the bottom half of the Metropolitan Division and Crosby took a lot of heat early in the season for his lackluster play. Though Crosby is experiencing something of a resurgence over the past two weeks, with five goals in his last six games, his play has been mostly inconsistent. Currently, Crosby has 12 goals and 31 points in 38 games, but the stats aren't enough to push him back into the top tier of players.\\n\\n2. Fans didn't have the power to vote him in\\n\\nRegardless of the kind of season Crosby is having, he's still one of the most popular and recognizable players in the league. For the average sports fan, Crosby is easily the face of the NHL. And despite his lack of goals and point production this season, fans still love him.\\n\\nBut, this year, the NHL changed the voting rules for the All-Star Game, giving league officials the power to decide the bulk of the roster. Fans were allowed to vote for division captains, and picked John Scott, Jaromir Jagr, Alex Ovechkin and Patrick Kane, but all the other players were chosen by the NHL. That's actually a good thing. Fan voting isn't always fair, and plenty of deserving players are consistently left off the list (like the Capitals' Nicklas Backstrom). This year, there's at least more parity in the selection.\\n\\n3. He has a terrible track record for All-Star Game appearances\\n\\nEveryone has that one friend that they invite to parties that just never shows up. They'll act super excited to go and then invariably bail when the actual event rolls around. After awhile, you just stop extending the invite.\\n\\nBefore being left off the 2016 list, Crosby has missed five straight All-Star game appearances and only played in one, in 2007. To be fair to Crosby, a lot of it has been out of his hands. Here's a good run down of his injuries from Puck Daddy:\\n\\nHis high ankle sprain in 2008, keeping him out of the Atlanta All-Star Game, sidelined him for 6-8 weeks. In 2009, it was a left knee bruise, missing a game immediately before the All-Star break. In 2010, there were Olympics. He missed 2011 and 2012 with concussion symptoms, with talk that he was going to boycott the 2011 game in Raleigh. (A well-time media leak for effect.) Then another lockout. Then the Sochi Games.\\n\\nBut, Crosby then bailed on the 2015 All-Star game due to a minor injury and it not only rubbed fans the wrong way, but likely rankled league officials as well. Crosby's decision to sit that one out disappointed players and the league who so often hold him up as the model player. Why risk that happening again, especially given his mediocre play this season?\\n\\n4.The league wants to let other players step into the spotlight\\n\\nA surprising thing happened at the 2015 NHL All-Star Game. With superstars like Crosby and Malkin sitting out, other players were more than able to pick up the slack and represent the league and the game in a positive way.\\n\\nCrosby may have been the face of the NHL, but after last year, it's clear that Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews is more than up to the task, as is the Washington Capitals' Alex Ovechkin. There are plenty of bright, charismatic players that never get exposure outside their own market. The All-Star Game can change that. Why take up roster space with someone that could be a no-show?\\n\\nFans might be confused at not seeing Crosby's name on the list, but he was never really a presence in the All-Star Game anyway and certainly won't be missed."}

And I can definitely mold the players and put them in the lap of you guys. They said he was paid a $13,000 cash bribe.\\n\\nLast month, NCAA President Mark Emmert said a new independent enforcement body that would adjudicate major infractions cases could be in place by August, as part of a reform package to curb some of the seedy recruiting practices.\\n\\nThe panel, which would include business leaders and former politicians, was among reforms recommended by a commission led by former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.\\n\\nOutside the courtroom, a relaxed and good-natured Bland declined to comment except to say Happy New Year and shake the hand of a reporter.\\n\\nDefense attorney Jeffrey Lichtman called it a very tragic sad ending for somebody who's given so much to so many people.\\n\\nIt's a tragic, tragic day, he said.\\n\\nLichtman said he could not fault prosecutors for trying to force change to college basketball, which he said had been relying too long on a very broken, antiquated system.\\n\\nIf the NCAA is unwilling to police themselves ... somebody's got to do it, he said.\\n\\nThis is a long and winding road that will ultimately lead to construction of new rules, Lichtman said.\\n\\nAs for his client, he said Bland was looking to get on with his life after a prosecution that drives a stake into the heart of his career.\\n\\nBland was an assistant coach at San Diego State University from 2009 to 2013 before he moved to USC, where he was made an associate head coach, second in line to head coach Andy Enfield, in 2014.

(AP) — Ryan Kesler tied the score on a power play with his second goal of the game early in the third period, Ryan Getzlaf got the deciding goal in the fourth round of the shootout, and the Anaheim Ducks beat the St. Louis Blues 4-3 Friday night.\\n\\nCorey Perry also scored for the Ducks and John Gibson made 25 saves.\\n\\nRyan Reaves, Troy Brouwer and Robby Fabbri scored for the Blues, who have lost five in a row (0-2-3) for the first time since dropping their final six of the 2013-14 season.

Elliott replaced Allen and stopped 27 shots the rest of the way.\\n\\nBrouwer's eighth goal came on a 20-foot wrist shot from the left circle, after he got the puck from Joel Edmundson in front of the Blues' bench during a line change and beat Gibson to the stick side.\\n\\nRyan Johansen scores on his first shot as a Nashville Predator\\n\\nFabbri then went in alone on Gibson after a Ducks turnover in the neutral zone and increased the margin to 3-1 with a short backhander at with 3:35 left in themiddle period. Perry started the Ducks' comeback just 31 seconds later.\\n\\nThe Ducks, coming off their league-worst eighth shutout loss of the season, opened the scoring at the 3-minute mark of the first. Kesler carried the puck out from behind the St. Louis net and around the outside of the left circle before finding an open lane in the slot and beating Allen to the glove side with a 25-foot wrist shot.\\n\\nReaves tied it at 2:36 of the second with his second goal of the season, skating through the right circle and taking a seemingly harmless 20-foot wrist shot that snuck underneath Gibson's outstretched right leg."}
{"original": "Michael Antonoff\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nPhotography had already been invented when the Old Homestead Steakhouse opened in Manhattan's meatpacking district in 1868. But no one had seen anything like the camera being passed around by diners in 1995. People rose from their tables attracted by its bright, color screen and ability to play back its 96 snapshots instantly.\\n\\nThe Casio QV-10 was in a category by itself as the holiday shopping season approached 20 years ago. It wasn't the first digital camera. But until then images had to be transferred to a computer to be seen. Within a few years, hundreds of models from leisure point-and-shoots to pro digital SLRs inundated the market, all with in-camera view screens for composing and reviewing pictures.\\n\\nIn a world of instant gratification, film photography's death dive was assured. Beyond turning the screen into the photographer's center of attention, the QV-10 had another feature that would be duplicated by other camera manufacturers. The lens housing rotated, enabling shutterbugs to frame themselves in the 1.8-inch liquid-crystal display. People started taking selfies a decade before the term was coined.\\n\\nMost American families owned at least one film camera in the second half of the 20th century, and an entire industry of craftsmen built their livelihoods around the taking and processing of film, slides and prints. Few activities in the analog-to-digital transformation have touched so many people as much as the switch from chemical to digital photography.\\n\\nTo see how much things have changed, I visited the PhotoPlus Expo this fall in New York. Out of 225 exhibitors on the floor, only 12 came up on the show's website under the category of film products + photographic paper/darkroom supplies. One of them was FilmToaster Photography, which makes accessories for digitizing multiple film formats.\\n\\nFilmToaster creator Cecil Williams began taking pictures in 1946 when he was 9 years old. He later photographed the civil rights movement for publications like Jet. Williams says he came up with the FilmToaster to help him and others preserve African-American history.\\n\\nBefore digital cameras appeared in the mid-1990s, generations of photographers like myself invested talent, time and resources creating billions of images on various-size roll and sheet film, he explained. I invented the FilmToaster as the ultimate accessory bridging 20th-century film and 21st-century digital. Because analog technology including film and equipment declines and fades with age, transferring film images into a digital format is no longer a choice — it is an inevitable necessity.\\n\\nPerhaps no one has more thoroughly chronicled the disruption of film-based photographers than Harvey Wang, author of the new book From Darkroom to Daylight. Distilling the input from 35 professional photographers he interviewed, Wang concludes that the greatest loss resulting from the digital revolution is the craft of photography as an entire generation of practitioners understood it.\\n\\nAt the same time, Wang says, the most profound gains from the analog-to-digital shift are the ubiquity of cameras and the ability to share and transmit images quickly. They've thoroughly democratized photography.\\n\\nStill, Wang strikes a note of caution based on an experience he had cleaning out his mother's house after she passed away. I found albums and boxes of photographs from her past including photographs of the 1939 World's Fair where she met my father. No one had touched them for at least 50 years. I don't think the next generation will be able to plug in a hard drive they find in a basement 50 years from now and recover that history, at least not easily.\\n\\nBecause file formats change and hardware becomes obsolete, Wang advises that at the end of every year people should print a selection of their best and most consequential pictures and put them in a physical album that will be accessible to and by future generations.\\n\\nThe accompanying chart compares some subtleties of the two photographic eras.\\n\\nHOW OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH PHOTOGRAPHY HAS CHANGED"}
{"original": "Every year, the Consumer Electronics Show kicks off the new year with a smorgasbord of new gadgets that may – or may not – ever see the light of day, gee-whiz new prototypes that do, indeed, wow us, and lots of talk about the next big thing in tech that's right around the corner.\\n\\nThis year, the show floor chatter will be all about 5G broadband and artificial intelligence, and how they will change our lives as we know it. The faster 5G internet signals will provide the backbone needed for autonomous self-driving cars and smart cities, for improved traffic flow and other services. AI will take the promise of the still-burgeoning Smart Home, and, using our voices to command Alexa and Google, to turn on and off the lights and tell us the weather. These personal assistants will be in virtually every product you see at CES, says Bret Kinsella, the editor of the Voicebot.ai website, which tracks the rise of voice computing.\\n\\nCES, which kicked off unofficially Sunday, will have over 4,500 exhibitors showing thousands of products to an expected crowd of 180,000 or more people.\\n\\nSome of the trends we expect to see in product form:\\n\\nNew form factors\\n\\nSouth Korea-based LG is expected to roll out a foldable, 65-inch TV with a hefty sales price over $10,000. Think it of as a portable movie screen, but with high-definition resolution. The idea is not to crowd your living room with the big screen. When you're in the mood for entertainment, just unfold it. LG, Samsung and several other manufacturers are also expected to show off foldable phones, which can double the effective screen size. Instead of a 6.2-inch Galaxy phone, a foldable model gives you a 12.4-inch device that, when folded, fits in your pocket.\\n\\nTired of 4K TV? Well, here comes 8K\\n\\nBecause 4K is so yesterday, right? There still isn't much 4K programming available, but virtually all sets sold today have upgraded from standard high-definition to 4K Ultra High-Definition. Manufacturers are looking to the next trend to reinvigorate TV sales, which market researcher the NPD Group says are flat, with double the resolution of a current 4K set, at sky-high prices. A $15,000 85-inch 8K set from Samsung is currently available. LG, Sony, Vizio, TCL and HiSense are also expected to have 8K models on display at CES for 2019 release. But don't worry, these products (with lower pricing) are not expected to go mass market until 2020. Perhaps by that time, viewers can find 4K programming at their fingertips.\\n\\nIn-car entertainment\\n\\nSpeaking of viewing, Hollywood powerhouse Disney and auto manufacturer Audi have teamed up with ways to keep us busy in the future, when we're in the back seat of an car. The two unveiled the new virtual reality concept Sunday.\\n\\nSelf-driving cars and motorcycles\\n\\nManufacturers love to show off autonomous vehicles at CES. But this year, BMW has something a little different. A riderless motorcycle. The cycle was developed as a research platform to gain insights about how to help drivers improve their maneuvering in the future, BMW says.\\n\\nVoice commands everywhere\\n\\nIf 2018 CES was notable for such newcomers as voice-activated showers from Moen and an Alexa, flush the toilet for me, command on a new Kohler commode that never got released, 2019 will see an even more heated battle from Amazon and Google to get their personal assistants everywhere, from toys to every conceivable kitchen product.\\n\\nAlmost every device will have this capability, notes Gary Shapiro, the CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, which produces CES:\\n\\nAmazon and Google are in a land grab, says Jason Johnson, the founder of August Home, which makes a popular smart lock that works with Alexa, Google and Apple's Siri. It's a race to get Alexa or the Google Assistant into every home. Because once you start with one, you're unlikely to switch.\\n\\nThis year, we saw Roku, which makes the most popular TV streaming player, add the Google Assistant, while its rival Amazon, which makes the Fire TV Stick, obviously works with Alexa. In the TV world, Amazon invaded the space of TV manufacturers with a branded set under the Toshiba and Best Buy Insignia house brands name, featuring Alexa commands to turn the set on and off and change the channel. These sets rank as Amazon's best sellers, but right behind are the TCL sets with built-in Roku and, thus, the Google Assistant. This means that if the consumer wanted to bark commands to the TV from another room, the Roku owner would need to buy a Google Home, and the Amazon TV viewer would buy an Echo speaker.\\n\\nLG may have the best solution. It works with both Amazon and Google, offering consumers the choice.\\n\\nAlexa or Google is like this year's VHS or Betamax of years ago, says Kinsella of Voicebot.ai.\\n\\nStephen Baker, an analyst with the NPD Group, has been going to CES for over 20 years and notes that many of the products we actually buy for our homes are rarely displayed there. They show the stuff you won't be able to afford, the best tech these guys can deliver.\\n\\nThey do it for bragging and PR rights, he says, but also to show what's possible.\\n\\nThe big trend he sees for 2019 is how to sell bigger products in smaller frames.\\n\\nConsumers want the larger products, he says, but have been uncomfortable with how they dwarf our living rooms.\\n\\nSo this year, look to TVs with fewer bezels and thinner frames, similar to how Apple made a larger iPhone with the X series models that actually looks smaller than the previous 8 Plus edition.\\n\\nWhen you thin them out, people will look at it differently, Baker says.\\n\\nAmong the chatter on the show floor, top executives from wireless powerhouses Verizon and AT&T will give keynote speeches where they are expected to outline why 5G will change the world. Both have launched limited 5G service in select cities, as consumers await the release of mass-market phones that can access the faster 5G signals. The talk will continue to heat up in February in Barcelona for the Mobile World Congress show, where more manufacturers are expected to show off new 5G phones.\\n\\nBut that's another show. For now, it's onto Vegas, baby.\\n\\nCES opened Sunday with two days of press previews, and the trade show officially opens its doors Tuesday. Stick with USA TODAY and follow @jeffersongraham and @mmaltaisla for the latest from CES."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – Donald Trump vs. Nancy Pelosi, the standoff that will define Washington for the next two years, started Wednesday.\\n\\nThe president and the presumptive speaker of the House are close in age (he is 72; she is 78), at the pinnacle of power in their political parties and eager to demonstrate that they are tough negotiators who can deliver. But in almost every other way, from ideology to resume to rhetorical style, the two could hardly be more different.\\n\\nHe won his first bid for elective office just over two years ago; she won her 17th term in the U.S. House in November. She is a liberal Democrat; he is a populist Republican. She is crisp, precise and disciplined; he is none of those things.\\n\\nThey met in the White House Situation Room on Wednesday afternoon for their first conversation since a Dec. 11 session in the Oval Office that is remembered mostly for Trump claiming credit for a looming government shutdown and Pelosi asserting her authority as leader of the new House majority.\\n\\nUnlike that meeting, this one wasn't held in front of the TV cameras. Like that one, there were no signs of progress made when it was over. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer accused the president and the GOP of using the shutdown as a hostage for border money.\\n\\nAfter the new Congress is sworn in Thursday, Democrats are expected to formally elect Pelosi as speaker, the top-ranking official on Capitol Hill and second in succession to the presidency. She previously served as speaker when Democrats last held control of the House, from 2007 to 2010.\\n\\nShe'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding, daughter Alexandra Pelosi, a documentary filmmaker, said on CNN Wednesday. This is not her first rodeo.\\n\\nTrump had suggested in a tweet Tuesday that they might be able to reach a compromise on immigration issues that would end the partial government shutdown, now in its 12th day.\\n\\nBorder Security and the Wall 'thing' and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! he declared. Let's make a deal?\\n\\nHere's what to watch in the days ahead.\\n\\nBottom lines: The Wall\\n\\nTrump says he won't accept a budget deal that doesn't include funding for the wall.\\n\\nHe has rejected the idea, floated by sometimes-ally Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., that the wall is a metaphor for border security. That was a suggestion that might have made it possible to take funding for other steps to secure the southern border and still claim victory.\\n\\nThe problem is, without a Wall there can be no real Border Security - and our Country must finally have a Strong and Secure Southern Border! he tweeted Tuesday.\\n\\nThe White House is underscoring the national-security aspects of the debate by holding the meeting not in the Cabinet Room or the Roosevelt Room but in the basement Situation Room.\\n\\nPelosi says she won't accept a budget deal that includes funding for the wall. The legislation House Democrats plan to pass when the new Congress convenes on Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border security, much less than the $5 billion the president wanted to start building the wall that has been his signature promise since he announced his candidacy.\\n\\nIn an interview with USA TODAY, she mocked Trump for his shifting explanations of what his wall might be, which he initially described as a cement structure that Mexico would finance. Now he's down to, I think, a beaded curtain or something, she said.\\n\\nMustering their troops\\n\\nTrump dismayed any number of congressional Republicans by backing out of a deal that would have funded the government until Feb. 8, choosing to shut down parts of it instead. But almost all of them have kept their mouths shut.\\n\\nGOP officials have learned the perils of provoking Trump and the ensuing Twitter tirade directed against them. Those most willing to risk it, including Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, are leaving town.\\n\\nThat said, incoming Utah senator Mitt Romney fired a pre-emptive shot Wednesday, the day before Vice President Mike Pence will swear him in to office. With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable, Romney wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.\\n\\nWhether Romney will be speaking for more than himself isn't clear. I won big, and he didn't, Trump responded on Twitter.\\n\\nPelosi faced public challenges to her re-election as speaker among Democrats, including 16 representatives who had pledged to vote against her if they won. She had to win over critics who had argued it was time for new leadership, appointing some to key committees and agreeing to legislative priorities.\\n\\nNow the new House rules establish new committees to address climate change and to modernize the Congress. A new consensus calendar to speed passage of legislation that commands bipartisan support, both steps reformers wanted.\\n\\nBut it also changed the rules to make it harder to fire the speaker, or to embarrass her. Now a majority of Democrats or a majority of Republicans would be needed to introduce a motion to vacate the chair, to remove the speaker. That used to take just a single legislator, making it an easy way for a dissident to make a point.\\n\\nPaging Mitch McConnell\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., will also be at the White House meeting. But he has pointedly declined to engage on the budget battle. The Senate unanimously passed the short-term funding bill before Trump, facing a hail of criticism from conservative talk-show hosts, announced he wouldn't sign it because it didn't include funding for the wall. (See Bottom line, above.)\\n\\nMcConnell has made it clear he thinks government shutdowns are stupid. There's no education in the second kick of a mule, he told reporters. But he also has been loath to take on Trump.\\n\\nWill he push the president to make a deal with Democrats?\\n\\nNot yet. I don't think any particular progress was made today, McConnell told reporters when he returned to Capitol Hill from the White House. He said the Senate wouldn't take up the budget bills House Democrats are poised to pass Thursday. We are hopeful that somehow in the coming days or weeks we will be able to reach an agreement.\\n\\nDays or weeks.\\n\\nMore:How long will the shutdown last? Here are lessons from previous budget battles.\\n\\nMore:The government shutdown is here. How does it affect you?"}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nDENVER (AP) — The Broncos are in search of a coach. The Raiders are looking for a quarterback.\\n\\nNeither of these AFC West rivals came out of Sunday in as good of shape as they went in.\\n\\nAfter a 24-6 victory, Denver coach Gary Kubiak told his players he was stepping away.\\n\\nDuring that loss, the Raiders (12-4) saw their hopes for a division title and first-round bye slip away, and also lost their quarterback-of-the-moment, Matt McGloin , to a shoulder injury.\\n\\nThey are faced with the prospect of rookie Connor Cook making his first NFL start in a playoff game at Houston next weekend.\\n\\nNothing is easy about this league, coach Jack Del Rio said. We wanted to win the division but we didn't earn that. We earned the playoffs.\\n\\nHe had little to offer about McGloin's status. The fourth-year veteran, starting in place of the previously injured Derek Carr, left in the second quarter with an injury to his left shoulder and watched the rest of the game from the sideline.\\n\\nIn the other locker room, players voiced support for Kubiak, who has battled health problems and will leave the team only one short season after he led it to a Super Bowl title.\\n\\nI owe him a lot, obviously, said Broncos quarterback Trevor Siemian, who earned the starting job this year.\\n\\nThe Broncos went 9-7 and missed the playoffs, and now, team vice president John Elway embarks on a coaching search he didn't expect. Dolphins defensive coordinator Vance Joseph and Falcons offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan could be candidates.\\n\\nI trust him 100 percent, linebacker Von Miller said of Elway, with whom he had contentious contract negotiations last offseason. We have a championship organization here.\\n\\nBut there will be a new champion this year. The Raiders once looked like as much of a front-runner in the AFC as anyone outside of New England. But now, it's Kansas City as division champion and Oakland as a road team with no sure bet on who its quarterback will be.\\n\\nWe're big boys, Del Rio said. We can take it like men and move on. It's not what we wanted by any stretch.\\n\\nOther things we learned from Denver's win over Oakland:\\n\\nPRESSURE COOKER\\n\\nCook was a fourth-round pick out of Michigan State. His first NFL action came under the most difficult of circumstances. He finished 14 for 21 for 150 yards with a touchdown and an interception. If he starts next week, he'll become the first quarterback in the Super Bowl era to make his first NFL start in the playoffs. It's not going to change anything for me, he said. I'm still going to prep as if I'm playing. It doesn't matter if I'm backup, starter, whatever.\\n\\nON THE BENCH\\n\\nKubiak hinted all week that both Siemian and rookie Paxton Lynch would see playing time in the finale. With Denver's offense rolling — 24 points is more than it scored in the last three games combined — Lynch never made it off the bench. That's on me, Kubiak said. Paxton has a bright future. It's going to be a hell of a battle between those two kids next year.\\n\\nGOOD NEWS, MAYBE\\n\\nThe Raiders went 3-3 against AFC West rivals, but won all six games against the rest of the conference. Their playoff opener is against the Texans, who they beat 27-20 in a game in Mexico City in November. Our heads shouldn't be down, receiver Amari Cooper said. We're still going to the playoffs; we just didn't earn a bye. One more tidbit: Since the playoff field was expanded to 12 teams, a No. 5 seed has never represented the AFC in the Super Bowl.\\n\\nELITE COMPANY\\n\\nDevontae Booker became the seventh Broncos rookie with a rushing and receiving touchdown in the same game. He joins such names as Clinton Portis, who accomplished the feat in 2002, Terrell Davis (1995) and Rick Upchurch (1975). That just shows what our offense can do, Booker said. We went out there and moved the ball up and down the field. We put points on the board.\\n\\nOTHER HEALTH WORRIES\\n\\nRaiders left tackle Donald Penn left the game clutching his left knee but Del Rio said he thinks Penn should be fine for next week.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Sports Writer Pat Graham contributed to this report."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nGREENVILLE, N.C. (AP) — Good things happened for top-ranked Connecticut when the ball left Katie Lou Samuelson's hands.\\n\\nWhen she wasn't making shots, she passed to teammates who did.\\n\\nSamuelson scored 19 points and had a season-best nine of the Huskies' 31 assists in their 96-35 victory over the Pirates on Wednesday.\\n\\nIt's hard for us sometimes to run offense without (Samuelson) on the floor because she makes the most shots, and she's our best passer, coach Geno Auriemma said.\\n\\nGabby Williams added 18 points, Napheesa Collier had 14 points and Azura Stevens matched a season high with 16 rebounds for the Huskies (12-0, 2-0 American Athletic Conference).\\n\\nThey shot 53 percent, had a 52-38 edge on the boards, and scored 31 points off the Pirates' 20 turnovers while extending their Division I-record road winning streak to 42 and winning their 142nd in a row against unranked opponents.\\n\\nUConn dominated every facet of the game tonight, ECU coach Heather Macy said.\\n\\nCOACHES POLL:UConn remains No. 1\\n\\nWilliams — who had the program's fifth triple-double in her previous visit to ECU last January — had 12 points in the first quarter, and she and her teammates had an easy time finding lanes to the rim and attacking. UConn finished with 54 points in the paint, and 27 of its 40 field goals were layups.\\n\\nAlex Frazier and Destiny Campbell had eight points apiece to lead East Carolina (8-7, 0-2), which fell to 0-9 in the series and has never kept it closer than 41 points.\\n\\nMegan Walker and Crystal Dangerfield each had 10 points for UConn.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nUConn: Maybe someday, some team from the American will challenge the Huskies, who improved to 85-0 in regular-season and tournament games within the conference. Until then, they'll have to be content with nitpicking the flaws that pop up in their blowouts — such as missing 13 of 14 shots late in the second quarter — and making sure they're sharp for their annual run through the NCAA Tournament.\\n\\nEast Carolina: Macy's bid for school history will have to wait a few more days. She entered tied with her predecessor Sharon Baldwin-Tener for the most coaching victories in program history. Nobody expected win No. 127 to come against the mighty Huskies.\\n\\nWEATHER REPORT\\n\\nTip-off time was moved up five hours to 2 p.m. in an attempt to finish the game before a winter storm was expected to dump snow, sleet and freezing rain on the Southeast seaboard.\\n\\nAn announced crowd of 1,823 — the smallest to watch the Huskies this season — showed up for the makeshift midweek matinee.\\n\\nAuriemma appreciated the change because that gives us a chance to get out of here at a decent time but added that the people that were here, I think they got to see a pretty good game by us.\\n\\nKEY STAT\\n\\nWhen this game was its closest, UConn took away what the Pirates do best. ECU entered leading the league with an average of 16.3 offensive rebounds. UConn allowed the Pirates just one offensive rebound in the first half, when the Huskies pushed their lead well into the 20s. The 6-foot-6 Stevens — the tallest player for either team by at least 3 inches — finished with a game-high nine defensive rebounds.\\n\\nHOMECOMING\\n\\nThis was as close to a homecoming as Stevens will have. The UConn forward grew up in Raleigh, attended high school in the suburb of Cary and was an all-Atlantic Coast Conference selection during two seasons at Duke before transferring following a disappointing 2015-16 season with the Blue Devils.\\n\\nShe's so much different than anybody else we have on our team, Auriemma said. She's got a dimension that's hard to find anywhere in the country, actually, someone with that length that has those kinds of skills.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nUConn: Plays at South Florida on Saturday night.\\n\\nEast Carolina: Travels to Memphis for a Saturday game.\\n\\nPHOTOS: Day in sports"}
{"original": "The latest domestic assault case involving Washington Redskins linebacker Reuben Foster was dropped by prosecutors for lack of evidence on Thursday.\\n\\nFoster faced a single misdemeanor count of domestic battery related to an alleged altercation with his on-again, off-again girlfriend Elissa Ennis in Tampa on Nov. 24. Foster, a member of the San Francisco 49ers at the time, was released hours after his arrest at the 49ers' team hotel.\\n\\nWe take issues of domestic violence very seriously and thoroughly investigated this case, Estella Gray, spokesperson for the Hillsborough State Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY Sports. There was no evidence that corroborated the allegations.\\n\\nA notice of termination of prosecution filing was made in court by prosecutors on Thursday, the same day Foster was scheduled to be arraigned.\\n\\nEnnis alleged Foster pushed her in the chest and slapped her with an open hand, according to the criminal affidavit provided by Tampa police.\\n\\nIt's disappointing, Adante Pointer, Ennis' attorney, told USA TODAY Sports. This adds insult to injury.\\n\\nPointer said Ennis is looking at all her legal options, which could include filing a lawsuit against Foster.\\n\\nThe Redskins were heavily criticized for claiming Foster off waivers days after his second arrest in less than a year's time on domestic violence charges. Foster remains on the commissioner's exempt list as the league's investigation into the incident continues. He still could face further discipline from the league.\\n\\nFoster was forced to sit out the first two games of the season for violating the NFL's policies on personal conduct and substance abuse related to the first arrest in February 2018. The Santa Clara County (Calif.) District Attorney's Office charged Foster with felony domestic violence and three other charges before Ennis recanted her allegations.\\n\\nEnnis admitted in court last May that she served time in a Louisiana jail for fabricating domestic violence allegations against a different boyfriend in 2011.\\n\\nI'd imagine it factored into the decision, Pointer said of Ennis' prior claims of abuse. Despite all that, there was enough physical and medical evidence to corroborate that abuse took place.\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports does not identify alleged victims of domestic violence unless they choose to come forward publicly, which Ennis did in an interview with ABC News in December.\\n\\nI did what I had to do for the person I loved, Ennis said when asked about why she retracted February's allegations of abuse in Northern California. I thought he would change. Anybody in my position, they would've done the same thing if they shared a family with this person."}

We combed through to find the best offers on the best products available and found a few items whose deals really stood out from the pack.\\n\\n1. Wireless earbuds from Beats that'll keep you going at the gym all winter\\n\\nWith more smartphone companies following Apple's lead and ditching the headphone jack, wireless headphones are picking up in popularity. One of our favorite pairs of wireless, fitness-ready earbuds in recent years, the Powerbeats 3 from Beats by Dre, are currently at their lowest price ever on Amazon: just $129.99 when you add them to your shopping cart.\\n\\nWe loved the Powerbeats' impressive wireless range, their long-lasting, quick-charging battery, and the rich, distortion-free sound performance they're capable of (once you've secured a good fit with the buds' ear hook design). With a proper fit, the Powerbeats will be a reliable companion for both outdoor running and indoor exercise.\\n\\nAs of late, these headphones have typically been listed at around $150 on Amazon, but right now their hidden price is $130.

A small essential oil diffuser that actually looks good\\n\\nIf you've got a small bedroom, living room, or office in need of some revitalization, this modestly sized essential oil diffuser from Urpower is your new best friend—and it's only about $24.\\n\\nAs a small humidifier, the Urpower diffuser will elevate your living space from a dry, winter den to a lovely smelling (and lovely feeling) oasis. I recently purchased one of these gadgets for my bedside night stand, and the combination of fragrance, ambient noise, and fresh air has completely rejuvenated my sleep schedule.

The best cutting board I've ever used\\n\\nMy love for Epicurean cutting boards is no secret among my friends, family, and coworkers, but in case you're out of the loop, allow me to sing their praises yet again.\\n\\nEpicurean cutting boards are somewhere between wood and plastic, but with all of the benefits of the both and without the drawbacks of either. Plastic boards aren't ideal for keeping your knives sharp, but they can be tossed in a dishwasher.

When the witnesses refused to do so, the investigating officers simply fabricated civilian accounts in the reports.\\n\\nRobbins wrote that civilian witnesses who say they told police they saw the shooting were listed as not having witnessed the shooting. One person listed by police as not seeing the shooting said he told multiple officers what he saw and described the shooting as being like an execution, according to Robbins.\\n\\nThe allegations of a police falsifying statements and intimidating witnesses came in correspondence as the city and the attorneys negotiated a settlement for the Oct. 20, 2014, death of McDonald, who was shot 16 times by officer Jason Van Dyke. The city was forced by court order to make public police video of the shooting in late November.\\n\\nThe video appears to show McDonald veering away from police when the first shots were fired. Van Dyke continued to fire on McDonald, who was armed with a knife, after he fell to the ground. Police had been called to the area after received reports that McDonald had been breaking into trucks and stealing radios.\\n\\nChicago Teachers Union calls on mayor to resign over police shooting\\n\\nChicago officer pleads not guilty in black teen's death\\n\\nThe video's release had spurred widespread outrage in the city, with activists claiming that the police department and Emanuel administration attempted to cover up the shooting. The city approved a $5 million settlement to the McDonald family last April, and the Justice Department last month launched a civil rights investigation of the department.\\n\\nVan Dyke was charged with first degree murder on the same day of the video's release in November, which came 400 days after the incident.\\n\\nThe police actions surrounding this shooting are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible criminal charges, and by the city's Inspector General for possible disciplinary action, Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins said of the attorneys' allegations. The public deserves answers to a number of important questions in this case, and we eagerly await the findings of those investigations.\\n\\nChicago officer fatally shoots 2, including one by accident, in domestic call\\n\\nIn a separate March 6 memo to Platt, Neslund wrote that another witness who had been appalled by what she had seen was taken by officers to a police station where she was held against her will and intensively questioned for over six hours.\\n\\nDuring the questioning, detectives repeatedly attempted to get her to change her statement, telling her that her story 'did not match the video,' which they refused to show her, Neslund wrote. Finally, (she) was released at approximately 4:00 a.m., after she demanded a lawyer.\\n\\nNeslund wrote that the woman had been in contact with McDonald's family.\\n\\nShe has stated 'I only saw [Laquan] running … running trying to hold his pants up; trying to run away from them,' Neslund wrote.There's a reason they kept us there til 4:00 a.m. one officer said he was going to get me – that's why I haven't talk to anybody; that's why I've kept things to myself.'\\n\\nThe attorneys reiterated in an interview with CNN on Friday that they believe police officers were trying to cover up the shooting.\\n\\nYou have a false narrative put out by police,outright lies to cover up an illegal shooting, corroborated by other officers, Robbins told CNN.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY Chicago correspondent Aamer Madhani on Twitter: @AamerISmad"}

Ron DeSantis blamed the largest hospital operator in Southwest Florida for causing seniors in one county to wait in long lines and even camp overnight for access to COVID-19 vaccinations.\\n\\nDeSantis on Monday was responding to a question from CNN's Rosa Flores in Miami. DeSantis repeatedly tried to cut off Flores before she could finish her question.\\n\\nWe distributed vaccines to hospitals, and the hospital said, 'First come, first serve. If you show up, we'll do it.' So, they didn't use a registration system. There wasn't anything that was done.

By the time hospital officials realized the freezer had malfunctioned, they had 2.5 hours to distribute the vaccines, which have a shelf life of 12 hours at room temperature, Cici Winiger, Adventist Health spokeswoman, told the Ukiah Daily Journal.\\n\\nThe hospital sent 200 doses to Mendocino County Public Health that were dispensed to county workers, including sheriff's deputies and jail staff. Jail inmates also received the vaccine, Winiger said.\\n\\nKansas, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana, Virginia trail in COVID vaccines\\n\\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data Monday tracking the progress made by states to administer COVID-19 vaccine. So far, about 15.4 million doses have shipped throughout the country. That's just shy of the 20 million doses U.S. officials had promised to distribute by the end of 2020.\\n\\nHowever, health experts are more concerned with the lag in COVID-19 vaccinations. Only about 4.5 million people have received their first dose as of Tuesday, the CDC reports. That means just 30% of available doses have been used.\\n\\nWhile some states have been more successful overcoming the obstacles to vaccinate their residents with available doses, other states – such as Kansas, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana and Virginia – seem to be falling behind.\\n\\n– Aleszu Bajak and Adrianna Rodriguez\\n\\nFederal agents struggle to do jobs amid pandemic\\n\\nFederal law enforcement agencies' response to the coronavirus pandemic has been inconsistent, with employees saying policies on masks and social distancing were not enforced, according to a survey conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general.\\n\\nThe anonymous survey, which received responses from more than 6,000 law enforcement employees, found that 64% said COVID-19 affected their ability to do their jobs. While some employees said they were satisfied with their agency's response to the pandemic, one employee said management has downplayed the threat.\\n\\nAlthough our leadership team instructed people to wear masks, it was not enforced, and at times, employees were shamed by coworkers for wearing masks, an employee said.\\n\\n– Kristine Phillips\\n\\nHalf of Chicago public school teachers ordered to return Monday did not\\n\\nHalf of the almost 2,300 Chicago public school teachers ordered to return to work Monday to prepare for in-person instruction did not return, school board officials said Tuesday.\\n\\nChicago Public Schools required pre-K and some special education teachers to return to classes Monday in advance of in-person education resuming Jan. 11. But only 49.7% of teachers and 70% of paraprofessionals returned, Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson said Tuesday. The absentees will face progressive discipline, Jackson said.\\n\\nWe cannot sit back and allow a generation to just falter, Jackson said. A year from now, there's going to be a reckoning around those students who have been sitting at home, not being properly served.\\n\\nMore than 10,000 members of the Chicago Teachers Union are opposed to the city's reopening plan and are calling on officials to delay the return until the pandemic is under control, according to the union.\\n\\nGot the first dose? You are not out of the woods yet.\\n\\nIt's possible to test positive for the coronavirus even after getting vaccinated.\\n\\nBoth the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses per patient to be fully effective. The first Pfizer-BioNTech dose is more than 50% effective in preventing COVID-19, and the second dose increases that protection to about 95%. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it can take weeks for a person's body to build up immunity after getting vaccinated.\\n\\nThat means it's possible a person could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 just before or just after vaccination and get sick, the agency said. This is because the vaccine has not had enough time to provide protection.

{"original": "Paul Payne\\n\\nSpecial to the Advertiser\\n\\nMore than a decade later, that magnetic smile is what Debbie Jones-Ellis misses the most.\\n\\nIt was the one thing that could completely change her day, something that would soothe the pain of seeing her middle child of three wage war against a merciless foe, a fight he would lose to a rare strain of cancer in March 2008 at the age of 28.\\n\\nVictor Ellis loved the University of Alabama, where he was a four-year letterman at linebacker from 1998-2001 bridging the coaching tenures of Mike DuBose and Dennis Franchione.\\n\\nHis entire adult life was spent as an ambassador for the university, eventually becoming an out-of-state student recruiter for the admissions office.\\n\\nEven during his nine-month struggle against the aggressive affliction diagnosed as medullary renal cell carcinoma, Ellis continued to give back to his alma mater that meant so much to him, the impact of his life still resonating nearly 11 years later.\\n\\nIt is brutally unnatural for a parent to bury a child. But Jones-Ellis finds comfort in grasping the reality that the sorrow over Victor's death has blossomed into a harvest of hope that she would not have otherwise known.\\n\\nVictor always had that smile on his face, and it would light up a room, Jones-Ellis said. He was the type of young man who always built people up with that wonderful smile, and he was always about making the lives of others better. He was a beautiful young man that brought peace and hope into the lives of those he met.\\n\\nWhile Ellis accomplished plenty on the gridiron — leading the Crimson Tide to an SEC championship and earning academic All-SEC honors — it was the impact he had away from the field in the milieu of everyday life that still resonates today.\\n\\nAs successful as Ellis was in making the most out of his brief life, his greatest gift was in teaching those who knew him how to die well.\\n\\nCountless former Alabama teammates, family members and Crimson Tide families that witnessed his battle still treasure the lessons of bravery they learned from him.\\n\\nAs does Clemson coach Dabo Swinney.\\n\\nSwinney was a young assistant coach at Alabama in 1998 when he recruited Ellis from Red Bank High School in Chattanooga, Tennessee.\\n\\nIt was the start of a beautiful relationship that continued with Swinney's move to Clemson, the final chapter written when Swinney delivered a message before an overflow crowd attending Ellis's funeral at Lookout Mountain Presbyterian church.\\n\\nVic was one of those young men that I was immediately drawn to, Swinney said. You get close to guys when you recruit them. I was at Alabama his first couple of years, and he was just one of those guys you knew had a special future.\\n\\nEllis was raised in a military family who traveled the world due to his father's various assignments. But his parents divorced when he was in high school, prompting Debby to move from Millington, Tennessee — a Memphis suburb — back to her hometown of Chattanooga in order to raise Victor and his younger brother, Patrick, as a single-parent.\\n\\nI was determined to be the best mom I could, Jones-Ellis said. I heard that single moms couldn't raise sons. Well, I grew up with six brothers and two sisters and my mother was a single mom, and she raised fine young men.\\n\\nI knew I could do it because I came from a strong woman.\\n\\nIt was during Ellis' early years at Alabama that became roommates with Steven King, whose family lived on Lookout Mountain, a wealthy bedroom community overlooking Chattanooga known as an enclave of influence and prominence in addition to its Civil War history and tourist attractions.\\n\\nVictor became fast friends with King, along with his cousin, Kristyn Miller Clark, who was also from Lookout Mountain, and the trio would share car rides between Chattanooga and Tuscaloosa during school breaks.\\n\\nVictor would ride home with Steven from Alabama, and he'd do like all college students and drop his dirty laundry off at the house, then head up to Lookout Mountain to hang out with Steven and his family, Jones-Ellis said. Then Steven would join our family for Sunday dinners at my mother's house, so the families became close.\\n\\nIt evolved into a beautiful, unlikely friendship undeterred by their differences of race or socio-economic backgrounds.\\n\\nTheir connection to Alabama football not only drew them closer, but also expanded Ellis' widening circle of friends, including Tim and Kathy Miller — Kristyn's parents — who were staunch Crimson Tide supporters.\\n\\nSince he played here at Red Bank, we'd heard of him but didn't know him, Kathy Miller said. It's a sweet story that they became such close friends just traveling in the car together. He'd stay here with us some when he'd come home.\\n\\nWhile at Alabama, Ellis was reunited with Ahmaad Galloway, one of his close friends from his earlier days in Millington. Galloway was also the product of a military family, so their connection was forged through their shared experiences in life as well as football.\\n\\nIn fact, it was Ellis who convinced Galloway to reconsider his earlier pledge to attend Notre Dame.\\n\\nHe was the brother I never had because I was an only child, Galloway said. He was a great friend, a stand-up guy you didn't want to let down. He was a guy who did things the right way. I had committed to Notre Dame when he convinced me to visit Alabama, and it was the best decision I ever made.\\n\\nIt was during their early years with the Crimson Tide that Galloway began to recognize the influence Ellis began having on his life.\\n\\nI could count on him to hold me accountable, and that means a lot when you're in college, said Galloway, who was an all-SEC running back while at Alabama. He was that guy when no one was looking, he was doing things the right way. I loved him that much because he was everything in the light that he was in the dark.\\n\\nFormer Alabama offensive lineman Griff Redmill was a junior when Ellis arrived at Alabama, but immediately noted something unique about the freshman linebacker.\\n\\nAs an offensive player, you don't get the opportunity to really get to know a lot of the defensive guys, Redmill said. But Victor was an exception. He always wanted to make friends and he made it easy for you to like him.\\n\\nWe played with guys from all different types of backgrounds, some good and a lot not so good, but Victor at first blush appeared to be a guy who had it all together. He epitomized what it's like to be a great teammates and friend. People wanted to be near him.\\n\\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt in the NFL with the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ellis decided he wanted to continue his association with Alabama. He began by tutoring athletes, then moved to the admissions office where he eventually took a post as an out-of-state recruiter in Charlotte, North Carolina.\\n\\nI'll never forget he called me after he'd gone back to work in the admissions office at Alabama to tell me he'd be working in Charlotte, Swinney said. I told him that was great since it was just up the road from Clemson where I was an assistant.\\n\\nBut literally two or three weeks after that, he's calling me to tell me he's got some rare form of cancer.\\n\\nWhat began as a nagging cough that wouldn't go away was eventually determined to be Stage IV cancer in August 2007.\\n\\nTim and I drove to Charlotte and were in the room when the doctor came in to tell him he had cancer, Kathy Miller said. They didn't know what it was, so they sent him to Mayo Clinic where they diagnosed him but had never treated it because there were only 50 known cases in world.\\n\\nRedmill vividly recalls the shock of hearing the bleak diagnosis of his former teammate.\\n\\nI had just seen him during football season, and it was hard news to take, Redmill said. I had never had anybody that I was close to that experienced truly bad news. My first reaction was that it would not take Victor Ellis down. He just seemed invincible.\\n\\nJones-Ellis accompanied her son in his travels to various cancer specialists hoping to find a cure for her son's illness, which forced her to take a prolonged leave of absence from her work before Victor was brought home to live with her in Chattanooga. But the toll was becoming overwhelming for her.\\n\\nThe doctors said there was nothing they could do. I was exhausted from traveling all over with him, and then I had a talk with Kathy that I'll never forget, Jones-Ellis said.\\n\\nEllis recognized the strain his condition was placing on his mother, and he shared with his mother his desire to spend his last days on Lookout Mountain living with the Millers.\\n\\nVictor knew he was dying, so I mentioned it to Kathy, Jones-Ellis said. I will never forget that without any hesitation she said 'yes'. I had some family members who didn't agree with it, but it wasn't about them. It was about my son's dying wish.\\n\\nThe Millers were empty-nesters as both of their daughters had already moved out of their home, so the choice seemed obvious to Kathy.\\n\\nWe told Vic that it was up to him, Kathy Miller said. He was 28 years old, but I told him we'd love to have him stay with us and he was welcome to anything we had. Two or three days later he moved in with us.\\n\\nI never dreamed that we'd be doing something like that. But If you'd have ever met him, you would realize it was the easiest decision we ever made in our lives.\\n\\nThe Millers rearranged their home to accommodate Ellis' medical needs, and they opened another spare bedroom for his mother to stay whenever she desired.\\n\\nKathy and Tim were lifesavers to me, Jones-Ellis said. I was a single parent, and I had lost 30 pounds trying to care for him and take him to all of his doctor's appointments. But they opened their home to him like he was their son. God in heaven knows I appreciate everything that family did for Victor.\\n\\nKimberly Ellis, Victor's older sister by seven years, remembers the relief she felt when Victor moved to the Millers. A California resident who led Emerge California for seven years, she is currently seeking to become the first African-American to chair her state's Democratic Party.\\n\\nIt was such a relief to my mother that the Millers intervened, Kimberly Ellis said. She simply could not handle everything that was required. She had used up all of her leave time and she needed their support.\\n\\nThat showed me the power and influence of the family created by Alabama football. It is a passion that transcends all social barriers and is representative of the core beliefs of humanity which we should all embrace.\\n\\nAlabama conducted a fundraiser on the quad to defray some of Victor's medical expenses for his frequent trips to M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston during the 2007 football season, and he was named an honorary captain as well during a November game.\\n\\nI was amazed by the outpouring of kindness shown from the entire Alabama family, Tim Miller said. (Athletic director) Mal Moore called every week asking what he could do for us. We had so many former players, coaches and fans that would call or come by who had been impacted by Vic.\\n\\nSwinney was one of those who visited Victor after finding out his situation was worsening in early 2008.\\n\\nIt was a dire situation and he was struggling with closure, battling with his faith and dealing with issues of forgiveness, Swinney said last week during Clemson's Cotton Bowl preparations. I asked Coach (Tommy) Bowden if I could have a day off to fly over there and spent the day with him.\\n\\nIt was a life-changing moment for me for sure, first of all to be able to witness with him. I wanted to make sure that, first and foremost, he was right with the Lord and, secondly, to just challenge him. It was a very difficult conversation.\\n\\nI told him 'Vic, I know this is a bad situation but it's your responsibility to get your affairs in order and for things to be done the way you want.' I told him we could still pray for a miracle, but it was a very difficult conversation. Then we talked about forgiveness with a couple of issues he was dealing with. It was unbelievably powerful.\\n\\nHere's this kid that I had recruited a few years earlier, a strong and beautiful young person, and now he literally had only a short time left. I remember hugging him when I left realizing that was the last time I'd see him alive.\\n\\nEllis died several weeks later two days after Easter, eight months after moving into the Miller's home. Later in the week, an overflow crowd attended his funeral service on a day when the entire mountain was shrouded in a dense fog.\\n\\nKimberly Ellis looks back and admits her brother's memorial changed the entire course of her life.\\n\\nThe day of his funeral, I was overwhelmed by the love and support shown by so many that cared for my brother, Kimberly Ellis said. I came home from his funeral and determined that I would live the rest of my life honoring my brother, striving to overcome my own fears to champion causes that would change lives.\\n\\nWhile the service was attended by hundreds with connections to Alabama, what struck her the most was a nurse who ventured all the way from Houston who Victor met during one of his treatments.\\n\\nShe shared with me how much he had impacted her life even though they had met only once, so much so that she felt compelled to come to Chattanooga to celebrate his life, Kimberly Ellis said.\\n\\nRedmill's reflections on Victor's funeral had a sobering impact on him as well.\\n\\nLife doesn't always work out like it does in fairy tales, Redmill said. When you die you can really see those seeds bloom of what his life truly meant.\\n\\nThere were so many people at his funeral just like me who were drawn to him, equally devastated, and that's just not the case for most people. I think when your death is that impactful, it means you did something right on this earth.\\n\\nSwinney was one of the speakers at Victor's funeral, and he admits that event was a game-changer in his outlook on life.\\n\\nIt shook me to my core as a father of three boys myself, just to know how fragile life is and how one moment, you can be healthy and the next moment you're facing the biggest battle of your life, Swinney said. It really gave me a perspective because it was the first time I dealt with one of my player's death.\\n\\nThat's not normal to bury a young person like that in such a fast period of time. It was a life-changing event for me and forced me to learn to appreciate the time I have with these young men.\\n\\nVictor's death was a crushing blow for Galloway, whose parents divorced around that same time. He felt like he had buried the moral compass to his life.\\n\\nThat's what makes it hard when I lost him, Galloway said. We had the best time in his last days because he was teaching me what it takes to get yourself ready to leave this earth. At that age, that's tough.\\n\\nHe could have licked his wounds and wondered why, but there was never a pity party. He was all about getting his soul ready for his next destination.\\n\\nI feel a little guilty because we had a great time leading up to his death. Every day he impacts my life, more so now than ever because he taught me how to get out of my selfishness. He really made me think about the decisions I make. Sure, I was an all-SEC player, but I want to become a deacon of a church now because of Victor. Those are the things Victor would be most proud of.\\n\\nPrior to his death, Victor opted to create a scholarship fund with the surplus contributions he had received for his medical care. He decided to establish an endowment that provides an opportunity for two students to attend Alabama annually.\\n\\nWe met with Coach Moore and Vic decided he wanted to give back because the university had done so much for him, said Tim Miller, who still proudly wears the A-Club letterman's ring at Victor's request. I remember him saying 'I loved Alabama every day I was here.\\n\\nYou all fed me, clothed me, educated me and took care of me, but I want this to go to some kid who otherwise wouldn't be able to come to Alabama and experience what I did.'\\n\\nDespite the difficulty of seeing Victor's courageous march toward death, the impact of his life has never ceased for Kathy Miller. Their home is full of pictures and mementos from his brief presence in their lives.\\n\\nHe was the sweetest thing, Kathy Miller said. Honestly, he taught us how to live. He never complained, ever. Never asked why he was the one with cancer. He was kind to everybody. He saw everyone as equal and he always saw the good in every person he met.\\n\\nIt's amazing what Alabama did for him. So, when people say bad things about Alabama, I get defensive. People have no clue what all they do down there in Tuscaloosa. That's why everybody's pulling for Dabo because he's family to Alabama fans, although it makes it hard when we play Clemson with national championships on the line.\\n\\nAlthough it has been 20 years since Swinney first recruited him to Alabama, he's not forgotten the impact Victor had on his life.\\n\\nI've still got his picture up in my office as a reminder to me of what's truly important about my job, Swinney said. You go and recruit a guy to come to your school, so to me it should be a relationship for the rest of your life.\\n\\nIt's a reminder to me that at any moment I could be gone and they could gone, so I need to impact their lives in a positive way.\\n\\nI had a former player, C.J. Fuller, pass away this year and I spoke at his funeral. It doesn't get easier. But as I've gotten older, now that I'm 49, I have a peace in the circumstances of life in knowing that God is in control.\\n\\nEven though there's things that happen on this side of eternity that we'll never understand, I know that one day through Christ we will. I just hang on to that, but more importantly, my perspective as a coach and the opportunity I have every day to help shape these guys and help plant great seeds of hope in their lives.\\n\\nJones-Ellis, too, has come to grips with losing a son far too soon. Her pain has gradually subsided to where she can gain perspective on his death.\\n\\nVictor had a lot of courage and I loved that boy, Jones-Ellis said. I thank God every day for the 28 years he blessed me with Victor. I have some wonderful memories to look back on. He blessed me with him and he had accomplished his mission here on earth.\\n\\nI wasn't angry when God took him. I was hurt, but I knew everything happens for a reason. It was a shock, but he had accomplished what God had intended for him to accomplish."}

If you like the song, you can press the heart on one side of the pyramid. If not, simply tap the X on the other side.\\n\\nThe Prizm Music Brain uses AI software to learn your tastes, habits, and likes, and will even suggest new music you might like. It uses an internal mic to tell what's going on in the room, but also senses WiFi and Bluetooth signals to detect other individuals; if they have a guest account (free), it can then add their taste into the mix.\\n\\nFor example, your premium account may have a full playlist of West Coast hip hop, but when your showtune-loving roommate walks in, the Prizm knows, and will try to pick something you both might like—the Hamilton soundtrack, perhaps?\\n\\nUsing its microphone, Prizm also senses how many people are room and tries to pick tunes accordingly. A ton of people? Party music. Just you on the couch? Something a bit softer.\\n\\nThe Prizm Music Brain is set to roll out this spring, with a list price of about $160 (€149).\\n\\nFor more in-depth CES coverage, head to Reviewed.com."}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts played catch-up all season.\\n\\nNow they'll be doing it for a few more months.\\n\\nAfter going 8-8, sliding down another peg in the AFC South and missing the postseason in consecutive years for the first time in almost two decades, the Colts must figure out what went wrong, how to fix it and how they can get back to the playoffs.\\n\\nThe transformation will start with an attitude adjustment.\\n\\nI think we just have to hold ourselves to an extremely high standard, and we have to every day devote ourselves to hitting that goal, said kicker Adam Vinatieri, who owns four Super Bowl rings. It's easy to get complacent if you're not striving to get better every single day.\\n\\nBut the Colts have been regressing.\\n\\nAfter starting his coaching tenure with three straight 11-5 records and three straight playoff appearances, Chuck Pagano has gone 8-8 each of the last two seasons. Indy was eliminated from playoff contention on the final day of the 2015 season and with one game left in 2016.\\n\\nNo one in this locker room ever accepts losing as the norm or as OK, quarterback Andrew Luck said. That's absolutely not the fact here, nor will it ever be with the Irsay family running this organization. I know that for a fact.\\n\\nSo what needs to change?\\n\\nThe immediate focus in Indy has been on the fates of Pagano, who was scheduled to meet with team owner Jim Irsay on Monday, and general manager Ryan Grigson. Antsy fans are clamoring for either or both to be fired.\\n\\nPagano and Grigson are under contract through the 2019 season and there has been no word, so far, from Irsay.\\n\\nClearly, things have not worked out the way Irsay envisioned.\\n\\nPagano was hired to fix the defense, which has been ranked 20th or lower four times in five years, including 30th this season.\\n\\nAnd with Luck relatively healthy in 2016, many figured Indy would recapture the division crown. Instead, the Colts lost their first two games, never got above .500 and blew a chance to take control of the AFC South race with a second straight December loss at home to Houston.\\n\\nI take full responsibility for all of this stuff, Pagano said. I think we've got to be better. Have to be better.\\n\\nAnd with about $60 million expected to be available in free agency, they need to spend wisely.\\n\\nHere are some things to watch during the offseason:\\n\\nHELPING LUCK: Luck had a career-high completion percentage (63.5 percent) and only threw one more interception (13) in 15 starts than he did in seven games in 2015. He had the league champion in yards receiving (T.Y. Hilton) and finally worked with a 1,000-yard rusher (Frank Gore). Yet the Colts still needed a season-ending win just to avoid a losing season. Obviously, the Colts need to spend the bulk of their money — and draft picks — on defense. But they also need to put more pieces around Luck.\\n\\nNEED FOR SPEED: Four outside linebackers could become unrestricted free agents — Erik Walden, Trent Cole, Akeem Ayers and Chris Carter — and 35-year-old Robert Mathis is retiring. Walden led the team with 11 sacks and at age 31 could be too expensive to re-sign. Mathis was second with five. The rest of the team had 17. So finding a young, dominant pass rusher must be a top priority.\\n\\nLINE DANCE: While the Colts allowed 44 sacks this season, there were promising signs from their young offensive line in November and December. Center Ryan Kelly looks like a long-term anchor and two other rookies, swingman Joe Haeg and tackle Le'Raven Clark, played well when given a chance. Indy still needs to see more consistency and more growth, but the Colts should feel better about this group heading into the offseason than they did a year ago.\\n\\nCOST CUTTING: Indy needs to get younger on defense and could save some cash in the process. By releasing three players — 33-year-old linebacker D'Qwell Jackson, 30-year-old defensive tackle Art Jones and 29-year-old cornerback Patrick Robinson — the Colts could save roughly $13.2 million. Jones and Robinson battled injuries all season and have not lived up to the billing. Jackson was suspended for the final four games for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL ."}
{"original": "Aimee Picchi\\n\\nSpecial to USA TODAY\\n\\nWith rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran this week, some students are fretting that the first step in getting financial aid for college is also the first step in getting drafted.\\n\\nOn social media, some expressed concern that filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, which asks men whether they have registered with the Selective Service System, could prioritize them in case of a draft. The Selective Service System's website crashed on Jan. 3 amid a surge in traffic, which the federal agency blamed on the spread of misinformation.\\n\\nBut filling out the federal aid form won't get you drafted, experts say.\\n\\nFor one, there's currently no draft in place. Secondly, most men between the ages of 18 and 25 — regardless of whether they are applying for college financial aid through the FAFSA — are required to register with the Selective Service System, the government agency that registers eligible men in case of a draft.\\n\\nDoes FAFSA sign you up for the draft?\\n\\nUnless there is a draft, this has no impact on anyone's life, says Charlie Javice, the founder and CEO of Frank, a company that helps students fill out the FAFSA. It should not be a reason for not filing your FAFSA as a man.\\n\\nThe confusion comes from question 22 on the FAFSA form, which states, Most male students must register with the Selective Service System to receive federal aid. If you are male, are age 18-25, and have not registered, fill in the circle and we will register you.\\n\\nEssentially, the FAFSA is checking whether eligible men have registered with the Selective Service System, but it won't increase the chances of getting drafted.\\n\\nIran missile strike:Dow Jones industrial average climbs 100 points as investors weigh Iran retaliation\\n\\nHowever, there's a bigger issue for young men who need assistance to pay for college: If they don't register for the Selective Service, they aren't eligible to receive federal financial aid. And neglecting to register could be the start of a host of challenges, with a USA TODAY story finding that men who don't register by their 26th birthday forever close the door on benefits like student aid, a government job or citizenship.\\n\\nIt's borne out of the fact that the FAFSA was created for veterans who were coming back to the U.S. after serving, Javice says. Part of it is you should be giving back to your country if you receive federal financial aid.\\n\\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, the Department of Education said, The Selective Service is separate from the U.S. Department of Education, and their rules exist regardless of whether or not someone applies for federal student aid.\\n\\n'Chill out':Gas prices not spiking due to Iran attack, but that could still change\\n\\nNo priority order\\n\\nThe agency pointed to its statements on Twitter for more details, such as the fact there's no priority order for Selective Service based on the FAFSA form (they use a random lottery number and year of birth).\\n\\nIn other words, filling out the FAFSA won't bump you to the top of the list in case of a draft.\\n\\nThe FAFSA opened on Oct. 1 to applicants for the 2020-2021 academic year, although many students are still working on their forms given that colleges and universities have rolling deadlines for financial aid. About 21 million people filled out the FAFSA last year, according to the Department of Education."}
{"original": "Claudia Boyd-Barrett\\n\\nSpecial to Ventura County Star\\n\\nCAMARILLO, Calif. – The number of monarch butterflies turning up at California's overwintering sites has dropped by about 86 percent compared with only a year ago, according to the Xerces Society, which organizes a yearly count of the iconic creatures.\\n\\nThat's bad news for a species whose numbers have already declined an estimated 97 percent since the 1980s.\\n\\nEach year, monarchs in the western United States migrate from inland areas to California's coastline to spend the winter, usually between September and February.\\n\\nIt's been the worst year we've ever seen, said Emma Pelton, a conservation biologist with the Xerces Society who helps lead the annual Thanksgiving count. We already know we're dealing with a really small population, and now we have a really bad year and all of a sudden, we're kind of in crisis mode where we have very, very few butterflies left.\\n\\nResults from the count so far show that the number of monarchs at 97 California overwintering sites has dropped from around 148,000 in 2017 to just over 20,400 this year. Counts for dozens of other sites are still being tabulated, but the outlook is troubling, Pelton said.\\n\\nWhat's causing the dramatic drop-off is somewhat of a mystery. Experts believe the decline is spurred by a confluence of unfortunate factors, including late rainy-season storms across California last March, the effects of the state's yearslong drought and the seemingly relentless onslaught of wildfires that have burned acres upon acres of habitat and at times choked the air with toxic smoke.\\n\\nThe Thomas Fire last year burned almost 300,000 acres, including areas important for monarch breeding and migration, Pelton said. More recently, the Woolsey Fire damaged at least four monarch butterfly overwintering sites in the Malibu area, according to Lara Drizd, a wildlife biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Ventura.\\n\\nMORE:Why California is burning\\n\\nThese events add to the burden of other threats to monarch butterflies, including pesticide use and habitat loss. There are also questions about whether hotter weather brought about by climate change is affecting monarchs' breeding behavior, Pelton said.\\n\\nWe don't think it's just fires or just those bad storms in March … but it's a really small population that has already had a bad year last year and then it got hammered by more stressors, Pelton said. We're seeing the population really collapse in a single year. Now we're worried: Are they going to bounce back? We're not sure.\\n\\nWestern monarchs generally follow a different migration pattern than eastern monarchs, which fly from the East Coast down to Mexico to overwinter. One piece of good news is that the eastern monarch population seems to be doing well this year, although their numbers, too, have declined by an estimated 80 percent since the mid-1990s.\\n\\nMORE:The Woolsey Fire has sparked valley fever fears, but how high is the risk?\\n\\nMORE:Deadly, destructive fires happening to more Californians, over and over again\\n\\nPelton suggested that concerned residents can help with monarch monitoring efforts such as the Western Monarch Milkweed Mapper (monarchmilkweedmapper.org), and pressure their local representatives to take action to save the monarchs by committing to the National Wildlife Federation's Mayors' Monarch Pledge (visit www.nwf.org). The Xerces Society also offers ideas and information on how to help monarch butterflies at xerces.org."}
{"original": "Andy Vasquez\\n\\nStaff Writer, @andy_vasquez\\n\\nThe NFL has long resisted making pass interference subject to replay review, but Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis believes that should change.\\n\\nRevis said the NFL needs to clarify its pass interference rules, and the future Hall of Famer advocated for adding replay review to help the process.\\n\\nI feel like that will make the calls a little easier, Revis told The Record last week. It would make calls the easiest, because you're zooming in on what exactly is going on. Instant replay, nowadays, you can see everything clear as day. So if slow it down, and see where a defender is at, [where a defensive back] is at, you'll get a better feel. You'll see where a receiver is at, if receivers are pushing off sometimes -- they do push off.\\n\\nIt would be best, Revis said. It would be good for both sides, the receiver position and the DB position, to see a clearer view of it.\\n\\nTraditionalists have railed against the idea of subjecting pass interference to replay, because the rule is largely a judgement call, for which replays won't solve every argument. There's also a concern that it could add too much time to the game.\\n\\nBut even with those concerns, Giants wide receiver Victor Cruz believes something must change.\\n\\nI think that would open a can of worms, Cruz said. To look at every single play would be insane, and really drag the game along. But something's got to be done to make sure to make sure we get the right call on the lay that everyone is seeing on the field.\\n\\nThe NFL could follow the blueprint created by the Canadian Football League. For the last three seasons, the CFL has allowed pass interference calls to be subject to replay. Coaches can challenge calls, or non-calls -- which are only overturned if there is indisputable evidence that a mistake was made.\\n\\nAs of now, NFL teams have only one recourse when a pass interference call is missed.\\n\\nTeams send in plays [to the league] after the game, Cruz said. And you get back, 'Yeah, we missed that. Sorry.' You don't want to miss a play that changes a game, but get an apology.\\n\\nBut that's exactly what could happen if a call is missed in a playoff game this weekend.\\n\\nStaff Writer Art Stapleton contributed to this story\\n\\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com"}
{"original": "Bob Jordan\\n\\nAsbury Park (N.J.) Press\\n\\nTRENTON, N.J. — Minimum-wage workers in 14 states are celebrating New Year's raises, but in New Jersey unintended consequences from a constitutional amendment tie increases to the inflation rate.\\n\\nBackers of the 2013 amendment heralded the immediate $1-an-hour raise it created and expected automatic increases every Jan. 1. But New Jersey's minimum wage is staying at $8.38 an hour in 2016 because an inflation index didn't rise.\\n\\nThat means New Jersey's lowest paid workers lag compared with a $10 minimum taking effect in Massachusetts and California and the phasing in of $15 minimums in several large cities. New York is getting a $9 minimum, up from $8.75. Pennsylvania remains at $7.25.\\n\\nNew Jersey legislators took a strong first step by empowering voters to raise the minimum wage in 2013, said Rob Duffey, spokesman for the advocacy group New Jersey Working Families. But the simple fact is that an hourly wage of $8.38 won't even cover the basics in New Jersey, much less sustain a family.\\n\\nNew Year brings new laws around the nation\\n\\nA higher minimum has a ripple effect, pushing pay for other hourly workers higher, he said. Federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour, but state and local rates prevail if higher.\\n\\nDemocrats in New Jersey proposed the 2013 constitutional amendment, which business leaders opposed but voters overwhelmingly approved, for a $1 increase and yearly cost-of-living increases. So far, it hasn't been much of a win for the estimated 250,000 workers who are paid the minimum or close to it.\\n\\nLast year, they received a 13-cent raise based on the Consumer Price Index, measured from August to August, but no new boost is in store now because the calculation for 2016 declined slightly, by 0.28%.\\n\\nA New Jerseyan working at the minimum wage 40 hours a week every week of the year earns $17,430.\\n\\nThose workers must spend disproportionate amounts of their paychecks on rising-cost basic necessities like housing and food, components of the all-items CPI, said Jon Whiten of New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal research group. Federal figures show food prices rose by 1.6% from August 2014 to August 2015 and the fair market rent for a two-bedroom apartment rose by 1% from 2014 to 2015.\\n\\nThis lack of a bump in the wage floor is a sobering reminder that too many working New Jerseyans are being left behind due to an inadequate minimum wage, Whiten said.\\n\\nAlthough the change was enshrined in the constitution, another adjustment could be achieved with a referendum or through the New Jersey Legislature. Lawmakers included language in the amendment that would free them to raise the minimum wage by statute in the future, but Gov. Chris Christie is unlikely to go along.\\n\\nThe Republican governor, who is running for the GOP presidential nominatinon, said he was tired of hearing about the minimum wage when Democrats nationally made it a topic in the 2014 midterm elections.\\n\\n$15 minimum wage could spread in 2016\\n\\nI'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage. I really am. I don't think there's a mother or a father sitting around the kitchen table tonight in America saying, 'You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, my God, all of our dreams would be realized,'  he said.\\n\\nDemocratic leadership in the state Legislature has shown little appetite for revisiting the issue.\\n\\nMy thoughts when they first put that on the ballot was that it was not really a proper way to legislate, to make changes through the state constitution, said Carl Golden, senior contributing analyst with the William J. Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University in Galloway, N.J. Now the inflation index didn't go up, and therein lies the problem for the proponents. There's less flexibility and ability to pivot when you enshrine something into the constitution.\\n\\nBernie Sanders says democratic socialism is about economic fairness\\n\\nState Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat from Gloucester, N.J., told a group of business leaders in March that he is opposed to legislation allowing municipalities to set their own minimums. He hasn't responded to inquiries on his position on another statewide change.\\n\\nMeanwhile, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he will lead efforts for a minimum wage hike for all New York state workers to a phased-in $15 an hour. Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco and two more California cities have set increases in stages to $15 an hour.\\n\\nActivists also are waging a campaign to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Christie and the other Republican candidates for president have dismissed that as an unwanted mandate for businesses, and Democratic frontunner Hillary Clinton says $12 an hour is a better goal.\\n\\nIf you go to $12, it would be the highest historical average we've ever had, Clinton said in a November Democratic debate, expressing skepticism about going higher.\\n\\nFollow Bob Jordan on Twitter: @bobjordanAPP\\n\\nRelated:\\n\\nWages: We were better off 10 years ago\\n\\nFast-food workers strike, seeking $15 wage, political muscle\\n\\nStates with widest gaps between rich, poor"}

We're diving into personal financial topics impacting college students and unpacking complex finance terms that young people need to know. Let us know what you think!\\n\\nWith school about to start up again after winter break, your schedule's about to go 0 to 100 real quick. While you have some time, it may be worth taking a moment to better understand your student loans (and how to save money on them).\\n\\nWe all know that student loans are basically the devil.\\n\\nThey can be a big problem.\\n\\nAnd 61.9% of those surveyed in an IonTuition study think their student loan payments are (or were) too high, so we know you guys think your student loan payments are out of control.\\n\\nWhat if I told you that you could make student loan payments smaller? Well, there is a way, and it's called refinancing your student loans.\\n\\nWhat's refinancing, and why would I do it?\\n\\nRefinancing involves you taking out a loan from an institution to pay off another loan. In other words, you're taking out a new loan to pay off a current loan.\\n\\nNote that it's different than debt consolidation, where multiple loan payments are combined into a single, bigger loan (though it's often possible to consolidate loans during the refinancing process).\\n\\nWhy would you refinance, you might ask? It can actually save you money by reducing your student loan's interest rate.\\n\\nReducing the interest rate on a student loan will make the monthly payment more affordable and reduces the overall amount you will pay over the life of the loan, says Abby VanDerHeyden, Certified Financial Planner at Bedel Financial Consulting.\\n\\nLet's say you take out a $10,000 loan from Bank A at 9% interest. The idea is that you can head to Bank B and take out a $10,000 loan for less than 9% interest, which will make your payments cheaper.\\n\\nWhy do a few interest rate percentage points matter?\\n\\nIf you're carrying a big balance on your student loans, even a slight reduction in your interest rate can mean thousands of dollars in savings, says Amanda Wood, Director at Social Finance, Inc.\\n\\nVanDerHeyden runs a calculation to show how much you can save. If you have a $25,000 loan at 7.5% interest amortized over 10 years, you'll pay $11,700 in interest. But if that loan is paid back at 5.5% interest, you'd pay about $7,500 in interest.\\n\\nReducing your interest rate by just 2% would save you about $4,200! she exclaims.\\n\\nChristine Roberts, Citizens Bank's head of student lending, adds that their average customer saves $137 a month through refinancing.\\n\\nSo, yeah, a couple percentage points could save you thousands of dollars over a few years.\\n\\nHow do I know if I'm a good candidate?\\n\\nEvery lender's underwriting criteria are slightly different, says Wood, who says her company takes these factors into account: income after monthly expenses, history of financial responsibility pulled from creditreports and professional and educational history.\\n\\nCitizens Bank's considerations are similar, according to Roberts: A candidate must have a strong established credit history and income to support the debt and corresponding payment.\\n\\nRelated: 3 student loan resolutions to make for 2017\\n\\nIn other words, higher income, better repayment history and a strong professional or educational background can all aid in refinancing at a lower interest rate. And guess what? New college graduates may have all that.\\n\\nWhen an individual gets out of college and has a job, their personal situation is much different when they were in school, says Roberts.\\n\\nWhat factors should I consider in choosing a bank?\\n\\nVanDerHeyden says you should first consider whether the bank charges you an origination fee, or the cost to process and create a new loan.\\n\\nIf there is, you will want to make sure that the origination fee is worth paying, she says.\\n\\nAnother consideration is (obviously) the interest rate you're charged. If two banks make you identical offers except one charges you 5% interest while the other charges 5.5% interest, you'll save more with the 5% offer.\\n\\nVanDerHeyden adds that you'll want to consider whether your interest rate is fixed or variable.\\n\\nFixed interest rates don't change — so a 5% interest rate will remain the same. Variable interest rates can change. They generally start off lower than fixed interest rates, but they fluctuate with underlying interest rate changes (like how the Fed just raised interest rates).\\n\\n[I]f you are planning to pay off your student loan debt as quickly as possible, a variable rate might be the way to go, says VanDerHeyden. Otherwise she says you probably want a fixed interest rate.\\n\\nOne more important note: the Federal Reserve's projecting to raise interest rates at least into 2019, which signals that variable interest rates will be increasing for the next few years.\\n\\nAre there any cons to student loan refinancing?\\n\\nPotentially.\\n\\nStudent drowning in student loans probably know that two loan types exist: federal and private. Federal loans are provided by the federal government while private loans are made by lenders like banks and credit unions.\\n\\nCurrently, you can only refinance via private lenders, meaning no federal refinancing exists. Therefore, refinancing federal loans make them private.\\n\\nOnce you have refinanced federal student loans, you lose the flexible repayment options offered, VanDerHeyden says. You will also become ineligible for certain programs the government offers.\\n\\nOne program she mentions is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, which forgives any remaining student loans after 10 years of work in public service.\\n\\nMake sure you know whether a lower interest rate outweighs federal benefits (if you qualify).\\n\\nBut if it is a good choice for you, look into your options, decide on a lender and get prepared to save money every month.\\n\\nMichael Schramm is a student at University of Michigan and a USA TODAY College lead digital producer.\\n\\nThis story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) — Along with the usual assortment of cargo that goes on every NFL road trip, the Seattle Seahawks are collecting every parka, hand-warmer and beanie to be found.\\n\\nGood reason. The NFC wild-card matchup Sunday at Minnesota could end up being the coldest game in Seahawks history.\\n\\nTo be honest with you, I don't have too much experience with this type of weather. I grew up in Florida. I don't really know if there's a way to prepare for it, other than just being aware that it's going to be difficult, Seattle wide receiver Doug Baldwin said. We're going into it with the best mentality that we can, knowing that it's going to be a cold game.\\n\\nThe Seahawks — who said late Friday that star running back Marshawn Lynch has been ruled out while he recovers from abdominal surgery — have never played in temperatures lower than the 16 degrees when they visited Denver in 2006. But with temperatures forecast to be around zero in Minneapolis on Sunday, the Seahawks are preparing for a cold most of them have never experienced with no easy way to replicate it other than standing in a storage freezer for an extended period of time.\\n\\nSeattle opened all the doors to its indoor practice facility and pumped in cold air during the week, but even that was mild compared to what they'll face this weekend.\\n\\nAnd this is not a group that has extensive experience playing in frigid conditions. Under Pete Carroll, the Seahawks have played only two games in temperatures under 25 degrees. Linebacker Bobby Wagner remembered one game in college at Utah State that was so cold and snowy, players wore plastic bags over their feet to keep the moisture from soaking through their cleats and getting their socks wet.\\n\\nRussell Wilson played his final year of college ball at Wisconsin and had a few chilly practices inside Camp Randall Stadium.\\n\\nOnce it gets below 20 it's all about the same, Wilson said.\\n\\nEven with the freezing conditions don't expect to see players deviating from what they've done in the past. Sleeves? Forget about it if you are one that has traditionally not worn them.\\n\\nWhen asked why he wouldn't add arm coverings, linebacker Bruce Irvin joked, I can't look like no punk, man.\\n\\nAnd that seemed to be the sentiment throughout the Seattle locker room. Fred Jackson, who spent nine seasons in Buffalo, planned to forgo the sleeves. Rookie wide receiver Kasen Williams played the final regular season college game of his career in 19-degree conditions in kickoff, but still planned to only go with three-quarters sleeves in Minnesota.\\n\\nSome of the reasoning seems to be psychology of trying to keep the chill from getting in their heads. Some of it — especially for ball carriers — is tactical in wanting to feel the ball against their skin rather than having a layer of material in the way.\\n\\nOf course, that's assuming they're able to feel their skin in the first place.\\n\\nThere's nothing you can do to change what minus 2 or zero feels like. You just got to go out there and play in it, Jackson said.\\n\\nRichard Sherman downplayed the cold because of the advances in technology including massive heaters and heated benches on each sideline. But the idea of trying to tackle Adrian Peterson in such conditions is not an enviable thought for anyone playing defense.\\n\\nYet it's the offensive side where most impacts of the cold are likely to be noticeable especially in the passing game and trying to catch a ball that's going to feel like a brick.\\n\\nWe'll see what happens. Unfortunately, that's something that we can't control, but we've always dealt well with the things we can't control, Baldwin said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nOnline: http://pro32.ap.org/poll and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nImagine this: Kevin Durant is out of bounds by an enormous margin, all three referees somehow miss the obvious infraction and Golden State winds up getting a basket that it didn't deserve to take the lead with a few seconds remaining.\\n\\nIt seemed implausible.\\n\\nThat is, until it happened.\\n\\nWhen such a scene played out last week in the Houston-Golden State overtime thriller, James Harden kept a ton of egg from landing on the NBA's face when he connected on a 3-pointer to give the Rockets a win in a game they would have screamed bloody murder about otherwise. But what if he missed? Or worse, if a call that big got missed in Game 7 of the NBA Finals?\\n\\nHow do you miss that? TNT analyst Reggie Miller mused while watching the Durant replay.\\n\\nAn obvious question, with an obvious answer: It's time for a change.\\n\\nEveryone in the NBA replay center in Secaucus, New Jersey that night surely saw Durant standing out of bounds. But there is no mechanism for the replay crews to trigger a review of such a play — since, under NBA rules as they're written now, they can only get involved if a call is made on the floor.\\n\\nThe league doesn't want a system where every call is challenged or reviewed because games would take forever. There are bang-bang plays in every game, and someone will always be mad when a block-charge call doesn't go their way. But the NBA has been thinking about changes, such as adding a coaches' challenge option that they've tinkered with in the G League and at summer league.\\n\\nFor now, here's a solution:\\n\\nGive the referees sitting in Secaucus that night the option of triggering a review late in games based on what they see. It would just make sense, because the NBA insists the top priority in these situations is getting calls right. True, a call made in the first 2 minutes might have just as much effect on an outcome as one in the last 2 minutes, but people just seem more fixated upon the stuff at the end.\\n\\nWe're dealing with human beings, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver said last year. And people lose their cool under pressure at times.\\n\\nCameras aren't affected by pressure. So use them.\\n\\nBATTLING WIZARDS\\n\\nTo say that Washington's Bradley Beal had high hopes entering this season is an understatement.\\n\\nIf you look at us on paper, we look absolutely amazing, Beal said back at media day.\\n\\nThey look much different now. But they're still fighting.\\n\\nJohn Wall's season is over. Dwight Howard's season hasn't really gotten started. Markieff Morris' season won't resume for a few more weeks, at least. The Wizards are 11th in the Eastern Conference, yet insist their resolve is still intact — as was evident in their win over Oklahoma City on Sunday night.\\n\\nWe're banged up and I haven't heard one player, nor coach, feel sorry for ourselves that we've got guys missing, Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. It's just what we have to do. Sure, we would love to have everybody here all season long, but that hasn't been the case and now we know guys are going to be out for the rest of the season and we've just got to tie the laces up and compete for one another.\\n\\nThe Wizards started 2-9, then went 9-5 in their next 14 games and looked as though they were righting the ship.\\n\\nIt's been one bad break after another since, but they're still fighting to get back into the playoff hunt.\\n\\nThat's what we have to do, Beal said. We have to step in for John, for Keif, for Dwight — those are key guys and we need everybody to be able to step up and fill in those roles in whatever way possible. Whatever it looks like, as long as we get a win. That's something we continue to preach every day.\\n\\nHALFTIME\\n\\nFor the first time in five years, Golden State will not have the best record in the NBA at the midway mark — after 41 games.\\n\\nThis year, that distinction will go to Milwaukee, Toronto or Denver.\\n\\nFew would have picked that to be the case three months ago.\\n\\nThe Bucks, at 27-11 with three games left in the first half of their schedule, are in position for their best 41-game start since opening 30-11 during the 1980-81 season.\\n\\nToronto matched a franchise best by opening 29-12 — tying what it did last year, even while dealing with the coaching change from Dwane Casey to Nick Nurse, the addition of Kawhi Leonard and Danny Green, the departure of DeMar DeRozan and injuries to Jonas Valanciunias and Kyle Lowry.\\n\\nThe Nuggets, 26-11 so far, might end up with their best 41-game start ever. They were 29-12 in 1976-77.\\n\\nMILESTONE WATCH\\n\\nGolden State's Stephen Curry loves the 3, and San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich has said he hates the 3.\\n\\nFitting, then, that they're both approaching No. 3 on some NBA all-time lists this week.\\n\\nPopovich enters the week with 1,220 regular-season wins, one shy of matching Jerry Sloan for third-most in NBA history. When Popovich passes Sloan, only Don Nelson (1,335) and Lenny Wilkens (1,332) will be ahead of him on the list.\\n\\nCurry made 10 3-pointers on Saturday night, moving him past Utah's Kyle Korver for fourth on the NBA career list from beyond the arc; Curry has 2,277, while Korver has 2,274 entering Monday. Both are about to pass Jason Terry, whose 2,282 career 3-pointers rank No. 3 in NBA history — for a few more days.\\n\\nRay Allen leads the all-time list with 2,973, and Reggie Miller is second with 2,560. At his current pace, Curry will catch Miller in about a year and Allen in about two years.\\n\\nYOUTH MOVEMENT\\n\\nMinnesota fired Tom Thibodeau on Sunday and replaced him with Ryan Saunders, the son of former Minnesota coach Flip Saunders.\\n\\nRyan Saunders is 32. There are 43 players older than him who have logged NBA minutes this season, including three members of the Timberwolves: Luol Deng, Anthony Tolliver and Taj Gibson.\\n\\nTHE WEEK AHEAD\\n\\nA game to watch every day this week:\\n\\n— Denver at Houston, Monday: MVP James Harden is playing out of his mind right now, and the Nuggets have a chance at a statement win.\\n\\n— New York at Golden State, Tuesday: The Knicks led the Warriors by 10 late in the third quarter in October, and got outscored 57-19 from there.\\n\\n— Indiana at Boston, Wednesday: Fourth game on a five-game trip for the Pacers, and the Celtics enter the week 14-6 in their last 20 games.\\n\\n— Oklahoma City at San Antonio, Thursday: The start of a home-and-home that concludes Saturday for these clubs hitting their stride.\\n\\n— L.A. Lakers at Utah, Friday: Could this be the game when LeBron James returns from the groin injury? The Lakers are leaking oil without him.\\n\\n— Memphis at Miami, Saturday: This will be Dwyane Wade's final time facing the Grizzlies, who have gone 3-10 in Miami against his Heat.\\n\\n— Milwaukee at Atlanta, Sunday: Former Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer returns to Atlanta, days after his Bucks rolled the Hawks 144-112.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/tag/NBAbasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}

Jones\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nDENVER — The Oakland Raiders' winning formula changed the moment Derek Carr suffered a broken fibula last Sunday.\\n\\nThis is no longer a team that can rely on its quarterback, who engineered thrilling fourth-quarter comebacks and explosive plays.\\n\\nIf the Raiders are going to survive losing Carr, they'll have to do it with a grinding running game, smart and safe play from the backup quarterbacks and a defense still finding its way.\\n\\nThe first test of that formula yielded miserable results Sunday in a 24-6 loss to the Denver Broncos, the Raiders' first contest without Carr since he was drafted in 2014.\\n\\nWILD-CARD PREVIEWS:\\n\\nThree things to know: Raiders (5) at Texans (4) wild-card preview\\n\\nThree things to know: Dolphins (6) at Steelers (3) wild-card preview\\n\\nThree things to know: Lions (6) at Seahawks (3) wild-card preview\\n\\nThree things to know: Giants (5) at Packers (4) wild-card preview\\n\\nOakland struggled to run on Denver's defense despite rushing for 218 yards in a November win. Quarterbacks Matt McGloin and Connor Cook combined for just 20 completions and 164 passing yards. And the defense allowed an anemic Broncos attack to have its best game in months.\\n\\nBut perhaps even more troubling than just the on-field results was the Raiders' overall appearance as a demoralized team, one that is floundering after the loss of its most valuable player.\\n\\nHead coach Jack Del Rio was at a loss Sunday evening to explain how so many fundamental elements went wrong in a game with such high stakes.\\n\\nI tell the guys all the time, you get what you earn in this league. We didn't do enough to earn a win (Sunday) and didn't do enough to earn the opportunity to clinch the division, Del Rio said.\\n\\nWith the loss and the Kansas City Chiefs' win, Oakland lost out on the AFC West title and a first-round bye.\\n\\nNow the Raiders must figure out how to quickly fix their major problems.\\n\\nThat starts with finding a way to rebuild the Raiders' confidence, which now appears seriously shaken.\\n\\nDel Rio's plan is to emphasize to his players that they deserve to be in the playoffs, to remember the 12 games they won – some with wild finishes, others in dominating fashion – and try to forget about Sunday's loss in Denver.\\n\\nWe're big boys. We can take it like men and move on, Del Rio said. We'll be ready to roll. We have a good group of men. We'll shift into playoff mode.\\n\\nBecause of the left shoulder injury McGloin suffered late in the first half, the Raiders don't know yet who their starting quarterback will be.\\n\\nBut they do know which others players will have to step up to provide assistance.\\n\\nMORE NFL:\\n\\n2016-17 NFL playoffs schedule: Times, dates, odds, TV info\\n\\nNFL Week 17 overreactions: What to do with Kirk Cousins, Tony Romo?\\n\\nPatriots' Josh McDaniels heads list of top coaching candidates\\n\\nBrowns weigh QB options with No. 1 pick in hand\\n\\nOakland will lean on its massive high-priced offensive line, who protected Carr so well for much of the season. The group will be counted on to shield McGloin or Cook from a dangerous Texans pass rush led by Jadeveon Clowney. The Raiders' front also will need to open holes in the run game, like it did in the November game against the Broncos, to take pressure off whichever quarterback makes his first playoff start.\\n\\nRunning back Latavius Murray and wide receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree need to help the new quarterbacks more than they did on Sunday. The game plan might be simplified for McGloin or Cook, but the team's identity can't entirely change.\\n\\nWe have to keep doing what we've done all year. We have confidence in our quarterbacks. We just have to dig deep, wide receiver Andre Holmes told USA TODAY Sports.\\n\\nDefensively, Oakland will need more from star pass rusher Khalil Mack, who finished the regular season with 11 sacks but none in the Raiders' last three games. The Raiders had the fewest sacks (25) of any team in the NFL this year. They'll also look for improvement from a run defense that was undisciplined in the regular-season finale.\\n\\nDel Rio believes all of these things can happen, and happen quickly.\\n\\nI'm confident in this group, Del Rio said. They care about this team and are really prideful. I think we'll find a way to bounce back.\\n\\nFollow Lindsay H. Jones on Twitter @bylindsayhjones.\\n\\nPHOTOS: Best of NFL Week 17"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Mired in a four-game skid and having fired its coach in-season for the first time in the program's 100-year history, UCLA went back to the past to right itself.\\n\\nThe Bruins appointed Murry Bartow interim coach after dismissing Steve Alford on Monday. The same day assistant Tyus Edney, who helped win the school's record 11th national championship in 1995, addressed the team.\\n\\nTyus gave a really emotional talk. What it means to put the UCLA uniform on and the way you've got to look, act and play, Bartow said. He talked about the tradition and history here. I certainly think that had an effect on them.\\n\\nIt did.\\n\\nFreshman Moses Brown had 17 points and 10 rebounds, and UCLA routed Stanford 92-70 on Thursday night in the teams' Pac-12 opener.\\n\\nThe Bruins (8-6, 1-0 Pac-12) began the week in turmoil and celebrated in a raucous locker room after their third-highest scoring game of the season produced their first win in nearly a month.\\n\\nIt's been a hard week, Bartow said. It's just one game, but it's a good start.\\n\\nBartow took the helm of a program his late father Gene coached for two seasons in the mid-'70s. Gene Bartow lost his UCLA debut against No. 1 Indiana 84-64 on a neutral court on Nov. 29, 1975. The Bruins then won their next 11 games, including 10 at home.\\n\\nMy dad passed away seven years ago today so it's a little emotional for me to think about, said Bartow, his voice hoarse. I miss my dad.\\n\\nAfter just three practices under Bartow, the Bruins looked crisp and energized in the nationally televised game. Their defense and ball movement improved from last weekend's 15-point home loss to Liberty that sealed Alford's fate in his sixth season.\\n\\nThe animated Bartow proved a stark contrast to the low-key Alford. He stalked the sideline, barked instructions and waved his arms. The 57-year-old coach grabbed the arms of players he wanted in the game and pushed them toward the scorers' table.\\n\\nI love Bartow's energy in practice. He does a lot to motivate us, Brown said. We had more energy, we were playing up and down and were having a good time. He emphasized us just looking like a team and valuing each other.\\n\\nAlthough Pauley Pavilion was just over half full at 8,026, as it was for much of Alford's tenure, the same fans who booed the Bruins last weekend responded with the loudest cheers of the season.\\n\\nJaylen Hands added 15 points. Prince Ali and Kris Wilkes had 14 points each, and David Singleton had a career-high 13 points off the bench for the Bruins, who owned a whopping 56-30 edge in the paint and had seven steals that keyed their fast break.\\n\\nKZ Okpala was the only player in double figures with 22 points for Stanford (7-6, 0-1) in its 13th straight loss at UCLA. The Cardinal opened league play on the road for the first time in six years.\\n\\nStanford got within four to start the second half on four straight points by Okpala. His steal and dunk drew the Cardinal to 48-42 with 13 minutes left.\\n\\nBut the Bruins took off from there, owning a double-digit lead for most of the rest of the game.\\n\\nWe just had a lack of discipline, lack of toughness, Stanford coach Jerod Haase said. The last 20 minutes we couldn't guard.\\n\\nBrown had consecutive dunks and a few minutes later Wilkes and Ali had back-to-back jams that ignited the crowd and pushed UCLA's lead to 18 points.\\n\\nThe Bruins ran off 10 straight points with under four minutes remaining that produced their largest lead of the game, 88-61.\\n\\nUCLA broke open a tight game with a 20-4 run that produced a 30-16 lead, its largest of the first half. Five different players scored during the spurt that began with a dunk by Brown off his offensive rebound and ended on a dunk by Wilkes off his own steal.\\n\\nThe Cardinal answered with a 10-0 run to get within four. Chris Smith missed a windmill dunk, but the Bruins went into the break leading 38-32.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nStanford: The Cardinal is one of just four teams in Division I that has started all freshmen and sophomores this season. Through the first 12 games, they accounted for 82 percent of Stanford's scoring and 79 percent of its rebounding. Stanford will go as far as the youngsters will carry the program, with just four players on the roster having at least two seasons of experience.\\n\\nUCLA: The coaching change apparently re-invigorated the Bruins, who drew loud applause for their spirited defense. Bartow has said the NCAA Tournament remains within reach, but UCLA has little margin for error even in a weakened Pac-12. Next week the Bruins open a three-game road trip, their longest of the season.\\n\\nFIRST START\\n\\nSmith got his first career start in his 47th game. He had seven points, eight rebounds and three assists.\\n\\nI'm a fan of his, Bartow said. He's a hard matchup and he's a versatile guy and he's really athletic. I'll be really surprised if one day he's not playing in the NBA.\\n\\nSEASON DEBUT\\n\\nAlex Olesinski made his season debut for the Bruins after missing the first 13 games. The redshirt junior forward sustained a stress fracture in his right foot in late September. He entered late in the first half and was scoreless with one steal.\\n\\nCOME DOWN\\n\\nStanford's Josh Sharma came back to earth after his first career double-double against Long Beach State last weekend. The senior had career highs of 23 points and 18 rebounds in the seven-point win. Against UCLA, he was in foul trouble and limited to six points and six rebounds.\\n\\nWALTON'S COACHING PICK\\n\\nFormer UCLA great Bill Walton worked the game for ESPN and was asked by his partner Dave Pasch who should be the next Bruins coach.\\n\\nBarack Obama, Walton replied.\\n\\nPasch pointed out that the former president wasn't going to coach.\\n\\nHis brother-in-law coached, Walton replied, referring to former Brown and Oregon State coach Craig Robinson. I'm sticking with Barack Obama until he says no.\\n\\nWalton is known for his off-the-wall commentary.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nStanford: After two days off, the Cardinal visit Southern California on Sunday.\\n\\nUCLA: Host California on Saturday.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college basketball: https://apnews.com/Collegebasketball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}

And even though the calendar still says 2020, my brain has already checked out of this year and moved on to 2021.\\n\\nI'm not really the kind of person who makes New Year's resolutions. The best thing I can say about them is that they gave us that episode of Friends where Ross makes a resolution to try something new everyday and ends up in a pair of way too-tight leather pants.\\n\\nEven if I were that type, I don't think 2021 is the year for big sweeping declarations to change our lives for the better.

I will keep my distance as long as I have to, wear a mask and stay home. I'll talk to my friends and family. I'll play with my dog.\\n\\nLearning a new language or running a marathon?

{"original": "AP\\n\\nThe Associated Press All Pro team has long been what NFL careers are measured by. That won't change on Friday when this year's squad is announced.\\n\\nWhat has changed is some of the positions. The AP doesn't let me vote, but here are my picks.\\n\\nFULLBACK: Don't even bother; the position has been eliminated on the AP team as it has on the field. Mamas really don't want their sons to grow up to be fullbacks these days.\\n\\nTIGHT END: With Rob Gronkowski down, the field narrows. Yes, there are other deserving tight ends, but let's be a bit creative here. LeBron James has the physique and the championship pedigree. Certainly the hapless Browns could use a tight end with his skills.\\n\\nWIDE RECEIVER: Lots of star candidates here, but let's give this to Oakland's Amari Cooper so he at least has a consolation prize for a postseason that figures to end quickly now that he's relying on a third-string quarterback.\\n\\nSUSPENDED PLAYER: This was pretty much a two-man race between Tom Brady and Le'Veon Bell, both of whom started the season on the sidelines. The pick is Brady because he's more likely to be in Houston on Feb. 5 than Bell or any other player in the league.\\n\\nKICKER: This is a position in play once again, now that extra points are no longer automatic. They pretty much are for Atlanta's Matt Bryant, though, who has tried more extra points (57) and made more (56) than anyone. He's also 34-37 in field goals, and not the guy opposing teams want to see on the field in the playoffs.\\n\\nBEST TEAMMATES: After beating the Washington Redskins to close out the regular season, Giants star Odell Beckham Jr. and a few of his teammates flew to Miami to hang out with Justin Bieber and party on a boat. Their next flight will be to Green Bay, where they're more likely to keep their shirts on.\\n\\nBEST TEAMMATE: This would go to Tony Romo, who not only endured being replaced by rookie Dak Prescott but made a classy speech about it.\\n\\nMOST SURPRISED BACKUP QB: Connor Cook had never even dressed for a regular season game before Sunday, when he put on the pads as a backup to Matt McGloin, who was a backup himself until Derek Carr got injured. After McGloin got injured, Cook now may become the first quarterback ever to make his first start in a playoff game. I'm going to do what I've been doing all year, said Cook, who hopefully will remember to bring his uniform to the stadium.\\n\\nBEST RETURN ON A RETURN GUY: Kansas City picked Tyreek Hill in the fifth round when no one else would, taking a chance on player who pleaded guilty to charges he punched his pregnant girlfriend in the stomach and choked her two years earlier. Hill just might be asked about that if the Chiefs make the Super Bowl.\\n\\nLEFT TACKLE: The Browns are paying Joe Thomas nearly $10 million a year so he better be good. The Browns are so bad that it makes little difference and that could mean he's gone soon. Still, it was fun just watching the big guy's reaction to the only win this year. I kept telling myself I shouldn't be this happy, Thomas said.\\n\\nRIGHT TACKLE: This is a new category for the AP awards, mostly because left tackles always seem to dominate. They still do.\\n\\nBEST ON A KNEE: Colin Kaepernick made a lot of people unhappy when he decided to take a knee during the national anthem to protest social inequality. He didn't make San Francisco fans much happier when he was standing up on the field.\\n\\nFLEX: This is the position that wins a lot of fantasy contests, and now it's an AP pick. Le'Veon Bell has made a lot of fantasy owners happy this year, and he could make Steelers fans even happier in the postseason.\\n\\nDESIGNATED GOON: Vontaze Burfict never tires of inflicting damage on other players — and his own career. The Bengals linebacker, who began the season under suspension for his hit on Antonio Brown last year, was fined $75,000 in October for stomping on Patriots back LeGarrette Blount while he was down. To show his versatility, Burfict was fined $12,154 a few weeks later for flipping off the home crowd in a loss to the Bills.\\n\\nLEAST MISSED: Johnny Football parted ways with the NFL, and no one seemed to care. The Cleveland Browns gave up on Johnny Manziel after just two years, and unless the Raiders move to Las Vegas his days in the NFL are likely over.\\n\\nThere are more, of course, but they'll have to wait until all the votes are in. Meanwhile, we await a postseason full of tantalizing possibilities.\\n\\nWill Brady win a fifth Super Bowl and obliterate the comparisons to Joe Montana? Will the Cowboys win one for Jerry Jones, or could Romo return to win one for himself?\\n\\nJust a reminder that the postseason honor that matters the most will be decided on the field Feb. 5 in Houston.\\n\\n____\\n\\nTim Dahlberg is a national sports columnist for The Associated Press.

{"original": "Nicole Auerbach\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nGLENDALE, Ariz. — Adam Griffith knew he'd done a perfect thing perfectly. He could tell the moment the ball left his foot.\\n\\nIt was a pop kick, Alabama coach Nick Saban said later. With the College Football Playoff championship game score tied midway through the fourth quarter Monday, Griffith lofted a short, surprise onside kick — its trajectory mirrored a golfer's chip shot — to his right, between the numbers and the sideline.\\n\\nTeammate Marlon Humphrey recovered it cleanly and easily, and two plays later, Crimson Tide quarterback Jake Coker found a wide-open O.J. Howard for a 51-yard touchdown. Alabama would never lose its lead, eventually beating Clemson, 45-40, for its fourth national championship under Saban.\\n\\nThe call that might have won Alabama the national championship\\n\\nSaban is not known for an arsenal of trick plays or brazen playcalls. He beats you by doing what he always does; you know what's coming and you still can't stop it. But this was different.\\n\\nA hell of a call, assistant coach Kirby Smart said.\\n\\nAnd Griffith was ready. The junior had practiced it once a week all season long. Saban had told him earlier Monday at the team hotel that he'd probably be relied upon to kick one against Clemson, based primarily on the way the Tigers set themselves up during Alabama kickoffs.\\n\\nThey were lining up on the hashes, so I had plenty of room on the sideline and the numbers, Griffith said. There was a huge gap.\\n\\nKey takeaways from the College Football Playoff championship\\n\\nSaban and special teams coordinator Bobby Williams had seen this on film; they'd watched the way Clemson lined up against opponents that use a kickoff alignment like Alabama's, specifically Notre Dame and Louisville.\\n\\nSmart told the kickoff coverage team to make sure to not line up offsides. Offensive coordinator Lane Kiffin told his unit not to wander off, that they were about to go back on the field.\\n\\nI thought we had it in the game any time we wanted to do it, Saban said. I made the decision to do it because the score was 24-24 and we were tired on defense and weren't doing a great job of getting them stopped. I felt like if we didn't do something or take a chance to change the momentum of the game that we wouldn't have a chance to win.\\n\\nIn one call, in one moment, Saban achieved all of that. They had no chance to get it, Williams said. What a perfect time tonight.\\n\\nMeanwhile, an Alabama kicker who was perhaps best known for a career lowlight — being the one who kicked the fateful Kick Six that is etched in Auburn football glory — became a darling.\\n\\nI've had bad games before, Griffith said. But I'm a kicker. I'm not going to be perfect.\\n\\nArmour: Nick Saban saved his smile for the gutsiest championship\\n\\nFans seemed to distrust Griffith after the Kick Six debacle, and they criticized him after he missed his first four field goal attempts to open this season. But Saban always voiced support for Griffith; so did his teammates.\\n\\nHe had a slow start to the year, Williams said. The thing about Adam is he internalizes a lot of things. He will keep the same demeanor, but you can tell when he gets a little down on himself. But you'd never see the expression on his face, that he was showing disappointment. The fact that the team rallied around him, that really made a big difference for him.\\n\\nAdam's been fantastic this year. He got off to a slow start but really finished strong.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP GAME: CLEMSON VS. ALABAMA"}
{"original": "Nancy Armour\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nPARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. — Stubbornness and stupidity often go hand in hand, and what results is rarely good.\\n\\n​The folks at the College Football Playoff would do well to remember that, given that they appear to be hellbent on ruining what was finally a good thing.\\n\\nA report Friday that ESPN owes at least $20 million in makeup ads was further proof of what a colossally bad idea it was to play the CFP semifinals on New Year's Eve. Yet executive director Bill Hancock refused to budge, insisting there are shades of gray to numbers that everyone else clearly sees as black, white and alarmingly red.\\n\\nI don't want you to read too much into the numbers. We're not going to, Hancock said. We are not making decisions based on the numbers, and we're not going to make decisions based on one year.\\n\\nRatings plunge for New Year's Eve College Football Playoff\\n\\nThen what are they using to make their decisions? Tea leaves? A Magic 8 Ball? Stale fortune cookies?\\n\\nThough CFP officials expected some drop by moving the semifinals to New Year's Eve this year, Hancock acknowledged he was surprised at just how much the ratings fell. The two semifinals were down a combined 36% from last year, when they were played on New Year's Day.\\n\\nRatings for all of the New Year's Six bowls, which included the Orange and Cotton, were down 13%.\\n\\nHancock and the CFP can spin it all they want — and they're trying, reminding everyone there were blowouts in most of the games. Not that that's ever stopped America from watching football before. The Rose Bowl was not exactly what you'd call close when USC and Illinois played in 2008, and plenty of people still watched that.\\n\\nNo, protecting the Rose and Sugar bowls at the expense of the semifinals only served to hurt everybody and will, ultimately, be the undoing of the current system.\\n\\nNew Year's Eve is not, was not and never will be a natural fit for college football. Or any sport for that matter. Too many people have to work during the day, and the night has a permanent spot on the world's social calendar.\\n\\nThat's not going to change just because the playoff decides it wants to make football a thing on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nWe don't want to be dismissive, Hancock said before being just that. On the other hand, I don't anticipate any changes.\\n\\nThe playoff might soon find it has no choice.\\n\\nAccording to Broadcast & Cable, ESPN owes some $20 million in ad make-goods because the games' ratings didn't meet levels guaranteed to advertisers. Much of that will be made up during Monday night's title game between Alabama and top-ranked Clemson, or the NFL wild-card game between the Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans that airs on ESPN on Saturday afternoon.\\n\\nAs is standard practice with any sponsored television event, inventory is managed and contingencies are put in place to protect advertisers, ESPN said in a statement. The specifics of those deals vary and we work with our advertisers to make them whole in the event of a shortfall.\\n\\nCollege Football Playoff remains committed to New Year's Eve games\\n\\nOf course ESPN is going to say all the right things. It's only two years into a 12-year deal to air the playoff games, with side deals for the other New Year's Six bowls.\\n\\nStill, a network that was already trying to pare costs can't be happy that it's taking a financial hit from what should be a gold mine. Not only that, but advertisers are already expressing concern about next year's ratings, when the semifinals again are on New Year's Eve.\\n\\nWe're going to have to look at all the numbers, Hancock said. But we will not make a knee-jerk reaction after one year.\\n\\nNo one's asking playoff officials to make a knee-jerk decision.\\n\\nJust the right one.\\n\\nGALLERY: CLEMSON'S PATH TO THE TITLE GAME\\n\\nGALLERY: ALABAMA'S PATH TO THE TITLE GAME"}
{"original": "It may seem like an uncomfortable time for Americans to travel overseas. The standoff between the United States and Iran, the political unrest from Hong Kong to South America, and the raging wildfires in Australia, are just a few of the flashpoints.\\n\\nThe stress level dialed up even more this week, as Iran attacked U.S. military bases in Iraq, and a Ukraine International Boeing 737 crashed after takeoff in Iran's capital.\\n\\nWhat steps should travelers take to prepare themselves and their families?\\n\\nThe answer could be as simple as having updated travel documents or the right kind of insurance and making sure loved ones know how to reach you.\\n\\nIt also could mean knowing where the highest-risk areas are before you book the trip.\\n\\nYou never know where things can go wrong, said Karin King, deputy assistant secretary for Overseas Citizen Services.\\n\\nThe U.S. State Department encourages those traveling or living abroad to enroll in its Smart Traveler Enrollment Program. The program sends alerts to Americans about the conditions in their destination country. It also helps the U.S. Embassy contact Americans in case of an emergency and helps travelers reach family and friends if the usual channels of communication are disrupted.\\n\\nWith hot spots popping up all over the globe, King said Americans should take precautions when they travel.\\n\\nThe State Department has personnel worldwide who keep close watch on events, around the clock. It rates the conditions in each country on a scale of 1 to 4, with 1 meaning exercise normal precautions and 4 meaning do not travel.\\n\\nIf someone is contemplating travel anywhere in the world, they should take a look, King said.\\n\\nCurrently, the department rates France and Hong Kong as a Level 2, which means travelers should exercise increased caution because of recent demonstrations by people protesting government policies.\\n\\nThe South American countries of Chile, Ecuador and Bolivia also fall into the Level 2 category because of recent demonstrations.\\n\\nIt rates Mexico a 2 because of crime and kidnappings, though the risk varies according to the region. Colombia is rated a 2 because of crime and terrorism, the risk also varying with the region. Israel gets a 2because of the risk of terrorism amid Middle East tensions.\\n\\nNot every country requires that kind of close monitoring, King said. If there is a substantial change, we will let U.S. citizens know.\\n\\nCountries such as Venezuela, Iran, Iraq and Syria are rated a 4, meaning do not travel, because of violent demonstrations, the threat of terrorist attacks and ongoing conflicts.\\n\\nAs wildfires continue in Australia, the U.S. Embassy there last week advised tourists to leave the hardest-hit areas, following the advice of local and regional authorities. The State Department on Wednesday raised Australia's risk level to 2 because of the fires.\\n\\nNow is really the time to keep track of where the fires are, King said of the worsening situation in Australia.\\n\\nKing said the department gives the same information to the public as it gives to its own personnel. If the risk level rises to a 3 or 4 and the department begins to draw down its own staff, civilians will be similarly advised.\\n\\nIf you're going to a higher-risk area, monitor the news, stay in touch with local law enforcement, King said. Let people who care about you know where you are.\\n\\nWhat should Americans do when things get dangerous?\\n\\nThe answer is go to the airport and get a commercial flight out, King said.\\n\\nShe acknowledged that there can be situations where that isn't possible.\\n\\nWhen Israel launched a war on Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006, King said the State Department evacuated its staff to Cyprus, where it assisted Americans who needed to leave. They were transported on military ships.\\n\\nWe were there to greet civilians who got off the boats, King said.\\n\\nThough King said the State Department will work to find alternate transportation to a safe haven, Americans must reimburse the U.S. government for any travel on its dime.\\n\\nPreparation guide for traveling abroad\\n\\nMake sure you have adequate insurance coverage. King said employer-sponsored health plans don't always cover medical care overseas. She recommends looking at supplemental insurance policies before you begin your trip.\\n\\nKnow how to contact the embassy. King said the Smart Traveler Enrollment program is the best way to keep connected. You will get push alerts, she said.\\n\\nHave a plan to communicate with loved ones. If you're traveling with family or friends, agree on a place where everyone can meet in case of an emergency.\\n\\nMake sure your travel documents are up to date. Don't let your passport expire if you're getting close to the date.\\n\\nTravelers should also consider how to protect themselves from contagious diseases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization offer guidance on countries to avoid and vaccines to get."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nClemson coach Dabo Swinney had a strong message to deliver soon after his top-ranked Tigers were eliminated from the College Football Playoff — the run is not over.\\n\\nClemson, without NFL first-rounders in quarterback Deshaun Watson and receiver Mike Williams, were picked second in the ACC Atlantic this past summer. But the revamped Tigers rolled to a third consecutive Atlantic Coast Conference title and berth in College Football Playoff.\\n\\nClemson fell to No. 4 Alabama 24-6, its new faces on offense finally looking overmatched with something to learn against the Crimson Tides' suffocating defense.\\n\\nIt was a disappointment for sure, Swinney said. But one the team will learn from, grow from and return from.\\n\\nMy expectation is to be right back here next year, right back in the middle of it, right back in the thick of it, Swinney said. We have got a heck of a team coming back.\\n\\nParticularly on offense where quarterback Kelly Bryant,tailback Travis Etienne and receivers Ray-Ray McCloud, Tee Higgins and Amari Rodgers will have another year of experience. Bryant filled in capably for Watson, leading a changed attack that saw more emphasis on the ground instead of the air as Watson did in Clemson's national title season of 2016. Guard Taylor Hearn has said he'll go pro instead of playing a final season with the Tigers.\\n\\nDefense could be a bit trickier, depending on how many of Clemson's defensive line opts for the NFL. Defensive end Clelin Ferrell, the team's sacks leader this fall, and tackle Christian Wilkins are consensus first-round draft picks. Defensive end Austin Bryant, another underclassmen, is also weighing his options. The only certain to return is disruptive tackle Dexter Lawrence, a junior.\\n\\nPlayers have until January 15 to declare for the NFL draft.\\n\\nBryant, who was second on the Tigers with 11 rushing touchdowns, was upset about the defeat. He had little doubt, though, about his team's resolve heading into next year.\\n\\nThe mindset over there, he said of the Tigers. We stick together.\\n\\n___\\n\\nSome things to watch at Clemson this offseason:\\n\\nNFL DECISIONS: Wilkins, Ferrell and Bryant are not the only underclassmen considering whether to stay or go. All ACC tackle Mitch Hyatt, receiver Deon Cain, safety Van Smith and linebacker Kendall Joseph are all weighing their options. Most all in the postgame interviews said they were heading home for a few days to talk over their futures with their families before choosing. Wilkins, who has graduated, is a junior who asked to be honored with seniors on Clemson's senior day against Citadel on Nov. 18.\\n\\nQB BATTLE? Expect a healthy debate — at least among fans — about the starting quarterback job this offseason. While Bryant has excelled this year, many supporters are looking to incoming freshman Trevor Lawrence to supplant the senior next fall. Lawrence was rated the No. 1 overall prospect coming out of Cartersville High in Georgia. Swinney is loyal to upperclassmen, but may have regretted not starting then-freshman Deshaun Watson from game one in 2014 instead of senior Cole Stout in early losses at Georgia and Florida State. Watson took over after that.\\n\\nLEADERSHIP STABILITY: Don't look for significant change in Clemson's coaching staff as it looks like the Tigers will head into spring camp with its three prime coordinators — Brent Venables on defense, Tony Elliott and Jeff Scott on offense — in place. Each member of the trio was mentioned as potential candidates as coaching jobs came open, but ultimately stayed put. Venables will get to coach his son, linebacker Jake, next fall. Elliott and Scott both believe they've got more to learn as coordinators before taking a head coaching job.\\n\\nETN: Look for Travis Etienne to take full control of the running back spot next fall. Etienne was a freshman — and one of Clemson's last recruits in the winter of 2017 — who showed breakaway speed and tackle-breaking abilities to lead the Tigers with 766 yards and a school freshman record of 13 touchdowns. He got lost in blocking schemes at times, but count on that to improve under running backs coach Tony Elliott.\\n\\nRELOADING: Quarterback Trevor Lawrence isn't the only five stars to join the Tigers next year. Clemson will feature defensive ends Xavier Thomas and K.J. Henry and offensive lineman Jackson Carman. Lawrence was the state of Georgia's No. 1 prospect, while Thomas held that distinction in Florida, Henry in North Carolina and Carman in Ohio.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college football: https://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}
{"original": "Even with the regular season complete, early January can be an odd time to declare anything firm about the NFL draft.\\n\\nThe Senior Bowl, scouting combine and free agency are all still ahead, and several teams are without coaches and/or general managers. Meanwhile, the order for the full first round has not been set, as the playoffs will determine the final 14 slots. All of those developments are sure to shape the outlook for many organizations and prospects, leaving considerable doubt about how the first 32 picks might pan out.\\n\\nBut the conversation about the draft is already ongoing and will only intensify in the coming weeks. And while predicting the early picks this far out can be precarious, some early projections prove insightful. At this time last year, for instance, USA TODAY Sports correctly forecasted the first six picks of the 2020 draft.\\n\\nWith all that in mind, here's our first-round NFL mock draft for 2021, based on the current order for the top 18 picks and projected order of finish for playoff teams.\\n\\n1. Jaguars — Trevor Lawrence, QB, Clemson: We've already reached nitpicking season in the first week of January. Yes, Lawrence was outplayed by Justin Fields in the College Football Playoff semifinal that ended the Clemson star's decorated collegiate career. And the Jaguars should — and will — comb over all of their options, including Fields, at this spot. But this shouldn't be a difficult decision. Lawrence is every bit the singular quarterback and franchise-changing prospect he has been billed as for years. Any drama about this selection in the coming months is likely to be merely for show.\\n\\n2. Jets — Zach Wilson, QB, BYU: For some time, the Jets' choice here will be depicted as a consolation prize for a franchise that squandered its inside track on landing Lawrence. Yet there are several options poised to amount to far more than that in the long run. Bypassing one of the top quarterbacks to stick with Sam Darnold for another year seems like a tough sell, especially given that Wilson and Justin Fields likely would be seen as deserving No. 1 picks in a different year. For now, a slight edge goes to Wilson, a dynamic downfield thrower who frequently makes dazzling completions look easy.\\n\\n3. Dolphins (from Texans) — Ja'Marr Chase, WR, LSU: Afforded this selection thanks to the Laremy Tunsil trade with Houston, Miami once again finds itself faced with a quarterback decision. Though Tua Tagovailoa didn't enjoy the same personal highs as classmates Justin Herbert and Joe Burrow, the Dolphins will be hard-pressed to take another passer this high unless they're bowled over by one that falls to this slot. Equipping Tagovailoa with Chase, who torched elite opposition en route to multiple Southeastern Conference records last year before opting out in 2020, might stand as the savviest way to return the quarterback to a more freewheeling form.\\n\\n4. Falcons — Justin Fields, QB, Ohio State: As Atlanta looks to hire a new coach and general manager, the true measuring stick for the extent of the team's rebuild will be the steps it takes toward replacing Matt Ryan and Julio Jones. The Falcons might be a year away from moving on from either one, but Fields can help start a new chapter for the franchise whenever it chooses to turn the page.\\n\\n5. Bengals — Penei Sewell, OT, Oregon: Whether chalked up to shoddy protection or merely a stroke of bad luck, Joe Burrow's torn anterior cruciate ligament in Week 11 affirmed that Cincinnati's current setup along the offensive line is untenable for its franchise centerpiece. If Sewell is still available at this point, the 2019 Outland Trophy winner would be a no-brainer for the Bengals, as he would afford Burrow some much needed peace of mind upon the quarterback's return.\\n\\n6. Eagles — DeVonta Smith, WR, Alabama: The quarterback situation is murky. The defense needs reinforcements. Why, then, would the Eagles take a wide receiver, let alone a 175-pound one with a ho-hum physical profile? Simple: Smith is a well-rounded and refined target capable of elevating a Philadelphia passing attack that otherwise looks to be in disrepair.\\n\\n7. Lions — Micah Parsons, LB, Penn State: Where does Detroit start with overhauling a defense that ranked last in yards and points allowed? Given the Lions' modest cap space before addressing wide receiver Kenny Golladay, investing early and often in the draft has to be a priority. Parsons has a strong claim to the title of the draft's most explosive defender, and he's a standout in almost any assignment.\\n\\n8. Panthers — Trey Lance, QB, North Dakota State: Teddy Bridgewater's viability as Carolina's starter took a significant hit when Matt Rhule left the team's outlook at quarterback open after benching the veteran in the season finale against the Saints. The 6-3, 224-pound Lance would change the face of the offense with his deep-throwing prowess and ability to burn teams on designed runs and scrambles. Given that Lance has started just 17 games at the Football Championship Subdivision level, Bridgewater could stay on as a starter and mentor until it's time to hand over the reins to the Panthers' attack.\\n\\n9. Broncos — Caleb Farley, CB, Virginia Tech: It's a new day in Denver as John Elway cedes control of the roster to a forthcoming hire at general manager. Though adding a quarterback to compete with Drew Lock should be a consideration somewhere along the way, the Broncos would be wise to grab Farley, who has an ideal combination of size (6-2, 207 pounds) and speed to match up with NFL receivers.\\n\\n10. Cowboys — Patrick Surtain II, CB, Alabama: A defense that yielded 473 points, a franchise-worst, can't be expected to make significant progress with simply another year in Mike Nolan's system. Despite being seldom tested late in his career at Alabama, Surtain is one of this class' most proven entities given his track record of sticking with top receivers.\\n\\n11. Giants — Kwity Paye, DE, Michigan: After getting by with a lackluster pass rush, the Giants are due for an infusion of athleticism off the edge. With his head-turning blend of burst and power, Paye would be an immediate standout for Big Blue.\\n\\n12. 49ers — Rashawn Slater, OT, Northwestern: Any attempt to upgrade from Jimmy Garoppolo likely will have to take place via free agency or trade, whether that be for a veteran or one of the top four signal-callers in this draft. Should it stand pat in this slot, San Francisco might look to address its offensive line, especially if Trent Williams doesn't return.\\n\\n13. Chargers — Kyle Pitts, TE, Florida: Call this the 2021 version of the Cowboys scooping up CeeDee Lamb. With no offensive lineman worthy of this slot, the Chargers can instead score tremendous value in Pitts, a supersized target who can flummox defenses with his speed and keep Herbert's development on track even if Hunter Henry goes elsewhere.\\n\\n14. Vikings — Gregory Rousseau, DE, Miami (Fla.): Mike Zimmer's remark that this year's defense was the worst one I've ever had no doubt will shape Minnesota's offseason. The Vikings might have to part with some key defensive figures if they can't restructure several deals, so replenishing the roster with a disruptive talent like Rousseau looks to be a vital move.\\n\\n15. Patriots — Mac Jones, QB, Alabama: Bill Belichick can't afford any more half measures at quarterback after the Cam Newton experiment fizzled in New England's first losing season in two decades. The answer might materialize in free agency or the trade market, or perhaps earlier in the draft via trade. But even though this might be considered high for Jones, his superlative accuracy and poise could entice Belichick.\\n\\n16. Cardinals — Jaylen Waddle, WR, Alabama: An electric receiver whose 22.3 yards per catch in 2020 reflected his knack for both stretching defenses deep and taking short passes the distance, Waddle would be the perfect running mate for DeAndre Hopkins.\\n\\n17. Raiders — Azeez Ojulari, LB, Georgia: A breakout performer in his redshirt sophomore campaign, Ojulari has established himself as one of the most promising edge rushers in this class and a clear asset to a Las Vegas defense that ranked 29th with 21 sacks.\\n\\n18. Dolphins — Jeremiah Owusu-Koramoah, LB, Notre Dame: His exact role in the NFL might be difficult to determine after he operated as a linebacker/safety hybrid, but Owusu-Koramoah should fit in nicely in Miami thanks to his ability to handle both tight ends and running backs in coverage.\\n\\n19. Washington — Christian Darrisaw, OT, Virginia Tech: Should Ron Rivera look to stay the course with Alex Smith at quarterback, the most reasonable route for Washington to buoy its offense might be bringing on a stalwart tackle.\\n\\n20. Bears — Jalen Mayfield, OT, Michigan: Rather than look for a Mitchell Trubisky replacement, the playoff-bound Bears now appear more inclined to provide the offense with a steady blocker, which might point them toward Mayfield.\\n\\n21. Jaguars (from Rams) — Sam Cosmi, OT, Texas: Already equipped with the frame (6-7, 310 pounds), movement skills and knowhow of an NFL left tackle, Cosmi would provide an added degree of comfort for Jacksonville as Lawrence's blindside protector.\\n\\n22. Colts — Jaycee Horn, CB, South Carolina: Unless Indianapolis opts to move on from Philip Rivers in favor of a long-term option at quarterback, the Colts can instead bolster their already formidable defense with the pesky Horn.\\n\\n23. Browns — Zaven Collins, LB, Tulsa: At 6-4 and 260 pounds with impressive coverage ability and burgeoning pass-rushing skills, Collins is the kind of playmaker Cleveland needs at the second level.\\n\\n24. Titans — Joseph Ossai, LB/DE, Texas: If Tennessee is to make the leap into the AFC's elite tier, it will need to add a hard-charging edge presence like Ossai to invigorate its flatlining pass rush.\\n\\n25. Buccaneers — Jayson Oweh, DE, Penn State: Regardless of whether Shaquil Barrett re-signs, Tampa Bay should look to invest in another edge presence. Oweh did not record a sack in seven games this season, but his rare burst and closing speed signal a much more fruitful pro career.\\n\\n26. Ravens — Rashod Bateman, WR, Minnesota: Reliability at wide receiver has long proven elusive in Baltimore. Bateman, with an aggressive-yet-polished playing style and penchant for aiding quarterbacks when a play breaks down, could become a fast favorite of Lamar Jackson.\\n\\n27. Jets (from Seahawks) — Alijah Vera-Tucker, G, USC: After Joe Douglas bemoaned not equipping Darnold with the proper supporting cast, the fleet-footed and versatile Vera-Tucker would help the Jets GM set things right for his 2021 quarterback — whoever that might be.\\n\\n28. Steelers — Landon Dickerson, C/G, Alabama: As easy as it might be to connect Pittsburgh to a potential Ben Roethlisberger successor with this pick, fortifying the front with a stabilizing presence like Dickerson seems like a move more befitting the franchise, so long as the veteran quarterback returns for another year.\\n\\n29. Saints — Derion Kendrick, CB, Clemson: Many tough cap decisions loom in New Orleans, with the secondary looking primed to be hit particularly hard.\\n\\n30. Bills — Tyson Campbell, CB, Georgia: Adept at smothering receivers with his 6-2, 185-pound frame, Campbell has the profile that NFL teams covet in cornerbacks.\\n\\n31. Packers — Kadarius Toney, WR, Florida: Aaron Rodgers finally gets his first-round receiver in Toney, who would thrive with the open-field opportunities afforded to him by playing opposite Davante Adams.\\n\\n32. Chiefs — Jaelan Phillips, DE, Miami (Fla.): Their core in place for at least the near term, the defending champions can swing big by taking on Phillips, who retired from football in 2018 due to injuries but displayed his tantalizing physical tools and skill set in his return this season.\\n\\nFollow Michael Middlehurst-Schwartz on Twitter @MikeMSchwartz."}
{"original": "Congress' count of the Electoral College, a normally symbolic affair affirming the president-elect's victory, is set to be a contentious, lengthy process when the House and Senate convene in a joint session to count the electoral votes on Wednesday.\\n\\nIn an effort that has divided the Republican Party, over a dozen Senate Republicans and at least 50 House Republicans are set to object to the counting of electoral votes from states that President Donald Trump contested after Election Day. No Democrats are expected to object to the results.\\n\\nTrump has urged Republican lawmakers to join the objections, but the effort is unlikely to succeed because a majority of both the House and Senate is needed to exclude any electoral votes.\\n\\nCongress is set to meet on Wednesday at 1 p.m. EST as protesters descend on Washington. Here is what to expect:\\n\\nWhat is the procedure for the count?\\n\\nMembers of the House of Representatives and Senate will meet in a joint session in the House Chamber to count the electoral votes and declare an official winner. States already certified the results of their own elections. The procedures for the session come from the Electoral Count Act of 1887.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence is expected to preside over the joint session in his role as president of the Senate. If Pence is not present, the most senior member of the Senate, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, will preside. Leaders of both major parties will also appoint lawmakers from both chambers to serve as tellers.\\n\\nPence will open certificates of the electoral votes from each state – whose electors met to cast their ballots Dec. 14 – and hand them to the tellers to read aloud. As they read a state's certificate, Pence will call for objections to the state's votes.\\n\\nTo be considered, objections must be made in writing and endorsed by at least one member of both the House and Senate.\\n\\nAny objection that meets that criteria will result in a suspension of the joint session, at which time the House and Senate will convene separately to consider the issue.\\n\\nThe debate on each objection is limited to two hours. Each member may speak only for one, five-minute stint, and the fissures among the GOP on the objections will put some Republicans in the unusual situation of arguing on the same side as Democrats against the wishes of the president.\\n\\nPast dramatic moments:Congress' count of Electoral College votes could be most contentious in 144 years\\n\\nRep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., co-chair of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, told reporters on a conference call Tuesday he expected to see Republicans having an honest debate on this issue, even as GOP members of his group took different sides.\\n\\nOn the House side, Democrats have chosen several lawmakers who are well-versed in the Constitution and law to lead their rebuttals of any GOP challenges on specific states. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., will preside over any debate in the House.\\n\\nSenate Democrats have a similar tactic in place, planning to cite Republican officials and judges in each state that certified the results of the election.\\n\\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, who will be guiding some of the debate for Democrats, told USA TODAY the debate in the Senate will look different than it would in the House and would display a bipartisan pushback and that's how our debate will be structured.\\n\\nI think you're going to see a different flavor to the argument in the Senate because we will have a number of strong figures on the Republican side who are joining us in this, Klobuchar noted, adding that she has spoken with many Republicans over the days as the Senate prepares.\\n\\nRepublicans in both the House and Senate have spoken out against the effort to object to the electoral vote counting.\\n\\nShe added that in each state, Democratic senators, through their five-minute speeches, will display the key Republican officials in the state that certified results or pushed back on Trump's claims of fraud.\\n\\nIn all of these states, we will be emphasizing the fact that it wasn't just one party that certified these elections. In some states, it was a dominant Republican Party, Klobuchar said.\\n\\nSenate Republicans do not appear to have a set plan on how the day will look. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is allowing his fractured conference to vote as they will on objections after making his thoughts on the process well-known early on, according to a GOP aide who was not authorized to speak publicly on the plans.\\n\\nDespite McConnell's opposition to lodging objections, he has spoken with senators individually to offer guidance, but no formal plan has been sent to members of the conference.\\n\\nLarge protests are expected across Washington on Wednesday, and the president is sure to keep tabs on the events.\\n\\nAfter debate concludes, the House and Senate will vote.\\n\\nA simple majority in both chambers is required to uphold the objection and throw out the state's votes. Short of that, the objection is disposed of and the state's electoral votes are counted as cast.\\n\\nAfter all the votes are counted, it falls to Pence to declare the winner of the election.\\n\\n'We'll hear the objections':Vice President Mike Pence promises Georgia voters\\n\\nSo far, Pence – who has not acknowledged that Trump lost his bid for reelection – has remained relatively quiet on his role in the electoral vote count process.\\n\\nOn Dec. 28, Republicans including Texas Rep. Louie Gohmert filed a lawsuit in federal court to authorize Pence to pick and choose which electoral votes to accept or reject. In a filing Dec. 31, Pence asked the judge to dismiss the suit, which his brief called a walking legal contradiction.\\n\\nThe suit has since been dismissed by courts because of Gohmert's lack of standing.\\n\\nTrump has publicly pressured Pence to intervene in the proceedings.\\n\\nI hope Mike Pence comes through for us, Trump said at a rally in Georgia on Monday night. He's going to have a lot to say about it.\\n\\nThe Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors, Trump tweeted Tuesday.\\n\\nState officials have not found evidence of widespread fraud in any of the states contested by Trump, and Pence does not have the power to reject electors. Under the 12th Amendment, Pence's role is just to open all the certificates and preside over their counting.\\n\\nWho is objecting?\\n\\nAt least three states will draw objections from both senators and members of the House, starting the process for Congress to debate the counting of electoral votes from them.\\n\\nOver a dozen Republican senators have said they will object, including Sen. Kelly Loeffler, R-Ga., who is likely to object to the results in Georgia.\\n\\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, spearheaded a group of senators who said they would join in House lawmakers' objections. Cruz will object to the Arizona results, according to a source familiar with his plans not authorized to speak on the record.\\n\\nAnother Republican senator, Josh Hawley of Missouri, is likely to object to the votes from Pennsylvania.\\n\\nOn the House side, Rep. Mo Brooks led the charge and has met with the White House about his proposal. The Alabama Republican said in a Jan. 4 statement he would object to results from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – states whose electoral processes he said were badly flawed and untrustworthy.\\n\\nMore:The members of Congress who are planning to object to Joe Biden's Electoral College win\\n\\nHowever, some top Republican lawmakers have argued against objecting to the results.\\n\\nRep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the third-ranking House Republican, circulated a memo among GOP lawmakers calling the objections directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans, according to a source familiar with the memo.\\n\\nAnd Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., a member of Senate Republican leadership, told reporters he would not support the effort, adding, I actually like to come up with plans that have a chance of being successful.\\n\\nHave there been objections before?\\n\\nObjections to electoral votes are rare.\\n\\nIn 2017, half a dozen House Democrats objected to electoral votes for Trump, citing voter suppression and potential interference from Russia.\\n\\nBut Joe Biden, then-vice president and president of the Senate, repeatedly slammed his gavel and rejected the effort because they lacked a Senate sponsor.\\n\\nIt is over, he said, to applause from Republicans.\\n\\nJust twice – in 1969 and 2005 – have there been objections that met the criteria to require the House and Senate to debate and vote.\\n\\nIn 1969, the objection was over a faithless elector from North Carolina who voted for George Wallace instead of Richard Nixon. The objection to the faithless elector was rejected by both chambers.\\n\\nIn 2005, the objection was over electoral votes in Ohio cast for George W. Bush.\\n\\nSen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., joined Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, in the action, which they said was to raise awareness about voter suppression.\\n\\nThis objection does not have at its root the hope or even the hint of overturning the victory of the president, Tubbs Jones said at the time. But it is a necessary, timely and appropriate opportunity to review and remedy the most precious process in our democracy.\\n\\nThe objection was roundly defeated, receiving a single vote in the Senate, from Boxer herself, and just 31 votes in the House, all from Democrats.\\n\\nCould an objection succeed?\\n\\nIn short, no. Like the two previous objections, there is virtually no chance that any challenges lodged will succeed.\\n\\nThe most straightforward reason the objections will fail is that they must be approved by both chambers, and Democrats control the House.\\n\\nThe Senate is harder to predict. The runoff for seats in Georgia that will determine control of the Senate takes place just a day before, on Jan. 5.\\n\\nLoeffler is still seated as a U.S. senator because she was appointed to fill a term going through 2023, but Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., who was also up for reelection in Tuesday's runoffs, is no longer a senator after his term lapsed Sunday.\\n\\nRepublicans still maintain a majority. But top Republican leaders like McConnell have declined to publicly back the objections. Only a handful of Republican senators need to vote against the objections for them to fail, assuming all Democrats vote against the objections.\\n\\nIn late December, Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters that an objection would go down like a shot dog in the Senate.\\n\\nI just don't think it makes a lot of sense to put everybody through this when you know what the ultimate outcome is going to be, said Thune, who is from South Dakota.\\n\\nRegardless of the outcome in the Senate, without the approval of the House, objections will not change the Electoral College vote totals.\\n\\nThough the challenges are doomed to fail, they will extend the vote-counting process far longer than normal.\\n\\nThe joint session took just 23 minutes in 2013 and 41 minutes in 2017, according to the Congressional Research Service. Not this time.\\n\\nIf all six planned objections from the House receive support from a member of the Senate, total debate time could exceed 12 hours, and the process could take over 24 hours once time to clean the chamber and time for votes is factored in, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told reporters Monday.\\n\\nRecesses are also allowed under the law governing the counting of electoral votes, though it is unclear whether Congress will take breaks.\\n\\nIf that's the case, the meeting could wrap up sometime Thursday – or later – ending, at long last, the presidential election.\\n\\nContributing: Christal Hayes"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nKAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) — On the day PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan announced more than $180 million given to charities last year, he shared how the tour turned to Jack Nicklaus to help protect golf's model for raising money.\\n\\nThe tax-exempt status of the PGA Tour and other sports leagues was in jeopardy late last year under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Part of the Senate version of the bill included a subsection called, Repeal of Tax-Exempt Status for Professional Sports Leagues.\\n\\nThat's when Monahan decided to call Nicklaus at his office, but he dialed his mobile phone.\\n\\nHe whispers, 'Hello?' Monahan said Sunday at the Sentry Tournament of Champions. I said, 'I need your help.' I walked him through the whole scenario. I said, 'I need you to make some phone calls and write some letters. We need to go full bore on this thing.'\\n\\nNicklaus whispered because he was in a field in upstate New York. He told the commissioner he'd get started when he got back to Florida.\\n\\nMonahan said Nicklaus wrote letters and called senators. Meanwhile, Davis Love III went up to Washington a week after having hip surgery and helped arrange for meetings with members of the Senate Finance Committee.\\n\\nGolf Digest reported in December that PGA of America chief executive Pete Bevacqua said he contacted his political contacts. Ultimately, the provision was not in the final version of the Senate bill.\\n\\nIt's pretty amazing that Jack Nicklaus and Davis Love III were reaching out to their congressmen and women, Monahan said.\\n\\nIf the provision had remained in the bill, it could have required the PGA Tour to change its structure in a way that would reduce tax incentives to attract corporate support that makes charitable giving possible. All net proceeds from PGA Tour events go to local charities, and corporate support helps pay bills from prize money to operational costs.\\n\\nMonahan said the $180 million that PGA Tour events generated last year broke last year's record by about $14 million. That includes donations from tournaments on all six of its tours — PGA, Champions, Web.com, Canada, Latin America and China.\\n\\nPGA Tour events have raised $2.65 billion dating to a $10,000 donation from the Palm Beach Invitational in 1938.\\n\\nIt's a big part of who we are, Monahan said. We like to think we do it better than anyone else. It's our scorecard, if you will."}

She's going off on new adventures and a new life — but does that mean she's a new Valerie?\\n\\nMaybe, says Watkins. What I love about this show is that the characters do change and grow and evolve and have new problems, while staying basically the same people, she told television critics Saturday. Like real people, she says, the characters on Casual don't change who we are; we change how we manage our life based on our experiences.\\n\\nThe new batch of episodes, says creator Zander Lehmann, will be more openly comedic and a little less serialized. But just as the characters will stay essentially the same, so will the show. I think we're good at the specific thing we're doing, says Lehmann, and I hope people relate to it."}
{"original": "Cecil Hurt\\n\\nThe Tuscaloosa News\\n\\nFor Alabama football fans, there was no need to be convinced. DeVonta Smith did that on the field, and while there may have been split allegiances because of the viable candidacies of quarterback Mac Jones and running back Najee Harris, it was Smith who was the focal point of college football's most prolific offense.\\n\\nThe sole questions were whether a wide receiver, even one as dynamic as Smith, had a chance against the overwhelming power of statistics. Alabama doesn't have the only explosive offense in college football. Offenses everywhere have exploded. While that does increase numbers for receivers, it causes potential exponential growth in a passing quarterback's output.\\n\\nEven a decade ago, a 4,000-yard passing season at one of college football's power programs would have netted not only a Heisman, but also a ticker-tape parade all the way from campus to New York City.\\n\\nThis year, Smith was able to win the Heisman Trophy, overcoming passing prodigies like his teammate, Jones, as well as Florida's Kyle Trask. Trevor Lawrence of Clemson didn't have quite those eye-popping numbers, although he had the double impetus of career achievement (including a College Football Playoff championship as a freshman) and the endorsement of NFL draft analysts as the best available pro prospect. Ohio State's Justin Fields was done in by Ohio State's short season and his own inconsistent play at times, although his performance against Clemson in the Sugar Bowl would have impressed voters had ballots not been submitted a week earlier.\\n\\nNational title game:COVID-19 wreaking havoc with college football to the very end\\n\\nThe next level:Ranking last 25 Heisman Trophy winners based on NFL success\\n\\nNext year's early favorites will probably be quarterbacks like Spencer Rattler at Oklahoma, although being the early favorite hasn't always paid off recently. The running back crop seems stronger.\\n\\nFull disclosure: My Heisman vote went to Smith, as we voters can now reveal. He seemed easily the most deserving, and would have seemed so whether he played in Tuscaloosa or Tucson. The greatest argument, for me, wasn't statistical. The fact that he elevated his game to another level after Jaylen Waddle's injury, to the point that Alabama's entire offense didn't miss a beat, was even more striking.\\n\\nWhile Smith is no novelty winner, there also is some fresh air at an interruption of the quarterback hegemony. There will be plenty of quarterbacks ahead, and even Smith's win – the first for a wide receiver this century – doesn't change the fact that offensive skill players are overwhelmingly likely to win. We aren't at the point yet where a dominant defender like a Chase Young (Ohio State) or Jonathan Allen (Alabama), much less an offensive lineman like former Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson, can win.\\n\\nBut as the Heisman electorate grows younger, and social media grows more influential, such candidacies can blossom even without the ESPN highlights that are so necessary for winners these days.\\n\\nWe aren't yet at the point of seeing a Khalil Mack or Aaron Donald or Derrick Thomas at the Heisman podium. But maybe that's a little bit more imaginable today than it was a few years ago.\\n\\nReach Cecil Hurt at cecil@tidesports.com or via Twitter @cecilhurt"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nThe Buffalo Bills' long-awaited playoff appearance might not have been so short-lived had their coaching staff played the percentages and not a hunch in their 10-3 loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars.\\n\\nOn first-and-goal from the Jaguars 1, coach Sean McDermott and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison elected to call a run-pass option instead of asking quarterback Tyrod Taylor to either run it in himself or hand it off to running back LeSean McCoy against one of the most vulnerable run defenses in the playoffs.\\n\\nI want a running play, McCoy said. It was a play I was lobbying for the whole time and it didn't work out ...\\n\\nInstead, Taylor lofted a fade pass toward the left corner of the end zone where Kelvin Benjamin was whistled for offensive pass interference on All-Pro cornerback Jalen Ramsey, pushing the Bills back 10 yards.\\n\\nThe drive stalled from there and Stephen Haushka's 31-yard field goal was all the Bills had to show for their 18-play, 71-yard drive that took 8:06, their only decent drive all game.\\n\\nMcDermott also botched the end of the first half by calling pass plays on second-and-6 at his 14 (incomplete) and the next down (5-yard completion to Zay Jones in which he was pushed out of bounds).\\n\\nInstead of taking a knee and heading to the locker room with a 3-0 lead, the Bills gave the Jaguars the ball back with enough time to get into field goal range and score and gain some momentum heading into the locker room.\\n\\nThe Bills' curious play call, however, paled in contrast to the series of odd calls by referee Jeff Triplette's playoff crew in Kansas City, where the Tennessee Titans overcame an 18-point halftime deficit to shock the Chiefs 22-21.\\n\\nHorrible way to start the playoffs, tweeted Mike Pereira , the former NFL officiating chief turned Fox sports analyst. I hate to say it, but this was not a good performance by the crew. Teams and fans deserve better.\\n\\nA day later, Pereira praised both Tony Corrente's crew in New Orleans and John Hussey's crew in Jacksonville, adding, Yesterday is a memory. I feel bad for Jeff Triplette. He is a great man who was part of a crew that did not have a good game. I feel bad that he is retiring under this cloud.\\n\\nAfter Marcus Mariota caught his own deflected pass for a touchdown Saturday, Triplette explained that the Titans quarterback was an eligible receiver because he had lined up in the shotgun formation rather than under center.\\n\\nThere is no such rule in the NFL.\\n\\nWhenever a defensive player deflects a pass, every offensive player is allowed to catch the ricochet, including the quarterback and it matters not where he lined up when the play began.\\n\\nThen, there was the very quick whistle that negated a fumble recovery by Justin Houston after fellow linebacker Derrick Johnson sacked Mariota in the second quarter.\\n\\nMariota fumbled a split-second after contact, but Triplette said the QB's forward progress had been stopped before the fumble.\\n\\nForward progress is usually called when a running back is stopped and defenders are piling on him or several defenders drape a quarterback.\\n\\nHardly ever is it applied when a QB is going to the ground on initial contact by a single defender.\\n\\nAs a judgment call, Chiefs coach Andy Reid was helpless to throw his red challenge flag, and Ryan Succop kicked a field goal on the next play.\\n\\nThe defender hit him and he was driving him back, Triplette said after the game.\\n\\nThe officials had one more gaffe in them, one that was corrected on replay review.\\n\\nThe crew initially called a fumble on Titans running back Derrick Henry late in the fourth quarter, signaling touchdown when Johnson scooped up the ball and rumbled into the end zone as fireworks lit up the sky.\\n\\nThe replays showed he was down before the ball came loose.\\n\\nBefore wild-card weekend began, there were several notable calls concerning the Cincinnati Bengals.\\n\\nBills fans giddy over Buffalo ending the longest playoff drought in North American pro sports made a surge in donations to Andy Dalton's foundation , their way of thanking the Bengals QB for his role in the Bills' first invitation to the postseason party in 17 years.\\n\\nDalton's foundation received more than $300,000 in donations after the Bengals beat the Ravens 31-27 in the regular-season finale when Dalton threw a 49-yard TD pass with 44 seconds left to eliminate Baltimore and open a spot for Buffalo.\\n\\nI think I'm the hottest guy in Buffalo right now, Dalton said.\\n\\nWhile the Bills' long streak of playoff futility is over, the Bengals' streak continues. They haven't won a playoff game since the 1990 season, the sixth-longest streak of postseason futility in NFL history. They've lost all seven of their playoff games since that season, including an NFL-record five straight first-round defeats from 2011-15.\\n\\nThe Bengals missed out on the playoffs for a second straight season, going 7-9. They won their last two games, knocking the Lions and Ravens out of the playoff race.\\n\\nThat was enough for owner Mike Brown to give coach Marvin Lewis a two-year extension and two more chances to try to get the Bengals that playoff victory that has eluded him for 15 seasons.\\n\\nLewis has the second-longest active coaching tenure in the NFL, behind only Bill Belichick's 18 seasons with New England.\\n\\nUnlike Belichick, who has won five Super Bowls and made two other appearances in the title game, Lewis is 0-7 in the playoffs, the worst such coaching record in NFL history.\\n\\nIn Denver, John Elway thought long and hard about canning coach Vance Joseph after a 5-11 debut but decided to stick with him.\\n\\nHowever, Joseph fired a half dozen assistants, saying it was time to change the culture so we could get back to pushing our players to be the best that they can be.\\n\\nAll six of the fired coaches directed rookies who underperformed in 2017, so they're the ones shouldering the blame for Elway's so-far dismal draft class.\\n\\nElway said at his season-ending news conference he's not perfect and always striving to learn, but he took a jab at a reporter , suggesting that when he finally has this front office football job perfected, he'll retire and go into radio because then he'll be a fellow know-it-all.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nWith contributions from AP Sports Writers Mark Long, Dave Skretta and Joe Kay.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton"}
{"original": "Adam Tamburin\\n\\nThe Tennessean\\n\\nNASHVILLE — It was the wellspring of the civil rights movement in Nashville and one of the nation's premier educators of black leaders in the 19th and 20th centuries.\\n\\nAnd leaders at Fisk University hope a yearlong celebration of that rich history will serve as a springboard that helps them carve out a new niche in another era.\\n\\nFisk marks the 150th anniversary of its founding this year, and administrators are planning a long slate of events to mark the milestone, starting with a Founders' Day ceremony Saturday, the same day classes began in 1866.\\n\\nIn an exclusive interview this week with The Tennessean, Frank L. Sims, Fisk's interim president, said the anniversary presents an opportunity to look forward. Sims outlined the broad strokes of a new master plan meant to address longstanding challenges that have sometimes threatened to overshadow the university's historic legacy.\\n\\nMiss. honors legacy of civil rights martyr Vernon Dahmer\\n\\nWe had the stretch where we struggled with a few things, Sims said, referencing the university's well-publicized money problems. We believe that we managed through that and that we can now see a better and brighter future.\\n\\nThe success of Fisk's next phase will depend in part on leaders' ability to manage the recovery from decades of financial instability.\\n\\nFisk University's been broke since 1866, joked Reavis Mitchell, a Fisk professor who teaches a class on the history of the university. Fisk's legacy is well known within the United States for bringing together people from diverse backgrounds for conversations, but it's been very difficult to find support for that.\\n\\nRecent developments have highlighted those struggles while suggesting that conditions might be improving.\\n\\nFisk's accreditation with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges was put on a two-year probation that was lifted in 2013 after an overhaul of financial practices.\\n\\nAnd the university engaged in a seven-year legal battle to sell part of the Alfred Stieglitz Collection, which was donated to the university by Georgia O'Keeffe in 1949. The university eventually agreed to a multimillion-dollar deal to share the collection with the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Arkansas. It was a move that leaders at the time said helped keep the university from closing.\\n\\nThe Fisk board of trustees selected Sims to serve as interim president in September because of his extensive experience as a business executive. At the height of his professional career at Cargill Inc., Sims said, he managed an $8 billion branch of the company with 5,000 employees.\\n\\nSims said he is applying that experience to strengthen the university's financial practices. He also said administrators would use the sesquicentennial year to encourage hefty donations that would bankroll critical renovations to the university's residence halls, where run-ins with mold and bugs have become common over the years.\\n\\nFisk's academic programs have been a bright spot for the school even as its endowment has been precarious.\\n\\nAlumni earn more doctorate degrees in the natural sciences than minority graduates from any other college or university in the nation, officials say. And the school consistently ranks among the nation's best liberal arts colleges.\\n\\nThat pedigree is what drew sophomore Courtney Jack to Fisk. The pre-med and psychology major said her close relationships with peers and professors made the small school feel like a family.\\n\\nOther students are drawn in by past students' renowned roles in the civil rights movement. During an interview this week with three student leaders, legendary alumni such as W.E.B. Du Bois, Diane Nash and U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., came up often.\\n\\nSeeing that they were able to stand up for their rights, it's kind of like a model for us, if you will, of what we could possibly do, said junior Lamar Allen, who is vice president of the student government. That is a part of the Fisk legacy.\\n\\nFisk has built on its efforts to educate underrepresented minorities in recent years by making an intentional effort to offer scholarships to undocumented students who would have to pay expensive out-of-state tuition rates at Tennessee's public colleges. Mitchell, the historian, sees the move as a natural extension of Fisk's mission, and one that signals the long-term durability of its mission.\\n\\nYou have to continue to prepare people for the future. You can't lean on the past, Mitchell said. As long as there's a population in this country and people coming into this country which need opportunity and which need a welcoming environment to grow, to see themselves change, then there's a role for Fisk University."}
{"original": "BOSTON – On a sunny summer's day at historic Christopher Columbus Park on Boston's waterfront, it's hard to picture the dormant fury of the Atlantic Ocean as it laps softly at the creaking docks.\\n\\nBut one day, according to the city's climate projections,a massive storm driven by unusually high winds and high tides will pour water over the park's grassy rise and inundate the arbors where grape vines trail and newlyweds pose for photos. The waters will rush across the brick pavers onto Atlantic Avenue and flow toward historic Faneuil Hall and Quincy Market, where generations of tourists have learned about the Boston Tea Party. The floodwaters will threaten nearby Old North Church, where Paul Revere's ride kicked off, and lap at the edges of Bunker Hill.\\n\\nHigh tides and strong storms already regularly inundate the area, but this storm would be different. It's a vision that keeps Boston Mayor Marty Walsh up at night.\\n\\nThat's why Walsh is preparing to have the city spend billions of dollars over the next decade to try to blunt the effects of climate change on the city, including armoring Columbus Park and gently raising it to provide a buffer against the worst of what the Atlantic can throw.\\n\\nThe plans to harden Columbus Park and large portions of the city's 47 miles of shoreline are part of a massive but generally uncoordinated local-level effort across the country to fight the changes that will accompany the Earth as it continues warming.\\n\\nFrustrated by what they see as the Trump administration's decision to de-emphasize the danger posed by climate change, local government officials, nonprofit leaders and university researchers are busily forging ahead with limited resources in a piecemeal approach they say is better than nothing. They're hardening buildings, digging bigger storm drains and changing zoning laws to keep homes from being built in low-lying areas prone to flooding.\\n\\nWhile many cities and states are also trying to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to slow global warming, these more concrete efforts are aimed at mitigating the actual impacts of climate change, which many elected officials say is politically easier to tackle.\\n\\nClimate change is real and it's impacting our city right now, said Walsh. We just can't back down from the threat regardless of what's happening in Washington, D.C. I would love to have a strong federal partner. We don't have that right now. But that doesn't mean we stop.\\n\\nAn exhaustive federal report issued last month warned that climate change could, under a worst-case scenario, deliver a 10 percent hit to the nation's GDP by the end of the century. The 1,600-page National Climate Assessment details the climate and economic impacts U.S. residents will see if drastic action is not taken to address climate change.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump downplayed the report's findings, complaining that the United States is already very clean and that other countries aren't addressing climate change.\\n\\nI've seen it. I've read some of it. It's fine, Trump told reporters at the time. Speaking about the potential economic impacts, Trump said, I don't believe it.\\n\\nBroad scientific consensus says the Earth's climate is warming, and that humans are accelerating that process though the burning of fossil fuels. Climate change threatens the health and well-being of the American people by causing increasing extreme weather, changes to air quality, the spread of new diseases by insects and pests, and changes to the availability of food and water, the NCA researchers said.\\n\\nThe report says the changing climate poses a cascading series of linked risks, like storms destroying aging bridges and roads, which will then make it harder to move food and fuel around the country, and droughts making it harder for power plants across the West to safely generate electricity due to a lack of required cooling water. Meanwhile, larger insect populations in northern areas could bring more Lyme, West Nile and Zika infections to areas that were once free of them.\\n\\nEarth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in the history of modern civilization, primarily as a result of human activities, the report concluded.\\n\\nExperts say the devastating and unusually powerful hurricanes that have struck the East Coast over the past decade have done more than any politician could to raise awareness of just how much risk the nation faces. Heavy flooding in Texas, warming ocean waters in the Pacific Northwest and New England, and eroding islands in Alaska are adding even more weight. Scientists for years have been warning that ocean levels are rising, and that storms will become more violent.\\n\\nThe number of people having that conversation is larger today than it ever has been in the past, said Mark Misczak, who a longtime emergency manager who spent the bulk of his career as a Federal Emergency Management Agency leader under multiple presidents. The disasters, as terrible as it sounds, provide an opportunity to re-envision how things function and to consider that resiliency.\\n\\nAcross the country, communities large and small are drawing on university experts and nonprofit scientists to help chart their course, which they say must be laid down to prepare for future climate-related disasters.\\n\\nSome of the efforts are small, like Denver's decision to create a list of air-conditioned facilities where residents can take refuge during heat waves. Others are more ambitious: In Alaska, officials are preparing to relocate several native villages in danger of being washed away by seas that no longer freeze solid for months at a time. Many more fall into the middle, like the decision by Florida Keys officials to raise up portions of their low-lying roads to serve as flood barriers, or efforts by Austin, Texas, to reduce water consumption in anticipation of droughts in.\\n\\nIt's really simple: This isn't a political issue. The changes we are seeing firsthand are affecting our communities, our economies, affecting ways of life that have existed for millennia, said Michael LeVine of the nonprofit Ocean Conservancy, which has worked on climate change issues in Alaska. We simply don't have a choice. It is incumbent on us as Alaskans to work together. We are past the point of fighting about who did what, who caused what, or what the political consequences might be. Our way of life depends on adapting to the changes that are happening.\\n\\nFor many, dealing with climate change is inherently a political issue. A December report issued by the state of Texas about the need to future-proof the state from worsening natural disasters never directly mentions climate change, or the role that humans have played in emitting heat-trapping carbon dioxide by burning the oil and gas Texas has long been known for.\\n\\nRepublican Gov. Greg Abbott, in releasing the report, said it was impossible for him to say whether climate change is causing the worsening disasters hitting Texas.\\n\\nWe need to stop making the old mistakes in local development that expose homes and businesses to risks that only become apparent when disaster strikes, according to the report. To paraphrase the old saying, an ounce of preparation is worth a pound of cure.\\n\\nWhile climate change has largely broken down along partisan lines at the state and federal level, the nation's mayors have overwhelmingly put aside political parties to address the issue. A survey of mayors this year found that 57 percent of cities are planning to take climate-related actions in 2019. And dozens of the country's largest cities have committed to meeting the terms of the 2025 Paris Agreement on climate change, which Trump is withdrawing from on a national level.\\n\\nI think every mayor in the country would say it's their responsibility to do something, said James Brainard, the longtime mayor of Carmel, Indiana. Our mayors are not sitting back. The mayors are the closest elected officials to the people and the mayors can make this happen regardless of what the federal government does.\\n\\nBrainard, a Republican, said he doesn't consider climate change a political issue, but he acknowledged he sometimes has to tailor his message for different audiences. Liberal groups, for instance, love that the city replaced it's streetlights with LEDs, reducing electricity consumption and therefore the emission of greenhouse gasses. Conservative groups, he said, are usually more interested in the fact that the switch saves the city 20 percent on its electricity bill annually.\\n\\nNow, Carmel is installing solar panels to generate its own electricity, which will save taxpayers money and ensure the lights are more likely to stay on if a disaster knocks out major power lines outside city boundaries.\\n\\nEverybody sees local government as the pothole in front of their house, the zoning down the street. They don't think about these global issues, Brainard said. And I think it's the job of local leaders to explain why it's important and to lead on it.\\n\\nMany local officials say the federal government should play a stronger role in increasing a cohesive strategy to combat the effects of climate change, but find themselves frustrated by Trump's apparent willingness to dismiss scientific concerns. In absence of that leadership, they're forging ahead.\\n\\nThere's a sense from cities and states across the country that we want to be part of the solution, and that just because the federal government isn't doing it doesn't mean the United States isn't, said Sally Jewell, a former interior secretary in the Obama administration. We're not going to stop and wait for that (Trump administration) priority to change.\\n\\nJewell is now working at the University of Washington as a distinguished fellow with the College of the Environment and as chair of the advisory council for EarthLab, the university's new institute dedicated to connecting researchers with people on the front lines of climate change and environmental challenges.\\n\\nEarthLab offers solutions both large and small, including helping Washington state's oyster farmers deal with more acidic oceans by showing them how to adjust the PH level of the water surrounding young oysters, known as spats.\\n\\nMisczak said local governments often find success when they tie climate-resiliency efforts to impacts on local businesses. And he said that while the federal government can provide leadership, it's usually a series of seemingly small decisions made at the local level that can truly make a difference: Can homes be built in floodplains? How tough is the building code? Are local emergency services designed to operate in an actual emergency? Are emergency generators sitting in basements that could get flooded, or installed atop parking garages, where they'll be better protected?\\n\\nWe're getting better. But we're not doing enough yet. We're making progress. And the more we can showcase the solutions that have been effective, the more communities will consider building things that way from the start, said Misczak, who is now senior managing director at Witt O'Brien's, an international crisis and emergency response consulting company.\\n\\nBack in Boston, Walsh is trying to figure out how to get funding for the city's climate resiliency plan. Taxpayers will contribute 10 percent of all new capital funding in the city toward resilience, but the mayor knows he needs more help from businesses, and the state and federal government.\\n\\nThe city has already installed an approximately $100,000, 7-foot-high barrier in order to block floodwaters from the homes of 4,300 residents and at least 70 businesses in the East Boston neighborhood. The barrier across the East Boston Greenway normally lays flat across the path but can be raised during storms. Boston used to be more protected from storms and high tides by the tidal flats that surrounded the city, but those areas have either been developed on or dredged away to deepen the harbor.\\n\\nBigger solutions come with bigger price tags: Just fully protecting East Boston, home to Boston Logan International Airport, could cost the city up to $200 million. But city officials say that would ultimately prevent more than $443 million in estimated damage from a large storm. Researchers expect sea levels to rise 36 inches by 2070, leaving Boston with the likelihood of being flooded every month during the highest tide.\\n\\nThe city's overall climate resiliency plan has no official price tag, but Boston officials say it would pale in comparison to the damage done by a major hurricane: 2012's Superstorm Sandy did at least $32 billion in damage to New York City's streets, subway tunnels, homes and businesses, and killed at least 43 people. And that was just a single storm.\\n\\nWe're not just planning for the next storm we'll face, we're planning for the storms the next generation will face, Walsh said. Whatever the federal policy is, it's still going to be incumbent on local leaders to carry out these plans. There's no question that our environment is in trouble, and humans are responsible."}

She also served as CEO of the Metropolitan Wilmington Urban League.\\n\\nBut until this week, she had never served in elected office.\\n\\nShe began her career in politics as an intern and then a case worker for Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., when he was a congressman. She later became his adviser and labor secretary when he served as governor. Carper said at the Tuesday reception he often encouraged Rochester to run for mayor, but Rochester would reply that she wanted to serve as Delaware's congresswoman — even when he held the seat.\\n\\nI said, 'Well, I'm the congressman,'  he recalled, laughing. And she said, 'Well, I want your job.' I said, 'Like, Right now?'

{"original": "The Recording Academy is under fire again from critics who say the Grammys, music's most prestigious awards, routinely fail to appropriately honor females and artists of color.\\n\\nThe latest example comes from three contenders in the best children's album category who opted in December to turn down their nominations. All this year's nominees in that category are white. Grammys final round voting closes today.\\n\\nAlastair Moock, Dog on Fleas and the Okee Dokee Brothers wrote a joint letter asking that their names be removed from the final ballot. They said their genre is uniquely tasked with modeling fairness, kindness and inclusion and the nominations in their category did not reflect that objective.\\n\\nThe trio's letter, in its entirety, reads:\\n\\nAfter a week of soul searching, discussions with our black, brown, and white peers, and consultations with our families, we, the undersigned nominees in this category have come to the conclusion that it's in the best interest of our genre for us to decline our nominations. We respectfully ask that our names be removed from final round ballots. We are deeply grateful to the Recording Academy and its voting members for the honor we've received, but we can't in good conscience benefit from a process that has – both this year and historically – so overlooked women, performers of color, and most especially black performers. Unfortunately, this year's slate of all white nominees, only one of whom is female, is not an aberration for children's music. In the past 10 years, only about 6% of nominated acts have been black led or co-led, another 8% or so have been non-black POC-led, and around 30% have been female-led. These numbers would be disappointing in any category, but – in a genre whose performers are uniquely tasked with modeling fairness, kindness, and inclusion; in a country where more than half of all children are non-white; and after a year of national reckoning around race and gender – the numbers are unacceptable. We take full responsibility for putting ourselves in the position we're in. We chose to submit and distribute our albums to voters, even as we were aware of this category's past history of exclusion. We thought that this year – after recent national events, all the hard work of the Family Music Forward racial justice collective to bring attention to issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in our genre, and changes within the Academy itself designed to reduce bias – we might see a different outcome. We didn't, and the results are frankly an embarrassment for the field of children's music. We know that there are proposed changes already being discussed for this category – due, at least in part, to the vocal efforts of Family Music Forward in bringing attention to this year's results. If there's a role for us to play in helping to create positive change in this category going forward, we'd like to be a part of that work. But we also recognize that changes going forward can't alter the outcome of this or past years' nominations. We know that declining our nominations runs the risk of centering ourselves even further in this conversation. We're prepared for that criticism if it means helping to bring attention to the problem. And, in order to make sure this story is told in a well-rounded way and not purely through a white lens, we commit to including black and brown leadership from our genre in any future press interviews that may arise from our nominations, or our declining of them. We're hopeful that our statement today can be a small part of helping to heal some of the pain and anger amongst our peers, and that it will help bring us closer as a community. We don't pretend to have the answers, but we want to be part of the solution. We feel sure that, if we work together in the coming months and years, we can arrive at a better place for children's music – one that better serves all performers and families.\\n\\nThe Grammys have placed an increased emphasis on diversity in the past year, following criticism from Sean Diddy Combs during a speech at the 2020 Clive Davis pre-Grammy Gala.\\n\\nBlack music has never been respected by the Grammys to the point that it should be, he said. For years we've allowed institutions that have never had our best interests at heart to judge us, and that stops right now.\\n\\nMore:After Grammy nominations outcry, Recording Academy steps up efforts to support Black musicians\\n\\nThe Recording Academy has since vowed to take a number of steps to address concerns from Combs and others, including hiring a diversity and inclusion officer. In October, we got a first look at its #ChangeMusic Roadmap project.\\n\\nThe three children's groups aren't the only musicians to protest this year's Grammy nominations. The Weeknd, who was shut out despite having one of the year's biggest hits, voiced his frustration on Twitter shortly after nominees were unveiled.\\n\\nMore:The Weeknd calls out his Grammy nomination shutout, demands 'industry transparency'\\n\\nThe Grammys remain corrupt, the Blinding Lights singer wrote.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nKAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) — Kevin Kisner has a motto for 2016 that surely is unlike that of any other player on the PGA Tour.\\n\\nDon't be Ronda Rousey.\\n\\nMake sure we don't do so many commercials, get caught up in celebrity and then get knocked out in the second round, his swing coach, John Tillery, said with a laugh. The reference was to the UFC women's bantamweight title fight in Australia two months ago when Rousey was floored by a kick to the head by Holly Holm.\\n\\nKisner is nowhere near that level of celebrity.\\n\\nBut for all the talk about encores going into the new year — Jordan Spieth, Jason Day — that should apply to Kisner.\\n\\nThe 31-year-old from South Carolina might be the best golfer hardly anyone knows.\\n\\nOne year ago, he was No 236 in the world after he narrowly kept his PGA Tour card while overhauling a swing that had gotten so out of whack he nearly quit the game. Kisner goes into the new year at No. 17 in the world, and it was no accident.\\n\\nKisner earned a small slice of PGA Tour history as the only player to lose three playoffs in one season without winning a tournament. And it's not as if he couldn't handle the pressure. He birdied the 18th hole in regulation and in the playoff at Hilton Head before Jim Furyk beat him on the second extra hole. He matched birdies with Rickie Fowler until losing to a birdie on the fourth playoff hole at The Players Championship.\\n\\nHe also lost in a four-man playoff at The Greenbrier, and he was runner-up a fourth time in 2015 at the HSBC Champions in Shanghai. In the final tournament of the calendar year (part of a new PGA Tour season), Kisner showed his moxie by turning a three-shot lead into a six-shot victory at Sea Island.\\n\\nKisner thus fulfilled a pledge to Tillery when he sought his help at the low point of his golfing career.\\n\\nAll I ever told J.T. was to get me in position where I could hit it a little better and I can win out here, Kisner said.\\n\\nHe resumes the PGA Tour season at Kapalua as the leader in the FedEx Cup because of his win at Sea Island and second-place finish in Shanghai. Still to be determined is whether last year was as good as it gets or if the best is still to come.\\n\\nWhat makes Kisner intriguing is his personality. He is loaded with confidence and grit, but it's hidden behind his straight-shooting, homespun Southern nature. With a slight build, he doesn't stand out among the new power regime in golf. And he understands why only the hardiest of golf fans would know him.\\n\\nThis tour doesn't market the guy that finishes 111th, Kisner said after opening with a 69 in the first round at Kapalua. You have to win and be in the hunt for people to know who you are. I was a bottom feeder barely keeping my card.\\n\\nHe has the pedigree, even if his career record to this point suggests journeyman.\\n\\nKisner was the first player at Georgia to be an All-American all four years, but he lost his way as a pro. He didn't come close to keeping his card his first two years on the PGA Tour. And even after he won on the Web.com Tour in early 2013 — in effect, assuring a trip back to the big leagues — he knew was going the wrong way.\\n\\nAnd that's when he went to Tillery, whom he knew through Scott Brown, his close friend and neighbor in Aiken, South Carolina.\\n\\nWhen I went to see him, I had already locked up my tour card and I was ready to quit, Kisner said. It was that bad.\\n\\nTillery had seen plenty of him through Brown, and he had a clear picture of what needed to change when Kisner hired him. Kisner said his pivot was bad and his arms didn't fit in sequence with his body, making his swing steep.\\n\\nTo most of the golf world, he just showed up one day, Tillery said. But there was a solid five to six months of grinding through changes. He was determined to stay on the path and know he was working on the right things. And he had a lot of hidden qualities being a good putter, a super good guy and he believed. As soon has he got in position where he believed he swung it good and could drive it play, that confidence of his just poured on top of all that.\\n\\nKisner is more about the process than the goals. It didn't shake him when he kept getting into playoffs and seeing someone else hold the trophy. The only two goals he mentioned for 2016 were to play in the Ryder Cup and his debut in the Masters.\\n\\nI love Jordan's quote about encores meaning the show is over, he said. It's not over. If I keep playing the way I'm playing and getting in contention, that's what I want to do. I love having a chance to win."}
{"original": "Pete Buttigieg\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nA decade ago, I came to Iowa knocking doors for a young presidential candidate with a funny name. The stakes were high in that election. They are enormous now.\\n\\nTraveling throughout Iowa this year, I've met workers facing rising costs and stagnant wages. Farmers are paying the price of a reckless trade war. Our children are learning active shooter drills before they learn to read.\\n\\nIowans cannot afford four more years of this president or the division that he exploits. On the morning after this president leaves office, the sun will come up on a country even more bitterly divided than we are now, exhausted from fighting — and still facing urgent crises.\\n\\nThis election will decide whether the next president will mobilize Americans behind bold ideas or polarize them around the same Washington fights that have held us back for decades. We need to elect a president who can not only end the era of Donald Trump, but can launch the era that must come next. I'm running for president to lead a nation done with division and hungry for action.\\n\\nI've seen that hunger on display throughout Iowa.\\n\\nPolicies to serve people\\n\\nI've seen it in the Des Moines mother who wrote me that her medical bills had become so expensive that she and her parents sold their homes to pay for her 24-hour care. That's why I've proposed Medicare for All Who Want It, which guarantees every American affordable coverage while letting you choose which plan is best for you, and introduced Long-Term Care America to ensure all Americans are supported. I measure the power of an idea not by how much controversy it generates, but by how many people it can help.\\n\\nIn a sweltering barn in Shenandoah, I met a young man who wanted to know how agriculture in the Midwest could help lead the fight against climate change. He said that people tend to forget about them. I told him how we'd put rural communities like his at the center of a national project and achieve a net-zero carbon economy by 2050.\\n\\nDuring a Fourth of July parade in Storm Lake, I marched alongside 24 floats proudly displaying the two dozen countries that made up the area's immigrant population. Places like Storm Lake inspired my plan for community renewal visas to attract immigrants to areas experiencing population decline, and strengthen my faith that we can manage our border in accordance with our values and our laws.\\n\\nTrump should have stayed in the Iran deal:Attack on US embassy in Iraq shows Trump is failing. He walked into Iran's trap.\\n\\nAnd I've seen that spirit in a teenager from Muscatine who found the courage to be open about her autism after watching our campaign lead with values of inclusion and belonging.\\n\\nIt may seem out of place, to emphasize unity and belonging at a time like this. But my sense of hope is based not in my age but in my experience.\\n\\nThe future can be better\\n\\nIn the dust of a war zone, I saw fellow Americans who had nothing in common besides the flag on our shoulders learn to trust each other with our lives. Amid the ruins of old factories, I saw my hometown answer those who called us a dying city by rising up and forging a new future.\\n\\nMake the center hold:Truce? Progressive Democrats need Republican moderates to beat Donald Trump in 2020\\n\\nOne afternoon in South Bend, I walked into my church, having once believed that something inside would make me forever an outsider — and walked out a married man. And in some of the most conservative counties in Iowa, and in more than 20 counties I've visited that voted for Barack Obama and then Donald Trump, I've witnessed the makings of an American majority made up of progressives, moderates, and even what I like to call future former Republicans sickened by the actions of this president, ready for something better.\\n\\nWhat I've seen in Iowa has made me a better candidate, and it will make me a better president. There's still plenty of work to be done before the caucus on Feb. 3. But I am forever grateful to have been welcomed into your communities. Propelled by your stories and your support, we can change the trajectory of our nation and usher in that era that must come next.\\n\\nPete Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is a Democratic candidate for president."}

We have a great relationship and great trust, and I appreciate the way he works, I think he appreciates the way I handle my business to play quarterback and get ready. We've had a good run. It could've been better, obviously, but I appreciate everything he has done for me.\\n\\nNFL coaching carousel: Breaking down every hire\\n\\nPlayers reported Monday to the team facility for exit interviews, to clear out their lockers and begin the offseason. The attitude was somber, as rumors have been swirling about the team's coaching staff facing an overhaul after a disappointing 6-10 season saw the Giants miss the postseason for the fourth year in a row.\\n\\nHe has done a great job and he definitely has not failed, Manning added.

When guys respect somebody, you can't help but to put your best foot forward. It's as simple as that. There's no way around the respect level that these guys in this locker room have for coach.

Not yet, at least.\\n\\nNor does NFL field director Ed Mangan expect it.\\n\\nWe're in good shape the way we are, Mangan said Monday, noting that with the San Francisco 49ers (5-11) out of the playoffs it was most favorable for a timely transformation.\\n\\nVery smooth.

That's largely based on geography because West Coast operates out of California's Central Valley in Livingston.\\n\\nWest Coast supplied the previous grass — removed early last week — that wound up staying put and durable through the course of the recently completed 49ers season, that following several earlier problems that included players slipping and chunks of sod coming loose.\\n\\nThe Super Bowl grass is a hybrid Bermuda 419 over-seeded with perennial rye, and it was grown on plastic sheeting — a positive change made at West Coast Turf, Mangan said.\\n\\nThe Niners have addressed any of their issues, said Mangan, also field director for baseball's Atlanta Braves and working his 27th Super Bowl.\\n\\nWe're kind of starting anew here with what we're doing.

But we didn't know how emotional it would be. How did we get here? he asked Tuesday. How did we get to the place where people think expanded background checks is an excuse to take away people's guns? Addressing an audience of families of gun-violence victims, gun owners and gun-control advocates, Obama recited a litany of mass shootings during his presidency before he paused and choked up at the mention of 20 first-graders shot and killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary. First-graders, he said, as tears ran down his cheeks. Every time I hear about those kids, it makes me mad. In the other corner: GOP candidates quickly denounced the plan. Florida Sen.

{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nMARIBOR, Slovenia - Not even a broken gate rolling down the course could stop Olympic slalom champion Mikaela Shiffrin from returning to the top of the podium in her favorite discipline.\\n\\nThe American won a women's World Cup race Sunday, five days after she had failed to finish a slalom run for the first time in four years.\\n\\nIn light snowfall, the American was leading the field by 0.19 seconds when a gate that she had just passed correctly broke and flew down the hill. Shiffrin skied over it but managed to stay on the course.\\n\\nShe fell 0.09 off the lead due to the incident, but accelerated in the bottom section to take the win, 0.19 seconds ahead of Wendy Holdener of Switzerland. Frida Hansdotter of Sweden came 0.31 behind in third.\\n\\nI skied over it a couple of times. It just kept coming at me, Shiffrin said. The gate was very solidly under my skis for a couple of turns. I felt it but it was OK. I was happy that I didn't totally lose my ski and fall over.\\n\\nIt was the American's 27th career win, which puts her level with Phil Mahre in third place among American skiers with most World Cup wins, behind Bode Miller (33) and Lindsey Vonn (76). She also equaled Swedish standout Ingemar Stenmark's feat of 27 victories before turning 22. Only Annemarie Moser-Proell of Austria had more wins (41) at that age.\\n\\nShiffrin had her seven-race winning streak come to an end in Tuesday's race in Zagreb, where she straddled a gate early in her first run.\\n\\nIt's always important to be able to change the mindset after something like in Zagreb, she said. It's really easy to get worried about straddling, and then do it again, and again, and again. And then it becomes like a snowball effect and you can't get out of it.\\n\\nRELATED COVERAGE:\\n\\nTessa Worley wins giant slalom after Mikaela Shiffrin loses 1st-run lead\\n\\nShiffrin seemed free of doubts when she took the lead in the opening leg Sunday. In a clean run on the Radvanje course, she was 0.23 ahead of the competition at the final split time, but lost a few hundredths on the bottom section.\\n\\nThe two-time world champion held a 0.17-second lead over Holdener, with Hansdotter of Sweden 0.38 back in third. The top three held their positions in the final run.\\n\\nVeronika Velez Zuzulova, who won the race where Shiffrin went out, led the American by 0.08 seconds at the second split time of her first run before the Slovak straddled a gate and did not finish.\\n\\nVelez Zuzulova has become Shiffrin's main rival for this season's slalom title, and now trails the two-world champion by 110 points with three races remaining.\\n\\nEven if beaten again by Shiffrin, her competitors feel they are closing in on Shiffrin, who won a slalom by more than three seconds last season.\\n\\nMikaela is always fast, Hansdotter said. But it's fun to see the other girls are coming closer.\\n\\nRunner-up Holdener, who missed out on becoming the first Swiss winner of a women's slalom in 15 years, added it's good to know that she is not that far away. Every girl has some parts to improve, Mikaela as well. But it's good to know she is not one second in front or more.\\n\\nDespite winning again, Shiffrin said she was not completely satisfied with her racing this season.\\n\\nI have not been skiing in the races like I can ski, not even close, she said. And it's a bit disappointing, actually, even to come down and win. Right now, I am not happy with just winning, I want to ski well.\\n\\nIn one of her rare slalom starts, defending overall champion Lara Gut finished 4.27 behind Shiffrin and failed to qualify for the second run. The Swiss skier was preparing for a combined event next week, which includes a slalom run.\\n\\nShiffrin leads Gut by 305 points in the overall standings, but the American said the situation was likely to change with a lot of speed races coming up before next month's world championships.\\n\\nThere is four speed series coming so I expect that the lead will disappear quick, she said.\\n\\nThe women's World Cup travels to Austria for a night slalom in Flachau on Tuesday, followed by a downhill and a combined event in Altenmarkt-Zauchensee at the weekend.\\n\\nPHOTOS: MIKAELA SHIFFRIN'S CAREER"}
{"original": "Din Thomas wants to break the stigma that surrounds the subject of men's depression in the mixed martial arts world.\\n\\nThe respected veteran won 26 fights in an MMA career which spanned from 1998-2013, and along the way, he noticed that when fighters encounter life's struggles, they're not always addressed in the healthiest of ways.\\n\\nPeople come into the fight business with problems, and they don't always deal with them, Thomas told MMA Junkie. When you're fighting, it's like your manhood is on the line every time. So people don't want to say when they need help, they think it's soft. And that's got change.\\n\\nSo when the 44-year-old Thomas, who took up cycling over the past year, wanted to set a goal for himself, he decided to think big and find a cause.\\n\\nAs an athlete, you're always looking for the next thing and the next challenge, Thomas said. So when I started riding, I started thinking, like, 'I want to bike across Florida.' You start thinking about things like that and then you work towards it and try to make it happen.\\n\\nAfter doing his first century (100-mile) ride, Thomas decided it was time to give his cross-Florida ride a shot, and he found his cause: Heads Up Guys, a foundation run by the University of British Columbia which works towards the management and prevention of depression in men.\\n\\nThomas set out Friday, New Year's Day — which was chosen because it was the anniversary of his mother's passing — and pedaled approximately 210 miles from Titusville, on Florida's Atlantic Coast, west to Clearwater, on the Gulf Coast.\\n\\nAside from the occasional wrong turn and some killer wind gusts on Day 2, Thomas reports the cycling went smooth.\\n\\nIt was awesome, man, Thomas said. It was a great experience. It was mostly on trails, we got lost a couple times but that's alright. The second day come up to the coast the wind was legit, there was times I wanted to get off my bike and walk but it was like, 'I already came this far.'\\n\\nThomas set up a GoFundMe page to help raise money for Heads Up Guys. You can go here to make a donation.\\n\\nHe's also hoping awareness will come from his efforts.\\n\\nA lot of guys, when their fighting days are over, their problems haven't gone away and for some guys it gets worse when they don't have that outlet any more, Thomas said. I've been there myself. What I want people to know is, if you're struggling, you can get help. Don't give up."}
{"original": "NEW YORK – The only way Lance Palmer could outdo his overall dominant past performances over Alex Gilpin was to take him out.\\n\\nPalmer (22-3 MMA, 11-0 PFL) won the featherweight tournament and $1 million for the second straight year by defeating Gilpin (14-4 MMA, 2-3 PFL) for the third time in a row at the 2019 PFL Championship on Tuesday at Hulu Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York.\\n\\nPalmer's original opponent, Daniel Pineda, failed a drug test, which forced him out of the final. He subsequently was replaced by Gilpin.\\n\\nPalmer beat Gilpin by unanimous decision all three times they fought, and while he admitted he would have liked to score a finish this time around, he was happy with his performance.\\n\\nI really just wanted to get a finish in this fight, and it didn't accumulate the way I wanted to, Palmer said. So the way any fight can go, you just have to adapt while you're in there. I felt that my striking was cleaner and better than his, but at the same time, I wanted to show that I can out-grapple him, since he had two finishes over guys who were high-level guys during the season. I didn't get the finish like I wanted to, but I still felt that it was a good performance overall.\\n\\nHaving mirrored his performance in 2018 by going undefeated once again in the regular season and playoffs, Palmer said the only real difference was what he expected out of himself.\\n\\nI think the pressure was different this time on myself, Palmer said. I think I put a lot more pressure on myself to get the job done. Especially – it's hard fighting the same guy three times in six or seven months or whatever it is, so that was all different things that added into it. But winning is always going to be important to me, so just getting it done and getting another belt is – it was cool. So, not much else to say.\\n\\nComing from a wrestling background, Palmer is accustomed to activity in a tournament-style format. He said that is a model that helped him find success in the PFL.\\n\\nIt's definitely something that not everybody can do, just going through five fights in a seven-month period of time, Palmer said. But I feel like it's something that I was bred to do, coming from a wrestling background and being able to grind and have seven and eight wrestling matches in one day, and go through 150 matches in a year growing up – like, that stuff, it's all prepared me for this.\\n\\nPalmer relied on his strong grappling once again and was able to fend off a few submission attempts from Gilpin. It was more of the same from their previous two meetings in May and October, though.\\n\\nI didn't feel like he brought anything different, which I was kind of surprised because from the first to the second fight, he kind of tried to bring a couple of different tricks and things, Palmer said. But he pretty much stayed with his same game plan from the first fight. I didn't really see any improvement or changes. But also, in that short 10-week period from the semifinals to (Tuesday), there's only so much you can do to change when you're fighting the same guy. So I've been training for Alex since April, so I was pretty much prepared for anything that he could have brought to me.\\n\\nGallery Lance Palmer def.

{"original": "Samsung kicked off the 2021 CES trade show Wednesday with a showcase of new televisions meant to address changes in home life brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nThe Seoul, South Korea-headquartered tech gian livestreamed the event Wednesday, leapfrogging the actual beginning of the annual consumer electronics confab by a few days – the all-online conference officially begins Monday, Jan. 11.\\n\\nFor TV makers, home is where the action is – as many of us work and attend school there – and Samsung's newest sets address how our displays have become hubs of home activity.\\n\\nTV sales grew during the pandemic. Despite workplace issues including layoffs and furloughs, Americans bought 20% more TVs in 2020 through mid-December than in 2019, according to the NPD Group. Samsung is dominant with the largest chunk of global TV sales, about 23% of shipments in the third quarter of 2020, according to Strategy Analytics.\\n\\nDiscovery+ is available:How does it compare with other streaming services?\\n\\nGalaxy smartphones:Samsung likely to unveil Galaxy S21 smartphone Jan. 14\\n\\nNearly six out of 10 consumers (57%) exercise or work out in their living room, according to the tech giant's internal consumer research. The same amount say they watch more shows and films on streaming services, according to research firm GlobalWebIndex.\\n\\nAs more life has revolved around the home, consumers have rediscovered the value of TV, said Mike Kadish, director of TV marketing for Samsung, who previewed upcoming products for media.\\n\\nSamsung is focusing on bigger TVs – with more functionality – that allow you to create a home theater in your house.\\n\\nSince locked-down consumers couldn't go to movie theaters under the COVID-19 stay-at-home orders and recommendations, they started buying bigger and bigger screens to re-create that experience, said Grace Dolan, vice president of home entertainment marketing at Samsung. And with bigger screens comes a need for better quality screens to have that experience.\\n\\nReviewed.com:LG unveils QNED Mini LED televisions\\n\\nCool fridge:Samsung's all-new Bespoke refrigerator with four doors\\n\\nYes, TVs at home can get bigger\\n\\nRemember The Wall, that 146-inch TV Samsung released in 2018? That same technology is used to deliver smaller, consumer-targeted 4K TV models in 110-inch, 99-inch and 88-inch sizes that do not require professional installation, as the original did. That mammoth-sized display – and an even larger version at 292 inches – came in modules that had to be connected and calibrated.\\n\\nThe goal, Dolan said, is to make microLED – it uses self-emissive pixels for improved picture quality – more accessible, easier for the average consumer. You just pull it from the box. It's one single unit now, so you don't need the complicated install.\\n\\nSamsung did not release pricing or product availability on the new sets. Some online news sites have put the price of the 110-inch model at about $159,000.\\n\\nThe 110-inch model, which will come to market first, could be a hot product with consumers, said Tom Campbell, chief technologist for Video & Audio Center stores in Los Angeles. The retailer said the first 110-inch model it'll get is already spoken for.\\n\\nI told him we didn't have an official price, but he said, 'I want it,' Campbell said. Because of COVID, people are buying bigger and bigger screens and paying the price for it.\\n\\nAlso coming are Neo QLED TV models of up to 85 inches (no prices or availability announced), which encase tiny LEDs more compactly without the need of a lens. There are so many more LEDs in there, like thousands more, Dolan said. You get much better contrast, you get a just crisper picture.\\n\\nTVs get even smarter\\n\\nMost of the new models will have a Multi-View feature, which lets you divide your screen in up to 12 sections to display TV channels, games, web pages and other content simultaneously. The screens also let you display a Google Duo video chat onscreen.\\n\\nAvailable on most new displays: The Samsung Health Smart Trainer transforms your living room – or whatever room your TV is in – into a gym. An artificial intelligence-driven program displays a trainer on the left side of the screen and an image of you on the right, so you can monitor your posture.\\n\\nAlmost like a personal trainer, you can monitor your form even as you are watching the content to make sure you are doing it appropriately because not everyone is in the gym any more, Dolan said.\\n\\nThe trainer program will track how many calories you've burned, and you can sync Galaxy smartphones and watches.\\n\\nMany of the new models have a special Super Ultrawide Gameview mode that caters to video game players, letting them create an extended widescreen with aspect ratios of 21:9 and 32:9 (the traditional widescreen ratio is a rectangular 16:9). The Game Bar brings a menu of vital options to the bottom of the screen, letting you quickly change aspect ratios and sound settings.\\n\\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider."}
{"original": "They love him in Israel and India. In the Philippines and Kenya. Oh, and in Nigeria.\\n\\nThe rest of the world? Not so much.\\n\\nConfidence in President Donald Trump to do the right thing when it comes to world affairs remains broadly negative, according to a Pew Research Center survey.\\n\\nThe Washington-based Pew study, released Wednesday, found that among people it polled in 32 countries, 29% express confidence in Trump. Sixty-four percent say they lack confidence in the White House occupant.\\n\\nThe figures stand in marked contrast to the final years of Barack Obama's presidency, when a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump's predecessor to direct America's role in the world in a positive manner.\\n\\nPew last conducted a survey of this kind in 2017.\\n\\nThe survey published Wednesday was conducted in the spring and summer of 2019, well before the Trump administration's slaying of Gen. Qasem Soleimani, an action that has brought fresh scrutiny to one of Trump's signature foreign policy moves: exiting the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers. It has led to increased tensions between Tehran and Washington.\\n\\nIran's assault was the most aggressive in decades: What happens next?\\n\\nPew notes that observed shifts in foreign attitudes toward the U.S. and its leader are sometimes connected to U.S. policy or actions, as in the case of the Iraq War in 2003; sometimes they reflect domestic realities, such as the case of right-wing voters in Europe recently growing more favorable toward the U.S.\\n\\nAt home, Trump has an approval rating of roughly 45% and a disapproval rating of nearly 53%, while the remaining 2% aren't sure, according to an average of job approval polls published by RealClearPolitics, a website focused on political analysis.\\n\\nDistaste for Trump is led by Europe, where approximately three in four people – 75% – in Germany, Sweden, France, Spain and the Netherlands lack confidence in Trump. Mexico, too, does not like him: 89% do not have confidence in Trump.\\n\\nAnti-Trump sentiment around the world is driven by his foreign policy actions, including increasing tariffs or fees on imported goods from other countries; withdrawing from the international climate change accord; and proposing to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. A majority of those polled disapprove of Trump's policies to allow fewer immigrants into the USA and his withdrawal from the Iran nuclear accord.\\n\\nMiddle East:Stampede at Iran commander Qasem Soleimani's funeral kills at least 56\\n\\nTrump's attempt to directly negotiate with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un over that country's nuclear weapons program garners the most support of his various foreign policy actions across the 33 countries surveyed – a median of 41% of people approve of this action, compared with 36% who disapprove.\\n\\nPew, which describes itself as a nonpartisan fact tank that does not take positions on policy decisions, tested the international popularity of four other world leaders in its survey: German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping.\\n\\nHermit kingdom:Trump downplays renewed nuclear threats from North Korea\\n\\nTrump is more negatively viewed than all the leaders asked about in the survey.\\n\\nIn 12 countries, men are more likely than women to rate Trump positively. For example, 28% of men in Sweden have confidence in the president; just 8% of women do.\\n\\nOverall global attitudes toward the United States remain largely favorable, although there are large differences across the 33 nations surveyed for that part of the study. Three Central and Eastern European nations – Poland (79 %), Lithuania (70%) and Hungary (66%) – had the most favorable opinion of the United States.\\n\\nOutside the European Union, Ukraine (73%) rates the United States highly, although views about Trump are less favorable (46%). Pew notes the survey in Ukraine was conducted before revelations last year about Trump's phone call with the country's new president in July. In Russia, 29% of those polled view America positively.\\n\\nIsraelis give the United States its highest rating on the survey (83% favorable). Elsewhere in the Middle East and North Africa, attitudes are more negative, especially in Turkey, where just one in five (20%) have a favorable opinion of the United States, the lowest percentage registered in the survey.\\n\\nThe survey says Trump is generally more popular among those on the political right in many of the nations that were polled. Trump's popularity in Israel (70%) partly reflects his decisions to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and to withdraw from the Iran nuclear accord.\\n\\nIsrael settlements:Donald Trump proves he's the 'King of Israel'"}
{"original": "Jessica Berman has never played lacrosse, but that hasn't stopped her from becoming one of the top executives in the National Lacrosse League.\\n\\nIn August, she was appointed deputy commissioner of the National Lacrosse League and is now the highest-ranking woman in a men's professional sports league. Her immediate goal? To expand the NLL, which now has 13 professional teams, to 16 teams.\\n\\nI love it, said Berman, who lives in Larchmont, New York. If I could have scripted the next best opportunity for me, it would be exactly this.\\n\\nBerman said she knew by age 15 that she wanted a career in sports.\\n\\nShe remembers the excitement at a New York Islanders game where spectators, who didn't seem to have much in common, were high-fiving and even hugging each other when their team scored a goal.\\n\\nLISA WILLIS: First female coach for New York Knicks' franchise\\n\\nSomething in that moment clicked as I watched the power of sports in bringing people together, said Berman, 42.\\n\\nGrowing up in Brooklyn, Berman always found ways to be part of the sports culture, from cheerleading in her high school to tracking statistics for her school's baseball team.\\n\\nAt the University of Michigan, where she majored in sports management, she was the manager of the school's hockey, football and baseball teams.\\n\\nWhen I went to college back in the '90s there was no clear path on how to obtain that kind of experience, she said of managing the teams. I just went to the athletic department and I offered my services to help the different teams to kept statistics on the different players and liaised with the local newspapers on storytelling about the players.\\n\\nSummers were spent on professional internships with sports agents and sports marketing agencies.\\n\\nThose experiences led her to sports law.\\n\\nThe way that my mind works, I knew I would really enjoy a very analytical way of thinking and I was specifically interested in collective bargaining and understanding labor and management relationships, she said.\\n\\nAfter graduating from the Fordham University School of Law, Berman began her career at Proskauer Rose LLP, in New York City specializing in labor and employment.\\n\\nOne of the firm's clients was the National Hockey League.\\n\\nWorking on labor relations issues, particularly collective bargaining agreements, convinced her she was in the right field, she said.\\n\\nI often describe labor relations as a marriage where you can't get a divorce. You have to find a way to work it out, she said. Collective bargaining requires a lot of patience and compromise and understanding the big picture. It's about winning the war, even if you lose some small battles.\\n\\nAfter four years with Proskauer, Berman was hired by the NHL in 2006 as a staff lawyer.\\n\\nNHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly, who was then head of the legal department, said the team had the opportunity to observe Berman on the job while she consulted on behalf of Proskauer.\\n\\nWe could see how she worked under stressful, difficult situations. We saw the level of expertise and creativity she brought, said Daly. She is very committed to accomplishing things. Anything that's put on her plate to accomplish, she'll go to great lengths to make sure it gets done.\\n\\nThat trait was in full display in 2013 when her husband, Brad Berman, a marathon runner, suffered a stroke at age 37. Doctors had to cut out a chunk of his skull to relieve pressure from a ruptured blood vessel in his brain (storing it in his abdomen for future reattachment) before placing him in a coma, where he remained for six weeks.\\n\\nThe stroke initially left him totally paralyzed on his left side, unable to even move the left side of his face. For the next few years, Jessica Berman balanced work, raising the couple's two young children — both under the age of 6 — and taking care of her husband.\\n\\nShe also raised more than $750,000 to help the Burke Rehabilitation Center, where her husband was being treated, to purchase machines and other equipment, including a robotic exoskeleton, needed for his progress.\\n\\nI often describe Jessica as the quarterback of my recovery, said Brad Berman. There were many difficult and complicated decisions that had to be made. She collected tremendous amounts of information and did a lot of research and figured out what the best technology was in terms of helping me to recover the left inside of my body and pulled in experts from around the country to deal with my condition.\\n\\nToday, he is not only well on his way to recovery, but also working full time as a tax attorney.\\n\\nThe couple's marriage, however, did not survive. The Bermans divorced earlier this year, but remain close.\\n\\nOur marriage didn't survive the experience. It changed the dynamics of our relationship, she said. When they say your life can change in an instant, I really know what it means.\\n\\nThrough it all, family, friends, the community and the NHL were pillars of support, she said.\\n\\nTime for change\\n\\nIn 2015, looking for a change in her career track, Berman approached Gary Bettman, the NHL commissioner and deputy commissioner Daly: She wanted to move from the legal side to the business side to gain a better understanding of revenue generation.\\n\\nBerman was offered the position of vice president for community development, culture and growth, responsible for designing and executing the league's strategic corporate social responsibility goals, initiatives, policies and programs.\\n\\nOne of her priorities was to increase revenue by building programming that engaged the community, such as an initiative honoring the Hockey Mom of the Year.\\n\\nMillennials and Gen Z really leverage their own spending on brands that are committed to community and purpose, she said. And when you have programming that authentically engages the community, sponsors will align around those objectives and support the programs.\\n\\nTwo years ago, as she turned 40, Berman said she sought out mentors to help her figure out how she could grow in her career.\\n\\nShe said she knew she would have to step out of her comfort zone.\\n\\nAn opening at the National Lacrosse League proved to be that opportunity.\\n\\nAfter 13 years, I felt like my identity was intertwined with the NHL, she said. It was a very hard decision to leave, but ultimately, I felt like if I want to stretch and learn and grow, I owed it to myself to challenge myself, redefine myself in a lot of ways and see where it leads.\\n\\nExpanding the NLL\\n\\nBerman is not shy about her ambitions.\\n\\nI wanted to intentionally fill any gaps in my experience so that I'd be a qualified candidate for any opportunity that comes my way in the future, she said. Whether it's to be a commissioner of a league one day or the president of a team.\\n\\nBut first, winning a buy-in from her kids, Noah, 11, and Andrew, 9, to take on a high-pressure job which would require a lot of travel was important to her.\\n\\nAs a working mom, you're always trying to be conscious of 'where am I most needed?'  she said.\\n\\nFor Berman, the key to her ability to balance all of this has been keeping her kids up to speed on what she's working on and why it's important.\\n\\nI talked to them about it before I accepted the offer and I said, 'I already work really hard. This is going to be the next level and if you guys aren't on board, I probably won't take it. We need to do this as a team or I'm going to figure something else out.'\\n\\nNoah, when he heard about the opportunity, he says, 'Are you kidding mom? This is going to make you a pioneer,'  she said. I always say they're co-presidents of my fan club.\\n\\nBeing at a much smaller, emerging league (it was established in 1986) has offered Berman the opportunity to grow in her role as executive vice president of business affairs.\\n\\nIn my old role at the NHL, I touched the revenue side from a marketing standpoint, but I wasn't working directly on generating revenue, she said. Now I'm involved in things like selling expansion teams, for example.\\n\\nWhen an expansion team is sold into a new market, there are things one quickly needs to become familiar with, such as negotiation with the prospective owner, identifying an arena for the team to play and paying a fee to buy a new team.\\n\\nThe NLL, which currently has 13 teams, has been authorized by its board to expand to 16 teams by 2023. By comparison, the National Football League, National Hockey League and National Basketball Association each have roughly double that number.\\n\\nLacrosse is among the fastest growing sports in the United States, according to a recent Sport & Fitness Industry Association report.\\n\\nIt's been really fun to learn and work on. From bringing in new sponsors to working on media rights, there are so many new things to learn, said Berman.\\n\\nSwapna Venugopal Ramaswamy covers women and power for the USA Today Network Northeast.

{"original": "Brett Kelman\\n\\nThe Desert Sun\\n\\nSix months ago, an unremarkable bridge on a desolate stretch of desert highway collapsed, severing one of the most important roads in the nation. A flash flood toppled the eastbound portion of the Tex Wash Bridge, which carried Interstate 10 across a dry riverbed near Desert Center. A motorist was nearly killed. The main route between California and Arizona was closed for five days, diverting travelers and truckers, costing millions in detours and repairs.\\n\\nThe collapse occurred on July 19, after nearly 7 inches of rain fell on the Chuckwalla Mountains south of the interstate, then flooded into the wash below. The storm was extremely rare and powerful, but its destructive force was magnified by critical flaws in the design of the bridge, according to an engineering expert's new study of the bridge failure.\\n\\nThe Tex Wash Bridge was built in 1967, as the I-10 slowly grew across the country, crossing the dry, dusty desert between the Coachella Valley and the Arizona-California state line. Dozens of short bridges were built in that stretch, but the Tex Wash was wide and delta-like, so it demanded a longer, stronger bridge. Instead, construction crews narrowed the wash, then built a short bridge with a shallow foundation. They also re-shaped the wash into a curve, which directed the full force of floods against the eastern base of the bridge.\\n\\nEventually, when the heavy rains finally came almost 50 years later, the pressure was too much. A flash flood pummeled the bridge's foundation until the concrete cracked and the asphalt tumbled into the rushing water.\\n\\nThis was not good engineering, said Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a UC Berkeley engineering professor, who visited the Tex Wash Bridge site in December. In good engineering, you work with nature, you don't fight against it.\\n\\nBecause the flood will always win.\\n\\nAstaneh is an internationally recognized expert on failed structures, who has studied some of the deadliest structural collapses in modern history. He speaks out frequently about his public safety concerns in a field where criticism is rarely aired publicly.\\n\\nIn 2001, Astaneh was hired by the National Science Foundation to study the collapse of the World Trade Center. In 2007, the professor made headlines when he attributed the collapse of the I-35 Bridge in Minneapolis, which killed 13 people, to undersized steel plating. A federal investigation later confirmed his findings.\\n\\nMore recently, Astaneh has turned his attention to the Tex Wash Bridge, which he studied with the help of Maryam Tabbakhha, another structural engineer at Berkeley. Together, they are preparing a research paper on the cause of the collapse, spotlighting four fatal flaws in the bridge design. The paper is expected to be made public later this month. Astaneh gave The Desert Sun exclusive access to his preliminary findings.\\n\\nThey include:\\n\\nNarrowing the wash: First, the Tex Wash Bridge was built over a wide flood plain, shaped like a river delta rather than a stream. Construction crews could have spanned the entire flood plain, which had been done with another bridge in the past, but instead narrowed the wash by filling it with dirt, then built a shorter bridge. This design made construction cheaper, but it also forced storm runoff into a channel, creating a bottleneck that increased pressure on the bridge in the same way that a spray nozzle boosts the power of a garden hose.\\n\\nRedirecting the water flow: Narrowing the wash created another problem too. The path of water, which once flowed straight through the delta wash, was now forced into a curve that put additional stress on the eastern side of the bridge. Rushing water now carved into the dirt berm around the base of the bridge, eventually digging up its foundation.\\n\\nImgur\\n\\nNo piles beneath foundation: The foundations on both sides of the bridge were built with no underground piles anchoring them into the soil. Instead, the foundation was just sitting in the dirt that had been used to narrow the wash, susceptible to rushing waters that whipped through the curved wash.\\n\\nNo walls to prevent erosion: Finally, the foundation of the bridge could have been further protected by a retaining wall that funneled water inward to prevent erosion on the curved wash. Instead, the wash was lined with protective boulders – called loose riprap – which were simply swept away by the flood.\\n\\nCollapsed I-10 bridge given an A rating just last year\\n\\nDespite Astaneh's criticism of the bridge, which allege a serious public safety risk, no response has come from the officials who are actually responsible for the Tex Wash Bridge. When reached for comment by The Desert Sun, the California Department of Transportation refused to discuss the collapse of the bridge.\\n\\nCalTrans spent $8 million to build a replacement bridge, which restored the interstate to normal when it opened on Sept. 24. Astaneh claims the new bridge suffers from many of the same flaws as its predecessor, and is only slightly less susceptible to flash flood. Reconstruction did not change the configuration of the narrow channel and the curved wash, so runoff will still bottleneck at the bridge. Underground piles were added to the foundations of the new bridge, but there is still no retaining wall protecting the earth from erosion. Instead, CalTrans contractors buried the edge of the wash under even more boulders, which could wash away again, Astaneh said.\\n\\nAstaneh claims the replacement bridge has also introduced a new problem – it will float. The bridge is built from long, hollow concrete boxes, and similar bridges have floated off their foundations during the extreme flooding after Hurricane Katrina, Astaneh said.\\n\\nThey built a boat, he said while inspecting the new bridge. If the 500-year flood comes, the analysis shows that it will very likely lift this and carry it away.\\n\\nA flood that could lift the new Tex Wash Bridge would need to be larger than the flood that struck in July, but it is not impossible.\\n\\nMeteorologists said a storm of this size is extremely rare – predicted to fall in this spot less than once every 1,000 years. However, the Tex Wash carries runoff from the Chuckwalla Mountains to the south, so any major storm on the northern half of the mountain range would send water flowing towards the bridge. A similar storm in a different spot still could flood the washes near Desert Center.\\n\\nSure, it could happen again, said Valerie Meyers, a meteorologist in Phoenix. Just because we are saying this is a 1000-year storm, doesn't mean it's only going to happen once in one thousand years. We are just describing the rarity of the event. It could happen next week. It could happen 5 miles down the road. It could happen tomorrow.\\n\\nTerri Kasinga, a CalTrans spokeswoman, said the agency would not respond to Astaneh's findings because his research had not yet been published. Kasinga added that CalTrans was unwilling to discuss or explain the failure of the bridge because a claim for damages was likely to be filed over the collapse.\\n\\nThat claim is expected from Bryan Castor and Scott Meyn, a driver and passenger who were injured when their vehicle was smashed by the tumbling bridge. Meyn escaped with a fractured sternum, but Castor was pinned in the crushed vehicle, surrounded by rushing water, with busted knee caps and broken ribs. He likely would have died, if not for an award-winning rescue by local police and firefighters.\\n\\nCastor and Meyn each plan to file claims against CalTrans by the end of the month, said their attorney, Dane Wood. However, Wood said that is no excuse for CalTrans to remain silent on the collapse.\\n\\nConsidering the public interest and the public safety involved, one would think CalTrans would be more willing to share at least some basic information about their findings, Wood said. If and when there is a lawsuit, they will have to provide that information to us anyway. So why wait until then?\\n\\nAlthough CalTrans won't talk about the bridge, public records show the agency's engineers have come to at least some of the same conclusions as Astaneh.\\n\\nOne day after the collapse, CalTrans engineer Terence Cheung determined that the narrowing of the channel and the bend in the wash were responsible for the flood damage.\\n\\nAlthough the channel bed appears to have stabilized, further degradation may be cause for re-evaluation, so the channel needs to be monitored, Cheung wrote in a July 20 inspection report.\\n\\nCalTrans inspectors had previously given the Tex Wash Bridge far more positive reviews. In 2015, the bridge received a grade-A sufficiency rating – 91.5 out of 100 – and one of the highest possible flood safety ratings. Forty-five other Riverside County I-10 bridges had received lower ratings, and seven of those were deemed functionally obsolete, meaning they were too small or poorly suited for modern-day traffic.\\n\\nAs I-10 reopens, meet Riverside County's worst bridge\\n\\nThe Desert Sun also spoke to three additional California engineers who said the narrowed channel and the curved wash likely contributed to the Tex Wash Bridge collapse, but they were unwilling to be interviewed in detail because they had not studied the bridge personally. However, one of those engineers said the July flood was so large that, even if the Tex Wash had been left wide and straight, the bridge may have been destroyed anyway.\\n\\nTo counter that point, Astaneh points to a neighboring bridge – the Ragsdale Bridge – which spans the same wash as the collapsed bridge but tells a very different story.\\n\\nThe Ragsdale Bridge carries an access road across the Tex Wash about 200 feet north of the collapse site. The wood bridge was built in 1931, so it is both older and – in theory – weaker than its concrete cousin. Yet, when the heavy rains came in July, the Ragsdale Bridge survived the flood.\\n\\nThe difference lies in the design, Astaneh said. Unlike the collapsed bridge, the Ragsdale Bridge's foundation is anchored by underground piles and protected by diagonal walls, which funnel flood waters inward to prevent erosion. The bridge was built before the wash was narrowed, so that it is nearly three times longer than the Tex Wash Bridge. Flash floods can pass beneath without being compressed into a channel.\\n\\nIn short: Everything that Astaneh says the builders of the Tex Wash Bridge did wrong, the builders of the Ragsdale Bridge did right.\\n\\nThis is the bridge they should have built, Astaneh said, smiling, as he marveled at the sturdiness of the wooden structure. All you have to do is change the timber to concrete or steel and you are done.\\n\\nDesert Sun Reporter Brett Kelman can be reached by phone at (760) 778-4642, by email at brett.kelman@desertsun.com, or on Twitter @TDSbrettkelman."}
{"original": "Alisa Priddle\\n\\nDetroit Free Press\\n\\n\\n\\nFord introduces the 2017 Lincoln Continental into a full-size luxury sedan segment getting a powerful injection of new products.\\n\\nThe Continental's planned debut today at the 2016 North American International Auto Show comes the same week that Mercedes-Benz used Detroit for the global debut of the all-new E-Class. The outgoing E-Class saw sales decline 15% in the U.S. last year but still sold almost 50,000 -- half as many as the entire Lincoln brand.\\n\\nAnd Cadillac is preparing to build its new CT6, which will hit dealerships months before the Continental is slated to go on sale this fall.\\n\\nIt's an exciting time to be in the heart of this segment, said Lincoln Brand Manager Eric Turner.\\n\\nLincoln didn't design the new five-passenger Continental to be an underdog. The automaker did not skimp on the production model and stayed fairly true to the concept unveiled last year at the New York auto show.\\n\\nThe obvious show pieces have been stripped away, like pile carpet so deep a kitten could get lost, footrests in the back seat to better enjoy the champagne on ice in the center console; and door handles akin to pieces of art. It was a show car and designers went all out.\\n\\nThe production car keeps the new grille comprised of Lincoln logos, which is the new official face of Lincoln, said design chief David Woodhouse. There are no footrests or kittens but there is luxury seating front and back.\\n\\nMark Reuss, head of global product development at General Motors, said the new face of Lincoln is a good change for the domestic rival to GM's Cadillac. I'd like to see them find their way and I think they are, Reuss said.\\n\\nThe Continental's 19-speaker Revel stereo system was specially designed in a sunrise pattern for the car and there are clever door handles incorporated into the beltline with a hidden touch mechanism to not mess up the lines of a car with a lower and sleeker silhouette. Hit the key fob and the headlamps start an ignition sequence of their own to greet the owner.\\n\\nMike Celentino, chief program engineer, is particularly proud of the 30-way adjustable seat and clean door panel that has a button instead of a door handle to open the door from the inside.\\n\\nUnder the hood is a new 3-liter twin-turbocharged V6 engine generating 400 horsepower and 400 pound-feet of torque. Choices also include the smaller 2.7-liter twin-turbocharged engine and a 3.7-liter naturally aspirated engine. In China, the base engine is a 2-liter twin-turbo.\\n\\nThe car has all-wheel drive and dynamic torque vectoring that transfers torque to the appropriate wheel when cornering, driver assist technologies can bring the car to a full stop if the driver fails to brake to avoid a collision.\\n\\nLincoln's flagship sedan will be built in Michigan but is expected to garner many of its sales in China. Lincoln sold 11,630 vehicles in China in 2015, its first full year in a market where it now has 33 dealers.\\n\\nThe future of the Lincoln brand largely rests on its ability to grow in China, as that market represents a higher-volume opportunity than the mature U.S. market overall, said Stephanie Brinley, senior analyst with IHS Automotive.\\n\\nWhile the car was clearly designed with the China market in mind, Lincoln did not create a longer-wheelbase version for the country where luxury buyers have a driver and the amenities are in the second row. But the one-size-fits-all sedan has a deliberately large back seat. Celentino said the car may have the footprint of a BMW 5-Series but offers the interior space of a 7-Series.\\n\\nThe rear passenger door has controls to move the front seat forward for more leg room. The rear seat reclines and there are controls to activate sun shades on the side and rear window as well as the glass sunroof so there is no glare while working on a tablet screen.\\n\\nLincoln President Kumar Galhotra, said the Continental reflects a fundamental shift in how cars are designed to cater to the owner's needs.\\n\\nHe is confident in the Continental's ability to go up against the E-Class, 5-Series, CT6 as well as the Audi A6 and Lexus GS.\\n\\nAnd he is bolstered by Lincoln's breach of the 100,000 sales mark in the U.S. last year. It's an important sales milestone, Galhotra said. There is no new strategy phase that kicks in, but it's emotionally important for dealers and the team.\\n\\nThe Continental is part of a segment under pressure as consumer tastes continue to shift towards SUVs, Brinley said.\\n\\nLarge luxury car sales have been on a downward trend, but are important in drawing and keeping loyal customers, said Turner. He said globally the segment accounts for 1.7 million sales annually and is expected to grow to 1.9 million by 2020.\\n\\nNew products are also bringing down the average age of the Lincoln buyer from 65 a few years ago to 58 now, Turner said. Continental won't change it much: the car's average buyer will be a 58-year-old male with a household income of $210,00 and who wants to make a mark on the world and leave a positive legacy.\\n\\nAn ad campaign featuring actor Matthew McConnaughey Matthew McConaughey has helped boost awareness and sales. Galhotra said it is too early to say if McConnaughey McConaughey will be in commercial for the Continental. He said Lincoln will not run an ad during the Super Bowl on Feb. 7.\\n\\nFord will build the 2017 Continental at its Flat Rock assembly plant and is already running early prototypes of the car down the line. The Lincoln was derived from the same platform as the smaller Fusion that was being built at Flat Rock, but the two cars do not share parts or dimensions.\\n\\nFlat Rock will build the car for shipment across North America as well as China, the Middle East and South Korea."}

Due to doping, it is now common for results to change months or even years after the last athlete crosses the finish line.\\n\\nI know amazing athletes who were awarded medals long after they retired. Sure, the delay cost them money, fame and a special moment on the medal stand, but more importantly, they lost the chance to share their experiences and the lessons they've learned with their communities.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) — Earning a bye week gave the Philadelphia Eagles an opportunity to work even harder.\\n\\nNo mini-vacations. No golfing. No beach trips.\\n\\nInstead, the Eagles (13-3) kicked off preparation for next Saturday's divisional playoff game by holding their toughest practice since training camp.\\n\\nPlayers put their pads on Wednesday and got after it on the indoor field as starters faced off like it was a hot day in August instead of a frigid January afternoon.\\n\\nThe guys in this room aren't afraid to work, grinding, enjoying the process, enjoying the small things a lot of people don't like to do this time of year, Pro Bowl safety Malcolm Jenkins said. We understand the significance of the situation we're in and we want to take advantage of the time we have. Guys didn't want to be off for the whole week. We want to get better.\\n\\nThe Eagles are the NFC's No. 1 seed but no longer are Super Bowl favorites after losing MVP candidate Carson Wentz in Week 14. Oddsmakers have three NFC teams listed ahead of Philadelphia.\\n\\nBackup quarterback Nick Foles played well the first five quarters he filled in for Wentz, then struggled in the last five. He was 20 of 48 for 279 yards with four touchdowns and no interceptions versus 23 of 49 for 202 yards with one TD and two picks. Foles and the rest of the starters sat out the final three quarters of a 6-0 loss to Dallas that prevented Philadelphia from setting a franchise record for regular-season wins.\\n\\nThe defense looked sharp in the last two games, but had a tough three-game stretch on the road to start December.\\n\\nSo, members of the team's players' council told coach Doug Pederson they wanted to practice in pads instead of going through walkthroughs during their bye.\\n\\nIt's not a punishment thing; it's not coming directly from me, Pederson said. It's what the players want. I listen to my guys. I think they understand that there is a sense of physicality that we have to get back to. So you get back into pads and it sort of refocuses the guys a little bit.\\n\\nOf course, there was no tackling at practice, but the intensity level was much higher.\\n\\nWe were moving around, moving fast, Foles said. Pads are different, and getting to move in pads, getting to throw in pads is a good thing.\\n\\nEven the receivers welcomed the change of pace.\\n\\nAll gas and no brakes now, Alshon Jeffery said. You have to keep working hard and we wanted to go out and compete against one another.\\n\\nThe Eagles are in the postseason for the first time since a 26-24 home loss to New Orleans on Jan. 4, 2014. Foles rallied Philadelphia from a 20-7 deficit late in the third quarter and tossed a 3-yard touchdown pass to Zach Ertz for a 24-23 lead with 4:54 remaining, only to watch special teams allow a long kickoff return that helped set up a winning field goal.\\n\\nThe NFC East champions will host the Saints (11-5), Panthers (11-5) or Falcons (10-6) on Jan. 13. They'll be seeking their first playoff win since advancing to the 2009 NFC championship game as the sixth seed.\\n\\nExpectations outside the locker room are low. Many folks are predicting Philadelphia is the most likely team with a bye to be one and done. Panic-stricken fans even called for Pederson to bench Foles for second-year pro Nate Sudfeld, who threw his first career pass against the Cowboys. Sudfeld was 19 of 23 for 134 yards. Pederson actually was asked by reporters to confirm that Foles was indeed the starter.\\n\\nObviously, he's not benching Foles for a guy who just made his NFL debut.\\n\\nHe's the guy now, Pederson said. But, he doesn't have to feel the weight of the entire team. This is a team sport. We have to play great defense, obviously, and special teams has to own up to their jobs. Then offensively, we just have to be better all around. I want Nick to embrace it; he has embraced it. At the same time, the guys around him also need to own their jobs and their responsibilities going forward.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nTORONTO (AP) — Tie Domi is no different than any proud hockey father when it comes to worrying about his son.\\n\\nHaving spent 16 seasons establishing a reputation for being one of the NHL's fiercest enforcers, Domi fully appreciates the importance of protecting a team's marquee players. What concerns him: Who has the back of his 21-year-old son, budding Arizona star Max Domi, at a time when the league has all but eliminated the role of on-ice policeman?\\n\\nObviously, I don't agree with it, especially having a kid in the NHL now and watching the so-called accountability factor, Tie Domi said during the NHL's Centennial Classic celebrations. We used to make people accountable. It's definitely a different taste for sure.\\n\\nA sour one, too, after Domi's fears were realized last month when his son broke his hand in a fight with Calgary's Garnet Hathaway.\\n\\nIt's a learning lesson for him, the elder Domi said. Unfortunately, he has a little bit of me in him.\\n\\nWith the exception of alumni games and Slap Shot  movie reunions, where the Hanson Brothers will live into infinity, it's taken just one generation — from Tie to Max Domi, for example — to usher in the end of the tough guy in what's become a faster, leaner and far less gap-toothed era. The evidence was apparent in the alumni who took the ice in Toronto last weekend: The game featured five of the NHL's top 20 career penalty-minutes leaders, including all-time leader Dave Tiger Williams (3,966 penalty minutes) and Tie Domi, who ranks third (3,515).\\n\\nHow many is there? cracked Williams, wearing a cowboy hat and big silver belt buckle, when informed the game appeared to be a reunion of aging enforcers. Well, good. They all showed up.\\n\\nFormer Toronto star Wendel Clark smiled when asked if he'd consider taking a run at ex-Red Wings player and current Maple Leafs president Brendan Shanahan.\\n\\nOh, I don't know. We've never hit a president before, Clark said. We've never gone that high up the ladder.\\n\\nTie Domi was wearing a throwback leather helmet fit snug to his head following a Maple Leafs alumni practice, a day before playing an outdoor game against their Red Wings counterparts. While holding court on the topic of enforcers in a hallway at old Maple Leaf Gardens, he stopped in mid-sentence to greet former Red Wings tough guy Joey Kocur. The two engaged in a big hug and a few playful taunts.\\n\\nYou're not scoring this year, Kocur said.\\n\\nMy mentor, Domi replied.\\n\\nHow quickly hockey has changed wasn't lost on former Red Wings enforcer Darren McCarty.\\n\\nThe game is where it's buddy-buddy now, McCarty said. The only talking over the red line back then is where you were (taunting) a guy or you're setting up a fight because you say, 'I'm coming.' It was never pleasantries.\\n\\nMcCarty joked he would have never had a chance to play today.\\n\\nIt's a different game. You've got to understand it's a college, European-style game, he said. I guarantee you, if I grew up and had to play this game, I would be learning how to hit that curveball, because that's what kept me out of baseball.\\n\\nThe elimination of the enforcer has been based on a series of rule changes. It began with the NHL in 1992 adding a game misconduct for players who start fights. That led to what was called show fighting, where both players would agree to square off so neither would be considered the instigator.\\n\\nThe NHL cracked down further on fighting to protect itself and its players from growing concerns over concussions, and the debilitating toll of repeated punches to the head. Rules freeing up the game from clutching-and-grabbing styles of defense also placed a premium on faster, more skilled players, and further reduced the need for plodding fighters.\\n\\nA comparison of penalty minutes numbers alone reflects how drastic the change has been.\\n\\nThrough Thursday, Dallas Stars forward Antoine Roussel led the NHL with 87 penalty minutes in 35 games. Three months into the 1996-97 season, Vancouver's Gino Odjick had a league-leading 214 penalty minutes. Roussel's current total would have been tied for 33rd with Anaheim's Ken Baumgartner 20 years ago.\\n\\nClark has no trouble with hockey's evolution.\\n\\nBasically, it's whatever society thinks they want to see. That's it. Society judges all of us, said Clark, who scored 330 goals and racked up 1,690 penalty minutes during a 15-year career.\\n\\nAs with any sport, Clark said, the top players will adapt and marginal players get shunted aside.\\n\\nOne of the alumni game highlights featured Detroit's Kris Draper and Toronto's Gary Roberts exchanging shoves and slashes before Williams, Kocur and Domi pulled the two aside before anything escalated.\\n\\nOh, the irony of seeing one-time enforcers stepping in to actually stop a brawl.\\n\\nMcCarty couldn't help but laugh in seeing two hard-hitting forwards such as Draper and Roberts picking up on a rivalry dating to their playing days.\\n\\nIt's just second nature that they reverted back to 20 years ago for the moment, McCarty said. They'll laugh about it now. But that's just what made them great players. And I think you don't see a lot of that these days."}

If you'd like to get The Backstory in your inbox every week, sign up here.\\n\\nGul Rukh was carried into the cafe in Herat in a white plastic lawn chair, one brother on each side of her.\\n\\nShe is paralyzed from the waist down but does not have a wheelchair. She was placed gently on cushions on the floor. A tent blocked the sun overhead.\\n\\nThere to meet her was USA TODAY reporter Brett Murphy. He had come to Afghanistan to interview those who survived, responded to or investigated the deadly battle in 2008 in the village of Azizabad, about 90 minutes away.\\n\\nRukh lost her parents and all four children – Dawa, 10, Rahima, 9, Ghani, 6, and Nabi, 5 – in the battle. She still has shrapnel in her spine. She has spoken briefly about that night but never shared great detail. Such as how her kids had new clothes for a village gathering and had painted henna tattoos on each other's hands. About how they played soccer with their cousins all day before settling down for the night outside under mosquito nets.\\n\\nBefore I could introduce myself, it came pouring out of her, Murphy says. She clearly thinks about this a lot every day. This opportunity to discuss it was rare for her. It was 45 minutes into our first meeting before I even got a question in. As soon as I said, 'We're recording,' she started.\\n\\nThe U.S. raid had been reported, but not the full scale and aftermath.\\n\\nMurphy wanted to get the whole story out about Operation Commando Riot, aimed at a high-value Taliban target. The U.S. military called in an airstrike on its own security guards. Dozens of children were killed. U.S. military officials publicly claimed it was a success. But, as Murphy's reporting found, some troops were never warned of Azizabad's civilian population, and the special operation commanders who did know unleashed devastating force from the air anyway.\\n\\nMurphy spent a year reporting this story. He traveled to Afghanistan to get government records and interview witnesses. USA TODAY sued the Department of Defense to obtain almost 1,000 pages of investigative files kept secret. These files included witness statements and testimony from U.S. forces involved in the operation. Murphy obtained reports from humanitarian groups, including the Red Cross, and a confidential United Nations investigation.\\n\\nTogether, the records and interviews tell the story of a disaster that was months in the making as military and company officials ignored warnings about the men they had hired to provide intelligence and security, Murphy reported. The records also reveal that the Defense Department has for years downplayed or denied the fatal mistakes surrounding the tragedy.\\n\\nThat is why we are telling this story now, a decade later.\\n\\nThere was denial about what happened, Murphy says. Americans only saw above the rubble, through their scanners. They had developed a sense of distance from accounts. It was seen as a success.\\n\\nPulling back that curtain is really rare. It's important to show people the thinking behind all the decisions being made – and of course the aftermath.\\n\\nOriginal reporting such as this involves risk.\\n\\nMurphy spent about two weeks in Afghanistan, in Kabul and Herat. It was too dangerous to travel to Azizabad, which is controlled by the Taliban. He arranged to have the villagers meet him in Herat and hired a stringer to travel to the village. To get to those witnesses, he had to go through the village elder, who happened to be the brother of one of the warlords involved in the raid in 2008.\\n\\nTo verify the accounts, he asked for diaries and pictures. He cross-referenced facts with other interviews or records. He kept witnesses focused on what they actually saw or felt.\\n\\nGetting to what they actually experienced, versus what they heard from someone else, that's what we spent time on, Murphy says. Each interview took one to three hours.\\n\\nWhen journalists report in dangerous areas, they often have fixers, local guides who provide information and access. Reporters also go through hostile environment training.\\n\\nIf we didn't feel great about something, or if we were in an area too long or getting some looks we didn't like, we'd get in the car and leave, Murphy says.\\n\\nMatt Doig is Murphy's editor. They talked at length about the risks, and the reason we took them.\\n\\nWe saw this not just as a great story but a great microcosm of what was going on in Afghanistan and the role private security played in it, Doig says. It's the most complete retelling of everything that happened.\\n\\nThis was our latest story about private security company G4S, which sells itself as the world's premier security company. Reporting by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found that the company's efforts to penetrate the U.S. market with low-cost protection have repeatedly come at the expense of its own standards. G4S has lost hundreds of guns over the past decade, many of them winding up at crime scenes across the country.\\n\\nWe've highlighted some dangerous things going on, Doig says.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nHOUSTON (AP) — Oakland's first trip to the playoffs in 14 seasons was short-circuited in great part because of injuries that wrecked its once-prolific offense.\\n\\nRookie third-string quarterback Connor Cook was no match for the Houston Texans in a 27-14 loss in a wild-card playoff game Saturday.\\n\\nWe got off to such a great start, winning 12 games isn't easy to do, coach Jack Del Rio said. Just came to an abrupt end. The last two weeks we were weren't able to do enough as a team to carry on and continue.\\n\\nThe Raiders last made the playoffs in the 2002 season, when they went to the Super Bowl. This appearance ended with a thud behind the struggles of Cook. Clearly in over his head, he threw for 161 yards with one touchdown and three interceptions .\\n\\nIt was his first start, on the road, in a playoff game, against the No. 1-ranked defense. It was a tough draw for him, Del Rio said. We had hopes that we would be able to do enough around him so he wouldn't have to do as much.\\n\\nCook became the first quarterback in NFL history to make his first start in a playoff game after MVP contender Derek Carr broke his leg two weeks ago. Then backup Matt McGloin injured his shoulder on Sunday.\\n\\nI had high expectations for myself, and to come in and play like that, it's not a good feeling, Cook said. It's a learning experience.\\n\\nCook's performance wasn't helped by star left tackle Donald Penn missing the game with a knee injury, which ended a streak of 160 straight starts.\\n\\nHouston (10-7) led by 13 at halftime and made it 27-7 on a 1-yard run by Osweiler early in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nThe Raiders (12-5) cut the lead when Andre Holmes grabbed an 8-yard touchdown reception on their next possession. Oakland got a stop after that, but Corey Moore intercepted Cook on the next possession.\\n\\nDefensive end Khalil Mack talked about how difficult it was to play without Carr.\\n\\nWhen you lose an MVP, it takes a toll, he said. We wanted to rally and focus back in, but you could tell it was a big hit for us.\\n\\nCarr threw for 3,937 yards with 28 touchdowns and just six interceptions this season before his leg was broken on a sack in a win over Indianapolis on Christmas Eve. McGloin started last week, but he went down with a shoulder injury to force Cook into action after not playing all season.\\n\\nDel Rio said he asked his staff at halftime if they should bring McGloin in for the second half.\\n\\nThe coaches really felt that there were other things that were kind of contributing, and that there wasn't going to be a big change based on changing the quarterback, so we stayed the course with it, Del Rio said. He did some good things, and then he did some things he'll certainly learn from.\\n\\nMack was disappointed that they couldn't do more to help their young quarterback succeed on Saturday.\\n\\nWe should have stepped up defensively, and carried this team, but we couldn't do it, he said. We weren't able to help our offense, and that's my fault. I'll take the blame for that.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "In closing arguments at President Donald Trump's impeachment trial last year, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff leveled a prescient warning.\\n\\nOf the president's efforts to pressure the Ukrainian president to smear Democratic rival Joe Biden, Schiff declared that Trump will do so again.\\n\\nYou cannot constrain him. He is who he is, the California Democrat said.\\n\\nNearly a year later, Trump appeared to make good on Schiff's admonition during a stunning hourlong telephone call in which the president sought to strong-arm Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to overturn his election defeat in that state.\\n\\nTwo weeks before the end of Trump's presidency, there is little time to launch an impeachment inquiry, but legal experts and Democratic lawmakers assert that Trump's action was tantamount to criminal conduct that should open him to fresh legal scrutiny.\\n\\nTop GOP: Liz Cheney calls Trump phone call 'deeply troubling'\\n\\nThis is a horrendous effort to undermine our system of government, said Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general in President George H.W. Bush's administration. Is it something within the purview of the Department of Justice? Yes, absolutely. You open an investigation to figure out whether there is something you can do to stop it or punish it.\\n\\nLess than 24 hours after Trump's conversation with Raffensperger was made public, the first formal calls for a criminal inquiry came Monday from Reps. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., and Kathleen Rice, D-N.Y., who urged the FBI to open an immediate criminal investigation.\\n\\nThe evidence of election fraud by Mr. Trump is now in broad daylight, the lawmakers said in a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray.\\n\\nThe FBI acknowledged it received the referral but declined further comment.\\n\\nThe Justice Department also declined to comment.\\n\\nRaffensperger, in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America, said an appropriate venue for an investigation would probably be the Fulton County, Georgia, District Attorney's Office.\\n\\nDistrict Attorney Fani Willis, a Democrat, said her office stood ready to investigate if a case was referred to prosecutors.\\n\\nLike many Americans, I have found the news reports about the president's telephone call with the Georgia Secretary of State disturbing, Willis said in a statement.\\n\\nAs I promised Fulton County voters last year, as District Attorney, I will enforce the law without fear or favor, she said. Anyone who commits a felony violation of Georgia law in my jurisdiction will be held accountable.\\n\\n'It was a veiled threat'\\n\\nLieu and Rice said their joint request to the FBI centered on provisions of two federal election fraud statutes and one Georgia law, which they say Trump may have breached during his call Saturday with Raffensperger and the secretary of state's general counsel.\\n\\nThe lawmakers called specific attention to Trump's demands for Georgia officials to find 11,780 votes to overturn the Biden victory.\\n\\nAnd there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated, Trump told the officials, according to a recording of the conversation obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nLieu and Rice said the president's request for a recalculation of the vote represented a solicitation of election fraud in violation of federal and state laws.\\n\\nWe request that if you believe Mr. Trump also violated state criminal law, that you refer the state violations to the Georgia Attorney General or the appropriate district attorney in Georgia, the lawmakers said in the letter to Wray.\\n\\nAt a briefing late Monday afternoon in Atlanta, Gabriel Sterling, the state's voting system manager, said he was not aware of discussions about the prospect of a criminal investigation.\\n\\nAsked to assess the president's call, Sterling said, I personally found it to be something that was not normal, out of place. Nobody I know who would be president would do something like that to a secretary of state.\\n\\nNick Akerman, an assistant special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation, said Trump's call to Raffensperger is not much different from wiretapped conversations involving Mafia bosses he heard during his years as a federal prosecutor.\\n\\nAkerman said he was particularly struck by Trump's suggestion that it's going to be very costly if the state official doesn't recount votes in a way that favors Trump.\\n\\nSo tell me, Brad, what are we going to do? said Trump, who was joined on the call by White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and the president's lawyers. We won the election, and it's not fair to take it away from us like this. And it's going to be very costly in many ways. And I think you have to say that you're going to reexamine it, and you can reexamine it, but reexamine it with people that want to find answers, not people that don't want to find answers.\\n\\nMore:Trump travels to Georgia before Senate runoff that will decide control of Senate\\n\\nAkerman said the words represented a threat.\\n\\n(Trump) doesn't come right out and say, 'You're going to be in big trouble.' … When he says it's going to be costly, I think everybody knows what that means, he said. It's specific enough and vague enough that you know what he's talking about. Who would it be costly to? I mean, come on. … It was a veiled threat saying, 'You better take care of this and find me these ... votes or you'll be in trouble.'\\n\\nPeople get the message. … It doesn't take much. It's all there. It's right out of 'The Godfather,' Akerman said.\\n\\nThe former Manhattan federal prosecutor characterized the call as part of a pattern of criminal activity by the president, referring to Trump's call in 2019 when he repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, then his potential presidential rival. Akerman also cited the instances of possible obstruction outlined in special counsel Robert Mueller's report on the Russia investigation and the presidential pardons he has granted to allies convicted in the Russia inquiry.\\n\\nMueller, who refused to clear Trump of criminal wrongdoing, said charging him with obstruction was not an option because of a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. After Trump leaves office this month, that policy would no longer be relevant should prosecutors pursue an investigation.\\n\\nThis is the way he operates. You can't look at (the call to Georgia officials) myopically. You have to look at this whole pattern of activity, Akerman said. If I were a prosecutor and I was given this case, I would be looking at … the federal racketeering statute.\\n\\nProving intent, political obstacles\\n\\nAs jarring as Trump's words sounded on the recording, some former prosecutors said, building a criminal case probably would be difficult.\\n\\nProving the criminal intent behind the words that Trump used during the calls is the biggest hurdle, said David Weinstein, a former Miami federal prosecutor. I ... can make an argument that (Trump) was encouraging Raffensperger to create fraudulent evidence or simply change the numbers. Alternatively, I can make an argument that Trump was simultaneously actively extorting Raffensperger to do the same, with a threat of criminal prosecution behind that suggestion.\\n\\nWeinstein said Trump defenders would probably argue that the president was puffing and simply suggesting other alternatives, not actively extorting or encouraging Raffensperger to break the law.\\n\\nThe prosecution would then have to show proof that Trump went beyond that and that it created a reasonable belief in Raffensperger's mind that he was being extorted or forced to break the law, he said.\\n\\nBrian Kelly, who was head of the public corruption unit of the U.S. attorney's office in Boston and was among the attorneys who prosecuted organized crime boss Whitey Bulger, said he does not believe the Biden Justice Department will – or should – pursue a criminal investigation based on Trump's call.\\n\\nProving election law violations are very difficult. If President Trump believes there are actually additional legitimate votes which need to be counted, then he is certainly within his rights to urge state officials to find them and count them, Kelly said. It's a waste of time, and it's inappropriate to use the criminal justice system to settle political scores.\\n\\nPatrick Cotter, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw numerous cases against organized crime figures, said a case against Trump would face political obstacles.\\n\\nBecause Trump is an elected official who has just lost an election, he and his supporters would claim that any criminal prosecution was politically motivated, Cotter said. Leaving aside the political difficulties of such a situation, the ability to ever seat a jury that was not infected with Trump's false claims of a political motivation for the charges would be a serious obstacle to conviction. Not insurmountable in my opinion, but significant.\\n\\nCotter said it was hard to separate the Trump recording from cases involving the conversations of known criminals – with a few exceptions.\\n\\nI would note that the majority of the mafioso I prosecuted or investigated would never have exhibited the astounding stupidity and obviousness of the Trump gang on that call, Cotter said. More intelligent criminals would never have made such threats on a call they should have expected was being recorded.\\n\\nWashington and Georgia require only one-party consent for recording phone calls. Somewhere I imagine John Gotti is shaking his head and muttering, 'Freakin' amateurs,' Cotter said.\\n\\nOpinion: Impeach Trump over new threats"}

Below are five affordable, healthy foods recommended by Keri Gans, nutritionist and author of The Small Change Diet.\\n\\nOatmeal: This inexpensive whole grain is jam-packed with nutrients, Gans says. And it's cheap (and healthy) when you buy a large container of plain oats instead of individual flavored packets. For a balanced breakfast, Gans mixes oats with nonfat milk, peanut butter and a banana.\\n\\nCanned salmon: Get the omega-3 fatty acids and protein of salmon without paying the steeper price of fresh fish. To prepare canned salmon, Gans suggests swapping it into a tuna-salad recipe.\\n\\nEggs: Protein-rich eggs are affordable and versatile. Every household should have eggs in it, Gans says. Enjoy eggs scrambled, poached or sunny-side up — but skip the bacon and hashbrowns, Gans says.\\n\\nBlueberries: This tiny fruit is loaded with fiber and vitamins C and K. To save money, buy berries in-season or frozen, Gans says, but check frozen varieties for additives. The only thing that should be on the ingredient label is the fruit itself, Gans says. Her recipe for a healthy parfait: Mix blueberries with Greek yogurt and a sprinkle of high-fiber cereal.\\n\\nBroccoli: This vegetable has just about everything: protein, fiber, calcium, iron and many vitamins. Plus, it's more affordable than many other veggies, Gans says, particularly when bought frozen. Just check that ingredient label to avoid unhealthy extras. Gans suggests steaming the broccoli or sauteing it in a little olive oil and garlic.\\n\\nNerdWallet helps you discover smart, new ways to save.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nMELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Novak Djokovic stopped quickly, abruptly changed directions and stabbed at a full-stretch volley that whizzed past Dominic Thiem for a winner.\\n\\nHe then turned and beamed. Djokovic is back after the longest injury layoff of his career and he's clearly enjoying himself on the court again.\\n\\nWearing a compression sleeve on his right arm to protect his troublesome elbow, Djokovic dominated the fifth-ranked Thiem 6-1, 6-4 on Wednesday in an exhibition match at the Kooyong Classic, a key tune-up event for next week's Australian Open.\\n\\nStill smiling afterward, Djokovic said he'd had doubts whether he'd be ready to play the first Grand Slam of the year, but the win over Thiem was a major confidence boost.\\n\\nObviously, I was waiting for this moment for six months to get out on the court and play a match, he said. Also, I got a great opponent today, the No. 5 in the world, so it was a fantastic test for me to see where I am.\\n\\nDjokovic, who had been sidelined with the elbow injury since a quarterfinal loss at Wimbledon last year, initially planned to play in an exhibition event in Abu Dhabi and then a tournament in Qatar to start the season, but withdrew from both due to lingering pain in his elbow.\\n\\nHe still traveled to Melbourne hoping to be fit to play in the Australian Open, where he's won six of his 12 career Grand Slam titles. Despite playing pain-free on Wednesday, he said he's still taking it day by day.\\n\\nI don't want to be over-confident, he said. Obviously, I'm very, very happy with the way it went today, but I don't want to say it's 100 percent. I'll say that when I start a tournament and when I get to actually feel that it's 100 percent.

{"original": "Princeton businesswoman Michelle Lambros Pirone opened her summer home on Long Beach Island in August 2018 to congressional candidate Jeff Van Drew so that local Democrats could open up their wallets.\\n\\nShe invited friends, neighbors and stalwarts from the Democratic Club of Long Beach Island to mingle with Van Drew, a Cape May County state legislator who was poised to be the first Democrat to seize the sprawling 2nd Congressional District in South Jersey in nearly a quarter of a century.\\n\\nVan Drew talked about the need to defeat his Republican opponent, Seth Grossman, who had been shunned by the state and national party over racially charged remarks, she said. But Van Drew also touched on the elephant-in-the-room issue that was stoking Democratic Party fury: Donald Trump.\\n\\nHe trashed his opponent more than Trump, but it was all in the same vein, Pirone said. It was about how we needed to put up a fight against Trump and Trumpism and where the direction of the country was going.\\n\\nLast month, Van Drew pivoted in a different direction. He joined the Republican Party and pledged his undying support for Trump, thrusting the once quiet, below-the-radar South Jersey district into the center of the national debate over the potential perils and payoffs of Trump's impeachment for both parties.\\n\\nNew Jersey Democrats are now lashing out, furious that the Jeff Van Drew that they nurtured and protected with money and political muscle during his three-decade climb from Dennis Township committeeman to Congress has morphed into a Trump enabler.\\n\\nTo many Democrats, Van Drew's party switch goes far beyond the rank opportunism that often prompts such a move. Van Drew is now propping up a reckless president who poses as an existential threat to democracy itself, they argue. And he's aiding and abetting Trump with their donations, they say.\\n\\nVan Drew formally defected the day after voting against impeaching Trump. He was one of only three House Democrats to break ranks.\\n\\nYeah, I want a refund,'' Pirone said of the event, which netted a modest haul of $2,500 to $3,000 in small donations.\\n\\nJohn Kostopoulos, president of the Democratic Club of Long Beach Island, succinctly put it this way: I gave money to him to represent the Democratic Party, not take the money to buy advertisements as a Republican with my money.\\n\\nDemocratic chairmen of the eight South Jersey counties also fired off a statement last month, demanding an immediate refund of every dime he raised from Democrats since he sold out in December.\\n\\nTrending news:Penn Station expansion plan to include 8 new tracks, increasing capacity by 40 percent\\n\\nMore Stile:Whether you know their names or not, keep an eye on these NJ politicos in 2020\\n\\nHis refusal to do the right thing would only prove he's nothing more than a Bernie Madoff-style con artist stealing other people's money in a scheme to fill his campaign coffers,'' they fumed in a joint statement.\\n\\nAtlantic County Democratic Party Chairman Michael Suleiman didn't narrow the demand to Van Drew's post-defection donations. He said Van Drew should return it all, although he doubts that's going to happen. While it was Van Drew's prerogative to vote no on impeachment, Suleiman should face the music from the people who supported you.\\n\\nYou took our money, we knocked on doors for you, we made phone calls for you, but you're going to tuck your tail between your legs?'' he said in an interview with NJTV last week. That's ridiculous.\\n\\nVan Drew did not respond to messages seeking comment on Monday. His federal campaign account reported $932,000 on hand as of Sept. 30. He is under no obligation to return money to aggrieved donors, campaign finance experts say, although it's not unprecedented.\\n\\nThe late U.S. Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania agreed to return donations upon request when he switched from the Republican Party to the Democrats in 2009. Many took him up on the offer.\\n\\nVan Drew was a conservative Democrat from South Jersey who was often given a pass from party-line votes on sensitive, progressive legislation during his tenure in the state Legislature, on the grounds that those votes could harm his chances at reelection.\\n\\nTo many, Van Drew was adopting the same logic as a first-term congressman, fearing that a vote for impeachment was unpopular in his district. He argued that the issue was doomed to die in the Republican Senate and diverted attention away from priorities voters cared about.\\n\\nBut he was caught in a tight squeeze: Internal polling showed that a no'' vote could destroy his chances of winning the Democratic nomination. And some Democratic leaders, like Suleiman, made it clear that he would not tolerate Van Drew's no vote.\\n\\nSo Van Drew jumped ship. And he is taking the money with him.\\n\\nVan Drew is staked with other valuable benefits that may come in handy in a likely primary this spring. Trump's campaign dispatched former Trump White House political director Bill Stepien to help run Van Drew's campaign. Stepien has a deep knowledge of New Jersey's political landscape, having served twice as former Gov. Chris Christie's campaign manager.\\n\\nA pro-Trump political action committee is also planning to run $200,000 worth of television ads for Van Drew and $50,000 in digital ads. And then, of course, there is Trump, whose blessing will likely give Van Drew an edge against challengers in the June Republican primary. The Trump campaign announced Monday that the president will hold a Jan. 28 rally in Wildwood, at the southern end of Van Drew's district.\\n\\nYet, to Pirone, the switch is still baffling. In her eyes, the fundraiser was the start of a budding political relationship. After the fundraiser, Van Drew invited Pirone to a luncheon in Philadelphia with House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer of Maryland. She became familiar with his staff.\\n\\nPirone noted that Van Drew was a little more conservative from where I am on the spectrum, but a Democrat nonetheless. She was willing to support him to help Democrats reclaim the House and capture a seat represented by Republican Frank LoBiondo, who was stepping down after 24 years.\\n\\nCertainly, if I had any inkling, I would have never done anything for him, let alone host a fundraiser,'' said Pirone, who was elected to the Princeton Borough Council in November.\\n\\nOther Democrats also had a nuanced view of Van Drew.\\n\\nKostopoulos recalled meeting with Van Drew with a small group three weeks before the switch to discuss climate change policy. Van Drew named one of the members to his advisory panel, Kostopoulos said.\\n\\nAlthough we suspected that he wasn't a 100 percent Democrat, he was doing the right thing here and there,'' he said. His record was not bad.\\n\\nKostopoulos was among the guests at Pirone's event last year. He doesn't remember much of what Van Drew said beyond some general remarks. But one moment stands out.\\n\\nI remember handing him ... an envelope with checks, which he took graciously, Kostopoulos said.\\n\\nEmail: stile@northjersey.com Twitter: @politicalstile"}

The Vice memo says her claims were found to lack merit at the time after a review by law firm, but a special committee of its board is looking at the matter now. It will make a recommendation on what to do before a Jan. 11 board meeting.\\n\\nAs for Germano, the memo says Vice's human-resources department and an external investigator are looking into the allegations. One woman told the Times that he had told her he didn't want to hire her because he wanted to have sex with her. Another woman said he pulled her on to his lap at a work event at a bar.\\n\\nThe Associated Press was not immediately able to reach Germano and Creighton for comment.\\n\\nVice's memo also laid out how the company is trying to change its culture. It said the company will require mandatory sexual harassment training for all employees starting later this month and that the company was committed to having half of employees be female at every level across the organization by 2020. Broderick said pay parity would come by the end of this year.\\n\\nThe reports of sexual misconduct at Vice are part of a wave of allegations of bad behavior in media, entertainment and other industries, as well as politics, that have come in the aftermath of articles detailing Harvey Weinstein's decades of alleged rape and harassment this fall."}

{"original": "Good news first: Hollywood studios have made a solid progress hiring black directors.\\n\\nFor the first time in over a decade, Hollywood studios hired a greater percentage of black directors to helm top-performing films – 16 black directors in 2018, actually – said a new study from Stacy L. Smith and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative.\\n\\nAnd yet, female directors continue to see no change over the same time period.\\n\\nSixteen of the directors of the top 100 movies last year were black – this historically high figure is nearly three times greater than the six black directors working in 2017 and twice as many as the eight black directors working in 2007, said Smith in a statement. While we do not see this finding mirrored among female or Asian directors, this offers proof that Hollywood can change when it wants to.\\n\\nJust how bad is it for women behind the camera?\\n\\nWell, out of the 100 top-grossing films of 2018, only four women were at the helm: Ava DuVernay (A Wrinkle in Time), Kay Cannon (Blockers), Abby Kohn (I Feel Pretty) and Susanna Fogel (The Spy Who Dumped Me).\\n\\nMore:Ava DuVernay working on Prince documentary for Netflix\\n\\nAlso:Ava DuVernay becomes second woman to direct a DC superhero movie with 'New Gods'\\n\\nThe numbers only get worse looking at the 1,200 top-grossing films released between 2007 and 2018, according to the new study.\\n\\nOnly 4.3 percent of all directors across the top films from 2007 to 2018 were female, a ratio of 22 males to every one female director.\\n\\nOnly five black women, three Asian women and one Latina have worked as directors on those 1,200 films, with no evident change over time.\\n\\nAsian directors represented only 3.6 percent of 2018's top 100 film directors. Across the 12-year sample, just 3.1 percent of the 1,335 directors studied were Asian.\\n\\nThe report, titled Inclusion in the Director's Chair, found that women continue to face major roadblocks industry-wide. Women of color are nearly invisible in film production – whether as directors, producers, or in below-the-line crew positions, said Smith.\\n\\nMore:Progress for women directors in Hollywood is still all talk, new study finds\\n\\nThe study found that over the past three years, producers skewed heavily male (82.1 percent), as did cinematographers (97 percent), editors (84.5 percent), production designers (81.7 percent) and composers (97.7 percent). Very few women worked as first assistant directors (9 percent), which is typically a springboard into a director role.\\n\\nThe inclusion report also examined executive ranks at seven major entertainment companies, and found an uptick in women holding board seats."}
{"original": "Every year since I can remember, I have vowed to lose weight at the start of the new year. But then life gets going, and my social calendar fills up with eating and drinking plans that I can't seem to back out of. Last year, though, I found a way to change this pattern: I started using the Weight Watchers app.\\n\\nIf you're not familiar with how Weight Watchers works, you're given a certain amount of points to eat each day, and an extra amount of weekly points to use during days when you go over your daily amount. Every food you eat is worth a number of points, which are calculated based on nutritional values like protein, calories, fat, and carbs. You are also given a certain number of activity points you have to accrue each day, but you can't redeem these points for food.\\n\\nAt first it wasn't easy. I quickly realized that although some foods were low in calories, they were high in points. I spent the first week pretty much starving until I figured out what foods I needed to eat that were low in points and would fill me up. Eventually, I started eating much more than I used to each day – and I actually started losing weight.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nNot to mention, I was able to go out to dinner and drinks with friends without worrying about my diet. After all, Weight Watchers isn't a diet – it's a lifestyle change. If you're thinking about joining Weight Watchers to lose weight or just to become healthier, here are some things you'll need in your kitchen to succeed. Good luck!\\n\\n1. Measuring cups\\n\\nThis is first on the list because measuring cups are arguably the most important items you'll need. When tracking food you eat on Weight Watchers, you have to measure everything, from the guacamole you're having as a snack with chips to the amount of spices you're putting in the crockpot for your latest dinner recipe.\\n\\nIt can be a bit of a challenge at first, but these easy-to-clean measuring cups and spoons make it a snap. They're also beautifully designed and are very highly recommended by Amazon users, too.\\n\\n2. Kitchen scale\\n\\nSome foods are measured by ounces, which can't easily be measured in measuring cups. For example, I eat The Good Bean's salted chickpeas as a snack, and to track them for WW, I just throw a few on my kitchen scale and voila! There is my serving size.\\n\\nKitchen scales are also great to know exactly how much meat you're having. I eat grilled chicken a lot because it's full of protein, and therefore low in points, and I am able to measure how much chicken I'm having.\\n\\n3. Good Food Storage Containers\\n\\nFruits and veggies are all 0 Weight Watchers points. Every Sunday I buy, cut, and wash food to eat all week and store them in plastic containers. This saves me from snacking on food that is high in points while keeping it as convenient as other, less healthy snacks.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nAnother part of eating healthier is making homemade food, and you'll need containers like this to put your homemade lunches in – and store all that leftover food!\\n\\n4. George Foreman Grill\\n\\nAs I said above, foods high in protein are both filling and low in points. So unless you're a vegetarian, there's nothing easier than grilling chicken, turkey, steak, chicken sausages, etc. on a weeknight. I use a George Foreman grill at home, because it's easy to clean and it fits in small spaces.\\n\\nAnd even if you don't eat meat, the George Foreman grill can be used for some vegetables and things like veggie burgers.\\n\\n5. Slow Cooker\\n\\nCooking after a busy day can be hard, but coming home to a cooked dinner after a busy day is easy! Slow cookers are the best because you can dump food in it in the morning and you'll come home to a prepared dinner at night.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIf you want to eat healthy and work a typical 9-5 where you're out of the home all day, a slow cooker is an absolute necessity. It also is easy to cook a large quantity of food without spending too much extra time preparing it all, meaning you'll have leftovers for days to come.\\n\\n6. Cutting board\\n\\nIf your typical food prep to this point has primarily involved finding which restaurant to order takeout from, you're going to need to pick up a few tools of the trade. Cooking for yourself means you'll be washing, cutting, and peeling fruits, veggies, and more – and a good cutting board can make all the difference during that process!\\n\\nThis 3-piece set is great because it's got a groove to collect excess moisture that'll spill out when you cut up washed fruits and veggies, and it's both plastic and dishwasher safe meaning it's easy to clean. That's key especially if you are preparing meats like chicken, where a typical wood cutting board can become a breeding ground for bacteria.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\n7. Mini muffin pan\\n\\nWeight Watchers is all about eating in moderation, and that can be a challenge when most recipes call for making family-sized portions of food. This mini muffin pan can help with that, giving you the ability to cook food in pre-portioned sizes.\\n\\nOf course, you can always use these pans to make actual mini muffins if you're saving up those points. But if you get a little creative you can also knock out a batch of mini frittatas, mini lasagnas, and more!\\n\\n8. SkinnyTaste Cookbooks\\n\\nOne of the challenges of cooking for yourself on WW is that many recipes don't include point values, so you're playing a bit of a guessing game when comparing them between websites. Gina Homolka runs the website Skinnytaste, which features tons of Weight Watchers-friendly recipes with points and nutritional info included for each one.\\n\\nADVERTISEMENT\\n\\nIf you want to count the points in your recipes, Skinnytaste makes it SO easy, and Gina has two cookbooks out now to have as a reference in your kitchen at all times. They're packed full of amazing recipes that you'll love no matter what your dietary needs are."}
{"original": "FLORHAM PARK -- There's a chance that the Jets could once again be looking for a new offensive coordinator.\\n\\nAccording to a report on Sunday, Jon Gruden would like to snag John Morton to be his offensive coordinator if he becomes the Raiders next head coach.\\n\\nJets coach Todd Bowles wouldn't weigh in on the report Monday.\\n\\nI don't deal in rumors, Bowles said. Until somebody talks to me worth something, I'll go from there.\\n\\nBowles said he hasn't discussed with Morton the possibility of a breakup. Morton began his coaching career under Gruden with the Raiders back in 2002. The Raiders' job is open after the team fired coach Jack Del Rio on Sunday. Gruden, who's been in the broadcast booth since 2009, is the reported front-runner for the job.\\n\\nIf Morton left, the Jets would be looking for their sixth offensive coordinator in the last eight seasons. Overall, Bowles said that Morton had a strong first year as a coordinator.\\n\\nI thought he did good, Bowles said. He had some plays that he made. Some things he'd like to have back, obviously. As a first-time coordinator, you learn things. I learned things as a first-time coordinator, but he brought them together.\\n\\nWe ran the ball at times well. At times, we didn't. We threw the ball well. At times, we didn't. We had a lot of change over there. The way he adjusted and brought guys in, receivers, and implemented them into the offense I thought was outstanding. We just keep building and keep growing.\\n\\nMorton had an up-and-down season in his first year as a coordinator. There were times when he got more out of the offense than expected. But there were also times when players were clearly frustrated with the way he was calling games.\\n\\nAfter the Jets' Week 10 loss to Atlanta, running back Matt Forte complained publicly that the Jets weren't running the ball enough.\\n\\nBut if Bowles is truly satisfied with Morton, the Jets don't have to part with him if they don't want to. He's under contract, meaning the Jets can block him from making a lateral move to another team. If a team wanted to hire him away without the Jets' approval, it would have to offer a head coaching job.\\n\\nBowles wouldn't say what his philosophy is on letting a coordinator make a lateral move.\\n\\nMy philosophy is not to even talk about my guys under contract, Bowles said.\\n\\nThe Jets' inability to stick with an offensive system is surely one of the major reasons for their seven-season playoff drought -- the second-longest in team history. But Bowles said the Jets will be OK if they have to install a new offense in 2018.\\n\\nIt's always good to have consistency and continuity, but in the NFL things change all the time, he said. You have to be ready. If we keep the same scheme, that's great. If we have to change for whatever reason, we'll go from there.\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nThe Jets signed nine players to a Reserve/Future contracts Monday: G Ben Braden, T Korren Kirven, WR Jalin Marshall, WR Tre McBride, DL Claude Pelon, DB Terrell Sinkfield, QB Joel Stave, WR Damore'ea Stringfellow and WR Daniel Williams.\\n\\nEmail: vasqueza@northjersey.com"}
{"original": "Lava Hot Springs\\n\\nThe housing market in southeastern Idaho is booming, with home prices soaring. Nowhere is this more true than in Lava Hot Springs, where houses are being bought up before they're even listed, sometimes for well above asking price. Second homes are a hot commodity here. There aren't many houses to begin with, and because of the town's layout, it's hard to build new ones. Plus, most of the people moving into town really only want vacation homes. One local real estate agent said 8 out of 10 people who ask her about buying a home in this tourist town are looking for second homes.

(AP) — Ron Rivera believes the Carolina Panthers rediscovered their swagger during a 38-10 rout of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday — and he couldn't be more pleased.\\n\\nOh yeah, definitely — did you see the picture? the Panthers fifth-year coach said excitedly on Monday.\\n\\nRivera was referring to several of his players posing for a team picture on the sideline — and also doing the dab — in the waning moments of their 11th straight home win, one that assured the Panthers home-field advantage through the NFC playoffs.\\n\\nThe victory photo has become a tradition for the Panthers (15-1) this season, although some opposing teams have taken exception to the celebration and called it excessive and disrespectful.\\n\\nRivera doesn't seem to mind, as long as his players aren't doing anything malicious or hurting anybody.\\n\\nHe doesn't believe they are.\\n\\nOne thing I did tell these guys, keep your personality, Rivera said. Keep true to who you are. And that's important, because that's what makes them who they are as football players as well as people. If we're disappointing some people, I apologize for that. This is who we are and this is how we're going to do our thing.\\n\\nFalcons linebacker O'Brien Schofield wasn't happy the Panthers were posing for pictures in the closing minutes of Carolina's 38-0 win over the Falcons in early December.\\n\\nWhen the Falcons got revenge two weeks later in Atlanta and ended Carolina's perfect season at the Georgia Dome, Schofield harkened back to that loss and said there's a better way to show class if you win a game.\\n\\nPanthers quarterback Cam Newton is no stranger to celebrations — and offers no apologies.\\n\\nWhen he pretended to rip open his shirt like Superman early in his career athletes around the country began mimicking his celebration. And Newton made the dab insanely popular in recent weeks and soon everyone was doing the dance.\\n\\nHis enthusiastic personality has carried over to his teammates.\\n\\nThat's been us ever since Week 1, Newton said Sunday. Nothing is going to change. I say it all the time. We're not celebrating because we're losing.\\n\\nHopefully, if we are able and blessed to be in those situations, there's going to be a lot of guys flying around, having fun and doing what they love doing, just living in the moment.\\n\\nEven normally reserved tight end Greg Olsen got into the act on Sunday.\\n\\nOlsen, who took some slack on social media for not participating in some of the recent sideline celebration photos, was right in the mix after the Panthers wrapped up the NFC's No. 1 seed for the first time.\\n\\nWe were all enjoying it, Olsen said. It's not usually my thing, but I'm all about the team.\\n\\nRivera said he felt his team lost some of its swagger following the 20-13 loss to Atlanta in Week 16.\\n\\nThat setback cost Carolina a shot to match the 1972 Miami Dolphins as the only unbeaten NFL teams.\\n\\nWhen players reported to work the following day Rivera was concerned because everyone was so down. But he said my midweek players had responded and battled back and rediscovered its personality.\\n\\nYou just didn't see that swagger, Rivera said. Going to Atlanta and not playing as well as we're capable of, and then playing as well as we did (on Sunday) is exciting. It really is. It is great to see the guys enjoying it and to see their confidence. I think it is part of who we are.\\n\\nLinebacker Thomas Davis said it was vital not only that the Panthers capture home-field advantage, but also to build some momentum heading into the postseason.\\n\\nThe Panthers will play Jan. 17 in the divisional playoffs against one of three teams — Seattle, Washington or Green Bay.\\n\\nThe Panthers have beaten all three this season.\\n\\nIt was important for this team to get back on track, and we were able to do that —offensively, defensively and on special teams, Davis said. Whenever we go out and put it all together like we did today, it's going to be tough to beat this team.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

Southwest is regarded as the gold standard of discount carriers, and airline experts have told The Enquirer it is the only low-cost airline that has the cachet to lower ticket prices across the board at an airport.\\n\\nThat's good news for both business and leisure fliers in Greater Cincinnati. For years, competing airlines shied away from coming to CVG because of Delta's dominance. But Delta has cut nearly 600 flights at its once-thriving CVG hub in the past decade, mostly due to the airline's 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines.\\n\\nSince McGraw took over as airport CEO in summer 2011, CVG has worked with top business leaders to aggressively recruit low-cost airlines. The airport pursued all domestic low-cost carriers, also including JetBlue Airways. Those efforts began to payoff four years ago this month, when low-cost Frontier Airlines announced it was coming to town.\\n\\nFrontier started non-stop flights to its Denver hub in May 2013, and has expanded multiple times since. Its success opened the door for another discount airline to come to town in 2014, when leisure carrier Allegiant Air launched at CVG. The Las Vegas-based airline also has expanded several times, mostly offering flights to beach destinations in Florida and South Carolina.\\n\\nDallas-based Southwest Airlines is the company that created the model for low-fare airline.

{"original": "AUSTIN, Texas -- Texas legislators are joining the national push to enact laws giving college athletes rights to cash in on their name, image and likeness just in case the NCAA fails to move forward.\\n\\nState Rep. Matt Krause, R-Fort Worth, has filed legislation for the session beginning Jan. 12 that would allow athletes at Texas, Texas A&M and any other institution in the state to work with an agent and sign legal contracts.\\n\\nOther states around the country such as California and Michigan are farther down the road. But Texas is likely to catch up fast as Krause hopes House Bill 920 will be a bipartisan issue that attracts all kinds of support.\\n\\nWe wanted to make sure getting a head start into session that we were going to do something with this, Krause said Monday. This is something that we need to have a serious discussion with during the session.\\n\\nMore:Democratic senators introduce 'College Athletes Bill of Rights' that could reshape NCAA\\n\\nMore:Supreme Court says it will hear case challenging NCAA's athlete-compensation rules\\n\\nThe rules have been lopsided toward the adults for decades as the NCAA labeled the athletes amateurs, unable to profit themselves while the schools rake in billions.\\n\\nThe University of Texas will pay football coach Tom Herman about $15 million just to leave with three years remaining on his contract. Meanwhile, senior quarterback Sam Ehlinger, a four-year starter, has been unable to monetize his name, image or likeness during his entire UT tenure even though Ehlinger is the program's most recognizable star.\\n\\nThe language of Krause's bill is similar to what appears in other states. Schools would be banned from keeping an athlete from entering into contracts, but rules would be in place to keep schools from giving athletes money as a recruiting inducement.\\n\\nIf enacted, the law would take effect Jan. 1, 2023.\\n\\nKrause is working with Rep. Drew Darby, R-San Angelo, and hopes to have multiple co-sponsors.\\n\\nThe NCAA at first was against the idea of letting athletes have such earning power. But threats of lawsuits and federal intervention forced the association to cave. New rules are expected to pass later this month that will effectively allow athletes to start profiting off their name, image and likeness.\\n\\nAthletes would probably be able to get paid for advertisements for local establishments or become social media influencers. Also under the NCAA's guideline proposal, athletes would be allowed to accept money for autographs and personal appearances.\\n\\nThe schools worry about appearances. What happens when an athlete signs a sponsorship with Coca-Cola but the school is sponsored by Pepsi? Or what happens when athletes accept appearance fees from nightclubs?\\n\\nAccording to Krause's proposal, it would be prohibited for an athlete to sign a contract directly opposed to a school's current corporate partner. The NCAA's proposal would push that decision to each school.\\n\\nTexas athletics has already partnered with Altius Sports to be the Longhorns' in-house adviser to the athletes for name, image and likeness issues. Altius officials could help UT athletes determine their fair market value and advise on contract structure.\\n\\nThe bill is consistent with the changes across the country, and this whole NIL change is coming, whether folks like it or not, Altius CEO Casey Schwab said. So it's a good thing the legislators in the state of Texas are moving on the issue.

They laid siege to the embassy for two days before beginning to disperse as security personnel fired tear gas into the crowd.\\n\\nSecretary Pompeo must postpone his visit to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Cyprus due to the need for the Secretary to be in Washington, D.C., to continue monitoring the ongoing situation in Iraq and ensure the safety and security of Americans in the Middle East, the State Department said in a statement.\\n\\nPompeo plans to reschedule his trip soon, the statement said.\\n\\nThe mob breached the embassy after U.S. airstrikes killed at least two dozen fighters linked to Kataeb Hezbollah, a militia the U.S. says is supported by Iran's elite Quds Force and is responsible for a rocket attack last week that killed an American contractor and wounded four U.S. service members.\\n\\nKataeb Hezbollah, or Hezbollah Brigades, is part of a larger umbrella group of Shiite militias called the Popular Mobilization Forces, whose leaders painted the embassy attack as a victory.\\n\\nPompeo and President Donald Trump directly blamed Iran for the embassy breach.\\n\\nIn a phone call to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi on Wednesday, Pompeo condemned the Iran-backed terrorist attack on U.S. Embassy Baghdad, the State Department said in a readout of the call.

{"original": "After months of debates on Medicare for All and taxes on billionaires, the Democratic presidential primary has been upended by questions on Iran, foreign policy and who is best fit to lead the country in a time of crisis.\\n\\nTwo of the race's leading candidates are seizing on that shift.\\n\\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who built their campaigns appealing to opposite ends of the Democratic voter spectrum, sharpened their focus on world affairs after a U.S. airstrike killed top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani in Iraq.\\n\\nThe killing inflamed tensions with Iran and Iraq and raised worries about whether the United States is again on the brink of a war in the Middle East.\\n\\nDuring campaign stops in Iowa over the weekend, Biden and Sanders criticized President Donald Trump for the airstrike. Both spent several days canvassing the state that will kick off the Democratic primary with the first-in-the-nation caucuses in 27 days.\\n\\nBefore the airstrike, 33% of voters rated foreign policy as an important issue affecting their choice for president, according to a poll by Suffolk University/USA TODAY in December. It ranked below the economy, health care, immigration and gun control but ahead of impeachment and climate change.\\n\\nBiden delivered a special address Tuesday in New York on the situation with Iran. Standing in front of American flags, Biden said the airstrike proved Trump to be dangerously incompetent. He accused the president of a haphazard decision process and a reckless disregard of the consequences that would surely follow. He added that Trump has failed to provide a sober-minded explanation for the airstrike, which he said has put the U.S. and Iran on a collision course.\\n\\nJoe Biden:The 2020 candidate shares his views on foreign policy, the economy and more\\n\\nAll we've heard from this administration is shifting explanations, evasive answers, repeated assertions of an imminent threat without the necessary evidence to support that conclusion, he said in a nearly 20-minute speech.\\n\\nThe only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy, Biden said.\\n\\nSanders, an independent from Vermont, has increasingly gone on the attack against Biden, calling his record weak and placing foreign policy atop his critique.\\n\\nJoe Biden voted and helped lead the effort for the war in Iraq – the most dangerous foreign policy blunder in the modern history of this country, Sanders said in an interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night.\\n\\nHow Biden, Sanders approach the Iran question\\n\\nFor Biden, the tension in the Middle East provides a chance to play up his foreign policy experience, both as vice president and as a longtime member and former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. A poll by CNN in October found 56% of Democratic voters said Biden is best equipped to handle foreign policy.\\n\\nSpeaking to caucusgoers at a hotel Sunday in Grinnell, Iowa, Biden argued that the killing of Soleimani turned the Iranian military leader into a hero. He pointed to the thousands of mourners packing the streets of Iran.\\n\\nThey expect literally hundreds of thousands of supporters who were initially opposed to the government in Tehran now solidified around the leadership in Tehran, Biden said.\\n\\nMore:Campaigning in Iowa, Joe Biden predicts Iranian dominance in the Middle East after Soleimani's death, Iraqi vote\\n\\nBiden said Iran is in the driver's seat in the Middle East, noting the Iraqi parliament's vote to remove U.S. forces from the nation. He said Iran will speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon. He predicted Iranian leaders will become more popular in their own country as its citizens rally behind them after the attack.\\n\\nThis is a crisis totally of Donald Trump's making, Biden said.\\n\\nBernie Sanders:The 2020 candidate shares his views on foreign policy, climate change and more\\n\\nSanders, who has long run on an anti-war platform, used the Iran question to remind Democrats about his vote in the Senate against the war in Iraq. That's in contrast to Biden, whose record on the conflict could make him vulnerable among the more liberal wing of the party.\\n\\nSince October, Sanders has separated himself in polls from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the other top Democrat in the liberal lane, solidifying himself in second in recent national polls behind Biden. He overcome a heart attack that month and pundits who had written off his campaign. If the Democratic primary is as drawn out as it was in 2016, Sanders could set up his foreign policy differences with Biden as an issue for the months ahead as both men battle for votes.\\n\\nSaturday, Sanders opened a campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa, by calling for immediate congressional action to stop Trump from launching a war with Iran.\\n\\nOur founding fathers gave the responsibility over war not to the president but to Congress, Sanders said. That is very clear in the Constitution. And in my view, Congress must, must act in the face of a president who has shown time and time again that he cannot be relied upon to tell us the truth or to make well thought out decisions.\\n\\nMore:Bernie Sanders, campaigning in Iowa, says 'if Congress wants to go to war, let Congress have the guts to vote for war'\\n\\nThe day before, Sanders gave his first public statement on the killing of Soleimani, which he called an assassination and a dangerous escalation. He told a crowd in Anamosa, Iowa, that Trump promised to end endless wars, but tragically, his actions now put us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.\\n\\nI have consistently opposed this dangerous path to war with Iran. But we need to do more than just stop the potential of a war. We need to firmly commit to ending the U.S. military presence in the Middle East, in an orderly manner, not through a tweet.\\n\\nWhat do voters say?\\n\\nKenn Bowen, 69, a Sanders supporter from Iowa City, applauded the senator's remarks: He made no bones about it. He's against it, and he thinks this is wrong.\\n\\nI've seen the cost of war, both in money and lives, said Bowen, wearing a Vietnam veteran hat and a denim vest with a peace logo sewn on the back. He said he's worried that a war with Iran would spiral and pull in other world powers, such as China and Russia.\\n\\nBiden supporter Richard Marsh of Cedar Falls, Iowa, cited the former vice president's foreign policy experience as one reason for his support. Marsh, who was at Biden's headquarters in Waterloo on Saturday morning, said Biden's connections with other world leaders will create more stable relations in areas such as the Middle East.\\n\\nMarsh said he's worried the United States is on a path toward another war and believes Biden would not have ordered the strike that killed Soleimani.\\n\\nHe would have sat down and talked to them, Marsh said.\\n\\nMore:Timeline: How tensions escalated with Iran since Trump withdrew US from nuclear deal\\n\\nThe White House said the president ordered the strike because Soleimani plotted attacks that endangered American troops and officials.\\n\\nThe Trump campaign said in a statement Monday that the president is cleaning up Joe Biden's Iran's mess.\\n\\nOn Sunday, Iran effectively backed out of a nuclear deal with world powers, saying it would no longer abide by operational restrictions on its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration withdrew from the agreement, which was negotiated by President Barack Obama, in May 2018.\\n\\nHostilities between Tehran and Washington have escalated since Trump's withdrawal. The Trump administration blames Iran for a series of provocations in the region.\\n\\nIraq's parliament voted to expel the U.S. military from the country, prompting Trump to threaten deep sanctions against Iraq on Sunday.\\n\\nMore:Iran abandons commitments to nuclear deal after Gen. Qasem Soleimani killing\\n\\nWhat other leading Democratic candidates say\\n\\nOther Democrats, including Warren and former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg, slammed Trump's airstrike before the Iowa caucuses.\\n\\nWarren, campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, said she questions the Trump administration's justification for the strike. She said the United States is not safer than it was a week ago.\\n\\nImmediately after they announced that they had killed this general, they had multiple different stories on why – they couldn't keep their story straight, she said. They pointed in all different directions, and now the president has taken us to the brink of war.\\n\\nWarren, who also called the airstrike an assassination, said the United States needs a president who is calm and steady-handed and who understands the importance of de-escalating and getting out of conflict – not someone who moves us closer and closer to the brink.\\n\\nTrump's tweets about attacks don't count as congressional notice, Warren says in Iowa\\n\\nButtigieg, who served as a naval intelligence officer in Afghanistan, said on MSNBC's Morning Joe on Monday that he has no interest in keeping or adding ground troops in Iraq and that the United States should not have invaded Iraq in the first place.\\n\\nHe said Soleimani has blood on his hands and was a bad actor in the region, but he questioned whether the Trump administration had a plan.\\n\\nWhat we've seen here is no evidence that there's been proper consultation with Congress, and more importantly and more dangerously, no evidence that they've really thought about the consequences.\\n\\nContributing: Kim Hjelmgaard, USA TODAY; Nick Coltrain, Tyler Jett and Kim Norvell, Des Moines Register\\n\\nReach Joey Garrison and on Twitter @joeygarrison."}

Pretty much your prohibitive Super Bowl favorites.\\n\\n2. Bears (2): League's stingiest defense has gotten deserved acclaim after being overlooked in recent years. Coordinator Vic Fangio now a hot HC candidate.\\n\\n3. Rams (3): Needed bye with Todd Gurley, Andrew Whitworth on mend. Won't open playoffs hosting Kryptonite Eagles, who have beaten Rams six straight times.\\n\\n4. Chiefs (5): Finally completed quest for AFC's top seed. But what do they do with it given they've lost six consecutive playoff games at Arrowhead?\\n\\n5. Ravens (6): Appropriate they reached wild-card round given they're ultimate wild cards with dynamic rookie QB, grind-'em-up attack and jackhammer defense.\\n\\n6. Chargers (4): They crest too soon? Philip Rivers has looked quite mortal since heroics in Kansas City and didn't come close to solving Ravens in Week 16.\\n\\n7. Patriots (8): Tempting to pencil them into eighth straight AFC title game, though that seems far likelier if they draw Texans — their personal punching bags —in divisional round.\\n\\n8. Colts (7): Was there a better free agent signing in 2018 than TE Eric Ebron? His career year included 14 TDs after he scored 12 in four combined seasons with Detroit.\\n\\n9. Seahawks (9): Reboot pretty much complete. Paul Allen would be proud. Be tough to win in New Orleans, but they can easily beat anyone else in January.\\n\\n10. Texans (10): They're 3-1 all-time in wild-card games, so history says they're primed to notch that signature win skeptics say they've lacked all season.\\n\\n11. Cowboys (11): Efficacy of their battered offensive line could be the key to their ability to survive Seattle in Saturday's wild-card showdown.\\n\\n12.

Browns (16): What if Baker Mayfield had started sooner? What if Hue Jackson had been fired sooner? Regardless, Cleveland thrilled Factory of Sadness has apparently been shuttered.\\n\\n15. Vikings (12): Maybe this is what Minnesota fans should've reasonably expected — since becoming full-time starter in 2015, Kirk Cousins' record is 32-30-2.\\n\\n16. Falcons (18): This just got interesting. One of league's most stable and talented rosters in recent years about to get whole new band of coordinators.\\n\\n17. Titans (13): They realized, a bit too late, that Derrick Henry should be their offensive identity. Now it's time to decide if they can rely on Marcus Mariota.\\n\\n18. Packers (17): This figures to be most scrutinized coaching hire of offseason as candidates decide whether working with Aaron Rodgers is a pro or con.\\n\\n19. Giants (19): Scintillating Saquon Barkley clearly new face of this franchise. What it means for OBJ's ego and Eli Manning's future remains to be seen.\\n\\n20.

Bengals (31): Just when you thought Marvin Lewis had lifetime appointment, Mike Brown makes a change. Next, he needs to change his spending habits.\\n\\n26. Broncos (27): John Elway still insists this is a plum job, but next coach will be well aware he might end up paying for GM's personnel mistakes.\\n\\n27.

{"original": "For people who don't believe in God, suspend your disbelief for a moment.\\n\\nBecause I need to tell you about how three black boys from three different cities escaped dire circumstances, met at Xavier University in Louisiana and pledged to help each other become doctors.\\n\\nThey say God brought them together and kept them together until the last one had graduated medical school, until the last rotation was completed, until they opened their own practices. Now, they help pay to educate young men and women who look like them, to make sure they are not the last.\\n\\nOnly about 5 percent of practicing physicians in 2015 were black, compared with a 13 percent African American population, according to a 2015 New York Times report. So these three are spending part of their salaries providing scholarships for future doctors. That is what black Americans must do, not just in Detroit but across the country: We must stop asking others to do what we must do for our children.\\n\\nThe three doctors put themselves in a position to help by sharing their stories in a new book, Pulse of Perseverance: Three Black Doctors on Their Journey to Success. Their goal is to tell their stories to as many young people as possible.\\n\\nBasketball or medicine? A crossroads, a choice\\n\\nDr. Pierre Johnson is a 38-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist at Chicago Metropolitan Hospital. But 35 years ago, he remembers running.\\n\\nI was 3 years old. My mother and I were running frantically down the street. I remember exactly where we were because we ran past my preschool. We were running from my father, who was high out of his mind, with a disheveled appearance in jeans and a sleeveless undershirt.\\n\\nThat is from one of his chapters in Pulse of Perseverance. In an interview, he recalls that I grew up on the South Side of Chicago, and I really wanted to play sports … But when I got to college, I realized that I was under-prepared for the curriculum and it really came to a crossroads. Will I continue the rigors for something that wasn't going to be fruitful? Or would I give it up and put my efforts into school. I was humbled, and I realized that one had to go.\\n\\nHe chose medicine over basketball.\\n\\nI was challenged by my aunt. I wanted to play professional basketball. She told me to create Plan B, he said. My parents were both addicted to drugs, and as a kid, I saw a lot of violence and destruction. And I wanted better for my life. ... I knew what I had to do to academically to get to a level of success. I was very fascinated by obstetrics and childbirth and I was very good with my hands, dexterity, so I thought that was something I definitely wanted to pursue.\\n\\nBlack leaders at hospital 'changed my life'\\n\\nDr. Max Madhere, 38, is a cardiac anesthesiologist in Baton Rouge, La. But as a child, Madhere was caught in the middle of a devastating divorce between his father and his mentally ill mother. His father moved him away from their mother to Washington, D.C. for a life safer than the one they were living in Brooklyn. His father would teach statistics at Howard University until his recent retirement.\\n\\nMy father provided the first imprint of strong male leadership in my life, he said. The biggest thing he did for me early on was to talk about the struggles of black people in general, the story of African-Americans in America, everything they had to deal with, everything they had to go through. …when I was in school, I tried to stay on task.\\n\\nI grew up during the tail end of the crack era, so even though I had positive influences in my home, dad couldn't protect my siblings and me from the things we encountered in the neighborhoods, he said. I became a doctor because when we moved to Washington when it was still considered Chocolate City, the high school I went to was across the street from Howard University Hospital.\\n\\nTo meet a required 200-hour community service requirement to graduate, Madhere said he was lazy and went across the street to the nearby hospital.\\n\\nThat changed my entire life, he said. I volunteered just to be an orderly, but what I saw was black people in positions of leadership, making key decisions every day, impacting people's lives. So from that time on, I said 'I'm going to be a physician.' I kept my eyes on the prize and never changed.\\n\\nA drug dealer until a role model was murdered\\n\\nDr. Joseph Semien is a 40-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist at Lake Charles Memorial Hospital in Lake Charles, La. Despite being the son of a strong Christian couple who are still married at 45 years and counting, he was a disruptive student (even hitting a teacher in elementary school) and he became a drug dealer.\\n\\nMy dad definitely inspired us, but he lacked education, Semien said. My dad had a third-grade education. …One of the things I was exposed to was drugs. After seeing these things around me, I began to be curious, and I began to sell drugs myself.\\n\\nHis life changed with a devastating wake-up call. On Oct. 14, 1996, when someone that I looked up to, someone that I felt inspired me in my life, was murdered. He was shot nine times, he said. At that moment, all of my dreams, everything that I wanted to do in my life that everyone said that I couldn't accomplish, I was willing and pushed to pursue my goals. I wanted to become a doctor before I sold drugs. I wanted to become a doctor when my mom was in her room praying for me. I wanted to become a doctor when I was at home looking at all the animals around me (in science class), and dissecting them.\\n\\nHe decided to swap out the people in his life, find those who could inspire, and hunker down.\\n\\n'We started to push each other'\\n\\nThe doctors met at Xavier University of Louisiana, which they credit with paving their way to different medical schools and their current success. It was the place their bond was formed and their pledge to make each other doctors was sealed.\\n\\nThey met in the library. When we found each other, we were all clinically depressed, Johnson said. Maxime's from New York, and I'm from Chicago. And first we talked about Knicks and Bulls… But we looked at each other and saw just a look of determination… and even though we were both doing poorly at that time, we knew that we had the drive that nobody could put their finger on, so we really connected in the library. And …we started to push each other.\\n\\nA couple of weeks later, they saw another guy just sitting there with books sprawled out on the table, and we started up a conversation. That frustrated young man was Joseph Semien. And from that point through their arduous journeys at different medical schools across the country, they shared study guides, time and encouragement.\\n\\nYears of success later, each of the doctors realized that their personal achievement was not enough. I remember sitting in my office one day… and I looked on my wall and I saw all the degrees, my masters, my medical school degree, Simeon said. I was trying to figure out why I was not as happy as I should be…. It was because I needed to share something with someone else, to push someone not to achieve my goals, but even do better to go beyond what I had done.\\n\\nMadhere spoke of living in a 5,000-square foot home with his wife and three kids in a tony neighborhood and seeing no one who looked like him. Around that time, he said, That was when Trayvon (Martin) got shot. That's when Tamir Rice died. That's when Eric Garner died. Philando Castile died… God was tugging on our shoulders, saying 'Hey, you guys have got to do something.'\\n\\nTheir success wouldn't matter as much if they didn't change the paradigm, Madhere said. That includes helping people to stop seeing black excellence as an anomaly.\\n\\nAs I walk through the hospitals, I don't change myself, mohawk, earrings, tattoos. Like the kids say, I keep it 100, Johnson said. To watch how people look at me…When I walk into a room, I'm everything in their eyes but a surgeon... And that's not only from my colleagues. That's from people who look like us. That's what hurts me.\\n\\nWhen he visits schools, we don't dress like this, he said, pointing to his suit. We keep it 100, jogging suits. We want to show them we're not different than you. The first question we ask is: What do we look like? And we get everything from rappers to party promoters. But then they see the book and the white coats, and it's 'O-h-h-h-h.' We're tired of that narrative. We're tired of the stereotypes. If we don't believe it, how in the hell we going to get everybody else to believe it?\\n\\nOne recent Friday night in Detroit at a mentoring event, the doctors got the chance to teach that lesson to Isaiah Bell, 14, a self-declared future neurosurgeon. Was it hard for you to come together and be like brothers? he asked.\\n\\nWhat we understood was there is enough for everyone at the top, Johnson told him. We knew that together is much easier than trying to do this on our own. You have to realize that everybody in your school is not going to be on your side, but there's two or three trying to do exactly what you're trying to do, and that's who you have to surround yourself with.\\n\\nSemien added: All three of us will tell you we're not highly intelligent super-geniuses. We just worked really hard. When I talk to kids, they say man, 'Doc, you're like one of us, and I tell them I AM one of you.'\\n\\nAnd that's how three boys whose beginnings didn't predict their ends became doctors, kept their finger on the pulse of perseverance, and are making sure that in the future, others will be able to tell similar success stories.\\n\\nRochelle Riley is a columnist at the Detroit Free Press, where this piece first appeared, and author of The Burden: African Americans and the Enduring Impact of Slavery.

{"original": "Russ Wiles\\n\\nThe Arizona Republic\\n\\nHigh-tech Gorilla glass has replaced crystal in many crystal balls. Will it result in clearer predictions? Hard to say. But here are some financial-focused trends that look to be safe bets for 2016:\\n\\nMore talk, less action on taxes.\\n\\nCongress in December finally made permanent several tax rules for individuals, rather than extending them on a yearly basis as had become the norm. These include a deduction for teachers, optional tax-free charitable distributions from IRAs and the option of deducting state and local sales taxes instead of state/local income taxes. It also extended other rules for two years. These include a college tuition and fees deduction, an exclusion from taxable income of canceled mortgage debt and a credit worth up to $500 for homeowners who install energy-efficient windows, air-conditioning systems and the like.\\n\\nThese actions should clear up some uncertainty for taxpayers. That's good because the prospects for major tax legislation in a presidential election year aren't strong. But as campaigning heats up, we likely will see more serious proposals from leading candidates on tax topics. Tax reform and policies to shore up Social Security are among the issues that could come up for debate.\\n\\nAdded opportunities/risks with crowdfunding.\\n\\nSocial media has proved to be an effective way to raise donations for people facing big medical bills or supporting a non-profit quest. It also could result in more investments in fledgling companies.\\n\\nEquity crowdfunding could expand noticeably in the coming year following federal legislation in 2013 that opened it up and recent rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission that allow small businesses to raise up to $1 million, with simplified regulations.\\n\\nBut the public must be careful. The pitch that small investors can get in on the ground floor of the next Google is simply too alluring for many investors to resist, even though 99 of these deals will prove to be unprofitable, said Chicago securities attorney Andrew Stoltmann,\\n\\nAt a minimum, he suggests that investors steer clear of companies lacking audited financial reports. Most of these outfits won't have audited financial statements, and without those you are literally trusting the firms to be honest.\\n\\nMore information, reduced privacy.\\n\\nIf you visited an electronics store lately, you couldn't help but notice all the drones for sale. Many already are in the air, and more will take flight in 2016, equipped with tiny cameras to snap photos of hot tubs, backyard parties and more.\\n\\nDrones aren't the only sign that privacy is eroding. All those smartphones in circulation can take photos, too. So can traffic sensors and security cameras. Retailers and government agencies fumble away personal information about customers by letting hackers into their data systems. Many people willingly reveal sensitive details about themselves through careless posts of comments and photos. It all adds up to a backdrop where Americans' shopping habits, dating preferences, driving habits and even medical issues are broadly available.\\n\\nTo some degree, the genie already is out of the bottle. But consumers still can take steps to defend themselves, such as by protecting financial records, checking credit reports (go to annualcreditreport.com for free copies) and just plain using common sense. If you wouldn't want to put up a statement on a billboard next to your house, don't put (the same message) on Facebook, said Eva Casey Velasquez of the Identity Theft Resource Center in San Diego.\\n\\nMore mergers and acquisitions.\\n\\nThe recently announced $130-billion marriage of Dow Chemical and DuPont put an exclamation mark on a busy year for mergers and acquisitions. When final numbers are in, 2015 will set records for M&A dollar volume and number of deals, reported McKinsey & Co. The trend could continue in 2016, with important implications for investors, employees, suppliers and competitors of affected companies.\\n\\nIn a recent report, McKinsey experts Werner Rehm and Andy West described the rationale for M&A deals as changing. In the past, big deals were often seen as tactics to address cost reduction and industry consolidation, they wrote. But today we also see deals where managers and boards are talking about diversification and, for the first time in a long time, about revenue — about cross-selling and creating new customer opportunities, and about transformation.\\n\\nMore M&A deals might provide a lift for the stock market, especially if the economic background continues to improve.\\n\\nIncreased pressure on bond prices.\\n\\nForecasters have been predicting for the past several years that interest rates would rise and bonds prices would decline. Now that the Federal Reserve boosted interest rates in December, it might finally happen.

Conditions, he said, are likely to change unpredictably. The Bureau of Meteorology issued an extreme fire danger forecast for the north of the state on Friday.\\n\\nThat's why we're again asking people in high-risk areas to leave ahead of time, Andrews said.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nGone are the days in the NHL when high-scoring Wayne Gretzky and Mario Lemieux lit up goaltenders at will.\\n\\nGoals are down across the league over the past decade and even hockey's biggest stars struggle to score these days.\\n\\nExcept Alex Ovechkin.\\n\\nThe Washington Capitals left winger is three goals away from becoming the 43rd player in NHL history to reach 500 for his career and will likely be the fifth-fastest to hit that milestone. Gretzky, Lemieux and fellow Hall of Famers Mike Bossy and Brett Hull are the only ones to do it in fewer games.\\n\\nOvechkin will play his 800th game Saturday at the New York Rangers. As he approaches one of hockey's magic numbers, Ovechkin continues to show why he's among the game's best by scoring at a pace that no one else in this era can match.\\n\\nI thought I could score every night. I thought I was unstoppable, Hull said. And I watch him in today's game, and it's scary to watch him do what he does. ... For him to do what he does in today's game is awesome.\\n\\nWhat Ovechkin is doing is almost unheard of in today's game. His 497 goals are by far the most of any player since he entered the league in 2005. The second closest is 350 by Jarome Iginla, who just reached the 600-goal mark for his career last week at the age of 38.\\n\\nOvechkin is 30 — beyond what is usually a goal-scorer's prime — and he already has six 50-goal seasons, including 65 in 2007-08.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, seven or eight goals a game was the norm and Gretzky, Hull and Bossy were scoring 80-plus a season. Ovechkin was the only 50-goal scorer last year and is defying hockey's curve that has made elite goal-scorers almost extinct.\\n\\nHe's been able to do it because he's probably the greatest goal-scorer of all time, former Capitals general manager George McPhee said. He's an incredibly powerful man, and the way that puck comes off his stick — the power, the thrust behind it — is unlike anything most people have seen.\\n\\nOvechkin tires of talking about how he's done it.\\n\\nJust Google it: What's Alex Ovechkin's answer to this question? the Russian said. I just try to shoot the puck as much as I can because if you don't shoot, you can't score.\\n\\nOnly 717-goal-scorer Phil Esposito and Hull shot the puck as much as Ovechkin, who averages five a game. But it's not that simple: Ovechkin is the most effective shooter of this era because of his physical strength, skating ability and a release that can freeze goaltenders even when they know what's coming.\\n\\nThe superstar in him is definitely there, said Adam Oates, who coached Ovechkin for two years and played alongside Hull during his Hall of Fame career. Watching him for two years close up reminded me a lot of Hully in the sense that Brett could shoot a puck from anywhere at any time.\\n\\nA lot of guys just shoot it when it's in their wheelhouse. He can shoot it from anywhere.\\n\\nNaturally, Ovechkin has his spots. When opponents figured out how to slow him down to 32 and 38 goals in back-to-back seasons, he and the Capitals adjusted.\\n\\nOn the power play, Oates told Ovechkin to stay in the faceoff circle to make the most of his patented one-timer.\\n\\nAt even strength, Oates moved Ovechkin to right wing, a change that once it took hold led to him winning his third Hart Trophy as NHL MVP in 2013. And even though new coach Barry Trotz moved Ovechkin back to his more comfortable left wing, two seasons on the right side helped reinvent him as a scorer.\\n\\nYou see him get goals in front of the net five-on-five, you see him get backhand goals, you see him get tip goals, Oates said. Playing a little bit of right side has helped that evolving five-on-five because I think it's made him a little bit more of a complete player.\\n\\nOvechkin said one of his improvements has been relying less on power-play goals, and only seven of his 22 this season have come on the power play. It helps that the Capitals are the league's most complete team and lead the NHL with 63 points, so Ovechkin doesn't have to put all the pressure on his shoulders.\\n\\nA Stanley Cup has eluded Ovechkin, and that's what he's most focused on. But reaching the 500-goal plat is a testament to how important a generational player Ovechkin is.\\n\\nYou can tell that Gretzky would score a lot of points now, you would know that Ovechkin would score a lot of goals in the '80s, former Capitals coach Glen Hanlon said. No matter where he played, when he played, he'd be doing those things.\\n\\n__\\n\\nhttp://bigstory.ap.org/latest"}
{"original": "Brendan G Nystedt\\n\\nReviewed.com\\n\\nDell's XPS 13 is one of the best laptops we've ever used here at Reviewed.com, and we've thrown plenty of awards its way. For 2017, Dell's taken most of its awesome ultrabook formula and flipped it on its head. The new Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 keeps most of what we love about the standard XPS 13 and added hinges that let you use it in tablet modes. Dell's kept the distinctive, beautiful design and signature InfinityEdge display.\\n\\nThis Dell's gotten even thinner, thanks in part to a change to 7th generation Intel Y-series chips. Even though this XPS 13 looks a lot like the previous incarnations, you'll lose out on a bit of power due to the different proccessor. Dell claims that these notebooks will keep up with their older, 2016 6th generation-based XPS 13, but we'll have to try it to be absolutely certain. This downgraded processor will, at the very least, put the XPS 13 2-in-1 behind the awesome new HP Spectre X360 for power, but in the real world it might not matter much.\\n\\nThe upside of a Y-based processor is that it allows the new XPS 13 2-in-1 to go commpletely fanless, making it utterly silent at all times.\\n\\nOther than the 360-degree hinges and ultra mobile processor, the XPS 13 2-in-1 also breaks from its predecessors by only including 2 USB-C ports. Thankfully, one of the ports is also fully compliant with Thunderbolt 3, so it's also a do-it-all high-speed port for all kinds of devices. A USB-C to USB adapter is included with the device in the box.\\n\\nIntel Y-series chips will make this thin XPS slower, but we'll have to try to see if it impacts usability.\\n\\n\\n\\nThough the keyboard and trackpad are both carried over from the original flavor XPS 13, Dell's added in Active Pen compatibility, making the XPS 2-in-1 ready for doodles and notetaking. XPS lovers who appreciated the SD card slot need not apply, as Dell's ditched it in this model. There is also a standard Windows Hello-compatible webcam, which has been moved from the lefthand corner of the device to the center, making it just a little less awkward than the old setup.\\n\\nAll in all, it sounds like Dell's taken most of the things we love about the XPS 13 and turned it into an appealing tablet. Though the changes and omissions will irritate those who love the current design, they were done to make the device better when used in tent or tablet modes. The new XPS 13 2-in-1 is competitively priced, starting at just $999 and shipping later this month. If you don't need the flippy hinges Dell's included in this version, the standard ultrabook XPS 13 will continue to be sold alongside the 2-in-1."}

{"original": "Mike Feibus\\n\\nSpecial for USA TODAY\\n\\nOnce again, PC makers at CES are spotlighting a new generation of laptops designed to persuade you to leave your iPad at home. But this time, they just might succeed.\\n\\nEver since Steve Jobs introduced the iPad a decade ago, PC makers have been searching frantically for ways to convince you that you don't need one. Much of the focus has been on improving the aesthetics, packing the power of laptops into slimmer, sleeker, tablet-like frames.\\n\\nNow, with a new generation of laptops on display this week at CES, they're finally starting to make a case for offering what only our tablets have been able to deliver thus far, like all-day battery life, quick availability and rapid response.\\n\\nI've been evaluating the newest $1,050 HP Spectre x360, a 13-inch convertible that is one of dozens of Windows laptops – along with two Chromebooks – from PC suppliers like HP, Dell, Lenovo, Acer, Asus and Samsung that are inspired by the coming-out party for Project Athena, Intel's multi-year campaign to persuade you to leave your tablet behind.\\n\\nPowerful or perky?\\n\\nPCs have always been more capable than tablets for demanding jobs, like editing video, creating presentations and crunching numbers. But like a powerlifter squatting into position just to snatch 5-pound dumbbells, PCs' approach to tackling performance-heavy tasks can make them seem downright unresponsive for quick, simple stuff like waking up or booting Candy Crush.\\n\\nVery personal tech:Meet the woman responsible for the return of sex toys at CES\\n\\nCES flashback:If LG's rollable OLED TV sounds familiar, there's a reason\\n\\nPC makers hope to fix all that with Project Athena. For this first year, Intel says it is verifying Project Athena-level capability with three metrics designed to approximate real-world use. They are:\\n\\nFast wake-up: Resume operation within three seconds (four seconds with fingerprint or facial recognition) of opening the lid, hitting the enter key or tapping the touchpad at least 80% of the time.\\n\\nResume operation within three seconds (four seconds with fingerprint or facial recognition) of opening the lid, hitting the enter key or tapping the touchpad at least 80% of the time. Fast response time: Quick action from a bunch of different applications and websites, like opening a file in PowerPoint or loading a Netflix video in Chrome, all while on battery power and with multiple apps running in the background.\\n\\nQuick action from a bunch of different applications and websites, like opening a file in PowerPoint or loading a Netflix video in Chrome, all while on battery power and with multiple apps running in the background. Battery life: At least nine hours of active time, with multiple windows open, including the browser with multiple tabs – and with the display bright enough to actually use.\\n\\nRefreshing change\\n\\nAs with EPA fuel-efficiency estimates, your actual mileage may vary. But as anyone who's bought a laptop boasting 17 hours of performance only to find it won't even power through a cross-country flight knows firsthand, today's benchmarks have drifted so far from real-world performance that they're practically useless. So credit the industry for trying to set things right.\\n\\nIn my experience with the Spectre, the quick response times were largely as advertised. I didn't actually keep track of how often apps and websites loaded quickly, but 80% of the time feels about right. For wake-up times, it seemed like the rapid-to-slow ratio was even higher. Invariably, though, the laptop occasionally would hang for some unexplained reason. Technology, right?\\n\\nWindows Hello identified me reliably and quickly – even with the fingerprint reader, which I seldom see. The laptop also has built-in Wi-Fi 6, as is called for in the Project Athena specification. And if you're lucky enough to connect to a Wi-Fi 6 router, as I have, you're in for a real treat.\\n\\nThe display is one of the laptop's most power-hungry components, which is why power-saving modes historically have dimmed the screen to the point it's barely readable. So I was impressed the spec is set to 250 nits, which is roughly 70% or 80% brightness on the Spectre. That was plenty bright for me just about everywhere but outside in the Arizona sun.\\n\\nAll-day performance?\\n\\nEven so, battery life was the one area that's fallen short of the spec in my testing. It's been good – and noticeably better than my go-to laptop – but lower than the purported nine hours.\\n\\nI've been getting seven-and-a-half to eight hours of activity between charges. That was enough to get me into my hotel room in Manhattan after working on the flight from Phoenix, as well as in the back of Ubers on each end of the trip.\\n\\nIn fairness, I loaded more applications than PC makers have optimized for with the first-year spec, like Quicken, NordVPN and PhotoShop. Most likely, though, the biggest culprits were cloud services like Adobe's Document Cloud and Synology's Cloud Station. I'd be surprised if cloud services aren't a prime target for improvement in the second-year spec.\\n\\nSo, yes, it's still true that when it comes to battery life, your actual mileage still may vary. But eight hours instead of the nine claimed is much more meaningful and, given the services I added, far more explainable than existing benchmarks. Regardless, it seems, we're in for a slew of zippy, responsive and power-sipping new laptops that make a better case for losing the tablet than we've ever seen.\\n\\nUSA TODAY columnist Mike Feibus is president and principal analyst of FeibusTech, a Scottsdale, Arizona, market research and consulting firm, and producer of the Privacy Now interview series on YouTube.

After about a 30-minute practice, the players held their open media session, ate a team-provided meal in the locker room and then took afternoon naps at a nearby hotel.\\n\\nThat routine wore on the players, who still live on Long Island. They asked to move the game-day practices to their facility in Syosset, where they work out other days.\\n\\nWe're just trying to get a sense of it all, Islanders captain John Tavares. There's the ups and downs of the season. Just because you go Brooklyn twice on the train in the morning (in the preseason) and stay in a hotel and it feels great, now in January it may not feel that way. We're just trying different things. I don't think it's anything to read too much into.\\n\\nSpending the day in Brooklyn meant players would leave home in the morning and wouldn't return until close to midnight. Now, they'll take the Long Island Rail Road into Brooklyn in the afternoon for night games.\\n\\nJust long days, forward Anders Lee said. Being out all day, I think it got a little long. This way we're home — can eat around (there) and go in a little bit later for the game.\\n\\nIslanders coach Jack Capuano said the change in the routine — with started Thursday — was not necessarily permanent, and it could return to spending the day in Brooklyn.\\n\\nWe're going to give this a try and see how it goes, Capuano said.

The Marvin-led Men might win a Super Bowl next year, and never stop. Someday, Mike Brown might even drive his sensible, American-made sedan to his own Hall of Fame induction. Marvin riding shotgun.\\n\\nIt's possible. Since I can't predict the future – if I could, I'd be in Vegas, cherry-picking champions and making tall piles of cash – I can respond only to what my gut is telling me.\\n\\nThis is a mistake.\\n\\nMore:Marvin Lewis returns as Cincinnati Bengals' head coach through 2019\\n\\nMore:Social media reactions to Marvin Lewis' return to Bengals\\n\\nMore:Cincinnati Bengals defensive coordinator Paul Guenther will explore options in 2018\\n\\nMore:Buffalo Bills fans overwhelm Andy Dalton's foundation with donations after Bengals' victory\\n\\nSomeone should ask this of Brown on Wednesday:\\n\\nAre you in business to win a championship?\\n\\nHe will say yes.\\n\\nCould you explain how that might occur while doing business as usual?\\n\\nThat's the only answer required.\\n\\nDon't sweat the details. Don't ferret out what power Lewis has today that he didn't have yesterday. Don't even worry about what's gonna be different this time around, for the big ML 3.0 launch.\\n\\nAre you in business to win a championship?\\n\\nIf you are, explain why you believe this coach is the coach to get you there. Because he's had 15 cracks at it, and he hasn't come close.\\n\\nI don't doubt that ownership wants to win a championship. Everyone wants things. I want to move to a tropical island paradise and aim 40-yard wedges at rows of Moscow Mule mugs. But I don't need to. It doesn't drive me.\\n\\nIs this your passion, BrownTrust? The way it's the passion of Bob Kraft and Jerry Jones and Arthur Blank, the Rooneys and others for whom finishing first is all that matters?\\n\\nAre you in business to win a championship?\\n\\nThe accolades afforded Lewis have been generous in This Space recently. No need to repeat them. He moved a mountain, he's wonderful for the community. He has been the Cincinnati Bengals' shining star. He hasn't won a Super Bowl, or come close.\\n\\nOn Monday, he put Brown on trial. Lewis issued ultimatums: Staying on the same page is important. If his direction is different than my direction, it's probably not good.\\n\\nHe gave short-shrift to fans who have suffered like Job: If you're a real fan, stay the course.\\n\\nHe said without going full in-your-face: I am the man here, and if you want me to stay, you better change your game.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, I asked two prominent local CEOs how they might react if one of their managers had gone public with a similar barrage. Both said without hesitation, paraphrasing, If I had a manager talk to me like that, he wouldn't be here.\\n\\nCoat, hat, door.\\n\\nNot two-year contract. For a coach who hasn't won a playoff game. Whose team won 13 games in the past two seasons, same as the Steelers won this season.\\n\\nAnywhere else, this is outrageous. Here, it's business as usual. By the way: Now that you've gone this route, please give Marvin every key and stop pretending you're football people who know how to win the Super Bowl.\\n\\nMeantime, Bengals fans walk the line between noble and foolish. This year, that started to change. The Anthem Crisis contributed, the concussion crisis contributed, the notion that at times the NFL is 10 pounds of hype in a 5-pound bag contributed. But around here, it was also that fans finally had quit the Bengals. Real fans.\\n\\nIn their 50th anniversary season, the Bengals actually marketed their product actively. It resulted in no sellouts and the 3rd-worst attendance in the league, ahead of only the vagabond Los Angeles Chargers and the bad-as-possible Browns. Ten-thousand short of capacity v. Pittsburgh, on a Monday night? Those numbers aren't actual bodies in seats; they're tickets distributed.\\n\\nAs many real fans cried as rejoiced Sunday night, when Andy Dalton completed that improbable comeback with a 49-yard TD pass to Tyler Boyd on 4th-and-12. That was a great play. And straight-up fortuitous. A team will make a play like that a few times a year. It shouldn't be seen as a sign of anything.\\n\\nWhat has ownership seen from this team the past two years that would suggest Super Bowl? At this point in the Marvin conversation, if we're not talking Super Bowl, why are we talking?\\n\\nBob Knight said this to me once: You rarely get what you want in life, and you don't often get what you expect. You get what you're willing to put up with.\\n\\nThe Bengals will hold a press conference Wednesday. There will be this question and it is the only question necessary:\\n\\nAre you in business to win a championship?\\n\\nWe await the answer."}

{"original": "WASHINGTON – Defying his boss, Vice President Mike Pence said Wednesday that only lawmakers can decide whether to accept or reject the Electoral College votes won by President-elect Joe Biden.\\n\\nPence's decision to abide by the rules as he presides over Congress' formal acceptance of the votes was a rare deviance from the staunch loyalty he's shown President Donald Trump over the past four years.\\n\\nAnd it earned him a quick rebuke.\\n\\nMike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, Trump tweeted.\\n\\nTrump has falsely asserted that Pence, in his constitutional role as president of the Senate, can change the votes.\\n\\nPence had to be rushed out of the Senate chamber by security during congressional debate over a GOP challenge to the results when dozens of Trump supporters breached security perimeters and stormed the Capitol. His wife and daughter, who had been watching the proceedings, were also removed from danger.\\n\\nSenate aides grabbed the boxes containing the electoral college certificates as lawmakers evacuated the chamber.\\n\\nTrump won that election! a protestor yelled from the Senate dais after lawmakers had left.\\n\\nIn a tweet, Pence urged protesters to immediately leave the building, saying those involved in the violence and destruction will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\\n\\nIn a lengthy statement issued before Congress began counting the votes, Pence said that he shares the concerns of millions of Americans about the integrity of this election. But, he continued, the oath he swore to uphold the Constitution prevents him from claiming unilateral authority to settle objections.\\n\\nToday I want to assure the American people that I will keep the oath I made to them and I will keep the oath I made to Almighty God, Pence wrote.\\n\\nHe arrived in the Senate shortly before 1 p.m. to lead lawmakers over to the House for a joint session of Congress to formally receive the state-certified results.\\n\\nPence fist-bumped Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who had tried to prevent senators from raising objections to the results.\\n\\nAfter some Republicans contested Arizona's electoral votes when Pence presented them to lawmakers, McConnell said democracy would enter a death spiral unless lawmakers rejected the challenge.\\n\\nPence voiced support for the objections. But he said he concluded, after a careful study of the Constitution, that he has no say in whether they should be accepted.\\n\\nWhen disputes concerning a presidential election arise, under Federal law, it is the people's representatives who review the evidence and resolve disputes through a democratic process, he wrote. As a student of history who loves the Constitution and reveres its Framers, I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress, and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority.\\n\\nShortly before Pence made his intentions public, Trump continued to exhort his vice president to come through for us by sending the electoral votes back to the states.\\n\\nSpeaking to supporters at a midday rally, Trump said he had just personally delivered that message to Pence.\\n\\nSen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., later told USA TODAY that he talked to Pence about Trump's rebuke.\\n\\nHe was very upset with him, Inhofe said of Pence.\\n\\nMore than one senator publicly praised Pence from the Senate floor.\\n\\nMr. Vice President, you have fulfilled your duties as president of the Senate tonight with distinction, said Sen.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nSome juicy rematches highlighted wild-card weekend, in which, well, just about any of the teams advancing wouldn't have been a surprise.\\n\\nSeattle beat Dallas early this season, and Baltimore handled the Los Angeles Chargers late. The Colts and Texans split two regular-season games. Only the Eagles and Bears didn't face off.\\n\\nThat was a different time of the season, says Seahawks defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr., who played for Dallas. I think we both were at different places in our growth for the season. I think we're both two different teams right now.\\n\\nThey're coming off of a win streak and the quarterback and the running back and the receiver and the whole offense is really clicking. It's really challenging for us to get this together, but it's going to be a really good game. They've been effective certainly on the run, they've been effective in the pocket and with his mobility. We have our work cut out for us.\\n\\nThey sure did, and the Cowboys (11-6) came out on top against the Seahawks (10-7) on Saturday night, with Ezekiel Elliott rushing for 137 yards and the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter as Dallas hung on for a 24-22 wild-card win. The loss ended a run of nine straight victories in playoff openers for the Seahawks.\\n\\nThe action began with the two AFC South teams meeting in Houston on Saturday, with the Colts (11-6) cruising to a 21-7 win over the Texans (11-6). Andrew Luck threw for 222 yards and two touchdowns in his hometown, and Marlon Mack ran for 148 yards and a touchdown for Indianapolis, which advanced to face the top-seeded Kansas City Chiefs in the divisional round next weekend.\\n\\nOn Sunday, the Chargers come across the country to Baltimore, then defending champion Philadelphia is at Chicago.\\n\\nAlso awaiting the results were NFC top seed New Orleans, plus No. 2s New England (AFC) and the Los Angeles Rams (NFC).\\n\\nLos Angeles Chargers (12-4) at Baltimore (10-6)\\n\\nTwo weeks ago, the visiting Ravens beat LA and moved atop the AFC North, which they then clinched last Sunday. Now comes a redux, and the Chargers will have top running back Melvin Gordon back, a real boost.\\n\\nThey will need a balanced offense, with Gordon's running complementing the passing of Philip Rivers, and a defense that can solve the speed and moves of Baltimore's Lamar Jackson. Since Jackson replaced an injured Joe Flacco at quarterback, the Ravens are 6-1. Jackson and fellow rookie Gus Edwards give them a formidable running game to go with the No. 1-ranked defense in yards.\\n\\nThey just never let you get comfortable as an offense, Rivers says. It's always something trying to keep you off-balance. It's going to be back and forth. There will be times where we pick everything up just right and do everything just right. There will be other times where we're going to have to, again, manage all those things that they do so well.\\n\\nPhiladelphia (9-7) at Chicago (12-4)\\n\\nThirty years ago, they played the Fog Bowl at the old Soldier Field. There isn't a whole lot of clarity about this matchup, either.\\n\\nThe Bears, paced by a strong version of the Monsters of the Midway, have been the better team all year. But they are generally playoff newbies, and they face perhaps the most resilient team in the league.\\n\\nPhilly has been ravaged by injuries, yet here it is, making big plays on both sides of the ball thanks greatly to the veterans who had such a big role in its roll to the title a year ago: Nick Foles, Zack Ertz, Lane Johnson, Fletcher Cox, Malcolm Jenkins. The Eagles still have to produce on the field, but their credentials are valid.\\n\\nI know how our team has really fought this last month of the season, last six weeks, coach Doug Pederson says. And it does give you a little comfort knowing that we've kind of went through this grind and we're here now and we have to continue to grind and continue to work.\\n\\nBut I don't think it's any easier. It's a different team again. Different set of circumstances. We have to travel. If we're fortunate to win, we have to be on the road again. It feels different, but the excitement is the same.\\n\\nThere's no shortage of excitement in Chicago, either. Under first-year coach Matt Nagy, the Bears have moved from last place in the usually difficult NFC North to the top.\\n\\nI would say last year when we were playing good football, even though we had struggles within the team and struggles would be, you know, everything else was going haywire around us, DT Akiem Hicks says, but we were able to pull together and keep fighting. And there was no quit, and you saw that this year when we got into last minutes of the game and still fighting and coming up with those wins. You could tell that guys have that fight in them.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nNFL teams ran the ball less than ever in 2016, yet six playoff teams had a 1,000-yard rusher.\\n\\nEzekiel Elliot (Cowboys), Jay Ajayi (Dolphins), Le'Veon Bell (Steelers), LeGarrette Blount (Patriots), Devonta Freeman (Falcons) and Lamar Miller (Texans) each topped 1,000 and will run again in January. Last year, Adrian Peterson was the only 1,000-yard rusher in the playoffs.\\n\\nI think really getting the running game going was crucial to us starting the ball rolling in the right direction, injured Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill said after the team bounced back from a 1-4 start to win six in a row.\\n\\nAjayi had three 200-yard games, including 204 in a win over Pittsburgh that started Miami's turnaround.\\n\\nI know that when I'm productive, the team is going to be successful, Ajayi said. But I feel that my play also allows a lot of guys to be able to make plays as well, and it's shown.\\n\\nThe formula for winning has changed drastically since the days teams relied on a smashmouth, ball-control running offense. It began with the evolution of the West Coast offense as the short-passing game replaced many runs plays.\\n\\nIt continued when more teams started incorporating spread offenses, using three and four wide receivers and putting quarterbacks in the shotgun formation for many snaps. Fullbacks lost their jobs and running backs became more specialized.\\n\\nThis season, teams averaged 26 rushing attempts per game. That's the fewest total in league history, according to Pro Football Reference. The average was 36.9 in 1976, 30.2 in 1986, 28.3 in 1996 and 28.2 in 2006.\\n\\nBut several successful teams had effective ground games led by a workhorse back.\\n\\nThe Patriots (14-2) ran the ball 99 more times this season than last. Blount's success helped 39-year-old Tom Brady post one of his best years. Blount ran for 1,161 yards and a league-best 18 TDs while Brady tossed 28 TDs and a career-low two interceptions after returning from his four-game suspension.\\n\\nLeGarrette's been very consistent for us, Patriots coach Bill Belichick said. He's been durable so he's there for us every week, gets a lot of tough yards. He's a big back but he's had some explosive plays as well. It's been good for us in really a lot of situations. He can run inside, he can run outside. He's athletic and he's got good quickness and agility for a 245-250 pound back, whatever he is.\\n\\nIn Dallas, Elliott's emergence took pressure off fellow rookie Dak Prescott. Elliott led the NFL with 1,631 yards rushing and the dynamic duo helped the Cowboys (13-3) finish with the No. 1 seed in the NFC.\\n\\nHe has gotten better and better every week, Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said of Elliott.\\n\\nThe Steelers, Falcons and Patriots had three of the best balanced offenses in the league. Each team had a 1,000-yard rusher and ranked in the top 5 in passing.\\n\\nBell ran for 1,268 yards and Ben Roethlisberger threw for 3,819 yards. Bell also caught 75 passes for 616 yards.\\n\\nI don't just want to be known as a running back, Bell said. I want to be a guy who's known in every situation, a playmaker who can catch the ball out of the backfield and make big plays, plays that can obviously change the game.\\n\\nFreeman had 1,079 yards rushing and Matt Ryan threw for 4,944 to lead Atlanta (11-5) to the No. 2 seed in the NFC.\\n\\nOf the six playoff teams with a 1,000-yard rusher, only the Texans ran the ball fewer times than last year but they gained more yards thanks to Miller. He had 1,073 yards.\\n\\nThe running game is very important in the playoffs, Houston coach Bill O'Brien said. It's important to be able to run the football, to be in manageable third downs, to control the tempo of the game.\\n\\nOakland (12-4) is another playoff team with a strong rushing offense that used three backs. Latavius Murray (788), Jalen Richard (491) and DeAndre Washington (467) helped the Raiders rank sixth in yards rushing.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Sports Writers Kyle Hightower, Will Graves and Kristie Rieken contributed to this report.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi"}
{"original": "The world's coral reefs are under siege from global warming, according to a new study published Thursday in the journal Science.\\n\\nWorldwide, the frequency of severe coral bleaching events has increased nearly fivefold in the past four decades, from once every 25 to 30 years in the early 1980s to once every six years in 2016, the study suggests.\\n\\nAlmost every coral reef on the planet has been affected by bleaching: Our results show that 94% of tropical reefs have already bleached severely, by an average of three times, since 1980, said study lead author Terry Hughes of the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. The remaining 6% has also bleached, but less severely so far.\\n\\nWarmer, more acidic ocean water is the cause of the bleaching, Pieter Tans, chief greenhouse gas scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said last year. The bleaching occurs when algae that live inside and nourish coral, which provides their brilliant colors, wither from the warming waters and die, leaving behind white coral skeletons.\\n\\nCoral bleaching is a stress response caused by exposure of coral reefs to elevated ocean temperatures, said study co-author Andrew Baird, also of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies. When bleaching is severe and prolonged, many of the corals die.\\n\\nHughes said that coral is the backbone of reefs as it provides an essential habitat for fish and many other species, adding that the decline of corals threatens the entire ecosystem.\\n\\nResearchers measured the rate of coral bleaching at locations throughout the tropics over the past four decades. They found a dramatic shortening of the gap between bleaching events, which not only harms the ecosystems but also livelihoods of many millions of people, the study said.\\n\\nIn fact, coral reefs are critically important to both societies and economies around the world. In Australia, for instance, the Great Barrier Reef alone supports a vibrant tourism industry that's worth about $5 billion per year, Hughes noted.\\n\\nBleaching events are increasingly taking place regardless of natural warmer or cooler cycles such as El Niño or La Niña. Before the 1980s, mass bleaching of corals was unheard of, even during strong El Niño conditions, but now repeated bouts of regional-scale bleaching and mass mortality of corals has become the new normal around the world as temperatures continue to rise, Hughes said.\\n\\nTropical sea temperatures are warmer today during cooler-than-average La Niña conditions than they were 40 years ago during El Niño periods.\\n\\nWhile the western Atlantic began to warm and experience bleaching more frequently than other regions at first, the risk of bleaching events has increased most strongly over time in Australasia and in the Middle East, the study said.\\n\\nIt's not too late to protect corals from severe climate change, the study authors said, if the emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide can be curtailed.\\n\\nThe future condition of reefs, and the ecosystem services they provide to people, will depend critically on the trajectory of global emissions, the study concludes."}

Every day, the talented men and women of NASA must think on a cosmic level because it's not just about space exploration and research. Sometimes it's about planetary safety, such as their plan to destroy Earth-ending asteroids. Tap or click here to read about NASA's innovative plan.\\n\\nOther work involves preventing cyberattacks on Earth or the International Space Station. Like corporations or government agencies, NASA has to protect itself from the most sophisticated hackers.\\n\\nBut it begs the question: Do tens of thousands of NASA employees and contractors know how to protect their personal devices at home?\\n\\nOne vulnerable moment on a private server could lead to astronomical problems. So how do NASA employees defend their personal computers and myriad of devices? It starts by practicing good habits online.\\n\\nI recently had the distinct pleasure of giving a keynote speech at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland for National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. I discussed essential safety procedures everyone needs to know these days.\\n\\nI covered three major topics during the event and, while each is important, luckily it's not rocket science. You need to adhere to all three in 2020.\\n\\n1. Your first line of defense\\n\\nI get it. No one spends much time thinking about their router. You just want it to work. But for meaningful cybersecurity, your router is your first line of defense for keeping criminals out of your network.\\n\\nHackers could have compromised your router already and have complete access to your data, files, and network.\\n\\nRight out of the box, your router comes with a default username and password. Since these credentials are available on the internet, amateur hackers know how to break in and do all kinds of damage. So, the first order of business is to log into your router's administration console and get that generic password changed.\\n\\nIf you don't know your router's password, tap or click here to learn how to find it and change it.\\n\\nNext, update your router's firmware to the latest version. The exact steps depend on your router brand and model, but all the modern options have an administrator page you can access via browser.\\n\\nAll you have to do is type the default IP address of your particular router on your browser address bar, and that will take you directly to that page. Tap or click here for detailed steps on updating your router's firmware.\\n\\nOnce the credentials have been changed and the system is up to date, it's time to adjust a few settings. If you've been using the same router for years and all you see in your security options is WPA or WEP, trust me, it's time to go shopping for a new one.\\n\\nLook for WPA2 or the latest standard, WPA3, and make sure your new router has a firewall, which comes built-in on just about every newer model. While you're at it, there's even more you can do. Tap or click here for 5 security settings to turn on before it's too late.\\n\\n2. Don't leave home without it\\n\\nEvery time NASA provides a laptop for working remotely, the employee is required to use a VPN. That's precisely why they were created in the first place – to securely connect business networks through the internet to allow secure access from home.\\n\\nA virtual private network, or VPN, is a layer of protection between your devices and the internet. It hides your IP or MAC address along with your location and encrypts the data that travels from your device to websites you visit.\\n\\nGet Kim's latest tips and trusted advice with the free Komando.com App.\\n\\nMost importantly, when you're using public Wi-Fi and not a trusted network, a VPN provides a critical layer of security. They're inexpensive and easy to procure.\\n\\nIf you're on an unsecured network like the one you might find at a coffee shop, airport, library, or other public places, you send queries through cyberspace, and they route through private networks to other computers or servers, exposing you to skilled hackers.\\n\\nIf you want a more in-depth look at VPNs, tap or click for a complete guide to choosing and setting up your own VPN.\\n\\n3. Beware the inbox\\n\\nPhishing attacks are no joke. Scam attempts that come into your email, social media accounts and text messages can be persuasive at first, until you take a closer look.\\n\\nPhishing scams have become more sophisticated in recent years. Instead of the long-lost uncle leaving you a $10 million inheritance, scammers pose as real businesses or government agencies.\\n\\nYou might get an email that looks like it's from Netflix, saying your account has been compromised, and you need to reset your password. If you click the link from your email, you'll be taken to a website that probably looks like the real thing.\\n\\nThe next type of scam is called spear phishing, and it's a little more personal: Realistic-looking emails from real companies or agencies might include your name, phone number, and even your job title or home address. This information could be culled from social media, or maybe it originated from a data broker.\\n\\nPhishing attacks could include malicious links or even attachments that can infect your system with malware. That way, they can access what's on that device or worse: infect your entire network and potentially any other device on it.\\n\\nSo don't wait. If these techniques are good enough for NASA, they'll definitely work for you.\\n\\nIf you use wireless internet at home, you probably have several devices connected to your network. It's so easy to keep piling on additional devices, too: your new laptop, another video game console, a new tablet or even your friend's phone.\\n\\nYou may even begin to lose track of everything that's connected, or worse, notice things that don't belong. There may even be users who have tried to connect to your Wi-Fi network without your permission or knowledge.\\n\\nThis is bad news for a few reasons. Someone could be stealing your network bandwidth – or your personal information. Luckily, there are simple ways to determine which devices are connected to your network, and you can prune what should and shouldn't be there.\\n\\nTap or click here to take a closer look at who's using your connection.\\n\\nLearn about all the latest technology on the Kim Komando Show, the nation's largest weekend radio talk show.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nSANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has a torn ligament in the thumb on his throwing hand and surgery has been recommended. That could happen as soon as this week once he receives a second opinion on the injury.\\n\\nHe also will have his surgically repaired left shoulder checked during a visit to the Steadman Clinic in Vail, Colorado. Kaepernick, who was demoted in November after his struggles, said continued pain in the thumb caused concern but he didn't know the extent of the injury until undergoing an MRI exam last week. He will travel Tuesday to Colorado.\\n\\nKaepernick said he injured the thumb in a home loss to Seattle on Oct. 22.\\n\\nIt's been recommended surgery and get confirmation on whether I'll need surgery or not, he said. We'll get it fixed as soon as possible. They haven't given me specific dates as far as how long it will be.\\n\\nHe underwent surgery on the left shoulder in late November to repair a torn labrum.\\n\\nHe's got several things that he's working through, general manager Trent Baalke said. We'll get a better grasp on how the rehabs are going in the different things and get him ready for the offseason program, that's the goal.\\n\\nIn terms of his future with the 49ers, who fired first-year coach Jim Tomsula after Sunday's season-ending overtime win against St. Louis, Kaepernick says, I'm under contract, I'm a 49er.\\n\\nHe did not elaborate on whether that means he wants to return amid speculation the team will try to trade him or cut him.\\n\\nThe 28-year-old Kaepernick's $11.9 million 2016 contract would become fully guaranteed for injury if he's still on the roster on April 1, to which Baalke said, I'm not worried about April 1, I'm more worried about getting him healthy and getting him ready for the offseason program.\\n\\nThat's Kaepernick's focus, too.\\n\\nFor me, that's not a date I'm concerned with, Kaepernick said. I feel like I'm going to be playing football regardless of April 1, April 2. I'm doing everything I can to be healthy as soon as I can, Kaepernick said. Once again, I'm preparing to be healthy and win the Super Bowl. That's all my focus is.\\n\\nThe franchise drafted him in the second round out of Nevada in 2011 and he took over the starting job from Alex Smith in November 2012. Kaepernick immediately showed the dynamic player he could be with his strong arm and quick legs — including a quarterback-record 181 yards rushing in a playoff win against Green Bay on the way to the Super Bowl.\\n\\nBut Kaepernick is coming off a forgettable 2015 season.\\n\\nBlaine Gabbert took over the starting QB job Nov. 8 for the final eight games and has no plans to relinquish the job.\\n\\nI'm going to compete. That's in my blood, that's who I am as a person: 'I'm going to be the starting quarterback, I'm going to be a starting quarterback,' and that's the way I'm approaching this offseason, Gabbert said Sunday night. Regardless of what happens, that's my mindset moving forward and I'm going to take this team and run with it.\\n\\nInitially when making the quarterback change, Tomsula said he wanted Kaepernick to step back and breathe and look at things through a different lens.\\n\\nTo that, Kaepernick said, I'm not out of breath, so I don't understand that reference.\\n\\nThe next head coach is going to have a lot of say in what we do at that position, Baalke said.\\n\\nIn eight starts and nine games this season, Kaepernick passed for 1,615 yards and six touchdowns with five interceptions — a career-high four of those came with two pick-6s in a 47-7 Week 3 loss at Arizona. He was sacked 28 times.\\n\\nI'm confident in the players in this locker room, I'm confident that we have the players here to succeed, Kaepernick said. We're doing everything we can to do our part to make sure we have a winning team.\\n\\nDuring his time recovering from surgery, Kaepernick said he has worked on bettering himself as a person.\\n\\nI continue to get stronger, continue to be a better man and be a better man for the people around me, he said.\\n\\nWhether or not he is in his No. 7 Niners uniform come the 2016 season, Kaepernick has one idea for what it takes to be a head coach.\\n\\nWinning, he said, ultimately that's what makes a good head coach. You have to be able to lead 53 players into a game and have them win.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

{"original": "When I started covering technology at USA TODAY two decades ago, I didn't own a cellphone, nor did my company deem it in its interests to buy me one.\\n\\nMy tenure predates text messages, soundbars, talking speakers, QR codes, video chat, Uber, DoorDash, Zoom calls, YouTube, Wi-Fi, affordable flat-screen TVs … you get the idea.\\n\\nSo many changes in such a short period of time! This is my last column for USA TODAY as your Talking Tech columnist. Let's say goodbye by celebrating how far we've come through the years.\\n\\nMy stint started in 2000 – I began at USA TODAY earlier, covering entertainment – when we spent a lot of time talking about the big three tech companies: AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft. AOL had just shocked the world by buying Time Warner for $165 billion. (You know how well that turned out. But I digress.)\\n\\nWe did use computers, yes indeed, mostly desktops, and they were Windows machines with black-and-white monitors. We weren't online; we went online, with a phone line attached to our computers. You know, the type we used on our landlines. Remember them?\\n\\nApple back then had less than 3% market share. It didn't start its evolution into the world's most valuable $2 trillion company until 2001, when it introduced the iPod MP3 music player and helped bring digital music to the masses. This is after the short-lived Napster popularized MP3s by showing how easy it was to copy licensed music. In 2003, the iPod shifted into a mainstream product when CEO Steve Jobs (who rejoined the company in 1997) opened it up to be used on Windows computers with the iTunes music store, the first easy-to-use, legitimate avenue for buying music, back then at 99 cents a song. Streaming and the celestial jukebox was a far-off dream.\\n\\nWe started Talking Tech in 2006 as a weekly, ahead-of-its-time video series, produced bicoastally on two webcams. The first episode – with my former partner, Edward C. Baig – was a review of the Flip Video camera. Remember that one, kids?\\n\\nBy 2010, Flip was soon to be gone, as Apple introduced the iPhone 4, the first iPhone with a decent camera. Kodak became a memory. Canon, Nikon, Olympus and other mainstays of the camera business saw their sales tumble as people preferred the camera that was in their pocket, their phone.\\n\\nI have to admit, I never foresaw just how great the smartphone cams would become. I always loved using them, but there was a stigma to cellphone video. Now we can shoot 4K video that looks nearly as good as what you get from a traditional camera, mostly because of computational photography tricks. But I'm not complaining. Have you seen my iPhone sunsets?\\n\\nThen there's Google and Facebook.\\n\\nMore:Why Amazon, Apple, Peloton and Zoom won 2020, while Quibi lost big\\n\\nTech we lost in 2020: Farmville, Flash and Segway top list\\n\\nIt was in 2000 that Yahoo handed over its search keys to a scrappy startup that said it had a method for more effective online searches. From there, we got Google stepping out onto its own in 2003 by sending people to its website and popularizing the phrase Google it. We got Google Maps (remember life without it?), Gmail (free email without being tied to our internet provider), Google Translate, Google Photos and so many other features that I don't think we could live without today.\\n\\nThat's the good side.\\n\\nThere's also Google tracking our every move to put personalized ads in front of us everywhere we go and saying goodbye to our privacy. Google will claim that much of the privacy invasion is opt-in and that we agreed to it when we signed up for services. But who remembers doing that?\\n\\nFacebook took the snooping to an even greater level. But today's column is about celebrating tech. Let's bypass the misinformation and online rage that erupted from the social network and instead give props to a site that reconnected about 2 billion people with old friends and family. I announced my pending exit on my newsletter, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and Facebook. You know where I got the most responses? Facebook, hands down.\\n\\nAmazon. Who believed you could order anything you ever wanted with one click and have it arrive the next day? By 2001, Amazon had announced its first profit. More recently, we saw Amazon acquire Whole Foods and launch Amazon Fresh, the supermarket with a radical cart that automatically tallies up your purchases. Amazon kicked off the smart speaker craze with Echo and Alexa and became a dominant force in streaming with Fire TV.\\n\\nBut Amazon missed out on phones. Google got in early, in 2008, with the Android operating system, which it grew by giving it away for free to companies such as Samsung, LG and Huawei. That business model enabled Android to claim a whopping 85% market share, where it's featured on so many low-cost phones.\\n\\nIf I had to pick the most influential tech device of my generation, there's no hesitation. It's the iPhone, hands down, even bigger than the VCR or the personal computer.\\n\\nThe iPhone (and other smartphone brands to follow) put the computer into our pockets, untethered and presented in an easy, intuitive way that appealed to the masses. Listen to music, answer the phone, watch TV, surf the net, all on one device. We can also monitor our daily steps, navigate and take amazing photos. (Again, those sunsets!)\\n\\nI love my laptop, but it didn't change my life.\\n\\nWhat of the future?\\n\\nIn 2016, I did a column quoting analysts saying the smartphone, as we know it, would cease and morph into some form of eyewear within the next few years. I didn't believe it then, I don't believe it now.\\n\\nHaving stuff flying in front of your eyes as you walk down the street is a distraction. (Take that, Google Glass.) We watched screens in the 1950s. We're going to be looking at screens in the 2020s and 2030s.\\n\\nSome final thoughts\\n\\nI never considered what I do as a job. You meet interesting people, talk to them about what they do and tell others about it. How is that work?\\n\\nJournalism is in a tough place, but if you can swing it, I can think of no better profession. Over the years, I got to meet nearly every person I'd ever want to meet, from Apple's Steve Jobs, Microsoft's Bill Gates, Google's Sergey Brin and Larry Page to showbiz icons (see my 2011-2015 celebrity edition of Talking Tech) such as Jimmy Kimmel, Zendaya and Ariana Grande. I got to jam musically (career highlight!) with James Taylor, Jason Mraz and Kermit, the Frog. I got to be a living witness to history and opine about it.\\n\\nI only have enough space here to cover my tech years. I have a prior life covering TV and stories about pumpkin pancakes with a young comedian named Jerry Seinfeld, playing Ms. Pac-Man with Sammy Davis Jr., visiting the sets of so many of your favorite TV shows of yesteryear, from Cheers to Coach. If you'd like to go down that memory lane with me, please subscribe to my Substack newsletter, where I will have a post for you on Monday all about that era.\\n\\nGrowing up, at various times, my ambition was to be a producer, director, actor, writer, radio host and guitar player. If you've seen any of my Talking Tech videos, you know I hit all the goals right here at USA TODAY!\\n\\nBig thanks to my first editor Ben Brown for hiring me, initial tech editor Bruce Schwartz for bringing me on board, editor Nancy Blair and colleague Ed Baig for riding the iPhone era with me and current editor Michelle Maltais for encouraging me to find the small print the tech companies hide and scream about it to the world. That was fun!\\n\\nThanks to USA TODAY for an amazing 36-year career and sending me to so many places over these decades: Would you believe 20 states and several visits to Canada?\\n\\nMy favorite: How do you top Austin, Texas, and South by Southwest, with its vibrant night scene and those amazing breakfast tacos at Torchy's? Or covering the solar eclipse in 2017 in Salem, Oregon, which I livestreamed and time-lapsed at the same time?\\n\\nSpeaking of photography and what's next, my 10-year Act III plan is to visit and Photowalk all the great spots, from Albuquerque to Abilene, Moab to Zurich. Post-pandemic, it's a great world out there just waiting to be documented.\\n\\nI'll be changing my name from Jefferson Graham, USA TODAY to just Jeff, and that will be a big adjustment. As will not having my direct connection to you. Let's stay in touch online. Remember, that's @jeffersongraham on Twitter.\\n\\nP.S.: One more thing\\n\\nMonday, after seven years and 2,500-plus episodes, the Talking Tech podcast will have two new hosts, Mike Snider and Brett Molina. Please say hi to them and offer them a hearty greeting. They're great and will do a fantastic job."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — The choice was clear for Clemson coach Dabo Swinney last September— freshman quarterback Trevor Lawrence deserved to start over well-liked, well-respected senior Kelly Bryant.\\n\\nIt's a move that could've led to dissension, in-fighting and a divided locker room. Instead, the switch started the second-ranked Tigers on a glide path to the national championship game where they'll take on defending champion Alabama on Monday night.\\n\\nIt's just a situation where (Lawrence) has been in the game, he has been productive and to be fair to competition, just like we do at every position, coach (Swinney) decided to name him the starter, Clemson co-offensive coordinator Tony Elliott said.\\n\\nSwinney insists, that despite Lawrence's talent, the swap wasn't made with Alabama in mind.\\n\\nYou've got to prove that you deserve to be the starter this year, he said Saturday. That's just the culture we have.\\n\\nLawrence's play has borne that out .\\n\\nHe's thrown for 2,933 yards with 27 touchdowns with just four interceptions. Clemson has averaged more than 45 points and 540 yards a game since Lawrence took over against Syracuse in game five.\\n\\nSwinney said Lawrence never acted like he didn't belong, showing a mix of confidence, poise and ability that stood out. Swinney realized that last spring when he saw how quickly (Lawrence) processed things, how easy it was for him, the coach said.\\n\\nThe hard part for Swinney came in September when he elevated Lawrence to starter over Bryant.\\n\\nThe quarterback selection was a choice looming since the 6-foot-6, strong-armed, long-haired Lawrence arrived on campus. Two experienced reserve passers in Zerrick Cooper and Tucker Israel transferred in January. Another five-star quarterback in Hunter Johnson left in May for Northwestern after going through spring ball.\\n\\nBryant, who went 16-2 as a starter, led Clemson to the Atlantic Coast Conference title and the College Football Playoff a season ago. But he struggled in the Tigers' passing game and a poor showing in the 24-6 loss to Alabama in the Sugar Bowl last year left the door wide open for speculators to pencil in Lawrence ahead of the popular Bryant.\\n\\nBryant kept the job into the season and started Clemson's first four games until Swinney knew what he had to do.\\n\\nAt the end of the day, this is not middle school, Swinney said in September. There's tough decisions that have to be made at his level and you have to do what's best for the team.\\n\\nSome programs might not have moved forward unscathed after such a switch. Clemson All-American defensive tackle Christian Wilkins never had a doubt the Tigers would remain on track.\\n\\nI'm sure a lot of you all would've liked more controversy, Wilkins joked this week. That's more of a testament to our leadership. We've got a lot of older guys who've been around for a while, just experienced a lot and we weren't going to let that faze us.\\n\\nWilkins said they all still love and respect Bryant, who has transferred to Missouri, but we weren't going to let that stop us.\\n\\nWilkins, the 6-4, 315-pound senior, went a long way to calming any locker room concerns about the switch when he took Lawrence to breakfast the week of Bryant's demotion. Wilkins downplays the meeting — I was going to eat breakfast anyway, he said — but Lawrence believes it gave him instant credibility to lead a veteran-stocked club.\\n\\nIt meant a lot, Lawrence said.\\n\\nThings couldn't have started worse for Lawrence and the Tigers when the freshman left with an injury before halftime of his first college start against Syracuse on Sept. 29 and the Tigers trailed 23-13 with less than 13 minutes left. But Clemson rallied with one-time sixth-string passer Chase Brice in the game and tailback Travis Etienne rushing for two TDs down the stretch of the 27-23 win.\\n\\nLawrence threw two touchdown passes in his next start, a 63-3 win at Wake Forest, and has not slowed down since.\\n\\nSwinney is pleased with Lawrence's progress, but still hurts when thinking about the quarterback change. Bryant gave his all to the Tigers during his time there, Swinney said, but this was simply a football decision.\\n\\nI'm not going to apologize for doing my job, Swinney said.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/collegefootball and http://www.twitter.com/AP_Top25"}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nCLEVELAND (AP) — The worst season in Browns' history, sometimes laughable, often painful, and totally deplorable, ended without any significant changes.\\n\\nIn Cleveland, that qualifies as change.\\n\\nOwners Dee and Jimmy Haslam, whose four-years-plus tenure has been overloaded with losing and turnover, vowed to keep things intact at the beginning of the season. They kept their word as Sunday's finale in Pittsburgh was followed by calm and commitment.\\n\\nAlthough the Browns went 1-15 and slid even deeper into the NFL's abyss, coach Hue Jackson hung on to his job. A revamped analytic-focused front office led by vice president Sashi Brown and strategy director Paul DePodesta went as far on Monday as to claim the team made progress in 2016.\\n\\nThere's a belief in the building we're heading in the right direction, so that's extremely important and a cornerstone of the foundation we needed to lay this year, Brown said.\\n\\nBaby steps at best.\\n\\nThe Browns did show some improvement in the final weeks, and never stopped fighting, a credit to Jackson and his staff. But that didn't come close to washing away the ugliness of 14 straight losses, the 31st-ranked scoring offense, 30th-ranked scoring defense, giving up a team record 66 sacks and 35 touchdown passes.\\n\\nIncredibly, Cleveland has sustained 14 double-digit loss seasons and is 88-200 since its 1999 expansion rebirth.\\n\\nBut after choosing not to re-sign any of their own free agents, purging the roster and filling it with rookies, the Browns are expected to take a different approach this offseason in a rebuilding project with no known completion date.\\n\\nAs always, much of the focus will be on finding a franchise quarterback. With the No. 1 overall pick in the draft, the Browns, who made a short-term investment in Robert Griffin III , will have an opportunity to land a player that has almost taken on mythical proportions. Cleveland has gone through 26 starters in 18 years and will continue to sputter and spin without an offensive leader.\\n\\nPro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas senses that the turnaround, albeit a slow one, is under way.\\n\\nWe've got the right head coach in place and we've got the right management team and we have a lot of young guys that are only going to improve, he said. You put all those things together and I think there's a good sense of excitement around the building.\\n\\nThings are definitely looking up for the Cleveland Browns.\\n\\nFrom the bottom, that's the only view.\\n\\nHere are a few more things to consider as the Browns enter perhaps the most significant offseason in the club's 67 years:\\n\\nRG3 AND OUT?: Griffin feels he proved his critics wrong by making five starts, including four in a row to end the season after he recovered from a broken non-throwing shoulder. While he showed some flashes of the old RG3, the Browns have to decide if he's worth keeping around. Jackson gave him a luke-warm review on Monday, saying he wanted to look at more film before making an evaluation.\\n\\nGriffin and 37-year-old veteran Josh McCown are due $750,000 bonuses if they're on the roster March 11. Rookie Cody Kessler did some good things when he was forced into the lineup, but he projects as a No. 2 QB.\\n\\nALL FOR ONE: The Browns will have the pick of the litter in the NFL draft and they really can't go wrong. Well, they are the Browns, so of course they could.\\n\\nAt this point, Texas A&M defensive end Myles Garrett is widely regarded as the can't-miss top pick, but that could change several times in the months ahead. Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen will also be in the mix for No. 1.\\n\\nCleveland also has the Nos. 12 and 33 picks, and could use one of them on a quarterback such as North Carolina's Mitch Trubisky or Notre Dame's DeShone Kizer.\\n\\nPRYOR COMMITMENT: Terrelle Pryor's transition from quarterback to 1,000-yard wide receiver was one of the league's best stories this season. An unrestricted free agent, Pryor wants to return and the Browns would like to have him back — at the right price. Pryor has told agents Drew and Jason Rosenhaus to get a deal done with Cleveland.\\n\\nBrown said signing Pryor and linebacker Jamie Collins, who played well after coming over in a midseason trade, are priorities. The team does not intend to use franchise tags on either.\\n\\nSTAFF SHAKEUP: While Jackson survived a 1-15 season, some of his assistants may not.\\n\\nHe plans to evaluate his staff and did not rule out making changes. A possible alteration could come on defense as the Browns struggled under coordinator Ray Horton, who is in his second stint with the team.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Sticky fingers and 15 points from Makuach Maluach off the bench helped New Mexico cruise to an easy 80-47 victory Saturday over San José State.\\n\\nThe Lobos (7-20, 2-2 Mountain West) pilfered 12 steals - part of the 20 forced turnovers -- turning those into 28 points off of the miscues.\\n\\nIn addition to the 28-1 advantage off on turnovers, New Mexico had a 20-0 bulge on fast break points.\\n\\nWe didn't feel like we necessarily like we had to do anything extra to create turnovers, Lobos coach Paul Weir said. We felt that we could just kind of get them.\\n\\nThe Spartans knew New Mexico would be pressuring the ball and simply did not react well to that pressure, San José State coach Jean Prioleau said.\\n\\nWe knew that they were going to put us in a situation where you have to make plays off the dribble because they switch everything and deny, he said. So you have to be ready to make plays off the dribble.\\n\\nBut the Spartans never quite seemed able to do that as New Mexico never trailed and quickly built its lead to double figures at 18-6 following a 3-pointer Maluach midway through the first half.\\n\\nA late first-half run pushed the lead to 39-23 at the break and the game was never close from there.\\n\\nRyan Welage had 17 points for San José State (3-12, 0-4), but the Lobos countered with 12 each from Chris McNeal and Anthony Mathis, while Antino Jackson dished out seven assists.\\n\\nWe weren't able to guard them man to man, Prioleau. We wanted to be able to switch it up a little bit. Go zone, go man, go zone, go man, try and change the game up. It worked in the first half. It didn't work in the second half.\\n\\nBIG PICTURE\\n\\nNew Mexico's win, after dropping two road games to frontrunners Boise State and Nevada, leaves it in the middle of the pack of the conference standings, but the Lobos remain undefeated at home in conference play. The key for New Mexico, however, is trying to win outside of the state as it has not won away from Albuquerque this season.\\n\\nThe Spartans continue to look for their first conference win and is the first MWC team to reach four conference losses.\\n\\nROSTER ISSUES\\n\\nNew Mexico starting guard Troy Simons was out of the game on a Mountain West-issued suspension after he was ejected for the second time this season for accruing double technicals in a game.\\n\\nAfter injuring himself in practice earlier in the week, Lobos top scorer and rebounder Sam Logwood was on the bench with his left arm in a sling. Logwood's status going forward remains unclear, Weir said, but Simons' penalty was a one-game suspension, meaning he should be back for Wednesday's game against Wyoming.\\n\\nWith just eight scholarship players available, all the Lobos players had to be ready to attack the game, Weir said.\\n\\nThe work ethic and toughness they displayed, he said, responding to questions about what he considered to be the key to the game. All we talked about was toughness and just getting tougher and more physical and stop being soft. I think we've been soft here lately.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nNew Mexico is at home Wednesday against Wyoming.\\n\\nSan José State is at San Diego on Tuesday."}

{"original": "After the Miami Marlins were eliminated in the second round of the postseason by the Atlanta Braves, manager Don Mattingly watched a lot of playoff games in the following rounds.\\n\\nHe wasn't a fan of the current style of the game.\\n\\nQuite honestly, it was a little hard to watch, Mattingly said at the league's virtual winter meetings. There's just nothing going on. Innings go fast. Strikeout, strikeout, home run. It was hard to watch. It tells me that we have got to find a way to make our game move. I don't mean play faster games; I mean more action. I think that's the way that we can create a better game to watch.\\n\\nThere are a lot of baseball fans who probably agree with his sentiment. Batting averages and on-base percentages are down across the league. Strikeouts and home runs are up. One of the three true outcomes — a walk, homer or strikeout — occurred 36% of the time last season, according to ESPN, which is an all-time high.\\n\\nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred has emphasized measures to improve the pace-of-play in games — the average nine-inning game was 3:07 last year — and he told the Dan Patrick Show in October that restricting extreme defensive shifts was a hot topic with the league's competition committee.\\n\\nWe've got to continue to be progressive, Mattingly said. We have to continue to put a product out there that people want to see, that has action and it continues to hold our attention. Anything that we're doing as far as rules, I think we have to be open-minded. I watch it in the NFL, the rules change. You watch it in the NBA. The games are going to evolve. Obviously, you don't want to change the core of the game, but I think we have to be open-minded.\\n\\nStatcast defines a defensive shift when three or more infielders are on the same side of second base. Left-handed hitters were shifted in 50.8% of their plate appearances in 2020, a number that continues to rise each year. Lefties were shifted in 29.6% of their plate appearances in 2018.\\n\\nThere's a real squeeze going on, not just as a left-handed hitter, but I'll speak for left-handed hitters, at the plate, Joey Votto told MLB Network Radio on Sirius XM. The combination of a lot of defenders on the right side of the field and the way a hitter is being pitched now is basically all built into either strikeout or weak contact on the right side of the field. I fell victim to that. Even when I would pop a ball hard and hit it to the right-field grass, it was one-hop to the second baseman or a line drive to the shortstop or second baseman. I felt like no matter what I was doing it was an out.\\n\\nWith fewer hits through the right side of the infield, it's led to many left-handed hitters focusing on hitting homers to right field to combat defensive shifts. Votto noted how players like Bryce Harper, Cody Bellinger, Max Muncy and Anthony Rizzo can hit a ball with a 112-mph exit velocity and it's a routine out because of the second baseman in shallow right field.\\n\\nThat was a base hit automatic not three, four years ago, not even that long ago, Votto said. I would guess, of course, they're always trying to hit the ball hard, but I think we have a tendency — I can speak from my experience — to try to chase hitting the ball with some height. A ground ball off the bat, even top-spin hard line drives are bad right now. If they change the rules, fine. That means the left-handed hitters will be better equipped for the next era. I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a guy hit .370 or something crazy like that even with the strikeouts.\\n\\nThat's not to say restricting shifts in a universally popular idea. Cleveland manager Terry Francona thought it could have unintended consequences.\\n\\nIf you artificially put in rules like no shifting, players aren't going to try to hit the ball the other way. They don't have to because you can't shift. They're just going to reach back for more and everybody is going to pull the ball. I think the best way is when players make adjustments. One thing we need to do better as an industry is make people understand just how much we love our game and enjoy our game, and not just pick apart the things we don't like in our game. I don't think we always do that really well.\\n\\nThere are more radical changes being considered to invite more action into games, ranging from moving the mound backward, deadening the ball or shrinking the strike zone.\\n\\nWhat do I think about the game currently? I'm fond of it, Votto said. I'm fond of it because I think it's a better version of athletes than the ones when I came up. I'm not going to poo-poo on the generation before me. I feel really grateful to have come up after the steroid era. I got to bridge the last few players of the steroid era and then the kind of middle era where I felt like there was a lot of older guys kind of lingering, longer-tenured guys and now what I feel like is this newer generation where truly these are the best athletes I've ever seen in a Major League uniforms.\\n\\nI mean I watch Ronald Acuña, and he's probably one of the guys that I would watch the most. He's such a fabulous athlete to watch. And I don't know how many of those — if any of those — I got to see when I first came up. For me, if you stand next to these guys or you get to go to a ballpark and sit in a first section and really watch an Acuña fly around the bases or watch a (Mike) Trout at-bat, and then see them run on the field and see how big these men are and how young and healthy they are, it's really such a treat. I'm proud and honored to be on the field competing with these guys because there are just so many fantastic athletes right now, so I think the sport is in a great place."}
{"original": "Erin Kelly\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nWASHINGTON — Republicans pushed through a rule change Tuesday that would fine House members up to $2,500 for broadcasting from the House floor — an effort to prevent a repeat of Democrats' sit-ins against gun violence that were streamed live from the chamber last summer.\\n\\nThe House voted 234-193 to pass a package of rules that included the change.\\n\\nHouse rules already prohibit lawmakers from taking photos or videos on the House floor, but the ban is largely ignored. The change approved Tuesday represents the first time that House members will be punished for violating the rules.\\n\\nThe sergeant at arms will have the power to levy the fines, which would start at $500 for the first offense and rise to a maximum penalty of $2,500 for each subsequent violation. House members could appeal the punishment to the House Ethics Committee, according to House Rules Chairman Pete Sessions, R-Texas.\\n\\nRepublicans said the change merely ensures that current House rules can be enforced. But Democrats called it a gag rule aimed at stifling free speech.\\n\\nSessions said he would support the rule no matter which party was in the majority as a way to maintain decorum on the House floor.\\n\\nIf you're willing to pay the fine and you want to do that (take videos), that's not a gag order, Sessions said. That's a violation of a rule. If you would like to participate in that, go for it all you want. But I don't think it's the right thing. We tried to limit (the rule)...very carefully to say we're going to make this a fine.\\n\\nDemocrats said the rule change was unconstitutional.\\n\\nIt's a violation of free speech on the House floor, said Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. It's an insult to the American people by saying they shouldn't be allowed to hear us.\\n\\nDemocrats staged sit-ins for nearly 26 hours in June to protest Republican leaders refusal to take a vote on gun control measures in the wake of the mass shooting at an Orlando gay nightclub. That massacre killed 49 people and wounded about 50 more.\\n\\nDemocrats continued to protest even after Republican leaders adjourned the House. The Democrats broadcast their sit-ins by taking videos via smartphones and other devices and streaming them live through Facebook and Periscope. C-SPAN, which normally broadcasts House proceedings, is run by the House and does not show the House floor when the chamber is not officially in session.\\n\\nWhen the cameras were turned off in this House there was no way to communicate with the American people, other than by . . . the streaming of the debate that was going on, said Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in House leadership.\\n\\nThe House passed the rules package after Republicans withdrew language what would have undercut the independent Office of Congressional Ethics.\\n\\nRead more:\\n\\nHouse Republicans drop plan to gut ethics office\\n\\nDemocrats continue gun control sit-in after House adjourns"}
{"original": "Sean Williams\\n\\nThe Motley Fool\\n\\nBy now you've probably heard about the cryptocurrency craze.\\n\\nEither a family member, friend, neighbor, doctor, Uber driver, sales associate, server, barista, or passer-by on the street, has probably told you how he or she is getting rich quick with virtual currencies like bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, or one of the lesser-known 1,300-plus investable cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nBut how much do you really know about them? Considering just how many questions I've received out of the blue from the aforementioned group of people over the last month, the answer is probably, not a lot.\\n\\nToday, we'll change that. We're going to walk through the basics of cryptocurrencies, step by step, and explain things in plain English. No crazy technical jargon here. Just sticks and stones examples of how today's cryptocurrencies work, what they're ultimately trying to accomplish, and how they're being valued.\\n\\nLet's get started.\\n\\nWhat are cryptocurrencies?\\n\\nSimply put, cryptocurrencies are electronic peer-to-peer currencies. They don't physically exist. You can't pick up a bitcoin and hold it in your hand, or pull one out of your wallet. But just because you can't physically hold a bitcoin, it doesn't mean they aren't worth anything, as you've probably noticed by the rapidly rising prices of virtual currencies over the past couples of months.\\n\\nMore: Ask a Fool: Are any bitcoin stocks worth buying?\\n\\nMore: Stocks had biggest gains since 2013: Here's why\\n\\nMore: Got $1 million in bitcoins? This 'Packers party house' could be yours\\n\\nHow many cryptocurrencies are there?\\n\\nThe number is always changing, but according to CoinMarketCap.com as of Dec. 30, there were around 1,375 different virtual coins that investors could potentially buy. It's worth noting that the barrier to entry is particularly low among cryptocurrencies. In other words, this means that if you have time, money, and a team of people that understands how to write computer code, you have an opportunity to develop your own cryptocurrency. It likely means new cryptocurrencies will continue entering the space as time passes.\\n\\nWhy were cryptocurrencies invented?\\n\\nTechnically, the idea of an electronic peer-to-peer currency was being tinkered with decades ago, but it wasn't truly successful until 2008, when bitcoin was conceived. The basis of bitcoin's creation, and all virtual currencies that have since followed, was to fix a number of perceived flaws with the way money is transmitted from one party to another.\\n\\nWhat flaws? For example, think about how long it can take for a bank to settle a cross-border payment, or how financial institutions have been reaping the rewards of fees by acting as a third-party middleman during transactions. Cryptocurrencies work around the traditional financial system through the use of blockchain technology.\\n\\nOK, what the heck is blockchain?\\n\\nBlockchain is the digital ledger where all transactions involving a virtual currency are stored. If you buy bitcoin, sell bitcoin, use your bitcoin to buy a Subway sandwich, and so on, it'll be recorded, in an encrypted fashion, in this digital ledger. The same goes for other cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nThink of blockchain technology as the infrastructure that underlies virtual coins. It's the foundation of your home, while the tethered virtual coin represents all the products built on top of that foundation.\\n\\nWhy is blockchain a potentially better choice than the current system of transferring money?\\n\\nBlockchain offers a number of potential advantages, but is designed to cure three major problems with the current money transmittance system.\\n\\nFirst, blockchain technology is decentralized. In simple terms, this just means there isn't a data center where all transaction data is stored. Instead, data from this digital ledger is stored on hard drives and servers all over the globe. The reason this is done is twofold: 1.) it ensures that no one person or company will have central authority over a virtual currency, and 2.) it acts as a safeguard against cyberattacks, such that criminals aren't able to gain control of a cryptocurrency and exploit its holders.\\n\\nSecondly, as noted, there's no middleman with blockchain technology. Since no third-party bank is needed to oversee these transactions, the thought is that transaction fees might be lower than they currently are.\\n\\nFinally, transactions on blockchain networks may have the opportunity to settle considerably faster than traditional networks. Let's remember that banks have pretty rigid working hours, and they're closed at least one or two days a week. And, as noted, cross-border transactions can be held for days while funds are verified. With blockchain, this verification of transactions is always ongoing, which means the opportunity to settle transactions much more quickly, or perhaps even instantly.\\n\\nHow are transactions verified on a blockchain?\\n\\nYou might be wondering how these blockchain transactions are verified. After all, there are logistics involved, such as making sure that the same virtual coin isn't being spent twice. Often this verification falls onto a group of folks known as miners.\\n\\nCryptocurrency miners are nothing more than people with high-powered computers who are competing against other people with high-powered computers to solve complex math equations. These equations are a product of the encryption designed to protect transaction data on the digital ledger.\\n\\nThe first miner to solve these equations, and in the process verify transactions on the ledger, gets a reward, which is known as a block reward. This reward is paid out in virtual coins, and is an example of how bitcoin transactions are verified. This process is referred to as proof of work.\\n\\nThe only other major verification process in place is known as proof of stake. Instead of having people use tons of resources trying to solve complex equations to verify transactions, the proof of stake model chooses who gets to verify the next block of transactions based on their ownership in a virtual currency. In essence, the more you own, the better chance you have of getting to verify transactions. With proof of stake, there is no competition among your peers and no excessive energy usage while solving complex equations, which can make it much more cost-effective.\\n\\nThe proof of stake model also rewards those folks who verify transactions differently. Instead of being paid in virtual coins, the stakeholder earns the transaction fees tied to that block of transactions.\\n\\nAre blockchain networks public or private?\\n\\nThe interesting thing is that blockchain has the opportunity to be public or private. As you might imagine, a private blockchain would appeal most to businesses, while public blockchains are most appealing to consumers who might want to use their virtual currency to buy goods or services, or to cryptocurrency investors.\\n\\nA private blockchain, just as it sounds, allows a business to place restrictions on who has access to data, and who can make transactions on the network. Meanwhile, public blockchains allow anyone to join and participate. Bitcoin is an example of a public blockchain.\\n\\nIs it true that cryptocurrency transactions are anonymous?\\n\\nThe answer to this is, it depends. Most cryptocurrencies aren't as anonymous as you'd think. Sure, you don't have to supply your Social Security number or bank account to begin trading or investing in cryptocurrencies, but any transaction you make is still going to be recorded in the underlying digital ledger.\\n\\nRecently, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) won a court case against cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase that required the exchange to turn over information on 14,355 users who, between 2013 and 2015, exchanged at least $20,000 worth of bitcoin. While the IRS primarily sought this info to go after possible capital-gain tax evaders, the bigger idea here is that these transactions aren't as anonymous as you'd think.\\n\\nThere is, however, a group of cryptocurrencies known privacy coins that have a sole purpose of beefing up the anonymity and privacy of a transaction. They use specialized protocols to help hide the identity of the sender of a payment. Monero and Dash are examples of coins that belong to this specialized group.\\n\\nHow do virtual coins fit into all of this?\\n\\nAs noted, digital currencies are what investors are buying. In nearly all instances, buying a cryptocurrency won't give an investor any ownership in the underlying blockchain technology. This happens to be one of the biggest differences between cryptocurrencies and traditional investments, like stocks. If you buy stock in a publicly traded company, you own a fractional percentage of that business. That's not the case with nearly all cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nSo, what do the virtual coins do exactly? In many instances, the coins are required to pay for transactions fees on a blockchain. Ethereum, which is one of the largest cryptocurrencies by market cap behind bitcoin, requires users of its blockchain to pay transaction fees in its coin, known as Ether. But there are other potential applications.\\n\\nFor example, Ripple's coin, known as the XRP, may serve as an intermediary that'll allow transactions to settle faster. Ripple is a blockchain company that's focused on partnering with big banks and financial institutions. Imagine that a customer in Japan wants to make a payment to a business in the U.K. If this payment were routed through Ripple's blockchain, it could take the payment in Japanese yen, convert that payment into XRP coins, then convert those coins into British pounds. All of this could theoretically be done instantly, or at the very least considerably faster than traditional banks (and hopefully for a lower cost).\\n\\nHow should cryptocurrencies be valued?\\n\\nTruth be told, no one knows the answer to this, because it's dependent on a number of factors. These include:\\n\\nHow quickly blockchain technology is adopted by bigger businesses;\\n\\nHow quickly merchants are willing to accept virtual currencies as a form of payment;\\n\\nWhether governments around the world will accept cryptocurrencies as legal tender, or choose to ban them entirely.\\n\\nIt's also unclear at times how cohesive a virtual coin and its underlying blockchain are. The example above involving Ripple's blockchain and its XRP shows how the two work pretty well hand-in-hand. Not all cryptocurrencies have a coin that has a clear-cut use or enhances the value of its underlying blockchain. This is why valuing cryptocurrencies often proves difficult.\\n\\nWhy have cryptocurrencies gone up so much?\\n\\nAgain, there's no 100% correct answer here, but the key in their success remains two factors. First, retail investors (i.e., non-professional investors) have accounted for most virtual currency trading. Institutional investors have kept to the sidelines because either their company won't allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies, or they're simply too volatile to merit an investment. Retail investors tend to be more reliant on their emotions relative to institutional investors, leading to moves that tend to overshoot to the upside, and downside.\\n\\nThe second factor is that this isn't exactly a fair market. Among traditional equities, like the stock market, an investor has the opportunity to buy, sell, and even bet against an equity. Money can be made if an equity moves up or down. With nearly all cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin, buying or selling is the only option. There is no way to make money if a cryptocurrency goes down, which naturally tends to incentivize buying. This probably won't last forever, but it's played a key role in pushing prices higher.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\\n\\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

{"original": "More than two years after his precipitous fall from Hollywood power amid a cascade of sexual misconduct allegations, ex-mogul Harvey Weinstein's criminal trial on five sex-crime charges is scheduled to begin Monday in Manhattan.\\n\\nWeinstein is the first target of the #MeToo movement. He is accused by more than 80 women, including A-list stars, of being a serial sexual harasser and predator for decades, and his trial can fairly be considered historic.\\n\\nAs such, it will be closely followed around the world as the first #MeToo case to be put before a criminal court jury.\\n\\nThis case is important because it is the first, and at this time the only criminal prosecution of Harvey Weinstein, says lawyer Gloria Allred, who represents Weinstein accusers, including one who will testify against him. It is important not because of a hashtag on the internet, but because many women who allege that they were victimized by Harvey Weinstein would like him to be accountable in a court of law.\\n\\nWeinstein, 67, remains under investigation in Los Angeles and in London, but thus far he is the only man accused since the #MeToo movement surged in October 2017 to reach this point in the criminal process.\\n\\nThe Nantucket, Massachusetts, groping case against Oscar winner Kevin Spacey collapsed at the pretrial stage last year after the accuser refused to testify. Bill Cosby was convicted of three sex crimes in Pennsylvania in 2018, but his downfall began years before the #MeToo movement.\\n\\nWeinstein's trial could end up resembling Cosby's in one respect: There will be more accusers (four) testifying about uncharged crimes than accusers (two) testifying about charged crimes. The trial will feature testimony from accusers whose allegations are not officially charged but are intended to help prosecutors establish an alleged pattern of predatory sexual misconduct by Weinstein.\\n\\nThis strategy proved to be crucial to Cosby's conviction, and it is fair to expect it could be powerful help to the prosecution of Weinstein, says Allred, who also represented Cosby accusers.\\n\\nWeinstein, who was charged in May 2018, has pleaded not guilty to all the charges and has been free on $1 million bail (recently raised to $5 million). He has denied all allegations of non-consensual sex.\\n\\nThis is not trivial, and not as simple as 'activists' versus Weinstein, and the only issues that should be relevant beginning Monday are those involved with the criminal charges if due process still matters to (the media) and to the public at large, says Juda Engelmayer, a spokesman for Weinstein's legal team. Mr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never been in a non-consensual physical relationship with anyone.\\n\\nHere's what to expect at his trial:\\n\\nWhat are the charges against Weinstein?\\n\\nHe is accused of five sex crimes, including rape and sexual assault, against two women, as yet unnamed, in two encounters dating to 2013 and 2006. Prosecutors have added a predatory label to the encounters, which under New York law allows for a longer prison sentence if convicted.\\n\\nIf he is convicted, Weinstein could get a life sentence.\\n\\nHow long is the trial expected to last?\\n\\nUp to two months, before Judge James Burke. The trial will not be televised.\\n\\nWho are the lawyers?\\n\\nFor the Manhattan District Attorney's office, the lead prosecutor is Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi. Her office had no comment on the opening of the trial.\\n\\nFor Weinstein, the defense team is led by Chicago lawyers Donna Rotunno and Damon Cheronis and New York lawyer Arthur Aidala.\\n\\nWhat will happen first?\\n\\nJury selection will begin and could take some time. It could last anywhere from two to three weeks and yes, it will be crucial, Allred says.\\n\\nWeinstein's lawyers have already complained in court documents that the jury pool is tainted by pretrial publicity, even though a judge denied their effort to get the case moved out of Manhattan.\\n\\n.\\n\\nIf it spills over into the next week, it is going very slowly and a lot of prospective jurors will have indicated they already made up their minds, says Alan Tuerkheimer, a jury selection expert in Chicago who has been watching the case.\\n\\nWho is expected to testify?\\n\\nThe two women whose accusations form the basis of the five charges are expected to take the stand. One woman says Weinstein raped her in a Manhattan hotel room in 2013.\\n\\nThe other woman says Weinstein performed a forcible sex act on her in his Manhattan apartment in 2006. She is Mimi Haleyi, who went public with her allegation in October 2017 at a news conference in New York with her lawyer, Allred.\\n\\nAlso expected to testify is former The Sopranos star Annabella Sciorra, 59, who alleges Weinstein raped her in her Manhattan apartment in the winter of 1993-94.\\n\\nWeinstein is not charged in connection with Sciorra's accusation. Instead, her testimony is intended to help prosecutors meet their burden of proving predatory sexual assault – meaning that at least two women were allegedly assaulted by the defendant.\\n\\nAdditionally, there will be three witnesses, who will be called to testify about alleged prior bad acts. These witnesses are intended to strengthen the prosecution's case.\\n\\nIn August, Judge Burke held a closed-door pretrial hearing barring the media at the behest of both prosecutors and the defense to keep the identities of the accusers and the details of their stories from tainting the potential jury pool.\\n\\nEventually, Burke agreed to allow three such accusers to testify. According to a court document, Jane Doe 1 says she was assaulted in the spring of 2004 at a hotel near Park Avenue in New York. Jane Doe 2 says she was assaulted between May and July 2005 at an address where Weinstein lived in New York. And Jane Doe 3 says her encounter occurred on Feb. 19, 2013, at a hotel in Beverly Hills, according to the document.\\n\\nThe Jane Doe 2 witness is represented by attorney Douglas Wigdor, who says his client came forward to the district attorney's office to detail her 2005 encounter with Weinstein because it's the right thing to do.\\n\\nShe has no other motivations than to hold Weinstein accountable for what he did to her and other women, Wigdor told USA TODAY.\\n\\nWill any A-list stars who have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct testify?\\n\\nDo not expect to see on the stand the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek, Ashley Judd, Rose McGowan, Lupita Nyong'o, Mira Sorvino or any of the other stars who have described what they perceived as disturbing encounters with Weinstein over decades.\\n\\nTheir claims against Weinstein have not been charged (most of them are too old or did not occur in New York), and they were not submitted as witnesses by prosecutors.\\n\\nWhat do #MeToo activists have to say about the trial?\\n\\nA group of about two dozen accusers, including McGowan and actress Rosanna Arquette, who call themselves the silence breakers issueda statement to USA TODAY saying the trial is another critical step in the public and professional reckoning Weinstein faces.\\n\\nOn Monday, the world will be watching as Harvey Weinstein walks into court to stand trial for a fraction of the egregious crimes he has committed, the statement said. This trial is critical to show that predators everywhere will be held accountable and that speaking up can bring about real change.\\n\\nThe trial is not just about Weinstein, it's about changing the power imbalances that allowed sexual misconduct to flourish for so long, says Tina Tchen, president and CEO of the #MeToo-inspired Time's Up Foundation.\\n\\nWe hope that (sexual misconduct) survivors experience some small measure of justice as this trial begins, which is an important step forward in a complex process of holding perpetrators accountable, Tchen said in a statement to USA TODAY. Sadly, most cases never even make it this far."}
{"original": "For years, cutting the pay-TV cord has been seen as a way to save money – you don't pay for channels you don't watch and are free from long-term contracts.\\n\\nBut in reality, the landscape and benefits constantly change as content shifts between providers and new streaming players emerge. The latest development: higher prices.\\n\\nAll of the main live TV streaming services – such as AT&T TV Now (formerly DirecTV Now), fubo TV, Hulu + Live TV, Sling TV, and YouTube TV – have seen price increases within the last year.\\n\\nAmong the most recent moves, Sling TV announced a $5 increase to its monthly subscriptions two weeks ago. And earlier in December, Hulu raised the monthly price for its Live TV service, which has more than 60 channels, by $10 monthly.\\n\\nProviding all of the channels and content viewers want comes at a cost. The high price of programming led Sony to decide to shutter its Playstation Vue live TV service, which had operated for five years, at the end of this month.\\n\\nRising prices mean you are likely going to pay about $50 or more for a service to stream live TV including the most popular channels such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and ESPN.\\n\\nSo can you really save by opting to cut the cord?\\n\\nThat depends on what you want to watch and how you price it out.\\n\\nAnd another one: New Quibi streaming service to give bite-size shows from J.Lo, Spielberg and The Rock\\n\\nStreaming live and local:You can finally stream your PBS stations online – on YouTube TV\\n\\nUS & Iran:The risk of an Iran cyberattack is up after missile strike on Iraqi military bases\\n\\nBroadband and beyond\\n\\nLet's break down the costs. To cut the cord, first, you need broadband internet service, although some make do with ultimate wireless plans allowing them to stream on mobile devices.\\n\\nMost U.S. homes (82%) already have broadband, paying about $67 monthly for the connection, according to Leichtman Research Group. That's a lot cheaper than the $109.60 that the research firm says pay-TV subscribers pay monthly. But that's not the end of your costs; you still have to pay for the content you stream.\\n\\nIf you are a pay-TV customer currently paying as much as $100 monthly – not counting your broadband costs – and opt to cut the pay-TV cord, you could likely save money.\\n\\nYou could save as much as $360 a year relying on an antenna, YouTube and free advertising-supported streaming services such as the Roku Channel, Pluto TV, Tubi, Crackle and Xumo, which collectively offer live news and thousands of movies and TV episodes. The movie offerings aren't first-run, but a sampling includes The China Syndrome (Crackle), Zodiac (Pluto TV), The Dark Knight (Roku Channel) , A.I. Artificial Intelligence (tubi), and Cloverfield (Xumo)\\n\\nHowever, if that lineup doesn't suffice and you decide to pay for content, be choosy or you could quickly rack up streaming charges of up to $200 monthly.\\n\\nSavings: $60 or more, if you keep to subscribing to only a few services, such as Netflix, Hulu on demand and one premium network such HBO or Showtime.\\n\\nThe real cost of cutting the cord:What streaming companies don't want you to know\\n\\nSubscription overload:So many streaming services, so many bills\\n\\nStreaming live TV: What does it cost?\\n\\nIf you prefer something more like a cable service with local TV channels and major cable networks, most services such as AT&T TV Now, fubo TV, Hulu + Live TV, and YouTube TV carry some local channels in most markets. And Sling TV, which carries only Fox or NBC channels, has an affiliate in several markets, too.\\n\\nTo maintain that $50 or so of savings from dropping pay-TV, choose YouTube TV ($49.99 monthly). Each of the others costs a bit more and AT&T TV Now starts at $65 monthly but includes HBO.\\n\\nA note: Before subscribing, you want to check with your internet provider. If you get your internet and TV from the same company, as most customers do, dropping your TV service could result in a higher monthly cost for broadband, too. A very recent development: Verizon Fios customers can now change their pay TV and broadband service without penalty, regardless of any previous contract.\\n\\nIf savings isn't the main goal, you can pay $80 monthly for AT&T TV Now's Max package with 60-plus channels, HBO and Cinemax. Each of the other services lets you add additional channels including premium networks for an additional fee.\\n\\nSometimes, the decision of whether to stream is made for you. If you live somewhere with subpar broadband service, you may not be able to rely on streaming. YouTube TV recommends 7 Mbps for one HD stream and 13 Mbps to do so with other devices on your home network.\\n\\nMy sister and her family in Kansas pay $127 for Dish Network and $35 for internet that delivers only 2.2 Mbps. For them, cutting the cord is dicey because streaming quality will likely suffer.\\n\\nMy parents do stream ESPN+ but their broadband speeds top out at 10 Mbps – another case where streaming multiple devices at one time could lead to quality issues. That – and the ease of use of a remote and programming guide – keeps them tethered to Dish Network, too, at $110 monthly for TV, broadband and home phone.\\n\\nCo-workers and friends pay from $50 to $235 monthly for various pay-TV, broadband and streaming content packages.\\n\\nBut what about news and sports?\\n\\nLive news and sports, especially, can throw a curve into your plans to cut the cord – and to cut costs.\\n\\nFor a full menu of live news and sports (to watch local teams) AT&T TV Now, Hulu + Live TV, and YouTube TV all have local networks, Fox News, CNN and MSNBC and several sports channels including ESPN, FS1, FS2 and some regional sports networks. Fubo TV compares favorably for news and sports – it has more than 40 channels that carry sports – but does not have ESPN and also recently lost some regional sports networks.\\n\\nBut streaming isn't a solution for all everyone. For instance, Washington, D.C., and Baltimore area fans of the Washington Nationals and Baltimore Orioles cannot stream most of the games locally, so a traditional pay TV service is required. Even an MLB.TV subscription won't solve that problem because local live broadcasts are blacked out, an issue that can hit fans of other sports teams across the U.S.\\n\\nWhere I live in northern Virginia, that means a broadband/TV bundle from Cox Cable ($69.99 and up monthly) or Verizon Fios ($89.99 and up monthly). For pay TV alone, there's satellite service from DirecTV ($60 and up) or Dish Network ($70 and up). Those prices are before any additional fees or taxes.\\n\\nIf you don't need live sports or news, you may be satisfied with on-demand services such as Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, HBO, and Showtime. There's also Philo ($20 monthly), which has 58 channels including AMC, BBC America, Comedy Central, Discovery Channel, Food Network and HGTV.\\n\\nSavings: $45 or more, if you swapped a pay-TV package of $100 or so for a broadband-delivered service of $50 to $55.\\n\\nTips to cut your streaming bill\\n\\nMost likely, you will want a combination of on-demand content from a service like Netflix or Disney+ and some live channels. That can easily push your monthly bill above $100.\\n\\nSo how do you save any money?\\n\\nLearn to game the system. Drop a service when there's nothing vital on there for you – remember, you did not sign a long-term contract. So you can save on monthly fees by dropping a service once you have watched the content you want and re-up when you want to watch again.\\n\\nStreaming providers have begun to expect this behavior. The Disney-controlled Hulu told subscribers in November that if its price increase for live TV hurt their pocketbook, to switch to one of Hulu's less expensive on-demand plans when a sports season ends or a TV series takes a break.\\n\\nThe practice is becoming increasingly commonplace among subscribers, wrote Rich Greenfield, tech/media/telecom analyst for LightShed Partners, in a blog post. But it was nice to see Disney management embracing change vs. fighting it, even if it hurts their legacy, highly-profitable assets.\\n\\nProviders should expect that, fubo TV co-founder and CEO David Gandler told USA TODAY. I don't believe people will maintain all these services 12 months a year, he said. They will be in and out of these things.\\n\\nYou can learn to make money-saving moves. For instance, if you are a fan of The Walking Dead, rather than pay for live TV service you could wait until the end of the season this spring and then subscribe to Philo for one month. Or perhaps binge the entire season during Philo's free seven-day trial for new members. Or you could wait until the latest season lands on Netflix or another service you already subscribe to.\\n\\nIf you don't need every news or sports channel, you could get the CBS All Access app, which has the CBSN news channel and your local CBS network. Or subscribe to Sling TV's Orange package ($30 monthly after $20 the first month), which has ESPN, ESPN 2, and CNN, or Sling Blue package ($30 monthly after $20 the first month) to get CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.\\n\\nScale it all back. Again, an antenna could be an alternative for some who want to watch local TV channels for local news and sports.\\n\\nThey say sharing is caring. Of course, many of you already use passwords shared with you by family and friends. Many services allow two or three viewers at the same time. So if your daughter or son or parents pay for a service, see if you can piggyback.\\n\\nConsumers expect to spend about $5 more each month for content, but that doesn't mean they will be loyal to a service, says Todd Supplee, entertainment and media partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers US.

{"original": "Every person who brings a new Echo speaker from Amazon into their home gets automatically recorded every time they utter the Alexa wake word.\\n\\nThat is, unless they mute the microphone on the device itself. Or diligently go to the Alexa smartphone app, to manually delete the recordings.\\n\\nAmazon could offer the option of not recording us, but it doesn't. And it will tell you every way but Tuesday how important the recordings are to improve the Alexa experience.\\n\\nWhich got us wondering: Why is this really such a big deal to Amazon, Google and Apple, and why do the companies make it so hard to stop them from monitoring us?\\n\\nLet's begin with Amazon, which seems to do everything in its power to stop you from deleting the recordings via the Alexa smartphone app in the privacy section. Voice recordings are used to improve the accuracy of your interactions with Alexa, the company says. Deleting voice recordings associated with your account may degrade your experience.\\n\\nAmazon does offer two very minor voice commands to erase the audio, by saying, Alexa, delete what I just said, or Delete everything I said today, but Amazon will still have transcripts from at least three months of your recordings unless you go in and manually get rid of them.\\n\\nOnce you do that, Amazon urges you to reconsider. Deleting your voice recordings may degrade your experience....are you sure you want to proceed? Amazon gives you the option of automatic deletion, but only for every three months or 18 months.\\n\\nWe don't keep data for data's sake, Amazon senior Vice President Dave Limp told USA TODAY in September. We're very convinc that by keeping this data...it improves the service materially.\\n\\nAt Google, whose Google Assistant goes beyond the Home speaker line to be an integral part of the Android smartphone platform and a feature on many devices from the Nest thermostat to Lenovo smart displays, the recordings go way beyond just using the Hey, Google wake word.\\n\\nGoogle manually tracks every search you make, via your typewritten keyboard clicks, as well as every word uttered into many Google apps and even Google.com for voice commands.\\n\\nSo when we opened the Google Assistant app on the iPhone this week, and said, We are told that Google only records you if you first use the wake word. Then how to explain this, huh? every word was recorded and stored. We played it back and listened.\\n\\nAnd continued on the Google app on an Android Pixel phone and Google.com on an Apple MacBook Pro. The results didn't change. We were recorded every time.\\n\\nLike Amazon, Google invites you to delete your recordings and keystrokes manually, or automatically every 3 or 18 months.\\n\\nGoogle advises why it wants to record you. The activity that you keep can improve your experience anywhere you use your Google Account, the company says. What you search, read and watch can work together to help you get things done faster, discover new content and pick up where you left off.\\n\\nIt says the audio and voice tracking is opt in only, but it uses strong persuasive wording to convince you to give it the OK because otherwise, your experience will be limited, according to Google.\\n\\nUh-oh!:Google really is listening and recording on apps\\n\\nReally::This simple trick stops Google, Amazon and Facebook from listening to you all the time\\n\\nTo opt out, go to Google's settings (icon on the top right of your browser), go to Data and Personalization and Web and App Activity, and make sure that Include Voice and Audio Recordings, is unchecked.\\n\\nThe bad news: Even unchecked, your previous recordings are still stored on Google servers. You'll need to go in and delete them manually.\\n\\nApple uses its alternative stance on privacy as a marketing tool. It doesn't urge you not to delete the recordings, like Amazon. In fact, it doesn't even automatically record your interactions with Siri. The company says you need to volunteer.\\n\\nUsers can opt in to help Siri improve by learning from audio samples of their requests, Apple says.\\n\\nUnlike its rivals, Apple will make you work to volunteer. Within the general Settings, under Analytics and Improvements, Apple offers the ability to help improve Siri and Dictation by allowing Apple to store and review audio of your Siri and dictation interactions, by clicking the feature on. By default, it's turned off.\\n\\nBut opting in, the users may be monitored. A small sample of audio from Siri requests may be reviewed by Apple employees to measure how well Siri was responding and to improve its reliability, Apple says. For example, did the user intend to wake Siri? Did Siri hear the request accurately? And did Siri respond appropriately to the request?\\n\\nBret Kinsella, the editor of the Voicebot.ai website, says the companies are justified in recording us and playing back the tapes.\\n\\nThey need to see where the errors occur, and the only way to do that is with real people, he says. They could use panels instead, but it's not the same as a real-life experience.\\n\\nWhat would Alexa be like if Amazon didn't record us?\\n\\nAlexa would be very good at understanding common speech patterns of professionals who live in (Amazon's headquarters) Seattle, he says.

{"original": "Rob Gordon\\n\\nBaseballHQ.com\\n\\nThroughout the offseason, USA TODAY Sports Weekly will be profiling the top five prospects from each major league team as part of its Organizational Reports series.\\n\\nThis week: the Pittsburgh Pirates.\\n\\n1. Tyler Glasnow, RHP: Glasnow, 23, flashes a plus-plus mid-90s fastball with good downhill tilt, an upper-70s curve and a change-up that is a work in progress. He gets strikeouts by the bushel (168 in 140 innings in 2016) but needs to polish his control. He'll have a chance to make the Pirates rotation this spring.\\n\\n2. Josh Bell, 1B: Bell, 24, is a strong-bodied hitter with plus bat speed and raw power that eventually should result in 20-plus home runs a year. He held his own in a late-season call-up with an advanced understanding of the strike zone and an ability to shoot lines drives to all fields. Bell likely will start at first base.\\n\\n3. Austin Meadows, OF: Meadows' compact left-handed stroke causes the ball to jump off his bat. He hits for power (12 home runs in 308 at-bats) and covers ground well in center field. With good patience and consistent contact at the plate, the 21-year-old has the tools to be an impact player. He'll open at Class AAA.\\n\\n4. Kevin Newman, SS: The 2015 first-rounder hit .320 between advanced Class A and Class AA. Newman, 23, has hand-eye coordination and strike zone judgment but below-average power. He runs well with good range and arm and should stick at shortstop. He'll begin at Class AAA.\\n\\n5. Mitch Keller, RHP: After an injury limited his innings in 2015, Keller made mechanical adjustments that decreased his walks (19 in 130 1/3 innings). His fastball comes in at 93-96 mph. Several years away, Keller, 20, will start at advanced Class A.\\n\\nExcerpted from BaseballHQ.com's 2017 Minor League Baseball Analyst. To order: Baseballhq.com/mlba2017"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — South Carolina has promoted Bryan McClendon to offensive coordinator, filling one of the Gamecocks biggest items on the offseason to-do list.\\n\\nCoach Will Muschamp announced the move Friday, saying he talked with McClendon soon after the interim OC had helped the Gamecocks to a 26-19 victory in the Outback Bowl on New Year's Day.\\n\\nIn his two years here at South Carolina, he's been outstanding, Muschamp said of the 34-year-old McClendon. You see the rapport he has with our staff, with our players, how he positively affects everybody in our entire organization.\\n\\nMcClendon will remain in charge of wide receivers going forward.\\n\\nMuschamp also hired Dan Werner as quarterbacks coach. Werner was co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Ole Miss for five seasons before moving on as an offensive analyst at Alabama this past season and will finish his duties with the Crimson Tide at the national title game Monday night before coming over to the Gamecocks.\\n\\nMcClendon and Werner fill the role of fired offensive coordinator Kurt Roper, who was let go after two seasons of disappointing offensive performances.\\n\\nThe Gamecocks ranked 13th in total offense and last in points in the 14-team Southeastern Conference in Muschamp's first season in 2016. Those numbers improved slightly this past fall as the Gamecocks were 12th in both SEC categories. That was not enough, however, to keep Muschamp from making a change.\\n\\nBobby Bentley, who took over as Gamecocks quarterbacks coach for the bowl game, will return to his regular spot coaching Gamecock runners.\\n\\nMuschamp does not expect any more staff shuffling as South Carolina heads into the offseason.\\n\\nMcClendon hopes to keep South Carolina's offense advancing to next year, building off the team's 9-4 season which marked just the sixth time in school history the team won nine games or more.\\n\\nIt's not like we're going to reinvent the wheel offensively, McClendon said. One thing that we do have to is giving our players the best chance to be successful. That's all any coach can be asked to do.\\n\\nMcClendon showed his adaptability in the Outback Bowl when South Carolina fell behind 19-3 and had little success against Michigan's defense, which ranks third in the country.\\n\\nBut McClendon changed up some offensive blocking schemes to buy his group more time and the Gamecocks responded with 23 unanswered points for the win. South Carolina ended with 239 yards passing, only the second time this season the Wolverines allowed more than 200 yards through the air.\\n\\nThat's what we're going to be constantly trying to do, getting creative and giving our guys ways to succeed, McClendon said.\\n\\nMcClendon's attack will have a rock-solid quarterback in rising junior Jake Bentley, who was named the bowl's most valuable player. It will also have dynamic playmaking receiver Deebo Samuel, who had six touchdowns before getting hurt against Kentucky on Sept. 16.\\n\\nSamuel, who fractured his leg, is cleared for spring practice, Muschamp said.\\n\\nMuschamp said he spoke with Alabama coach Nick Saban about Werner's ability and believes he'll help improve the team's quarterback play. Bentley's completion percentage dropped from 65 to 62 percent in his first full season as starter and the sophomore, at times, put the ball in danger as evidenced with 12 interceptions.\\n\\nMuschamp said Werner's work with Ole Miss quarterbacks Bo Wallace and Chad Kelly was impressive.\\n\\nMuschamp brought Werner in for a bowl practice and after watching him interact with McClendon knew the duo would click. He and Bryan hit it off and I saw this was going to work, the coach said. Dan's got a wealth of experience as a play caller, as a developer of quarterbacks.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college football: https://collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}

{"original": "WASHINGTON – Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said Friday that she now supports President Donald Trump's renegotiated United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement because it makes improvements.\\n\\nThe House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved the sweeping trade deal in late 2019, just one day after impeaching Trump on a mostly partisan vote.\\n\\nWorkers have had the legs taken out from underneath them and this agreement makes improvements, Warren told a Boston CBS affiliate Friday. It's gonna help open up some markets for farmers, they need that stability. It's gonna help with enforceable labor standards and that's gonna be useful. We really need trade negotiations going forward that make sure anyone who wants access to our markets is actually helping us in the fight against climate change and helping build an economy that works for everybody in the U.S.\\n\\nThe approval sets her apart from fellow progressive and 2020 Democratic primary contender Sen.

It is not going to stop corporations from moving to Mexico.\\n\\nThe support for the USMCA now aligns Warren with moderate 2020 candidates such as Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former vice president Joe Biden, who have shown support for the trade deal.\\n\\nSen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, who is also running for the 2020 Democratic nomination, previously called for changes regarding the trade deal last year, but has yet to talk about his position on the bipartisan bill passed by the House.\\n\\nWarren's approval is new as she previously disagreed with the initial version of the trade agreement, and demanded changes. She said in 2018 that Trump's deal won't stop the serious and ongoing harm NAFTA causes for American workers. It won't stop outsourcing, it won't raise wages, and it won't create jobs. It's NAFTA 2.0.\\n\\nThe new trade pact will replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, a nearly quarter-century-old accord that essentially eliminated tariffs on most goods traded among the three countries.\\n\\nMore:'I want to have peace.'

A verification process will enable U.S. customs workers to block goods from entering the country if they have been produced in violation of those rules.\\n\\nWarren stated Friday that she wants to see improvement for our farmers and workers. It's not as much improvement as I'd like to see but right now they're in a terrible hole where Donald Trump has put them. I want to get them out of that hole.\\n\\nContributing: Michael Collins"}
{"original": "If you went to high school in the U.S., you probably think you know everything you need to about cheerleading. But you're also probably wrong.\\n\\nThere is so much more to the sport than stereotypes and teen movies suggest, and Netflix's incredible docuseries Cheer, from the producers of the great Last Chance U, will change minds and maybe hearts about this uniquely American subculture.\\n\\nFocused on the national champion team at a small-town Texas junior college, Cheer offers six riveting episodes that will leave you stunned by the athletic talent of the diverse group of young adults being thrown in the air and (hopefully) caught again. It might also leave you deeply concerned about the safety of sport and the future of the athletes highlighted.\\n\\nCheer follows the coaches and cheerleaders at Navarro College in Corsicana, Texas, a tiny town with a tiny school that has more than a dozen national championship titles under its belt, mostly thanks to aggressive coach Monica Aldama, who built the program from the ground up.\\n\\nCheerleading is as all-consuming at Navarro as football might be at Big Ten universities: Students spend five or more hours a day training. Cheer spends most of its time with five of them: Lexi, Morgan, Gabi, LaDarius and Jerry.\\n\\nIt's immediately clear that there's so much more involved in cheerleading than rhyming chants and pompoms. The Navarro team's athletic feats are akin to 2000's Bring it On, although even that film couldn't convey the strength, stamina and pain involved in stunts, baskets, tumbling and pyramids.\\n\\nMore:Netflix's January 2020 list: 'Grace and Frankie,' 'Sabrina' and 'The Goop Lab'\\n\\nWhen the cheerleaders are just working out in a gym in athletic gear we might see runners or basketball players wear, the hyper-stylized cheerleading aesthetic is lost and the epic proportions of the sport come to light. You can see muscles ripple and hear grunts of effort and pain. When put in an arm-wrestling competition with other athletes, my money would be on the cheerleaders every time.\\n\\nThe team will also likely be a surprise to viewers. Often portrayed in pop culture as blonde, white, attractive girls, the students at Navarro come from a wide array of backgrounds. Several members are young men, whose strength is needed for all that throwing and catching, and many of these guys are gay men of color, often from low income or abusive backgrounds. They turn to cheerleading for escape and community, and they come to Navarro for a chance at a better life and a chance at winning.\\n\\nFar from being a clique of popular kids who bully others, the cheer team is inclusive, welcoming the five main students into the fold. Lexi has anger management problems and served time in jail; LaDarius survived sexual abuse; Jerry was homeless and lost his mother; Morgan was abandoned by both her father and mother; and Gabi, whose cheer career has turned her into a social media influencer, appears to be unwittingly used by her greedy parents. And yet they all find common ground on mat, the cheerleading parlance for being in the competition group.\\n\\nBut the moves and stunts required to be competitive at a national level are startlingly dangerous, and the number of injuries caught on film in just one school year is horrifying. While Coach Aldama appears a maternal figure to these kids, she also pushes them to risk their bodies for her goal, demanding they train while injured: It's pain for glory. It's disturbing to watch and prompts questions about just how many rules and regulations govern the sport and how many more there should be.\\n\\nThe athletes speak disdainfully of the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders or the Laker Girls, noting that so-called professional cheerleading is not nearly as difficult or athletic. For the Navarro kids, competing at the national competition in Daytona Beach, Florida, is as good as life gets.\\n\\nDirector Greg Whiteley crafts the narrative in a way that makes the audience feel intimately involved in their lives. When the cheerleading championships are over, the more pressing concern is what's next for the students who have spent most of their time and energy pursuing a sport with few job prospects.\\n\\nMore concerning than athletes at a traditional university who don't pursue pro sports, the documentary shows the Navarro students at a loss for next steps after cheering is over, armed only with associates degrees from the junior college. Some move on to four-year schools or get jobs right away, but when Cheer rolls its final credits, some are still lacking a path.\\n\\nCheer lures viewers in with the traditional hallmarks of a sports story: A group of scrappy underdogs, a rousing coach and stunning displays of physical prowess. But what makes it worth devouring in a single sitting is how much deeper it goes than just celebrating athletics. It asks questions about who deserves to be on mat, and how much pain is worth a trophy that, in the end, doesn't mean much of anything.\\n\\nIt may not be much to cheer about, but it might make you rethink pep rallies."}
{"original": "Jonathan Turley\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nI hate federal commissions. I have always hated federal commissions. Federal commissions are Washington's way of managing scandals. They work like placebos for political fevers, convincing voters that answers and change are on the way. That is why it is so difficult for me to utter these words: We need a federal election commission. Not the one proposed by some Senate Republicans. And not like past placebo commissions. An honest-to-God, no-holds-barred federal commission to look into the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nWith the challenge to the certification of election votes, some Republican members of Congress are calling to delay the proceedings for 10 days and impanel a commission to audit the results. There is precedent for such a commission. Just not good precedent. Indeed, citing the Electoral Commission of 1877 as a model of good constitutional process is like citing the Titanic as a model of good maritime navigation. The commission was an utter disaster.\\n\\nThe 1876 election commission\\n\\nThe commission was formed after the contested 1876 presidential election of Democrat Samuel Tilden and Rutherford Hayes. Tilden won the popular vote and was just one vote short of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. The election was marred by open fraud, including South Carolina certifying a vote of 101% of the eligible voters.\\n\\nAs a compromise, the commission was formed and consisted of 15 members: five Supreme Court justices and five members from each chamber of Congress. The key was that it was supposed to be composed of seven Democrats, seven Republicans and one independent. However, in a move that seemed calculated to secure his vote for Tilden, the Illinois legislature then moved to appoint the independent, Justice David Davis, to the Senate. If they wanted to buy his vote, it was a colossal failure when Davis decided to take the seat and leave the commission. He was replaced by a Republican, and the commission voted along strictly partisan lines to install Hayes, not Tilden.\\n\\nIn many ways, the Electoral Commission was a model for most federal commissions, which are designed for good politics and not good government.\\n\\nAn example is the 9/11 Commission, which was stacked with reliable allies to guarantee that no one — and no party — would be blamed for the negligence leading to up to the attacks.\\n\\nThe commission spent two years and millions of dollars. It went to almost a dozen countries, interviewed more than 1,000 people and archived over 2.5 million pages of documents. The result was a report that blamed no one specifically and since concluded that Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were not well served, in the words of the commission's chairman, by the FBI and CIA.\\n\\nYou see, if everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. Despite showing that the attacks could have been prevented under existing laws and powers, the budgets and powers of both agencies were then massively increased.\\n\\nThat is not what we need. There are three reasons why the need for a real commission is needed:\\n\\n►First, and most important, this was an unprecedented election in the reliance of mail-in voting and the use of new voting systems and procedures. We need to review how that worked down to the smallest precincts and hamlets.\\n\\n►Second, possibly tens of millions of voters believe that this election was rigged and stolen. I am not one of them. However, the integrity of our elections depends on the faith of the electorate.\\n\\nRoughly 40% of that electorate have lingering doubts about whether their votes actually matter. Most of the cases challenging the election were not decided on the merits. Indeed, it seems they haven't even been allowed for discovery. Instead, they were largely dismissed on jurisdictional or standing groups or under the laches doctrine that they were brought too late. Those allegations need to be conclusively proven or disproven in the interests of the country.\\n\\nElections 2020:Liberal and conservative teach the 2020 election. Together. On Zoom. What could go wrong?\\n\\n►Third, there were problems. There was not proof of systemic fraud or irregularities, but there were problems of uncounted votes, loss of key custodial information and key differences in the rules governing voting and tabulations.\\n\\nWe have spent billions to achieve greater security and reliability after prior election controversies. Indeed, we had a prior election commission that failed to achieve those fundamental goals.\\n\\nThe importance of having a commission\\n\\nA real commission will take a couple years to fully address these allegations. It will be meaningless if it's stacked by the same reliable political cutouts used historically in federal commissions. It should be formed on a commitment of absolute transparency with public hearings and public archiving of underlying material before the issuance of any final report. That way, the public at large can analyze and contribute to the review of this evidence.\\n\\nThere is one other task for Congress. It should rescind and replace the Electoral Count Act passed after the Hayes-Tilden election. It is one of the worst conceived and crafted federal laws on the books. The constitutionality of that act has long been challenged, including some who argue that Congress has nothing but a purely ceremonial role in opening state certifications and counting them.\\n\\nCourts are likely to recognize that Congress has a more substantive role, particularly when rivaling sets of electors are presented or there is clear evidence of fraud. However, the validity of such electoral votes should be left largely to the courts in challenges in the given states. That is why the current challenge is unwarranted. There is no serious basis to challenge the validity of the electoral votes certified by the states.\\n\\nReality check for Trump's fantasies:Judges aren't his pawns on election lawsuits.\\n\\nThe main challenge, however, remains the same: Whether Congress can appoint a real federal commission without rigging the result by appointing partisan members. In 1877, to quote from a speech of Ohio Sen. Allen Granberry Thurman, It was perfectly clear that any bill that gave the least advantage, ay, the weight of the dust in the balance, to either party, could not become the law of the land.\\n\\nNothing has changed. The stakes are too high to allow even a dust particle to tip the difference on the ultimate findings. The dust-free option requires a dependent, not independent, commission. Otherwise, the public will be the loser.\\n\\nSo, let's have a commission, but let's make it a real one.\\n\\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University and a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors.

{"original": "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - Giants general manager Dave Gettleman certainly did not commit to Eli Manning as the team's starting quarterback for 2019 and beyond.\\n\\nWhat Gettleman also did not do is say farewell to Manning, who has essentially held a firm grip on the job for the last 15 seasons.\\n\\nThat's just it with what Gettleman told a room full of reporters inside the Giants' auditorium during his season-ending news conference Wednesday: he left the door open to any and all possibilities, and not just with Manning, but just about everything else as the 67-year-old executive continues on his quest to return the franchise to its winning ways.\\n\\nThe Giants finished 5-11, the fourth time in the last five seasons they had double-digit losses. When Gettleman and head coach Pat Shurmur took over a year ago, they promised to own the 3-13 campaign, even though Jerry Reese and Ben McAdoo - fired in December 2017 - were responsible for the losing that came before their arrival.\\n\\nWhat the Giants have been since then - well, that's on Gettleman, Shurmur and the rest who are still here, still promising to turn this team around.\\n\\nI always hate the word rebuild. I don't ever like it, Gettleman said Wednesday. You just keep going, you just keep building. That's really what we're doing here. We're doing our best to accumulate the talent that fits our schemes and understands how to play the game. That's what it really is about. And we're going to continue and get it right. We're gonna fix it. We're gonna fix it.\\n\\nMore:NFL mock draft 2019: Where does top QB Dwayne Haskins land in first round?\\n\\nHere are five takeaways on the issues Gettleman addressed:\\n\\nEli Manning's uncertain future\\n\\nManning met with Gettleman on Monday and the two shared a no holds barred and what the latter referred to as a very honest and up-front conversation, presumably about the direction the Giants will head at the position moving forward.\\n\\nNow, here's the thing: Gettleman later revealed in the news conference that it was Manning who requested the meeting - It wasn't like he was called to the principal's office - and the GM obliged.\\n\\nHe took me in the low post one on one, Gettleman said, adding: I'll keep what was said private between he and I. In terms of any question you're gonna ask me today, OK, just so you understand, we will do what's in the best interest of the New York football Giants. That's the way we've operated since I walked in the door and that's the way we will continue to operate. What we're trying to do here is build sustained success. That takes some brutal honesty and it takes some tough decisions.\\n\\nGiven the chance to commit to saying Manning would be the Giants quarterback in 2019, Gettleman refused to offer any substantial clarity either way.\\n\\nHere's what I'm committed to do: I'm committed to making the best decision in the interest of the New York football Giants, Gettleman added. That's what I'm committed to do. We're in the evaluation process. I know you guys want answers now but quite frankly I didn't come in yesterday. I've got to do what I do, which is get in my office and watch film. We will meet this week with the coaches and get their evaluations, we'll meet next week with pro personnel to get their evaluation, get their feelings on everything. That's our schedule. I will be watching film for the next who knows how long until my eyes bleed. That's what I do. My commitment is to make this team the best team it can be. If that happens to have Eli playing quarterback, it does.\\n\\nThe fact that Manning wanted to talk to Gettleman Monday and essentially called the meeting is reason to believe that there will be an ongoing exchange here of opinions.\\n\\nIt's not just the Giants evaluating Manning. After 15 seasons, it's very likely that Manning is evaluating the Giants and just how close they are to winning again.\\n\\nHere's what Archie Manning, Eli's father, told ESPN after Sunday's 36-35 loss to the Cowboys: If Eli is done playing, I'm fine with it. But if he comes back, the Giants have got to win. They can't go through another season like this.\\n\\nGettleman bristled when a reporter asked if he understood Archie Manning's point, saying: No. Because Archie didn't tell me.\\n\\nGettleman was clear that he believes Manning can still play to some extent, insisting that the two-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback who turns 38 on Thursday can still make all the throws. It's also pretty clear the Giants are weighing their options, as is Manning, considering the $23.3 million he is scheduled to make in the final year of his contract, the possibility that the team may look to restructure the deal to create salary cap space and the prospects that Gettleman brought up sustained success - which speaks to more than just a one-year commitment at the quarterback position.\\n\\nWhat happens next remains uncertain, but if the Giants are committed to exploring all options at quarterback - those include Manning for another year, a 2019 draft pick or a veteran free agent - it's safe to say will be very interesting.\\n\\nCommitment to Odell Beckham Jr.\\n\\nGettleman was as emphatic as he can be regarding speculation that the Giants may look to move on from star wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr.\\n\\nWe didn't sign him to trade him, if that's what you're asking, Gettleman said of Beckham, who finished with 77 catches for 1,052 yards and six touchdowns before missing the last four games of the season with a quad injury suffered when he was leg-whipped on the final play against the Eagles.\\n\\nBeckham signed a five-year extension worth up to $95 million with $60 million guaranteed in September.\\n\\nWhen a reporter followed up asking whether that meant Beckham would be with the Giants in 2019, Gettleman quipped: You heard what I said.\\n\\nCould things change? Of course. The NFL is like that. But the Giants are a better team with Beckham than without him, and they believe that.\\n\\nNo regrets on Saquon Barkley\\n\\nGettleman was again adamant about how he does not second-guess the decision to draft Saquon Barkley with the second overall draft pick last spring, thus bypassing on the chance to draft a quarterback, whether it was Sam Darnold, who went to the Jets one pick later, or anyone else.\\n\\nI respond to it by saying, you have to take the best player available, Gettleman said. If you are reaching, you're going to get into trouble. Us taking Saquon was not a referendum on the quarterbacks, it was a referendum on Saquon. On the player he is and the person he is. If I was in that situation 100 times, I would draft him 100 times.\\n\\nConfidence in Pat Shurmur\\n\\nEight teams are currently in the beginning stages of a coaching search.\\n\\nThe Giants went through the cycle twice in the last three years, but Gettleman expressed confidence that team brass picked the right coach in Pat Shurmur last January.\\n\\nIf anything [watching Shurmur coach this season] reinforced my feeling about him a year ago when we went through the interview process, Gettleman said. It was the steadiness, it was the message, it was… We were 1-7 and we had two practices during the bye week that, it just was kind of amazing. ... There is no doubt in my mind he's the right guy.\\n\\nExpect defensive upgrades\\n\\nThere will be changes offensively, that's to be expected, but Gettleman did not skirt the issue that defensive coordinator James Bettcher was somewhat shorthanded in 2018.\\n\\nThat's what makes Gettleman's point about not forcing a quarterback in the draft stand out, especially with the Class of 2019 featuring so much talent, especially in the front 7.\\n\\nThat's why you're 5-11. We've got to continue to improve, Gettleman said. It's tough, it's not easy to win games when you do not have playmakers. We need to improve the defense, guys. Just like I looked you right in the eye last year and told you we got to fix this O-line. We've got to get better on the defensive side.\\n\\nEmail: stapleton@northjersey.com"}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump touted his decision to order the killing of Qasem Soleimani at a campaign rally in Ohio on Thursday, describing the Iranian general as a sadistic mass murderer and signaling the confrontation will play into his reelection campaign.\\n\\nDays after a crisis with Iran threatened to upend his presidency and drag the U.S. into another Middle East war, Trump spoke at length about what he described as bold and decisive action to deliver American justice via a U.S. drone strike near the Baghdad International Airport that killed Soleimani last week.\\n\\nHe was looking very seriously at our embassies, Trump said. We stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.\\n\\nThe rally – Trump'sfirst of 2020 –provided the president a venue to explain the latest developments in the Middle East and the perilous relationship between the U.S. and Iran to his supporters. Trump's extensive remarks on Iran suggested he will use the strike on Soleimani to laud his foreign policy to voters inthis year's election.\\n\\nTrump touched on the Iranian response to Soleimani's death, saying the U.S. was ready to go if Iran's rocket attack inflicted additional damage or resulted in the death of U.S. soldiers stationed on the two Iraqi bases that were targeted. Trump said Iran hit us with 16 missiles but thathe decided to stand down after he saw the relatively minor impact, which he attributed to a pretty good warning system.\\n\\nSo we didn't do anything...Not that I wanted to, but we were ready he said. You have no idea.Lot of people got very lucky.\\n\\nWar powers:House votes to limit Trump's ability to wage war with Iran after Soleimani\\n\\nThe crowd roared as Trump discussed the strike and blasted Democrats for attempting to curb his ability to launch strikes against Iran. Trump's rally came hours after the Democratic-led House passed a resolution aimed at limiting his war powers. Democrats have criticized Trump for not consulting Congress on the Soleimani strike and have accused him of recklessness.\\n\\nWe got a call. We heard where he was, Trump said. And we had to make a decision. We didn't have time to call up Nancy [Pelosi], who is not operating with a full deck.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the strike against Soleimani Republicans embraced the move and praised Trump for taking action against a country that has been widely perceived as a bad actor in the Middle East. But the president can't necessarily count on the issue unifying American voters ahead of the election.\\n\\nAmericans by more than 2-1 said the killing of Soleimani has made the United States less safe, a nationwide USA TODAY/Ipsos Poll found Thursday. A majority of those surveyed, by 52%-34%, called Trump's behavior with Iran reckless.\\n\\nMore:Americans say Soleimani's killing made US less safe, Trump 'reckless' on Iran\\n\\nAmericans were divided on the wisdom of the drone strike at the Baghdad airport that killed Soleimani and others: 42% supported it, 33% opposed it; 25% said they didn't know what to think. Republicans were much more supportive than Democrats; independents were almost evenly split.\\n\\nWe seek friends, not enemies, Trump told the rally audience.\\n\\nBut, he added, if you dare to threaten our citizens, you do so at your own grave peril.\\n\\nMinutes after Trump took the stage his remarks were interrupted by protesters holding a banner that read: NO WAR.\\n\\nThe Toledo rally is one of three Trump has scheduled this month. The others are set for Wisconsin, a critical state for his reelection effort, and New Jersey. It was his first major political event since the confrontation with Iran escalated.\\n\\nTrump has raised Iran at virtually every political rally he has hosted since entering the White House in 2017. His remarks on one of Washington's most challenging foes in the Middle East have generally focused on the 2015 multi-national nuclear agreement that offered sanctions relief in exchange for Iran curbing its nuclear program.\\n\\nTrump pulled the U.S. out of that agreement in 2018, arguing it did not do enough to curb Iran's nuclear ambitions.\\n\\nIran and the U.S. bothmoved Wednesday to deescalate the confrontation. Trump largely avoided saber-rattling during a nine-minute address to the nation and even suggested the possibility of a diplomatic resolution to the crisis. Iranian leaders, including foreign minister Javad Zarif described the attack as self-defense.\\n\\nIran crash:Trump says he thinks 'something very terrible happened' to Ukraine jet\\n\\nTrump address:Trump, Tehran step back from war footing after Iran's attack in Iraq\\n\\nTrump faced a similar test in 2017 as his rhetoric over North Korea began to boil. Trump held an Arizona rally at the end of August just weeks after he threatened to rain fire and fury on North Korea. Trump raised the issue at that rally, though his remarks were overshadowed by his comments about the violence in Charlottesville, Va.\\n\\nWhat I said, that's not strong enough, Trump said, referring to his fire and fury tweet. Some people said it's too strong; it's not strong enough. But Kim Jong Un, I respect the fact that I believe he is starting to respect us. I respect that fact very much.\\n\\nThe rally in Ohio also comes as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is poised to send impeachment articles to the Senate, which will determine whether to remove Trump from office. Pelosi said Thursday that she would transmit those articles soon. The Republican-led Senate is expected to acquit Trump on the charges of abusing his power and obstructing the congressional probe into his interactions with Ukraine.\\n\\nTrump slammed Pelosi and other Democrats for pursuing the impeachment, arguing that the House speaker is not playing with a full deck.\\n\\nMore:Pelosi says she'll send Senate articles of impeachment against Trump 'soon'\\n\\nMore:Trump says environmental policy change would fix 'regulatory nightmare'\\n\\nTrump carried Ohio in the 2016 election with nearly 52% of the vote. By rallying in Toledo he can also draw from supporters in nearby Michigan, which he won narrowly.\\n\\nContributing: Susan Page, Nicholas Wu, Christal Hayes"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nLAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) — The Chicago Bears might be ready to split with quarterback Jay Cutler.\\n\\nTop receiver Alshon Jeffery's future is in question. Change could be coming to the coaching staff, too.\\n\\nThe Bears have a big task ahead of them after finishing their worst season in decades last in the NFC North with a 3-13 record. They got shredded by injuries, suspensions and poor play overall.\\n\\nNow, it's time to regroup.\\n\\nIt was all bad, linebacker Pernell McPhee said. I'm happy we're out of 2016.\\n\\nThe Bears are 9-23 in two seasons under John Fox, and they just posted their lowest win total in a non-strike year since the 1973 team went 3-11.\\n\\nIt didn't help that 19 players finished the season on injured reserve, including Cutler and guard Kyle Long. Jeffery and linebacker Jerrell Freeman also served four-game suspensions for violating the league's policy on performance-enhancing drugs.\\n\\nIt added up to the Bears finishing with their highest loss total since 1969 and missing the playoffs for the ninth time in 10 years.\\n\\nI want to go to the playoffs, Long said. I want to have 10 wins before we get to the playoffs and have an opportunity to have home-field advantage. A frickin' playoff game in Chicago — can you imagine that?\\n\\nIt hasn't happened since the 2010 team lost to Green Bay in the NFC title game. The Bears enter this offseason with the No. 3 pick in the draft and some big issues to address on their roster.\\n\\nWHO'S THE QB?: The biggest question facing the Bears? That's easy.\\n\\nThe Bears' all-time leading passer, Cutler has no guaranteed money left on the seven-year contract extension he signed in 2014. At 33, he was limited to five games because of a thumb injury and then a torn right labrum that led to him being placed on injured reserve.\\n\\nThen again, the Bears have no logical long-term replacement on the roster. That's an issue they need to address, whether they keep Cutler or bring in another veteran.\\n\\nJEFFERY'S FUTURE: Though it's not clear if he will still be with them, Jeffery guaranteed a Super Bowl championship for the Bears next year. He even compared them to the New England Patriots.\\n\\nWe're just like them, the only difference is just a few plays here and there, he said.\\n\\nJeffery played for the $14.6 million franchise tag this season. The Bears could tag him again if they don't agree to a multiyear deal, though that would be an expensive option to use on a receiver with a PED suspension and a history of injuries.\\n\\nIt would be easier to part with Jeffery if the Bears knew what they had in Kevin White, the No. 7 overall pick in 2015. But he was limited to four games because of a fractured left fibula after missing his rookie year with a stress fracture in his left shin.\\n\\nI'll be just fine, said White, who hasn't started running. Just about getting my mobility back, getting my strength back.\\n\\nON STAFF: While Fox said last week he wasn't planning to make changes to his staff, he didn't quite slam the door on it, either.\\n\\nMaybe he and general manager Ryan Pace will provide more clarity on the status of defensive coordinator Vic Fangio and offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains when they meet with the media on Wednesday.\\n\\nThere was a report of friction between Fangio and Fox a few weeks ago. Fangio might also get interviews for head coaching jobs.\\n\\nLoggains came under scrutiny in his first season as Chicago's offensive coordinator.\\n\\nGETTING HEALTHY: The Bears might need to determine if the organization can do anything to prevent another rash of injuries.\\n\\nCutler, Long, White, nose tackle Eddie Goldman and linebackers Lamarr Houston and Danny Trevathan all wound up on IR. Other important players shuffled in and out of the lineup because of injuries.\\n\\nI think I'm just going to put those packing peanuts and bubble wrap all over myself next year, said Long, who is recovering from ankle surgery and will undergo a less invasive shoulder operation. I'm going to look like the Christmas Story kid. It'll be summer months, I'll be in like three North Face (jackets). But, yeah, honestly, it's football. It's a tortured existence from a physical standpoint.\\n\\nBUILDING BLOCKS: There were some bright spots for the Bears.\\n\\nLinebacker Leonard Floyd showed promise with seven sacks after being drafted No. 9 overall, though he did suffer two concussions late in the season.\\n\\nJordan Howard broke Matt Forte's franchise rookie rushing record with 1,313 yards. Rookie Cody Whitehair looks as though he has a home at center.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
{"original": "WASHINGTON, D.C. - Coming off a lackluster performance on Friday night against the Toronto Raptors, the Milwaukee Bucks really wanted to get that defeat out of their memories and replace it with a victory on Saturday night.\\n\\nFacing the Washington Wizards in an arena where they hadn't won since Dec. 6, 2013, the Bucks got off to a slow start and found themselves in an 11-point hole before ratcheting up the intensity that had been lacking the night before. Milwaukee's urgency had almost a playoff feel, as coach Jason Kidd kept his rotation to just eight players, riding his most-trusted guys for big minutes.\\n\\nThose players answered the bell, making clutch plays down the stretch and staving off fatigue on the second night of a back-to-back to claim a 110-103 victory at Capital One Arena.\\n\\nWe definitely wanted this win; it's a big win for us, Giannis Antetokounmpo said. We just have to play hard. Yesterday we didn't play as we wanted and we just wanted to come and set a tone tonight and try to get a win.\\n\\nAntetokounmpo's desire for the victory was obvious through his play. He led Milwaukee's charge, scoring 21 of his team-high 34 points in the second half while playing nearly 21 of his 40 minutes after intermission.\\n\\nRELATED:Bucks to waive Liggins, add Munford on two-way deal\\n\\nRELATED: Dellavedova draws Wizards' ire with hard foul that earns ejection\\n\\nBOX SCORE:Bucks 110, Wizards 103\\n\\nNBA:Live scoreboard, standings, stats\\n\\nAntetokounmpo navigated the Bucks through a tight third quarter with 13 points then stayed on the court for the fourth — serving as Milwaukee's center for the opening six minutes of the period. During that time, he anchored the Bucks' interior defense and helped turn a six-point deficit into a tie game with just over six minutes remaining.\\n\\nCoach Kidd told me, 'You're going to play minutes tonight,' and I was like, 'OK. I love playing basketball,' Antetokounmpo said. Everybody's fatigued, but you've got to fight. You've got to go out there, fight and do your job every night. That's what I'm trying to do for my team.\\n\\nBut with 6:18 remaining and the game tied, Antetokounmpo went to the bench for the first time in the second half. John Henson had already gone to the scorer's table to replace him, and quickly had to come in after Antetokounmpo was whistled for his fifth foul on a push-off.\\n\\nThe Wizards built a 99-96 lead before Kidd called timeout with 3:01 remaing to give his team a breather and get Antetokounmpo back into the game.\\n\\nI just got to be smarter, but I've still got to have a killer instinct and try to make plays — that can be shots for me or shots for my teammates, Antetokounmpo said of his mentality upon returning to the game. Just trying to get it done and try to get a W.\\n\\nThe Bucks, which had scuffled without their star on the court, scored on their final eight possessions.\\n\\nEric Bledsoe kicked off a 6-0 run with a pair of free throws then it Antetokounmpo for a running layup. Antetokounmpo then nailed a turnaround baseline fadeaway to put the Bucks up three before Washington's Bradley Beal sank a pair of free throws to make it a one-point game with 94 seconds left.\\n\\nAt the other end, Bledsoe kept his hot streak going, jabbing behind the three-point line before hoisting a trey that connected to coax a timeout from the Wizards bench. Bledsoe then got foul while making a strong rebound but only made one of two free throws. Beal again responded, this time with a layup, before Antetokounmpo knocked down a 21-footer with 36.2 seconds left to put the Bucks up five.\\n\\nTony Snell, who was moved out of the starting lineup in favor of Malcolm Brogdon, then blocked Beal's jumper at the other end and Khris Middleton sealed the victory with a pair of free throws.\\n\\nAntetokounmpo finished with 12 rebounds and seven assists in 40 minutes to go with his 34 points, marking the 28th straight game he's scored 20-plus. Bledsoe added 21, looming large late in each half as he sparked a 14-4 run to help tie the game going into halftime. Middleton finished with 20 points in a team-high 42 minutes.\\n\\nAs a team, the Bucks held the Wizards, which were playing without starting forward Otto Porter due to a right hip strain, to just 5 of 19 shooting in the final frame. John Wall finished with 16 points and 16 assists in the losing effort while Beal had 20 points.\\n\\nIn the end, though, one team had Antetokounmpo and the other didn't.\\n\\nGiannis was Giannis tonight and I think taking another step towards feeling comfortable down the stretch, Kidd said. Having the ball. Making plays. Finding a way to score the ball. But defensively is the way that we won the game. Again, on the back-to-back, understand what happened last night and putting that behind us and trying to find a way. I thought the guys did a good job of taking the three out late in the game.\\n\\nBEHIND THE BOX SCORE\\n\\nRoster move: The Bucks will waive guard DeAndre Liggins on Sunday, according to a league source. The decision was shared with Liggins at halftime and confirmed by the 29-year-old guard after the game.\\n\\nMilwaukee's decision comes as Sunday marks the deadline for teams to cut players on non-guaranteed deals before those salaries become locked in for the rest of the season.\\n\\nLiggins, who the Bucks claimed off waivers following training camp, is on a minimum, non-guaranteed deal. He played in 31 games, averaging 1.8 points and 1.6 rebounds in 15.5 minutes per appearance.\\n\\nChange up: Bucks coach Jason Kidd altered his starting lineup on Saturday for the first time in six games, inserting Malcolm Brogdon for Tony Snell.\\n\\nThe change moved Snell, who had been in a bit of a rut over the past three games, out in favor of Brogdon, who has been a steady presence off the bench. Kidd addressed Snell's recent issues — shooting 4 of 16 over the past three games and being reticent to put up threes — following Friday's loss to the Toronto Raptors.\\n\\nI think Tony's got to get back to being Tony — catch-and-shoot, knocking down the three and defending, Kidd said, noting on Saturday that the Bucks brought him off the bench in Utah and had positive results.\\n\\nRight now he's not playing the way that we want him to in the sense of being aggressive. He's looking to drive the ball a little bit to try to make a play for a teammate. Hopefully we can get him back on track.\\n\\nSnell ultimately played 32 minutes and closed the game, scoring 10 points and blocking a late shot by Beal to help secure the win. Brogdon had 10 points and nine rebounds in 32 minutes.\\n\\nUP NEXT\\n\\nTeams: Milwaukee Bucks (21-17) at Indiana Pacers (20-19).\\n\\nWhen: 6 p.m. Monday.\\n\\nWhere: Bankers Life Fieldhouse.\\n\\nAbout the Pacers: The Bucks and Pacers squared off on Wednesday at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, with Milwaukee running away with a 122-101 win. Indiana was without star guard Victor Oladipo in that game, its fifth loss in a row and fourth with Oladipo sidelined by a knee injury. When the Bucks and Pacers meet again, Oladipo will be on the court and on Saturday night proved how much of a difference he makes. Oladipo put up a team-high 23 points to go with nine assists, six rebounds and five steals in just 24 minutes as the Pacers stomped the Chicago Bulls, 125-86, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse."}
{"original": "Rafael René Díaz Torres\\n\\nReport for America\\n\\nSAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Women from multiple generations walked together late last year down trafficked avenues flanked by government buildings with a view of the Atlantic Ocean.\\n\\nSome held their daughters' hands; others held signs reading, Peace for all women and Justice, respect and equity. They joined others, many wearing purple as a symbol of resistance against patriarchy, transforming the marchers into a single color wave that descended onto San Juan. They chanted to demand a tally of how many women must be killed to cause an official acknowledgement, and reaction.\\n\\nIt was warm on the afternoon of Nov. 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, and the group, mostly female, marched for about 6 miles under the banner of Mujeres en marcha — Women on the march. For years, Puerto Rican feminist groups have loudly denounced what they view as the government's inaction in addressing endemic gender violence. They demand the government declare a state of emergency in response to some of the highest rates of femicide in the United States and its territories.\\n\\nMonths earlier, Ricardo Rossello resigned as governor of the island after 889 pages of private chat were leaked to Centro de Periodismo Investigativo, where I work, exposing his administration's misogynistic, homophobic and classist mentality, igniting public outrage.\\n\\nDespite the swearing in of a new female governor, Wanda Vazquez, many Puerto Ricans see her government as more of the same, especially regarding the crippling austerity measures designed to minimize Puerto Rico's $70 billion public debt, which was aggravated when financial institutions and investment houses helped structure the island's bonds with high interest rates.\\n\\nVazquez's administration has also failed to declare the requested state of emergency.\\n\\nWomen take back their streets\\n\\nA woman was killed every week in Puerto Rico between 2014 and 2018, around when the protests began, according to a recent study conducted by two Puerto Rican public interest organizations.\\n\\nThese women-led protests are a continuation of the political rallies from last summer, when Puerto Ricans rallied on the streets in front of the governor's house to demand Rossello's resignation and transparency from their government.\\n\\nDuring this period, democratic participation was strengthened by reclaiming public spaces throughout the island. In one July rally, for example, an estimated 500,000 people shut down one of the most important highways in San Juan for the March of the People — the largest public rally in recent Puerto Rican history.\\n\\nThe rules have been written for Puerto Ricans, not by them:Former Gov. Ricardo Rossello isn't the only weight on Puerto Rico\\n\\nThe November rally began on La Milla de Oro (The Golden Mile), Puerto Rico's financial district and where the island's most powerful banks and the federal Financial Oversight and Management Board, known as La Junta, are headquartered. These institutions and people affiliated with them are implicated in the corrupt management of Puerto Rico's public debt.\\n\\nIn discussing the economic crisis on the island, some of the women on the march told me that because they don't own the debt, so they won't pay for it. To them, the austerity measures imposed by both the Puerto Rico state government and the U.S. government-created bodies to address the economic crisis — just like the closing of more than 400 schools and the increased precariousness of health services — are a further act of mistreatment and marginalization, a continuation of the violence against women and other vulnerable groups on the island.\\n\\nAs they walked toward the governor's house in Old San Juan, the protesters paid tribute to past victims of gender violence — women targeted, abused and killed by strangers or their own partners.\\n\\nPolitical destruction doesn't happen all at once:Venezuela was my home, and socialism destroyed it. Slowly, it will destroy America, too.\\n\\nThe march also questioned the discourse that punishes women for walking the streets at night.\\n\\nIn 2015, Puerto Rican singer Ivania Zayas was killed in a hit-and-run. A state investigator blamed her for walking alone at night. That kind of mentality restricts basic freedom and fails to blame the actual perpetrators of the violence, the sociocultural oppression they operate within and the lack of protections for women against that oppression. In a march of solidarity, the protesters are attempting to reclaim these streets.\\n\\nMinutes after sunset, the protesters arrived near the Dos Hermanos bridge. The smell of fire from their torches drifted, interrupting the usual calm of Paseo Caribe, a high-profile commercial and residential district. The familiar sound of the Atlantic's tide was replaced by political chants and music.\\n\\nThe girls of our land want to be free to play, sang Plena Combativa, a feminist group that performs folk music with lyrics that challenge patriarchy and gender violence, while also promoting the empowerment of women.\\n\\nMembers of the feminist organizations that led the Mujeres en marcha told me they were planning more rallies. Understandably, many citizens in Puerto Rico don't want to wait until Election Day to have a say in politics.\\n\\nRafael René Díaz Torres is a Report for America corps member, covering government and public financial matters for the Centro de Periodismo Investigativo in Puerto Rico.

{"original": "AP\\n\\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) — Alabama's Irv Smith Jr. was determined to be a wide receiver in high school.\\n\\nNever mind that he's the son and nephew of former NFL tight ends and is built for that position, too.\\n\\nHe caved to the reality his junior year at Brother Martin High School in New Orleans and moved to the family's favored position fulltime. Now, he has become a dangerous option for the Crimson Tide as both a pass catcher and blocker heading into Monday night's national championship game against Clemson in Santa Clara, California.\\n\\nHe finally realized that you don't have to be a wide receiver to get a lot of glory, said Irv Smith Sr., a former first-round draft pick by the New Orleans Saints.\\n\\nIt took two years of high school for the 6-foot-4, 241-pound Smith to fully embrace life as a blocking/catching tight end, and two more at Alabama before he started getting any recognition.\\n\\nSmith, whose uncle Edward played for three NFL teams from 1997-99, has emerged from O.J. Howard's shadow.\\n\\nHe has been a beneficiary of a more explosive, pass-oriented Alabama offense led by quarterback Tua Tagovailoa and coordinator Mike Locksley .\\n\\nSmith went from 14 catches last season to 40 for 667 yards and seven touchdowns as a senior. Even Howard, who became a first-round draft pick, never matched those numbers.\\n\\nBut Howard's performances against Clemson will be awfully hard to top. He caught a 68-yard touchdown pass in a title game loss, and more than topped that a year later.\\n\\nHoward had 208 receiving yards — including touchdowns of 53 and 51 yards — in a 45-40 win on Jan. 9, 2017 while Smith watched as a freshman reserve.\\n\\nHe made a bunch of plays in those games, Smith said of Howard's performances. It's motivating for me as well because I obviously want to come out and have a big game. It was awesome seeing him do that.\\n\\nI was behind him so obviously I was cool with seeing that. I feel like it's my turn now.\\n\\nIn case Locksley has forgotten about Howard's success against Clemson, Smith joked that I'm going to definitely talk to him, for sure.\\n\\nSmith had stretches this season where he caught touchdown passes in four straight games and also had 50-plus receiving yards four times in a row at one point.\\n\\nHe scored on a 76-yard touchdown on Alabama's first play against Arkansas.\\n\\nSmith certainly has had far more balls thrown his way this season. But his father has also seen him improve in leaps and bounds each season in Tuscaloosa. The younger Smith didn't have a catch in nine games as a freshman, when his father said his movements on the field were stiff and robotic as he tried to get acclimated to a different level of football.\\n\\nThat started to change last season when he was more fluid and comfortable and showed his progress with a pancake block in the opener against Florida State.\\n\\nAnd this year he's a whole different player, Irv Sr. said.\\n\\nThe Alabama tight end knew he had a chance to get targeted with Locksley emphasizing he wanted to get more playmakers involved .\\n\\nTide defenders who have faced him in practice aren't surprised, either.\\n\\nHe's big like a tight end but he has skills like a receiver, middle linebacker Mack Wilson said. He's fast. He runs precise routes.\\n\\nAnd now Smith gets a chance to try to make an impact in the national title game. He didn't have a catch in last season's championship matchup with Georgia.\\n\\nNo one is predicting a 200-yard performance like Howard's. Irv Sr., who was used mostly as a blocker at Notre Dame, knows for tight ends that kind of performance, only happens once in a lifetime.\\n\\nHis son has more modest expectations though Irv Sr. said, He definitely wants to ... have a great game.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/tag/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – The president addressed the nation Wednesday from the White House after more than a dozen Iranian missiles struck Iraqi military bases housing U.S. and coalition troops late Tuesday night.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump said no Iraqis or Americans were hurt in the attacks, and he signaled the United States is open to negotiations and a de-escalation of tensions with Iran.\\n\\nThe attacks were Iran's response to the U.S.-ordered airstrike that killed its top military leader, Qasem Soleimani, late last week. The Defense Department said the strike was a preventive action to stop imminent plans to attack U.S. personnel in the region.\\n\\nUS will impose new sanctions on Iran\\n\\nTrump said Iran would not be permitted to have a nuclear weapon.\\n\\nAs we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime, Trump said. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior.\\n\\nHe accused Iran of a terror spree in other Middle East countries, and said, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked strike on Saudi Arabia and shot down two U.S. drones.\\n\\nIran has demanded a lifting of U.S. sanctions.\\n\\nRead Trump's full speech:'Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear weapon'\\n\\n'Ready to embrace peace with all who seek it'\\n\\nThe president signaled he was open to negotiations with Iran.

Iran responded that it had already negotiated a deal that the United States abandoned.\\n\\nIran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world, Trump said Wednesday.\\n\\nHe said Iran must change its behavior and expressed hope that U.S. economic and military deterrents would motivate Iran to cooperate. He touted the weight of the U.S. military: Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal and fast.

American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent.\\n\\nSpeaking to Iran's leaders, Trump said, We want you to have a future and a great future – one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home and harmony with the nations of the world.

It will not be allowed to go forward.\\n\\nHe repeatedly criticized the deal during his presidential race. He announced in 2018 that the United States was pulling out of the agreement, and he implemented what he calls a maximum pressure campaign against Iran to curb its aggression.\\n\\nWe must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of its enormous untapped potential. Iran can be a great country, Trump said.\\n\\nTrump blames missile attack funding on Obama administration\\n\\nTrump linked U.S.-Iranian tensions, as well as Iran-backed aggression, to the nuclear deal negotiated during President Barack Obama's term.\\n\\nIran's hostilities substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. Instead of saying 'thank you' to the United States, they chanted, 'Death to America,'  Trump said.\\n\\nTrump has suggested that the Obama administration gave Iran billions in monetary aid, but the $150 billion Iran received was not a gift. After the nuclear agreement was signed, Iran was allowed to access its own frozen assets, which included the $150 billion, and additionally was paid back for a long-standing claim against the United States, which accounted for the $1.8 billion.\\n\\nMajor provocations occurred after Trump withdrew from the nuclear agreement, including the downing of a U.S. drone.\\n\\nFACT CHECK: Trump discusses escalation of tensions with Iran in televised speech\\n\\nTrump suggested that the missile attacks launched by Iran on Tuesday were funded by the same money.\\n\\nThe missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available by the last administration, he said.\\n\\nObama's national security adviser Susan Rice pushed back on Trump's claim in an interview with MSNBC: The fact is, that's another lie, she said.\\n\\nIran has had these sophisticated missiles, they've been developing their capacity for many, many years, she said.

{"original": "Dan Wolken\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nCLEMSON, S.C. — Though last year's College Football Playoff championship is largely remembered for its whirring momentum shifts, breathtaking offensive plays and star-making performances for the likes of Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson and Alabama tight end O.J. Howard, the game largely turned on two special teams plays.\\n\\nThe first has become part of Nick Saban's head coaching lore: An onside kick that Alabama recovered with the game tied, 24-24, allowing the Crimson Tide to regain control of a game on which Watson had begun to impose his will.\\n\\nBut the second might have been an even bigger play in Alabama's 45-40 victory: After Clemson had pulled within 31-27 on a field goal with 7:47 remaining, Kenyan Drake took the ensuing kickoff from the 5-yard line, angled to his left at the 20 and shuffled away from a tackle as he sped toward the far sideline, then escaped the grasp of kicker Greg Huegel near midfield as he broke free for a touchdown.\\n\\nThose two plays illustrated the fragile margin for error the Tigers faced against a more pedigreed championship program, and Clemson coach Dabo Swinney was not interested in leaving those often overlooked areas vulnerable ever again.\\n\\nSo Swinney ordered an analysis of Clemson's special teams from every angle after the Alabama game, scrubbing everything from its personnel to its coverage schemes. The results this season suggest a significant improvement for the Tigers, who vow not to let special teams mishaps sink their chances again when they get their rematch Monday night in Tampa.\\n\\nThey found a little weakness in our special teams, and they exposed it. That's what great teams will do to you, said receiver Artavis Scott, who also returns kickoffs. That's not going to be the reason they beat us this year, I can tell you that.\\n\\nThough Alabama's trouble converting field goals over the years receives a disproportionate amount of attention, the Crimson Tide are largely excellent on special teams because the depth of talent allows for Saban to employ several former five-star recruits — some of whom are a year away from being front-line players — on coverage teams. The Crimson Tide haven't yielded a kickoff return score since the 2014 season opener and only had two punts returned for touchdowns in the last four seasons. Meanwhile, over the same span, Alabama has scored 12 special teams touchdowns.\\n\\nThe Crimson Tide were able to exploit that advantage last year against Clemson, which ranked 115th in kickoff coverage defense and gave up three touchdowns, revealing the overall immaturity of Clemson's roster as a national contender.\\n\\nWe played a lot of freshmen (on special teams) last year, Swinney said. We have the right people doing the right things (now) and have done a better job as a staff and that's been part of it. I've measured it from week to week. We're much, much, much improved. That was a major goal for us.\\n\\nTo reach that goal, Swinney brought in outside analysts during the offseason to evaluate Clemson's approach and every aspect of its special teams. Punter Andy Teasdall and placekicker Huegel also spent part of the offseason working privately with former NFL kicker Dan Orner, who also tutored former Clemson kicker and current Arizona Cardinal Chandler Catanzaro.\\n\\nCoach Swinney wanted to go back and rebuild everything, Huegel said. We went back (to the basics) whether it's kickoff coverage or holding somebody up for punt returns, small things and breaking it down to be able to better the team and every single part individually.\\n\\nThe biggest change, though, may be the seriousness with which Clemson's players have taken their duty on the coverage teams. Both Huegel and Scott hinted that some players last year saw it as a pay-your-dues burden rather than a place to significantly impact the game, a lack of enthusiasm which led to some of the breakdowns.\\n\\nInstead, they pointed to players such as James Skalski, Chad Smith and Denzel Johnson as embracing the dirty work. Cornerback Trayvon Mullen and running back Tavien Feaster, two blue-chip recruits from Clemson's 2016 recruiting class, also have found roles.\\n\\nCoach Swinney has done a good job of saying if you're going to be a starter on offense or defense, you're going to be a starter on special teams, Teasdall said. They brought in some analysts and tweaked some stuff but honestly it just comes down to mentality of getting everyone on board and having everyone wanting to make a difference because we realize it can be the difference.\\n\\nSwinney: Clemson has 'more juice' this time vs. Alabama\\n\\nCollege Football Playoff title game: Two best teams, Alabama vs. Clemson\\n\\nClemson savors shot at Alabama: 'To be the best you have to beat the best'\\n\\nWhich conference was best, and worst, in the bowls?\\n\\nIt certainly was against Alabama last season, as Clemson basically played to a draw or better in every other area. In fact, at the time Saban called for the onside kick, it seemed like a rather desperate play to keep the ball out of Watson's hands — and it worked.\\n\\nWe felt like we had good control of the game right there, said Swinney, who also noted that Clemson's defense could have salvaged the situation by keeping Alabama out of the end zone. It was a big swing in momentum for sure, and it was disappointing.\\n\\nBut just like with so many other things that emerged from the championship game loss, Clemson used it to raise the bar for 2016. And now it's back with another opportunity to beat Alabama and show just how much it learned.\\n\\nI think we just put a lot of emphasis on (special teams), Scott said. Last year it wasn't as much. The biggest thing was we want people on there who actually want to be on there and make plays. That was the biggest thing to figure out who wants to be on there and make an impact. It's about want-to, wanting to do your job.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS: CLEMSON'S PATH TO THE TITLE GAME"}

LOUIS (AP) — Robert Bortuzzo got mad for the St. Louis Blues, and teammate Oskar Sundqvist got even with the Washington Capitals.\\n\\nAlex Ovechkin scored his 30th goal of the season but the Blues came back to beat the Capitals 5-2 on Thursday night after Sundqvist knocked in the go-ahead goal.\\n\\nOvechkin's first-period score snapped a six-game drought and tied him with Mike Gartner as the only players in NHL history to begin their careers with 14 straight 30-goal seasons. Gartner scored 30 or more in his first 15 seasons for Washington, the Minnesota North Stars, the New York Rangers and Toronto from 1979-94.\\n\\nHe's just an elite, elite scorer that we're so fortunate to have on our team and, jeez, the league is even fortunate just to have this type of a player that's a generational talent, Capitals coach Todd Reirden said. To score 30 again this year is quite an accomplishment after going through a long season last year, and he continues to get a year older but he still does the phenomenal things.\\n\\nOvechkin wasn't in a reflective mood following the loss.\\n\\nIt's nice to be in that company (with Gartner) but still a long way to go (in my career), he said.\\n\\nSundqvist's goal stood as the game-winner. Sundqvist missed the first eight games of the season with head and shoulder issues after a hit from Washington's Tom Wilson in a preseason game on Sept. 30.\\n\\nWilson ended up being suspended 14 games. Bortuzzo and Wilson got into a fight early in the second period.\\n\\nI don't know whether he expected it or not, Bortuzzo said. I think he would have done the same thing on his side and I'm sure a lot of guys would have stepped up in this locker room. I just happened to be the guy and it is what it is.\\n\\nAlex Pietrangelo had a goal and an assist for the Blues, who stopped a two-game skid. Colton Parayko, Robert Thomas and Tyler Bozak also scored, and Jake Allen made 23 saves.\\n\\nBrett Connolly scored for the Capitals, who had won five road games in a row. Braden Holtby had 37 saves but lost to St. Louis for the first time in his career (7-1-0).\\n\\nParayko's power-play goal tied it at 2 with 7:37 left in the second period. That ended an 0-for-21 slump with the man advantage on home ice for the Blues spanning seven games.\\n\\nWe just outworked them, especially in the offensive zone, Pietrangelo said. The penalty kill was good. The power play was good in the second period there. I think we simplified and started getting shots and all of sudden momentum started to change.\\n\\nSundqvist gave St. Louis a 3-2 lead with a diving sweep of a rebound off Pietrangelo's shot from the point with 3:27 remaining in the second.\\n\\nHe got the shot through and I saw the puck and the diving during the shot was more to be sure I would be first to the puck, Sundqvist said.\\n\\nPietrangelo and Bozak added insurance goals in the third.\\n\\nThomas deflected Bortuzzo's slap shot past Holtby at the four-minute mark of the first to give the Blues a 1-0 lead.\\n\\nAfter Ovechkin tied it, Connolly gave the Capitals a 2-1 advantage three minutes into the second, poking a rebound of his own shot past Allen.\\n\\nNOTES: Blues RW Vladimir Tarasenko (illness) did not play. ...

{"original": "If anyone understands how bear markets and plunging stock prices can upend a sense of calm and financial well-being, it's me.\\n\\nI've spent the past 19 years at USA TODAY reporting and writing about the unpredictable Dow Jones Industrial Average's good and bad days. And even though the Dow was rising and in a bull market for 15 of those years, the best lessons I learned about investing – and about myself and the way my brain and psyche react to violent market swings – came when stocks were going down.\\n\\nToday is my last day writing about Wall Street at USA TODAY after voluntarily accepting an early retirement package from the newspaper's parent, Gannett.\\n\\nIn my final column, I'll share what I've learned about the market and personal finance since my first day here.\\n\\nIn a two-decade run as a stock market reporter, the market has been my friend, but also an enemy.\\n\\nThe thousands of stocks that I have owned through mutual funds made me and my family a lot of money. Like millions of other Americans, I'm an individual investor with 401(k), IRA and 529 savings accounts whose fortunes rise and fall with the market. But the stock market has also periodically masqueraded as a thief, occasionally draining a sizable chunk of my hard-earned investment dollars from my account balances.\\n\\nMore Money:Dow closes up more than 700 points after blockbuster job report and Fed rate fears ease\\n\\nMore Money:Want great quality of life? These are the best cities to live in every state across US\\n\\nMore Money:Sears deadline expires: Will Eddie Lampert's last-minute offer avoid liquidation?\\n\\nI both revere and fear the stock market. It's a nature-like force whose movements are amplified by a mass herd mentality around the globe. The market, I've come to realize, is everyone, everywhere with a finger on the buy or sell button.\\n\\nIn good times, the market can make your financial dreams come true, like paying for college or saving enough to retire or amassing $1 million. But in bad times, it has the destructive power of a Category 5 hurricane that can test your faith in investing and make you second guess why you even invest in stocks. But I've learned that just as the sun reappears following the rain, winds and flooding from a big storm, so do the green arrows after a bad stretch on Wall Street.\\n\\nI started on March 20, 2000, which turned out to be 10 days after the market top that signaled the end of the 1990s bull run and coming dot-com stock bust. The Nasdaq plunged nearly 4 percent on my first day.\\n\\nI spent the next 19 months covering my first bear market and explaining to readers why stocks kept going down. Most of the blame was heaped on irrationally exuberant investors who had driven up fledgling and profit-starved internet stocks to sky-high valuations.\\n\\nI survived that bear, which sliced the broad market's value nearly in half. But the swoon left a lasting imprint on my psyche and taught me to respect the stock market like hockey players in the NHL who fear a lethal enforcer on the other team.\\n\\nIn some small way, I feel like my byline is part of Wall Street history.\\n\\nAnd why not? I covered the two biggest market downturns since the Great Depression – the 2000-02 bear market following the internet stock implosion and the nearly 57 percent drubbing the market suffered in 2007-09 after the real estate bust and banking crisis ushered in the Great Recession.\\n\\nMy years covering the market haven't been all doom and gloom, however. I chronicled the 2002-07 bull market that saw stock prices double after the dot-com bust and I have written extensively about the current bull – the longest in history – which began nearly 10 years ago in March 2009.\\n\\nSo what have I learned about investing covering the ups and downs of the stock market at USA TODAY?\\n\\nTiming the market isn't easy, just as the pros say\\n\\nCountless times in stories during periods of acute market distress I have relayed the following boilerplate message from Wall Street pros to Main Street investors: It is tough, if not impossible, to time the market. The best thing an investor can do is stay the course and stick to their long-term plan.\\n\\nIt's true.\\n\\nWhy's that? Nobody has a crystal ball to help them predict the future. And market warning signals, which are clearly visible only in retrospect, never seem to flash as brightly in real time.\\n\\nI learned the hard way. I've never been able to time the stock market with any success. And, if I am totally honest, after screwing up once back in 2010, I never tried again.\\n\\nMy biggest mistake was getting out of the market in the early stages of the current bull market but not having a plan to get back in.\\n\\nHere's how I messed up.\\n\\nOn May 7, 2010, a day after the frightening Flash Crash sent the Dow spiraling down nearly 1,000 points in minutes for no apparent reason, I took the advice of a Wall Street strategist who said publicly that there's no reason to feel bad or guilty about taking profits on a 70 percent gain, which was the size of the market gain at that time after the bear market ended in March 2009. So I moved roughly $78,000 invested in stocks in my 401(k) into cash.\\n\\nThe problem is I never moved the money back into the market, which turned out to be in the first year of what is now a nearly 10-year-old bull market.\\n\\nThe financial pain of being out of the market was sizable. On the day I went to cash, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 10,380. On Oct. 3, 2018, the Dow notched a record high close of 26,828. So I missed out on a 158.5 percent gain, costing me $123,000 in lost upside.\\n\\nThe takeaway: Market pros are 100 percent right when they say timing the market requires two correct decisions: when to get out and when to get back in.\\n\\nMore:Stock market: 19 stocks to buy next year\\n\\nMore:Dow plunge: 5 ways to keep big drop from fraying your nerves, ruining your financial plan\\n\\nInvest using the sleep-at-night test\\n\\nI totally get that investing in stocks and holding what you bought for a long, long time, like billionaire investor Warren Buffett does, is the best way to grow wealth and actually reduces your risk.\\n\\nBut if watching the Dow fall 500, 600, 800 or even 1,000 points in a single day becomes an everyday thing and causes you to fret about losing all your money, putting your emotional and physical health at risk, then you know those huge stock allocations Wall Street pros recommend just aren't for you.\\n\\nForget what the asset allocation models cited by big mutual fund firms or your financial planner or a robo-adviser say you should do. Having close to 100 percent of your money in stocks isn't for everyone. Because if you can't handle wild price swings and you wake up in the middle of the night to check to see if stocks are selling off in Japan or if the Dow futures are down big or you fear tuning on CNBC at 9:30 a.m. when the New York Stock Exchange opens, it's better to accept the way you are wired and play a more conservative investing game.\\n\\nThat's what I did after the financial crisis. After witnessing that rout, it became clear to me that the key to surviving any severe market downturn is to be able to avoid getting blown out. That's my phrase for losing so much money that it puts your retirement on hold or puts you in a major financial bind.\\n\\nIt's true when market pros say the key to successful investing is to save, save, save and stay the course. But to stick to your long-range plan and not sell out at a market bottom, you need to marry your risk tolerance with the percentage of your money you have invested in stocks.\\n\\nBecause down markets get me down, I opted for a 50-50 portfolio for me and my wife. Fifty-fifty, as in 50 percent stocks and 50 percent cash and bonds. A money manager I recently met with flat out told me that I didn't have enough in stocks. He could be right. But I don't care.\\n\\nMy 50-50 portfolio does a few important things for me. It allows me to make money when the stock market is going up. But it also enables me to sleep better at night when stocks are going down.\\n\\nMore important, it keeps my losses measured in percentage terms in my overall portfolio from mushrooming to catastrophic levels. It also helps me better rationalize any paper losses I do suffer.\\n\\nI use a simple rule-of-thumb calculation to both tally my losses and keep them in perspective. For example, since I have only half of my money invested in stocks, when the broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index falls, say, 20 percent, my total portfolio only decreases in value by half that amount. For example, a 50-50 portfolio valued at $100,000 would only decline to $90,000 with my asset mix in a 20 percent market decline, versus a drop to $80,000 if I had 100 percent riding on stocks.\\n\\nLosing less in a market downturn allows me to avoid all sorts of bad financial outcomes. And that's a trade-off I am willing to take even though I might leave some money on the table by not going all-in when it comes to stocks.\\n\\nTame the voice – and voices – of doom\\n\\nBeware the pundits.\\n\\nRepeat.\\n\\nBeware the pundits.\\n\\nEspecially the voices of doom. I'm talking about the market watchers that try to predict the market's next move. Both doomsayers and perma-bulls can throw you off track, by either scaring the wits out of you or making you think stocks will go up forever.\\n\\nThe fact is that nobody – as Warren Buffett always says – really knows for sure what direction stocks will go in the short run.\\n\\nThe reason is simple: Things change. Every day the market is greeted with new information, new inventions, new data, new market calls, new tweets, and new, um, news. And changing information changes the narrative for the stock market in seconds.\\n\\nIt's also important to tame the voice of doom that runs through your own head. Fend off fearful thoughts of the stock market going to zero, because that is a low probability event. Keeping that in mind might help you avoid selling out at a market low just as stocks are poised to rebound. While stocks did go down 86 percent from 1929 to 1932 during the Great Depression, it was a rare event. And it didn't happen overnight.\\n\\nAt times, the best thing you can do if market gyrations are causing you emotional pain is to turn off the TV, tune out the market pundits and take a break from keeping track of the Dow's every move.\\n\\nThe market, I have learned, is like a lasting friendship, with ups and downs along the way. Just like life itself."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nCINCINNATI (AP) — Former Broncos head coach Vance Joseph will interview for Cincinnati's job this week as the Bengals begin their search for Marvin Lewis' replacement.\\n\\nJoseph will be in Cincinnati on Thursday and Friday to talk to owner Mike Brown and members of the front office. The Bengals' familiarity with Joseph works in his favor. Joseph was the defensive backs coach under Lewis in 2014-15.\\n\\nHue Jackson also is among those under consideration for the job and got Lewis' endorsement as his successor.\\n\\nThe Bengals are conducting their first head coaching search since the end of the 2002 season, when Dick LeBeau was fired. Lewis got the job, the first outsider brought in by Brown. He elevated the franchise from forlorn to playoff contender, but he couldn't win a postseason game in 16 seasons.\\n\\nA third straight losing season and a third straight year of falling attendance prompted Brown to finally part ways with Lewis, who is 0-7 in the playoffs. The overriding question is whether Brown, who is averse to major change, will choose someone familiar or go outside the organization for his next head coach.\\n\\nThe Bengals plan to interview a wide range of candidates over several weeks before choosing one.\\n\\nJoseph was fired by Denver on Monday after a 6-10 finish and an 11-21 mark in his two seasons, the worst two-year stretch for the Broncos since the 1960s. Brown has shown a willingness to overlook won-lost records — he kept giving Lewis extensions — if he feels a philosophical connection to a coach.\\n\\nJackson is the other candidate with head coaching experience and close ties to the Brown family. He spent eight years on Lewis' staff in a variety of roles, including receivers coach, defensive backs coach, running backs coach, offensive coordinator and special assistant on defense.\\n\\nThe Bengals quickly rehired Jackson when the Browns fired him in October after only three wins in two-plus years. He became Lewis' special assistant on defense, a loosely defined role that included preparing the game plan each week and talking to players on the sideline during games.\\n\\nLewis endorsed Jackson to be his successor during his farewell news conference on Monday.\\n\\nI think he's more than qualified, Lewis said.\\n\\nCleveland had a resurgence after Jackson was fired in October, winning five of their last seven games. Hiring Jackson would send a message to fans that the organization isn't going to change very much.\\n\\nThe Bengals also reportedly are interested in Kansas City offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, who has ties with Cincinnati.

{"original": "Dan Wolken\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nGLENDALE, Ariz. — When the Nick Saban era concludes and the details fade, this one will inevitably get lumped with the others; just another championship year etched onto a statue, another trophy to put in the case, another entry on his curriculum vitae as the most revered and feared college football coach of all time.\\n\\nBut the sport's greatest coach won his greatest championship on Monday because he did it without one of his best teams, against one of his most capable opponents and in a style that required Alabama to adapt and contort and do the very things that just a couple years ago Saban decried as the earmarks of an inferior brand of football.\\n\\nThe headline will be that Saban won his fifth national title overall and fourth in the past seven years at Alabama by beating Clemson 45-40. But this one was different. This one was more impressive. This one required Saban to break out of his comfort zone, take risks and concede vulnerabilities in ways that showed Alabama is not just a bludgeoning machine void of creativity and personality.\\n\\nThis wasn't the most impressive game of the Saban era, but it might have been the best game — and best season — he ever coached.\\n\\nAlabama holds off Deshaun Watson, Clemson to win national championship\\n\\nI don't think anybody understands what that (run of championships) is, outgoing defensive coordinator and new Georgia coach Kirby Smart said as cigar smoke filled Alabama's locker room. Four national championships in seven years in a world where there is parity, where you have to change quarterbacks every other year, kids come and go, kids transfer. It's just a different world of college football. It speaks volumes to his coaching ability. Nobody realizes how much mental effort and execution and ideas this guy puts into it. He lives, sleeps, breathes football.\\n\\nIn the ultimate evolution sport, leave it to Saban to come to terms with what this Alabama team had to be and what it needed to reach the championship after its ugly September loss to Ole Miss.\\n\\nIt was undeniable on that night that Saban had been through a rough stretch by his standard. The Crimson Tide had been under .500 in its previous nine games against top-20 teams. Alabama was finding itself more and more in shootout-type games against the Auburns and Texas A&Ms, which forced Alabama out of its traditional recipe of dominating defense, ball control and a conservative passing attack.\\n\\nSure, Saban had hired Lane Kiffin, brought in some up-tempo elements and generally accepted that football was being played differently. But there's a reason great championship runs like the one Alabama was on between 2009 and 2012 are historically impossible to sustain. The game evolves, competitors change, it gets harder and harder to keep winning.\\n\\nAs talented as Alabama is, this was probably the sixth-best team out of Saban's nine years. It's clearly behind 2011, 2009 and 2012 and probably behind 2010, the underachiever that lost three games but had perhaps Saban's most talented roster. You can even make an argument Alabama was better in 2013 when it was on the verge of going 12-0 and likely playing for a national title until Auburn's Kick Six miracle.\\n\\nWhich makes it all the more impressive — and a bit scary for the rest of college football — that Saban turned this team into a champion.\\n\\nThis team, I really wanted to do the best I could do for this team, probably as much as any team I've ever coached, Saban said. We didn't always play pretty in this game. It probably wasn't one of our best games when it just comes to flat execution. But when it comes to competing and making plays when we needed to make them, it was probably as good as it gets.\\n\\nUnderstand that in Saban's three previous national championship appearances at Alabama, the games were well in hand by the fourth quarter and followed the formula of physical superiority, fewer mistakes and grind-you-down clock management with the lead. Everything about those games felt inevitable, right down to Saban passing the trophy and making some comment about getting back out on the road recruiting.\\n\\nFor Alabama, a perfect call and a perfect kick at a perfect time\\n\\nBut there was nothing inevitable about this season or this game, and it took everything Alabama had to survive both, including Saban's acceptance that sometimes the Crimson Tide simply has to win a different way. Instead of grousing about tempo or scoring defense and trying to play the game on his terms, Saban has figured out that Alabama can win playing Clemson's game, too.\\n\\nI think you have to in this day and age of football, Smart said. There are so many run-pass option plays, so many plays to trick the defense that people are going to put better numbers up. To do what we did against Michigan State is a bit of a misnomer. It just doesn't happen anymore. People score points, especially teams with athletic quarterbacks. You have to be able to hold them under their averages and you have to score on offense.\\n\\nAnd sometimes you have to take risks.\\n\\nSaban's onside kick decision with 10:34 remaining in a 24-24 game will go down as an all-time gutsy move given the fact that Alabama — had it failed — would have given the ball to a red-hot Deshaun Watson at midfield and likely fallen behind.\\n\\nKey takeaways from the College Football Playoff championship\\n\\nIt's unfair to say Saban wouldn't have taken that kind of risk in another year with another team. But back then, he didn't have to, which is kind of the point.\\n\\nI guess you could say he's a conservative coach in a sense, but he knows the athletes he has on the field, running back Kenyan Drake said. He won't ever call a play we've never practiced before, and we gameplanned all week that if (Clemson lined up a certain way), we can easily pooch it over his head. He has the confidence in us to make the plays, and we have to execute it and everything happened as we planned it. In my opinion it was the most important play of the game.\\n\\nThat Alabama could win a championship game while giving up 550 yards, and while its Heisman Trophy running back Derrick Henry was limited to 30 yards in the second half, almost seems like a set of circumstances from another planet.\\n\\nMonday showed this isn't the same old Alabama. It's simply the same, and maybe more impressive, result.\\n\\nGALLERY: HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE CHAMPIONSHIP GAME"}

NHL players have been competing at the Olympics since 1998.\\n\\nBettman said Sunday that there has been no change in the league's position.\\n\\nWe've been there, done that five times and while Vancouver and Salt Lake City were different, when you're halfway around the world it's not the easiest thing to have in our season, Bettman said.\\n\\nBut Fehr continued to paint a different picture.\\n\\nFive reasons Team USA has strong chance of world juniors medal\\n\\nYou get a sense of things as they go along, and how they're likely to end up, Fehr said. Doesn't mean you're always right, but you get a sense of things.\\n\\nThe NHL's reluctance centers on the hardship of shutting down the league, condensing the regular-season schedule and concern over injuries.\\n\\nAbsent some compelling reason, I'm not sure there's a whole lot of sentiment on the part of the clubs to go through the disruption of taking almost three weeks off during the season, Bettman said.\\n\\nAnother major issue is the International Olympic Committee's decision not to pay the transportation and insurance costs for players.\\n\\nInternational Ice Hockey Federation president Rene Fasel has said he can find a way to cover the costs, which are approximately $10 million.\\n\\nThe NHL has raised the possibility of tying Olympic participation into a possible collective bargaining agreement extension.\\n\\n10 questions for 2017 in the NHL — from Metropolitan Division to Olympics\\n\\n(Players) didn't have an appetite on the basis of the suggestion that was made to them, no, Fehr said. The question is, if there would ever be an opportunity for a more wide-ranging discussion that would sweep in the kinds of things people would bring up in bargaining, obviously I would talk to the players about it. Now, that's hard to do, it's hard to reach a resolution without a deadline, when you have that kind of situation. But I would not be personally averse to considering it.''\\n\\nCould there be a long-term international agreement separate from the CBA?\\n\\nOne would think so, Fehr said. One would think so. Look, if you have a CBA expiring in a year, does the NHL not plan for the season or seasons after the CBA expires? Of course they do. It doesn't mean you don't change things, it doesn't mean you can't have issues. … It is always conceivable that you can do a long-term international program which would sweep in all kinds of events if even if you don't have a CBA extension, even if that means that there are some uncertainties.''"}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nTAMPA (AP) — Alabama coach Nick Saban and Clemson coach Dabo Swinney are hopeful that new rules regarding how NFL teams can evaluate underclassmen will provide players better information on whether to go pro.\\n\\nThe American Football Coaches Association and the NFL reached an agreement last year that allows underclassmen who are returning for another season of college football to participate in pro days at their schools. That will allow scouts and coaches to begin the evaluation process earlier. Each school is allowed to have five underclassmen participate, though it can request to have more.\\n\\nThe change should give the NFL's college advisory committee more information and allow it to provide better feedback when underclassmen request evaluations.\\n\\nI think the philosophy here is the more information that the NFL can get on players, the more accurate they can be in evaluation, Saban said. And I think that players are trying to make a business decision after three years in school, business decision being, where will I get drafted relative to if I stayed in school, where could I develop and get drafted a year from now and have a better opportunity for myself.\\n\\nBecause once you enter the draft, you can't improve your draft status. But if you stay in college you can improve your draft status dramatically.\\n\\nSwinney gave Saban credit for spearheading the change, arranging a conference call with about five coaches last year.\\n\\nFor the second straight season, Alabama and Clemson are playing in the College Football Playoff national championship game. Both teams are loaded with underclassmen that could leave behind college eligibility and declare for the NFL draft in April. The deadline to declare for underclassmen to declare for the draft is Jan. 16.\\n\\nSwinney has already said he expects quarterback Deshaun Watson, receiver Mike Williams and running back Wayne Gallman to give up their final season eligibility and enter the draft as juniors. Among the Alabama players who will be considering early draft entry are offensive tackle Cam Robinson and receiver ArDarius Stewart.\\n\\nUnderclassmen can request an evaluation from the advisory committee. The committee changed its rating system last year to potential first-round pick, potential second-round pick or neither, essentially recommending the player stay in school. The number of underclassmen entering the draft had been steadily rising in recent years and hit a record 98 in 2015. Last year that number dropped to 74 and coaches are hoping the new scouting rules can decrease it further.\\n\\nIt was frustrating when you have a young man that gets a second-round grade and he doesn't get drafted, or it's frustrating when you have a guy that gets a seventh-round grade and comes out and goes in the second round, Swinney said. The consistency in the evaluation was an area of concern for us as coaches."}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nRENTON, Wash. (AP) — Pete Carroll and Brian Schottenheimer sat together and decided with their team winless after two games there needed to be a change.\\n\\nWhat the Seattle Seahawks were trying to do on offense wasn't working.\\n\\nHe and I sat down and kind of had a little heart-to-heart, said Schottenheimer, Seattle's first-year offensive coordinator.\\n\\nThere were things that he and I just wanted to make sure we were on the same page about. It wasn't just the running game, it was he and I continuing to build our relationship and it was an awesome meeting. It probably lasted about an hour and we talked about a ton of different stuff. I know I came out of that meeting feeling really good just about the direction where we wanted to go.\\n\\nThe direction has been clear for more than three months as the Seahawks went from a team searching for answers to a team back in the postseason after a one-year absence from the playoffs.\\n\\nAnd it was the decisions made before playing Dallas in Week 3 where the switch was made and Seattle started on its path that has the Seahawks headed to face the Cowboys on Saturday night in an NFC wild-card game.\\n\\nThe conversation between Carroll and Schottenheimer made clear Seattle was going back to the fundamentals of how it wanted to be offensively. They were going to make running the ball the priority and let Russell Wilson be a playmaker around the running success.\\n\\nThe result: Seattle ended the season as the best run team in the NFL, and with Wilson having one of the best seasons of his career making big plays in the passing game.\\n\\nI don't think you'd always sit there and say we're going to make this philosophy and go do this, and then you think you're going to be the best in the league at it, Schottenheimer said.\\n\\nThroughout last offseason, Seattle preached it was returning to the basic offensive fundamentals that led them to consecutive NFC titles. They were going to be bullies running the football behind the trio of Chris Carson, Mike Davis and Rashaad Penny.\\n\\nBut for the first two weeks of the season, Schottenheimer and Carroll got too far ahead of themselves. They tried to see how much the Seahawks could rely on Wilson, rather than relying on the run game. The result was a pair of ugly losses to Denver and Chicago, and Wilson running for his life getting sacked 12 times in those first two games.\\n\\nWhen Dallas arrived in Week 3, so did Seattle's change in approach. That was the week Carson became the workhorse in the run game. It was the week that the additions of D.J. Fluker and J.R. Sweezy at the guard positions started to become noticeable, and Seattle's running success meant Wilson was no longer under siege by the opposing pass rush.\\n\\nSeattle rushed for only 113 yards that day in the 24-13 win — 102 by Carson — but it laid the foundation for what the Seahawks became.\\n\\nThey were talking about it the whole time of running the ball more and being a run team, Carson said. They finally started getting it going against the Cowboys and it's taken off ever since.\\n\\nStarting with Week 3, Seattle has rushed for 2,422 yards, the fourth-most by any team since 2010 during that 14-game span. The 2014 Seahawks had 2,447 yards during the same stretch of games, one spot ahead of this year's team.\\n\\nWhile it was the Cowboys when Seattle committed to its offensive identity, when it fully took hold depends on whom you ask. For Schottenheimer it wasn't until Week 12 at Carolina when he became convinced Seattle had the ability to win in multiple ways. The victory over the Panthers came on a day Seattle ran for only 75 yards, but Wilson threw for 339. It's the only time in the final 14 games Seattle was held under 100 yards rushing as a team.\\n\\nFor offensive tackle Duane Brown, it was Seattle's first game against the Los Angeles Rams in Week 5. Seattle lost 33-31, but ran for 190 yards and averaged 5.9 yards per carry.\\n\\nIt just became our norm and we had some pretty good fronts that we went against, Brown said.\\n\\nCarroll agreed with his left tackle that it was a few games after facing the Cowboys before the commitment to Seattle's offensive style became the norm.\\n\\nIt was a step in right direction and the commitment came through but we were just getting started, Carroll said. I don't think that was the pivotal week, it took us two or three weeks after that before we started to find the stride that we wanted and started to build on that.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/tag/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

When I saw the towels getting out I kind of assumed what was going on. A lot of thanks to coach Ryan and the rest of the Bills and everybody in Buffalo. I know they're excited about 8-8 and we're excited they got us in.\\n\\nPittsburgh's bumpy season — the Steelers overcame suspensions, injuries and a shocking loss last week in Baltimore — will continue with at least one more game. As usual, Roethlisberger did his part, throwing for 349 yards, including 187 to sensational wide receiver Antonio Brown, who had 13 catches and a TD.\\n\\nIt's been a tough, 16-week fight for us, but we're where we want to be, coach Mike Tomlin said. We're where we need to be.\\n\\nThe Browns (3-13) ended another losing season in disarray. Owner Jimmy Haslam, who vowed in August that he wouldn't blow things up did just that, ousting Pettine and Farmer after two disappointing seasons. Pettine went 10-22 during his two-year stint with Cleveland, losing 18 of his final 21 games.\\n\\nPettine wasn't surprised by reports he was on his way out.\\n\\nI'm not into pleading, he said. That to me is the resume: how hard the guys play, the effort that goes in, how hard we practice, what we do in meeting time, walkthrough, out on the practice field, how that carries over to the game field. I feel like we've done a lot of good things, but I'm the first one to tell you this is a pass/fail league, and the results aren't there.\\n\\nThe Steelers sacked the Browns' Austin Davis, starting in place of Johnny Manziel, seven times.\\n\\nWith Cleveland down just 17-12 in the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh's defense came up with the game's biggest play as linebacker Lawrence Timmons dropped Davis, who fumbled inside the 10-yard line. Linebacker Arthur Moats recovered, and on the next play, Roethlisberger completed an 8-yard TD pass to Markus Wheaton.\\n\\nAll that was left was for the Bills to help out.\\n\\nAnd when Buffalo completed its win over the Jets, the Steelers were back in the postseason. They hugged and high-fived on the sideline and thousands of Pittsburgh fans celebrated as the black-and-gold earned the right to play for the NFL championship in the Super Bowl's golden anniversary season.\\n\\nIt's so gratifying, said Brown, who finished with 136 catches for 1,834 yards. Sitting here as a Pittsburgh Steeler, that's the expectation to make the playoffs and hoist the Lombardi Trophy. We continue to stay together no matter what people say.\\n\\nThe loss in Baltimore had severely damaged the Steelers' playoff chances, but Roethlisberger made sure there wouldn't be another costly misstep.\\n\\nBig Ben finished 24 of 36 and improved to 19-2 over Cleveland.\\n\\nThere was one hiccup as Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams left in the first half with an ankle injury.

{"original": "Joyce M. Rosenberg\\n\\nThe Associated Press\\n\\nNEW YORK — Each year, business owners can count on changes in tax law and other rules. For 2017, small businesses are getting a bigger deduction for equipment purchases, and those that aren't required to provide health insurance will have an option to help staffers pay for coverage. Many companies have new filing deadlines for their tax returns, and owners who use their cars for business will get a slightly smaller deduction.\\n\\nA look at some of the changes owners will see in this new year:\\n\\nEQUIPMENT PURCHASES\\n\\nSmall businesses buying many types of equipment get a bigger tax break in 2017. The Section 179 deduction will be $510,000, up $10,000 from 2016, an adjustment to account for the effects of inflation.\\n\\nThe deduction, intended for small businesses, lets them deduct up-front rather than depreciate the costs of equipment like computers, vehicles, manufacturing machines and furniture, as well as some types of real property. But air conditioning and heating equipment, and land and improvements to land like paved parking areas are not eligible for the deduction.\\n\\nThese trends could affect your money in 2017\\n\\nIf a business spends more than $2,030,000 on equipment that qualifies for the Section 179 deduction, the tax break is reduced by the amount they spend that exceeds $2,030,000. However, companies can depreciate equipment that doesn't qualify for the Section179 break, and get a deduction that way.\\n\\nYou can learn more about Section 179 deductions and depreciation in IRS Publication 946, How to Depreciate Property. You can find it on the IRS website, www.irs.gov .\\n\\nSTAND-ALONE HRAs ARE NOW LEGAL\\n\\nSmall business owners who aren't required to offer health insurance to staffers but want to help them pay for coverage can now do so through what are known as Health Reimbursement Arrangements.\\n\\nHRAs have been legal under the health care law only if employers offered insurance that met the law's requirements and provided the HRAs as one alternative that employees could choose. But owners who were exempt under the law because they had fewer than 50 staffers couldn't simply give workers stipends or other non-taxed pay to defray the cost of individual policies.\\n\\nThe 21st Century Cures Act that President Barack Obama signed into law last month allows small businesses exempt from the law to create what are called stand-alone HRAs to reimburse employees for health-related expenses, including insurance. There is a limit of $4,950 for an individual employee or $10,000 if an employer wants to pay for a staffer's family's expenses. The law provides for annual increases tied to the inflation rate.\\n\\nThe skinny about freelance money: How to get comfortable with income, taxes and expenses\\n\\nNEW FILING DATES FOR SOME BUSINESS TAX RETURNS\\n\\nTwo laws passed by Congress changed the deadlines for many businesses to file important documents and returns with the IRS.\\n\\nThe changes in filing dates do not affect company owners who report their business income on Form 1040. That date in 2017 will be April 18; the usual April 15 deadline falls on a Saturday, and Emancipation Day, a federal holiday in the nation's capital, is observed on April 17.\\n\\nThe changes do affect partnerships and companies known as C corporations:\\n\\n—Partnership returns are now due March 15. They previously were due April 15.\\n\\n—Returns for C corporations are now due in April, a change from the previous date of March 15.\\n\\nThe changes were included in the Surface Transportation and Veterans Health Care Choice Improvement Act of 2015. The accounting industry had asked for the changes to help simplify the tax filing process for businesses.\\n\\nA separate law passed in December, requires employers to file W-2 forms and some 1099 forms with the government by Jan. 31. Employers were already required to give those forms to employees and independent contractors by Jan. 31, but previously had until the end of February to submit them to the government.\\n\\nUSING YOUR CAR FOR BUSINESS\\n\\nThe IRS has set the standard mileage rate for business use for a car at 53.5 cents per mile for 2017. That's down half a cent from 2016.\\n\\nThe government takes into consideration the fluctuating costs of operating a car when it sets the standard mileage rate each year. The rate is one of two methods for an owner to account for how much was spent on using a car for business; the second is to deduct the actual expenses for the car. An owner opting for actual expenses must calculate the percentage of miles the car is driven for business reasons, and apply that percentage to expenses like lease payments, fuel, maintenance, repairs and insurance. An owner can also deduct depreciation.\\n\\nTax-smart strategies for retirement savings\\n\\nIf business owners want to use the standard mileage rate, they must use it in the first year a car is available to be used for business. That's either the year the car is acquired or the first year that the owner is in business. Starting with the second year, they can choose either method.\\n\\nYou can learn more about deducting the business use of a car in IRS Publication 463, Travel, Entertainment, Gift, and Car Expenses.\\n\\n_____\\n\\nFollow Joyce Rosenberg atwww.twitter.com/JoyceMRosenberg .

{"original": "Annie Nova\\n\\nCNBC\\n\\nIf one of your New Year's resolutions is to grow your savings, one smart strategy is to keep your money in an account earning the most interest.\\n\\nThe Federal Reserve has been slow to raise interest rates, and even recent hikes haven't trickled down to consumers in the form of better savings yields. The average savings account offers a paltry 0.19% annual return, only slightly better than a year ago, according to Deposit Accounts.\\n\\nSome experts say that money could grow faster at online banks. Some CDs, or certificates of deposit, are also more generous than others.\\n\\nIf you're not seeking out the best returns on savings accounts and CDs, you're leaving money on the table, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate.com. It's the only place in the investment universe where you can get extra returns without extra risks.\\n\\nThese accounts are protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a government agency that provides deposit insurance, for up to $250,000.\\n\\nSavings accounts\\n\\nOnline banks, McBride said, are currently in an arms race to lure people with the best rates.\\n\\nAlthough current best rates of around 1.5% still seem low — one could find savings accounts with a 4% annual percentage yield in 2006 — experts say they make sense in the current environment.\\n\\nWe had record low interest rates for nearly a decade, and inflation is still 1.6%, McBride said. When banks are giving car loans for 3% and mortgages for 4%, no one is getting 10% on savings.\\n\\nPeople are also less likely to look to the past than they are to compare today's rates against each other, said Patricia Seaman, senior director of marketing and communications at the National Endowment for Financial Education.\\n\\nPeople feel good about saving 5 cents a gallon on gas, so they feel better about getting another half a percentage [on their savings], she said. We may not be talking about very much, but psychologically, that looks amazing.\\n\\nHere are some of the banks with the best savings yields:\\n\\n1) Dollar Savings Direct, a division of Emigrant Bank, claims to have America's highest rate. Saving accounts come with an annual interest rate of 1.60%.\\n\\nIt's a smaller Internet bank, but it's still a legitimate, FDIC [Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation] insured bank, said Ken Tumin, founder of the website DepositAccounts.com.\\n\\n2) Marcus by Goldman Sachs offers online savings accounts with an annual interest rate of 1.40%. Goldman Sachs seems to be a little hungrier for deposits, McBride said. First National Bank of Omaha also offers an annual interest rate of 1.40% on a savers' online account. Neither requires a minimum deposit.\\n\\n3) American Express's savings accounts accrue at 1.35% a year.\\n\\n4)Discover online savings accountscome with a 1.30% annual interest rate. In this account, $15,000 would produce a return of $194.74 in a year. To compare, that same amount in a Chase savings account would earn just $1.50. Barclays, too, offers an online savings account with an interest rate of 1.30%.\\n\\n5) Synchrony Bankoffers a savings account with a 1.30% annual return — and its accounts come with an optional ATM card, although like with most online savings accounts, there is a limit of six withdrawals or transfers in a month. Although this restriction might feel like a nuisance, it's actually helpful to people, McBride said.\\n\\nToo easy access can defeat the purpose of saving, he said.\\n\\nCertificates of deposit\\n\\nFor savers who won't need their money for an extended period of time, interest rates on CDs can be worth a look. The average 1-year CD returns 0.28%. Rates from online banks, however, are also higher.\\n\\nPeople generally can withdraw their CD interest at any time throughout the term. There are penalties for withdrawing the original deposit.\\n\\nIf it helps you to think, 'I can't get that money', it's worth it, said Seaman.\\n\\nHere are some CDs with the best rates:\\n\\n1) Online bank Ally has one-year CDs that range from 1.35% to 1.70%, depending on how much is deposited. Savers should look for CDs with the lowest penalties, said Allan Roth, founder of Wealth Logic. That way they can gain the benefit of a high interest savings account without the restrictions of a CD. If you need the money, you break the CD, he said.\\n\\n2) Marcus by Goldman Sachs also offers certificates of deposits with higher-than-average returns, although there is a $500 minimum deposit. A one-year CD comes with a 1.65% interest rate, and a six-year CD has a 2.55 percent annual rate.\\n\\n3) Barclays offers a 1.65% return for one-year CDs; five-year CDs will deliver 2.40 percent and there is no minimum opening deposit.\\n\\nSavers can also ladder their CDs, in which a person deposits money into, say, a one-, two- and three-year CD, so that they're not tying up too much of their money at once and can reinvest their savings should rates rise.\\n\\nIt can be hard for people to spend the time and energy to change their saving ways, Roth said. People need to fight that inertia.\\n\\nI know so many people that will complain about a sandwich being $12 when it should be $10, he said. And yet they lose thousands of dollars each year by having their money in a big-name checking account.\\n\\nKeep in mind you'll pay ordinary income tax rates on earnings from savings accounts.\\n\\n© CNBC is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news and commentary.

Living in the Midwest, I'm well-trained to dress warmly and in layers, but this deep freeze has been difficult to endure, especially when I expect to be comfortable – or at least not shivering — inside.\\n\\nAs much of the nation muddled through bitter weather in recent weeks, office dwellers found they still had to brave the cold even when indoors. Many relied on winter parkas, gloves, blankets and space heaters just to keep working.\\n\\nMore:8 things you shouldn't leave in your car in subzero weather\\n\\nMore:It's cold outside, but that doesn't mean climate change isn't real\\n\\nToday I've got two sweaters, a scarf, ear coverings, gloves and a blanket over my lap, Rebecca Miller, a 27-year-old academic adviser at Tennessee State University in Nashville, said last week as temperatures barely ticked above 50 degrees in her office while outside it was 20 degrees or lower in the daytime. But I'm still having a hard time working. I'm shaking cold, and it's hard to focus. The gloves make it hard to type, and the bulky layers make it difficult to move around.\\n\\nLike thousands of other chilly Americans, she snapped selfies of herself at her desk in attire usually reserved for the ski slopes and shared them on social media.\\n\\nOffice developments are built with centralized heating systems that make the buildings suitable for a range of uses over many years. The down side is that they provide little climate control to individual tenants – sometimes purposely, said Khee Poh Lam, architecture professor at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nThermostats are often tucked into hard-to-reach spaces like false ceilings and air ducts so office tenants can't mess with them, Lam said. Other buildings have dummy units out in the open that don't actually do anything except give desperate workers the illusion of control.\\n\\nMore:At work, women are freezing\\n\\nFinding the right temperature to please everyone has been an elusive goal for office designers and builders, said Stefano Schiavon, architecture professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who co-wrote a 2012 study that found roughly 40 percent of U.S. workers were satisfied with their office's temperature. Design standards call for an acceptability rate closer to 80 percent, he said.\\n\\nThe challenge isn't just confined to the winter, of course. Chilly offices have long been the bane of women who complain air conditioning is cranked up in the summer to appease their male, suit-wearing counterparts. And there are certainly many offices with overzealous furnaces that prompt workers to crack open windows even on the coldest days.\\n\\nOptimal temperature for office work is 72 to 79 degrees – or nearly 10 degrees more than what many buildings typically set their thermostats, said Alan Hedge, a design professor at Cornell University in New York who has researched how temperature affects productivity.\\n\\nSchiavon suggested that companies, even those based in the draftiest old offices, can invest in safe, relatively inexpensive technology to keep workers warm and productive, like heated chairs, electric blankets and heated floor mats.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that central heating won't work for everyone, even if designed right, he said. We're very different people and need some sort of personalization of our environment.\\n\\nEricson, the Iowa resident, said the key to getting through the work day has been reminding herself the cold is only temporary.\\n\\nEvery day that passes, she said, is a day closer to spring."}
{"original": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris called out President Donald Trump during a campaign rally on Sunday for pressuring Georgia's secretary of state to change the 2020 election results.\\n\\nHave y'all heard about that recorded conversation? Well, it was certainly the voice of desperation, most certainly that, Harris told onlookers during a drive-in rally in Savannah, Georgia. And it was a bald-faced, bold abuse of power by the president of the United States.\\n\\nDuring an hour-long conversation on Saturday with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, the president repeatedly asked for the state election official to find enough votes to reverse his loss to President-elect Joe Biden in Georgia, according to a recording of thephone call obtained by The Washington Post.\\n\\nHarris, a California Democratic senator, returned to the Peach State for a second event in as many months to charge up voters on behalf of challengers Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, who are looking to defeat Republican incumbents David Perdue and Kelley Loeffler, respectively.\\n\\nThe appearance is part of a last-minute effort to boost Democratic chances in Tuesday's runoff elections, which will determine control of the Senate. Harris's visit comes a day before President-elect Joe Biden is set to appear in Atlanta to stump for the two Democratic candidates.\\n\\nBiden and Harris stopping in Georgia underscores how important the state is for Democrats in setting the policy table in 2021.\\n\\nThe 117th Congress saw 50 Republicans sworn into the Senate this week, along with 48 members who will caucus with Democrats.\\n\\nIf Ossoff and Warnock win, Harris would be the tie-breaking vote as vice president, and would give the incoming administration's priorities an edge. If either challenger loses, however, Senate Majority Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., would retain control.\\n\\nHarris tied the outcome of the runoff races to putting closure on 2020, which was defined by the coronavirus pandemic infecting millions of Americans, killing more than 350,000 and destabilizing the economy.\\n\\nIt is not over until we get through with the end of Tuesday, then we can truly celebrate the new year, she said.\\n\\nDuring the rally, the incoming vice president, who will be the first woman and woman of color to hold the office, recited some of Biden's priorities, such as protecting the Affordable Care Act and providing people with a higher COVID-19 relief check of $2,000.\\n\\nHarris spent much of her speech, however, talking about efforts to suppress the vote in previous Georgia elections, and subsequent lawsuits challenging the 2020 election results.\\n\\nWhy are such powerful people trying to make it difficult for us to vote, she said. Because they know our power, they know when we vote things change and they know when we vote we win.\\n\\nGeorgia has been a reliable GOP stronghold for decades, but it surprised political observers when it went for a Democrat for the first time since 1992. Many point to an upswing of voter registration, in addition to higher turnout in urban centers and burgeoning suburbs, led by grassroots organizers as the source of Biden's win.\\n\\nAs a resultof the president's unexpected loss in the state, Trump has had sharp exchanges with Georgia's top Republican state officials, including Gov. Brian Kemp.\\n\\nWhen the president swung through the state in early December he vowed to return for a big rally on election eve, but also took a swing at GOP state officials in the process saying how he was treated badly by the governor and Raffensperger.\\n\\nBut Trump reiterated how there must be a massive victory for Perdue and Loeffler, who have echoed the president's unfounded claims of a mass election fraud in the election.\\n\\nOn Sunday, the president continued to hammer Raffensperger, saying how the GOP secretary of state was, unwilling, or unable, to answer questions about various unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud.\\n\\nHe has no clue! Trump tweeted.\\n\\nRespectfully, President Trump: What you're saying is not true, Raffensperger responded. The truth will come out,\\n\\nDemocrats point to GOP infighting as a good sign, coupled with higher state average turnout so far in areas such as Fulton, DeKalb and Cobb Counties, which were strongholds of Black voters who helped win the state for Biden.\\n\\nMore than 2.5 million people have already cast a ballot in the runoffs either through early in-person or by mail, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office.\\n\\nThat's less than the roughly 3.2 million Georgia voters who had cast an early ballot at this point ahead of the November 2020 election, but Democrats are optimistic given the high early turnout in their congressional districts compared to Republican areas.\\n\\nDuring her speech, Harris saidGeorgia is the center of not just who will control the Senate in 2021, but is part of a national fight about the legitimacy of U.S. elections.\\n\\nYou will make a decision about who is holding these most powerful positions that will chart the course for Georgia families and those across the country, she said. So I'm here to thank you on behalf of Joe and myself for what you did in November, and I'm here to ask you to do it again."}
{"original": "Brett Murphy\\n\\nUSA TODAY Network\\n\\nThe city of Los Angeles filed three lawsuits against some of the busiest port trucking companies in the country Monday, demanding they stop systematically exploiting their workers in the wake of reports by the USA TODAY Network.\\n\\nThis abuse, this disgraceful exploitation has to stop, City Attorney Mike Feuer said at a news conference Monday, citing the Network's scathing coverage of the industry.\\n\\nFeuer alleged CMI Transportation, K&R Transportation and California Cartage Transportation Express represent industry leaders that knowingly violate state labor laws with devastating practices meant to increase executives' bottom lines while driving their workers into debt.\\n\\nWe're trying to create systemic change, and we'll continue to investigate other companies as well, Feuer said.\\n\\nRigged:Forced into debt.Worked past exhaustion.Left with nothing.\\n\\nRigged:Retail giants enable trucker exploitation\\n\\nRigged:How trucking companies that cheat drivers dodge penalties\\n\\nRigged:Companies risk lives by putting sleep-deprived port truckers on the road\\n\\nThe three companies are part of the California Cartage family of outfits recently bought by New Jersey-based NFI Industries. Those companies helped spearhead the lease-to-own contracts that became pervasive across the industry.\\n\\nDenying workers fair wages and benefits to pad profit margins is unacceptable, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said in a statement. We will not stand for it in Los Angeles.\\n\\nThe lawsuit seeks penalties, restitution and a prohibition against practices that lead to worker exploitation, according to the complaints.\\n\\nRepresentatives at NFI and California Cartage did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday about the suits filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\\n\\nI would question the standing or merit of this lawsuit, but that is for the courts to decide, said Weston LaBar, chief executive officer of the Harbor Trucking Association, who called the state's history of judgments in favor of port truckers completely one-sided.\\n\\nThis most recent effort by the city attorney does nothing more than validate that in my mind, LeBar said.\\n\\nThe USA TODAY Network previously reported that more than 1,100 California port truck drivers have filed labor complaints in civil court and with the state labor commissioner since 2008. That year a new California environmental law required trucking companies serving state ports to replace old trucks with new, cleaner rigs.\\n\\nTo avoid the cost, many companies pushed their independent drivers into lease-to-own contracts that they didn't understand and could not afford.\\n\\nWhen drivers got sick or fell behind on payments, trucking companies fired them, seizing their trucks and tens of thousands of dollars they had paid toward buying them.\\n\\nMonday's legal action is the latest in a wave of changes affecting the port trucking industry in recent months following the USA TODAY Network's coverage.\\n\\nSince the network began reporting last spring drivers have filed 23 new California Labor Commissioner cases and six lawsuits, including three class actions, against port trucking companies.\\n\\nTrucking companies exposed in the network's reporting have lost business. At least one executive resigned. State and federal agencies have launched investigations into potential worker exploitation and forced labor, and lawmakers have introduced sweeping national and state reforms to curb systematic labor abuse in the industry.\\n\\nThe revelations about the abuse of workers in the port trucking industry should outrage every American, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wrote in a November letter to President Donald Trump, calling for an executive order to investigate port trucking companies and ban government agencies from contracting with them. It is time for us to end this exploitation.\\n\\nSanders is one of several high-profile lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, of California, and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who have launched public pressure campaigns to reform the industry.\\n\\nIn August they sent letters to 16 retailers and manufacturers named in the network's reports, demanding independent investigations and answers.\\n\\nPort trucking companies' brazen disregard for federal transportation safety standards and workers' safety and rights is shameful, wrote the senators, led by Brown.\\n\\nAs a result, manufacturers, shippers and at least six major retailers — including Target, Home Depot and Walmart — launched internal audits of their supply chain to ferret out port trucking companies with labor violations. So far two, including Costco, have cut ties with their trucking companies.\\n\\nMore:'Rigged' investigation prompts new bill\\n\\nMore:USA TODAY NETWORK investigation uncovers enterprise corruption and mistreatment of hundreds of truckers in the U.S.\\n\\nPacific 9, one of the biggest trucking companies at the port, changed its business model, dropping the lease-to-own program and rehiring dozens of independent drivers as protected employees.\\n\\nWeeks after one of the network's reports, the president of Fargo Trucking resigned, its board filed for bankruptcy, and the company lost one of its biggest clients, international steamship giant OOCL, after receiving tremendous pressure to minimize exposure from the articles, according to an email sent to the trucking company's executives.\\n\\nIn July, House members on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, led by Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., demanded more oversight from the Department of Transportation, which pledged to investigate the allegations of abuse.\\n\\nCiting the network's coverage, DeFazio and nine others in Congress introduced two bills, including the Port Drivers Bill of Rights, and other legislation to grant local governments more power to regulate port trucking companies.\\n\\nLocal and state lawmakers also have taken action.\\n\\nLast year California Democrats signed a unanimous resolution calling on the mayors in Los Angeles and Long Beach to end the sweatshop working conditions in the harbor.\\n\\nLos Angeles Councilman Joe Buscaino, who has led Los Angeles City Council hearings on the issue, praised the city attorney's decision to sue port trucking companies.\\n\\nNo company is allowed to gain an unfair advantage by exploiting human beings for the sake of corporate profits, Buscaino said in a statement.\\n\\nAfter a November special hearing that attracted more than 200 people, the Los Angeles council approved a plan for a city report on the financial possibility of banning companies that violate labor laws and an industrywide audit of lease-to-own contracts.\\n\\nThe city's Bureau of Contract Administration has since opened three investigations against port trucking companies.\\n\\nCouncil members also told the city attorney to look into mandating basic work standards and fair pay for workers at companies that operate on city property.\\n\\nI remain haunted by the testimony, Councilman Mike Bonin said after hearing port truckers speak about their experience.

Two of the other freshmen missed eight and nine games apiece.\\n\\nDuke coach Mike Krzyzewski to have lower back surgery, will miss several weeks\\n\\nMike Krzyzewski: Suspended Grayson Allen no longer a captain\\n\\nWhen the entire roster was finally available and curious outsiders could get their first peek at the true title contender, national Player of the Year candidate Grayson Allen became better known for his dirty play — after the third time he tripped an opponent during a game this calendar year — than his actual on-court performance, which has been rather terrific over his career at Duke. Not only was he suspended indefinitely by Duke, he was stripped of his captaincy.\\n\\nIn the Blue Devils' first game without Allen — Saturday's ACC opener against Virginia Tech — Duke flailed. It wasn't just the absence of Allen; it was a complete lack of interest in playing tough defense, no offensive cohesion and, essentially, a team that faced an early deficit and seemed to make no effort to make it up.\\n\\nAnd now, after all that, there's another bump in the road. Head coach Mike Krzyzewski will miss up to four weeks of conference play. The Hall of Fame coach announced Monday he will have lower back surgery to remove a fragment of a herniated disk on Friday.\\n\\nIn a statement, Krzyzewski said Duke's medical team has worked with him to manage the pain for the past few weeks. But ultimately surgery now became the best option for the 69-year-old coach.\\n\\nAs soon as the doctors clear me to do so, I look forward to returning and giving our team 100% of my energy and attention, which is certainly something that they deserve, Krzyzewski said.\\n\\nDuke associate head coach Jeff Capel will coach the team in Krzyzewski's absence, which means not much will change. Capel has been Krzyzewski's right-hand man for both the Blue Devils and USA Basketball since joining Krzyzewski's staff. He's helped recruit 12 McDonald's All-Americans to the school, a huge reason for recent success. Capel has also been a head coach before, at Oklahoma and Virginia Commonwealth.\\n\\nSurely, Krzyzewski will remain involved with his coaching staff during his recuperation. Surely, Capel will stay the course, though the team and program appear to be in a precarious position at the moment, coming off the dreadful ACC opener against Virginia Tech and the team's apparent chemistry issues. Duke looks far from the title contender it is more than capable of becoming by March.\\n\\nBut the first step toward getting there is overcoming yet another unexpected challenge during a season that's seen too many of them already.\\n\\nREMAINING UNDEFEATED TEAMS IN COLLEGE HOOPS"}

Maybe you can reduce these expenditures permanently.\\n\\nMake an inventory of what you did in 2020, and use it as a roadmap for 2021, suggested Bobbi Rebell, a certified financial planner and adviser for Splitit, a site that helps people make interest-free purchases on installment. Our definition of needs and wants has changed so much.\\n\\nAssess your insurance needs\\n\\nYou might have noticed that you don't require the same types or levels of protection as before. Auto insurance is an obvious example, now that more people are working or studying at home. That has meant fewer cars are on the road, with a sharp reduction in vehicle accidents and better insurance deals.\\n\\nThe staggering drop in accidents this year resulted in a dramatic drop in claims paid by insurers, said the Consumer Federation of America and the Center for Economic Justice in a recent review of accident statistics.\\n\\nThe groups want to see insurers lower premiums – and many have. It thus might be a good time to evaluate your insurance needs with an eye on shopping around.\\n\\nConversely, you might need more home-insurance coverage, or different types, if your dwelling has risen in value, you recently completed remodeling projects or you set up a new home-based business.\\n\\nCancel unneeded subscriptions\\n\\nWhile you're looking at spending, take the time to evaluate your various subscriptions, memberships and other accounts with an eye on eliminating those you no longer use, said Rebell. Look to cancel automated, recurring payments whether tied to your bank account, cellphone or other accounts if you rarely use those services anymore.\\n\\nCancellations don't need to be permanent and might bring about a better deal. If you change your mind, you can always resubscribe to a service and might receive a coupon, introductory rate or discount for doing so, Rebell added. Also, look to reduce paper clutter by signing up for email statements where possible.\\n\\nThese and other moves to get more organized weren't necessitated by the pandemic, but you might now finally have the time to get it all done.\\n\\nPlan for an unreliable tax refund\\n\\nMany Americans still haven't built up an emergency fund, and the COVID-19 outbreak with widespread job losses didn't help. But there could be a special need to accumulate a cash cushion now because you probably can't count on your annual income-tax refund arriving with as much predictability as in the past.\\n\\nTax refunds are the largest chunk of change many Americans receive all year and a key source of funds to pay down credit card balances and so on. But office-shutting measures to control the virus slowed tax-return processing and the issuance of some refunds by the Internal Revenue Service.\\n\\nTaxpayers shouldn't rely on receiving a refund by a certain date, especially when making major purchases or paying bills, the IRS warned in December. Some tax returns may require additional review, and processing may take longer.\\n\\nThe IRS said it already expects that refunds tied to the earned income tax credit and the additional child tax credit won't be issued before mid-February.\\n\\nMaintain online vigilance\\n\\nThe IRS and other entities have warned of an uptick in cyber scams tied to stimulus payments, coronavirus-relief measures and the like. Given that many of these federal and state programs are new, it's easy to get confused. Plus, more people are shopping online amid the COVID-19 outbreak, raising the odds of falling victim.\\n\\nHence the need to stay alert. Among key points: Be skeptical about offers from unfamiliar companies, avoid clicking on attachments and be wary of unsolicited messages from tax authorities such as the IRS, which doesn't initiate contact this way.\\n\\nAlso, take the opportunity to change passwords to lessen the odds of having an account hacked. Americans don't change their passwords often. Nor do they utilize complex, lengthy passwords. Password manager NordPass said it determined this by examining 275 million passwords, with the help of a data-breach security firm. Of those, only 44% were unique.\\n\\nThe 2020 list of most common passwords was similar to those from 2019. For example, the numerical string 123456 was near the top both years. Other common ones include password, picture1, 111111, qwerty and abc123.\\n\\nReview all your online accounts and delete those you no longer use, NordPass suggests. Favor passwords that are unique, complicated and long.\\n\\nInvest in yourself\\n\\nEven before COVID-19 arrived, many Americans found that their job and financial-literacy skills were lacking. Now might be a good time to take courses or make other personal improvements, especially as so much of this can be done online.\\n\\nWhile people usually think of financial resolutions in terms of saving more or cutting debt, learning and earning more also are important, noted Dana Anspach, a certified financial planner with Sensible Money in Scottsdale, Arizona. Learning is the foundation of both making smarter investment decisions and increasing your earning power, she said.\\n\\nAs with any resolution, Anspach said it's critical to devise a plan to make it happen by defining actionable steps and putting them on a calendar, now. Other helpful tips include having a mentor or accountability buddy and following a course of action for at least three to four weeks, until the new behavior becomes routine.\\n\\nReach Wiles at russ.wiles@arizonarepublic.com."}
{"original": "After its resurrection from the TV graveyard, Last Man Standing is more than living up to the vertical part of its name.\\n\\nThe Tim Allen comedy, canceled by ABC in 2017 after six seasons, could be justified in kicking its heels after a successful revival last year on Fox. It returns for its eighth season with back-to-back episodes Thursday (8 EST/PST).\\n\\nI never really felt we were finished, the Toy Story 4 star says of the cancellation, which came despite solid ratings. When we got (to Fox), the writers seemed like they got new ideas and it was really quite exciting. It was like a new show.\\n\\nLast Man centers on Allen's Mike Baxter, a successful Colorado sporting-goods executive and happily married father of three daughters, whose conservative political views often aren't shared by the rest of the family.\\n\\nSome fans claimed Mike's conservative perspective, a minority viewpoint in scripted TV, was behind ABC's cancellation, but Allen says he doesn't think that's the case. (ABC said it was because of high costs.)\\n\\nThe show's relaunch, which came months after Roseanne and its Trump-supporting lead character soared and then crashed, veered away from President Donald Trump and Washington politics while expressing Mike's political philosophy in his daily life.\\n\\nBack from the dead:Tim Allen's 'Last Man Standing' gets the last laugh in its new home on Fox\\n\\nWe did some anti-Hillary stuff before the (2016) election and Trump was part of a Halloween costume joke that year when the show was still on ABC, Allen says.\\n\\nWe all felt that Clinton was going to win and we had a bunch of fun stuff to make fun of her in a classic sense. And all of a sudden, Trump got elected. We were kind of neutral if not pro-Trump on the show. But now he's president and and we just kind of (shrugged).\\n\\nTrump jokes were so easy and everybody was doing it on talk shows, so we've just kind of left it alone because it's not funny anymore to us, says Allen, who remains busy as a stand-up comedian.\\n\\nAlthough Last Man has never been a favorite with TV critics, it has a devoted following and outperformed its final season on ABC in audience numbers last season, averaging 8.3 million viewers. That made it Fox's most-watched comedy in seven years and the top Friday broadcast show among young adults.\\n\\nAllen passes on I-told-you-so gloating at ABC for reasons that are partly practical. ABC owner Disney bought 20th Century Fox Television, which produces Last Man, and Dana Walden, the Fox executive who resuscitated the series, now heads ABC and Disney Television Studios.\\n\\nThere was no raspberry with a thumb to ABC. It's just the way life is, as is this season's move to Thursday to make room for WWE's SmackDown on Friday, Allen says. We've won already. To stay on in this brutal (TV) world eight seasons is a big deal.\\n\\nThe new season opens with Mike and his wife, Vanessa (Nancy Travis), adjusting to life as empty nesters – save for Hong Kong exchange student Jen (Krista Marie Yu), who arrived last season – and finds eldest daughter Kristin (Amanda Fuller, who had a baby boy in November) pregnant with her second child, making sibling Mandy (Molly McCook) envious.\\n\\nAmanda was pregnant, by a miracle really because she had some conditions that would suggest she couldn't get pregnant. It's a marvelous thing and we (were) able to write that in, Allen says. Mike and Vanessa are dealing with what a lot of parents do with an empty nest, in a fun way. And this couple has to get to know each other.\\n\\nThe conservative perspective of Allen's Mike is still apparent, especially in his signature episode-closing vlog, but he says the show, which brings back guest star Jay Leno as Outdoor Man employee Joe, is more focused on larger political issues as they affect the Baxter family and the Outdoor Man business.\\n\\nEven for those of us who are political, that's not much of our day. Most of our day is getting along and working, our families, (our) kids and the things at their school, he says.\\n\\nLeaning right:Tim Allen on 'Last Man Standing's rare conservative perspective (and why no Trump)\\n\\nThere's still room for relevant, hot-button issues within the Baxters' lives and Allen says writers are working on an episode that will deal with Outdoor Man and guns.\\n\\nThis is a sporting-goods store and an outdoors store, so there are weapons involved and weapons for hunters. These guys have been selling guns. How do they feel about that? Allen says.\\n\\nHowever, Mike, whom Allen says is like Archie Bunker with a college education, can go in surprising directions, too, he says.\\n\\nWe're going to talk about what it is to be a good businessman. Your workers are your family. And then he sounds like Bernie Sanders, he says. I was reading the vlog (script) and I go, 'Good God, I think Bernie Sanders said this yesterday.' \\n\\nBut don't expect Mike to change too much, as new episodes show him needling left-leaning California and taking jabs at the media, including a Don Lemon zinger. He just may not talk about it as often.\\n\\nMike doesn't like government and taxes. And it's really fun to make fun of that, especially in the people's republic of California, where Last Man tapes, he says. We still play with it, but it's like this couple, like some of us would like, have just moved on."}
{"original": "Nicole Auerbach\\n\\nUSA TODAY Sports\\n\\nTAMPA — Steve Sarkisian called himself a bottled-up ball of energy, a coach itching to get back on the sidelines, when he spoke Saturday morning for the first time since being named Alabama's offensive coordinator.\\n\\nHe'll call plays for the Crimson Tide in Monday's national championship game against Clemson, an abrupt personnel change that's unprecedented in a game of this magnitude in college football. He was supposed to take over the role after the end of the postseason; Lane Kiffin was supposed to finish out the postseason with Alabama before moving on to be the head coach at Florida Atlantic. Sarkisian was set to remain an offensive analyst until Kiffin departed.\\n\\nBut after a week of distracting media sessions and an underwhelming-at-times offensive performance in a 24-7 win against Washington in the national semifinal last Saturday, head coach Nick Saban decided to boot Kiffin early, and call Sarkisian up with a week's notice.\\n\\nIt was challenging, before this, in the analyst role, Sarkisian said Saturday at a news conference. You still got to work on the game plan, you still got to work with the coaches and give suggestions and tips when you watch the tape, but it was frustrating as analyst to go out to practice and not coach. You're not doing what you love to do.\\n\\nIf you have SEC pride, stop rooting for Alabama\\n\\nWhat keeps Alabama's Nick Saban motivated?\\n\\nIs Alabama's dominance good for college football?\\n\\nWould Deshaun Watson win a Heisman revote?\\n\\nClemson shores up special teams after 2 key plays turned tide a year ago\\n\\nIt's a lot of note-taking, a lot of watching other coaches coach. To get this opportunity to be back on the field, I feel almost like I was a bottled-up ball of energy. Now, I can get back on the field and do what I love to do.\\n\\nMonday will be the first time Sarkisian has called plays in a game since December 2014. It's also the first time the former USC head coach will be coaching since he stepped away from the sport for about 11 months because of substance abuse problems. Sarkisian said he's doing great, and appreciates everyone's concerns but didn't want to elaborate on personal issues when the focus should be on this Alabama team two days before its championship game.\\n\\nSarkisian said he's spent the past week developing relationships with players, most importantly true freshman quarterback Jalen Hurts, but that not much is that different from a regular game week. He'd worked alongside and sat in meetings with Kiffin to prepare game plans for the past four months, and he'd done the same years ago when they worked together at USC.\\n\\nI haven't made those final decisions you make as a coordinator, Sarkisian said. What, ultimately, are you going to run in those third-and-short situations? What are you going to call when you're on the goal line? What's that first call? You make suggestions when you're in my situation (as an analyst) throughout the week, but when you're calling those plays, you've got to make those calls.\\n\\nHe will call plays from the field and be able to talk to his quarterback face-to-face between drives, which is the setup he prefers. He'll call plays the way he's comfortable, but his familiarity with what Kiffin was doing all season long will come into play, too.\\n\\nWe're not going to re-create the wheel here, Sarkisian said.\\n\\nBy Alabama's offense going no-huddle so frequently, Sarkisian believes that actually makes it easier for him to step into his new role. There's no time for him to second-guess himself on play calling, and the tempo might very well help him get into the rhythm he needs to be in in terms of between-snap substitutions.\\n\\nThe biggest thing was that this was a new system for me, Sarkisian said. There's some carryover that Lane had brought with him that we had years ago — Lane and I hadn't coached together in over 10 years — but what I learned was the system (these last four months). I wanted to dive into it because I really wanted to speak the language. I always liken it to, if you live in the States and somebody puts you on a plane to go live in France, sooner or later you've got to start speaking French.\\n\\nI really tried to learn the system, speak the language, whatever I could to be the most help I could be in whatever role I was in.\\n\\nSaban brought him in at first as an offensive analyst after Sarkisian had visited Tuscaloosa during fall camp. Sarkisian had made visits to other college and NFL programs as well, seeing up close the sport he had missed, and how important it was for him to get back around it. Sarkisian said he knew he'd coach again someday, just didn't know when and where.\\n\\nHe was supposed to do some TV work, but he said he would really like to get involved in a program someplace, and if there was any opportunity for him to do it here … and I liked him in the week that he spent with us, Saban said Saturday. I said, 'There may be some opportunity for you to do that here, but since we play USC first, I'd rather wait until after that game until we do it because I wouldn't want people to think that we're trying to bring you in to create some advantage or whatever.'\\n\\nThat's basically what we did. He was helpful all year long, helping in the planning and assisting in some of the things that we did all year long. I think it worked out well.\\n\\nDitching Lane Kiffin now is a big risk, even for Alabama\\n\\nNick Saban: Lane Kiffin won't be around Alabama for national championship\\n\\nSaban: Sarkisian knows the offense inside and out\\n\\nMonday night is the final step of that process — not just helping to plan, not just suggesting ways to handle certain situations. It's taking full responsibility for the offense in one of the biggest games of his coaching career.\\n\\nLast year, when Alabama met Clemson met with the title at stake, Sarkisian watched at home, happy for Kiffin and the game he was calling, and riveted by all the excitement and twists in an exhilarating game.\\n\\nIt was one of those games you get a little white-knuckled, Sarkisian said, smiling. Because you don't have control of it. As a coach, you always want control.\\n\\nWhich is exactly what he'll have on Monday.\\n\\nHIGHLIGHTS FROM MEDIA DAY"}

He replaces Dennis Hickey, whose two-year tenure with the team ended Saturday on the eve of Miami's finale to yet another dismal season.\\n\\nGrier was raved about Sunday after the Dolphins' finale by owner Stephen Ross and will report to Mike Tannenbaum, the team's executive vice president of football operations — who will oversee the team's search for a new coach.\\n\\nNFL coaching carousel: Breaking down every hire\\n\\nI want to thank Stephen Ross and Mike Tannenbaum for this tremendous opportunity, Grier said.

We've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. While doing this study they took into account the diet being relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease.\\n\\nHere are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity Instagram captions in 2019.\\n\\nKetogenic\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or Keto, diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname Keto Guido on the new seasons of Jersey Shore) have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: 3.1/5 Weight Loss | 1.5/5 Healthy\\n\\nPaleo\\n\\nThe philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: 2.5/5 Weight Loss | 2.7/5 Healthy\\n\\nAlkaline Diet\\n\\nAcid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: 2.1/5 Weight Loss | 3.0/5 Healthy\\n\\nWhole30\\n\\nA popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life. This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: 2.4/5 on Weight Loss | 2.4/5 on Healthy\\n\\nMediterranean\\n\\nThe Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on bad cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy\\n\\nFlexitarian\\n\\nThink of the Flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. The term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. New York Times columnist Mark Bittman (who also wrote VB6: Eat Vegan Before 6:00) has a big role in popularizing this diet. Bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. An easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says Dawn Jackson Blatner, the author of The Flexitarian Diet and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: 3.4/5 on Weight loss | 4.7/5 on Healthy\\n\\nLectin-free\\n\\nWe can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of The Plant Paradox Cookbook by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation. An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.\\n\\nU.S. News & World Report: No ranking available"}

Ri has represented Pyongyang for cross-border military talks since 2006.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe meeting will discuss the North's potential participation in the Winter Olympics being held Feb. 9-25 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, as well as ways to ease the tensions after several months of provocative missile launches by the North and the isolated country's sixth nuclear test in September.\\n\\n\\n\\nBoth sides appear to hope that the Olympics can be a platform for improving relations between the neighbors.\\n\\nMore:Kim Jong Un's purported birthday is no holiday in North Korea\\n\\nMore:China clamps down on North Korea trade as part of U.N. sanctions\\n\\nNorth Korean dictator Kim Jong Un said in a New Year's Day address that the Olympics would be a good occasion to show the greatness of the Korean people and suggested that Pyongyang was willing to send a delegation to the Games.\\n\\n\\n\\nChang Ung, North Korea's representative to the International Olympic Committee, told reporters at Beijing's international airport on Saturday that his country is likely to participate in the Winter Games, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.\\n\\nNorth Korea would likely send figure skating pair Ryom Tae Ok and Kim Ju Sik to the Games. They captured a bronze medal last February at the Asian Winter Games in Japan.\\n\\n\\n\\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae In has repeatedly said he wants the Pyeongchang Olympics to be a means for re-engagement and conflict resolution with the North.\\n\\n\\n\\nI will strive to make the Pyeongchang Olympics the 'Peace Olympics' and furthermore to peacefully resolve the North Korean nuclear issue so that this can be a year when peace is cultivated on the Korean Peninsula, Moon said Friday.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoon also said he wouldn't take a soft stance with the North and vowed to strengthen South Korea's military. I won't be weak-kneed or just focus on dialogue, as we did in the past, Moon said.\\n\\nThe remarks were seen as way to placate conservatives in South Korea, who are skeptical of talks with the North.\\n\\nCritics in South Korea have expressed concern that the North will use the Olympics as a way to skirt international sanctions and try to drive a wedge between Seoul and Washington.\\n\\nThe United States agreed to South Korea's request to delay joint military exercises during the Winter Games last week during a phone call between President Trump and Moon.\\n\\nThe two leaders agreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against North Korea and to not repeat mistakes of the past, the White House said.\\n\\nTrump said over the weekend that he supported North Korean participation in the Olympics and hoped the talks would extend further.\\n\\nI would love to see them take it beyond the Olympics, he said. And at the appropriate time, we'll get involved, Trump added, while at the Camp David presidential retreat Saturday.\\n\\nTrump said he would be willing to speak directly with Kim, but doubled down on his tough talk against North Korea's communist leader.\\n\\nHe knows I'm not messing around, not even a little bit, Trump said.\\n\\nNikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said Trump's comments didn't indicate a change in policy. There is no turnaround, she said Sunday on ABC's This Week.\\n\\nWhat he has basically said is, 'yes, there could be a time where we talk to North Korea, but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place. They have to stop testing. They have to be willing to talk about banning their nuclear weapons.' ... What we're trying to do is make sure we don't repeat what's happened the last 25 years, she said.\\n\\nTuesday's agenda in sorting out matters related to the Olympics includes whether the North's delegation would travel to the Games by land and whether the two Koreas will march under a unified Korean flag during the opening and closing ceremonies.\\n\\nAlso at stake are the costs of accommodations and other expenses. The International Olympic Committee has said it is willing to cover North Korea's costs if Pyongyang takes part in the Games, but some have questioned whether that would violate United Nations sanctions imposed on the North for its missile and nuclear tests.\\n\\nSouth Korea's unification minister, Cho Myoung Gyon, hoped the discussion of the Olympics paves the way for better ties.\\n\\nIt is good that the resumption of inter-Korean talks could set the tone for an improvement in ties between the two Koreas, and better relations could become a small catalyst for helping resolving the North Korean nuclear issue, he told reporters Friday."}

Or Eric Mangini landing on his feet after his New York Jets ended the 2008 season in a tailspin.\\n\\nAFC wild-card matchup previews: Chiefs at Texans, Steelers at Bengals\\n\\nHeck, Rex Ryan was out of work for all of two weeks despite winning 26 games in his last four seasons as Jets coach.

That the mistakes a coach made in his first stop will help him avoid similar pitfalls in the second. Or third. Maybe even fourth.\\n\\nAfter all, Belichick wasn't the second coming of Vince Lombardi when he was in Cleveland. Far from it. Pete Carroll looked as if he was better suited for the college game until he went to Seattle.

{"original": "It's easy to want clarity on what the Philadelphia Eagles have to do following a season that will mercifully end Sunday.\\n\\nBut first, the Eagles have to decide on their quarterback, their head coach and their general manager.\\n\\nOnce they do that, they can decide how to fix a season that went horribly wrong in so many ways.\\n\\nRest assured, something will change on a team that is 4-10-1 heading into its finale against the Washington Football Team on Sunday night. It's even likely that Eagles president and CEO Jeffrey Lurie already knows what he wants to do.\\n\\nWHERE COULD HE GO? Five potential NFL landing spots for Carson Wentz if he leaves Eagles\\n\\nERIC BIENIEMY IS READY TO BE HEAD COACH:Which NFL team will finally take him?\\n\\nThe Eagles' dream has already been messed up.\\n\\nHere is a look at each possible scenario for the Eagles' offseason:\\n\\n1. Keep the status quo\\n\\nThe easiest solution, of course, is for Lurie to keep general manager Howie Roseman, head coach Doug Pederson and quarterback Carson Wentz as the starter.\\n\\nThat way, the Eagles can keep the framework in place in which Wentz remains the franchise quarterback. It will then be up to Roseman to improve the players around him and Pederson to coach them better.\\n\\nThat seems to be the preference of Pederson, who again on Friday expressed confidence that he will return for 2021. He said he will meet with Lurie, as he always does after a season, early next week.\\n\\nBut if Pederson is returning, he said his priority is fixing Wentz, who will finish the season sitting for the last 4 1/2 games while rookie Jalen Hurts took over.\\n\\nWentz completed a career-low 57.4% of his passes before he was benched Dec. 6 in favor of rookie Jalen Hurts. He also threw an NFL-high 15 interceptions and has been sacked a league-high 50 times.\\n\\nIt's a big dropoff from his previous four seasons.\\n\\nI think these last four games have allowed Carson to just kind of take a step back and just evaluate and just see and work on some things that we've helped him with, and things that we continue to help him with as we move forward, Pederson said.\\n\\nThat's probably been the biggest thing that's come out of these last couple of weeks. Listen, I've got a ton of confidence in Carson Wentz and always have. Our offseason is going to be geared towards getting things fixed as quarterbacks, and obviously as a team, and that falls on my shoulder.\\n\\nOn the one hand, the Eagles can make the case that much of Wentz's struggles stemmed from the injury-ravaged offensive line in which Jason Kelce was the only starter to make it through the entire season in addition to a wide receiver corps led by rookies and first-year players.\\n\\nThe Eagles will end up using 14 different line combinations in their 16 games, an NFL record. Two starters – left tackle Andre Dillard and right guard Brandon Brooks – missed the entire season. And three others – right tackle Lane Johnson, left guard Isaac Seumalo and left tackle/right guard Jason Peters – missed at least seven games.\\n\\nPeters, who will turn 39 years old in January, is the only one in that group who's not expected back.\\n\\nI look at the injuries and that's something we've got to talk about in the offseason, Pederson said. We've got to discuss that and see if I need to change up practice or if I need to maybe practice harder or be more physical in training camp.\\n\\nThe quarterback, whether it's Wentz or Hurts, will also have an entire offseason with young receivers in Jalen Reagor, John Hightower and Quez Watkins.\\n\\nThat didn't happen last spring because of the pandemic.\\n\\nThe more you do things, the more repetition, the more chemistry, is always better, Reagor said. Getting an offseason, being able to do OTAs, will only make us better because we'll be around each other more, so it's kind of self-explanatory.\\n\\nBut if Lurie truly believes in Roseman and Pederson – they did lead the Eagles to their first-ever Super Bowl victory just three years ago – he could bring in a senior-type adviser to help with the draft, free agency and other type of decisions.\\n\\nHe could also force Pederson to give up play-calling duties on offense. Pederson has been reluctant to give up play-calling duties in the past, even though he admitted doing just that from time to time during the season.\\n\\n2. Fire Roseman\\n\\nRoseman's draft record has been spotty at best since he got full control over personnel decisions in 2016.\\n\\nTo his credit, Roseman hit on all five his 2018 draft picks, most notably with tight end Dallas Goedert and defensive end Josh Sweat, along with running back Miles Sanders in the second round of 2019.\\n\\nBut he also missed badly on several others, most notably with cornerbacks Sidney Jones and Rasul Douglas in the second and third rounds, respectively, of the 2017 draft, and wide receiver J.J. Arcega-Whiteside in the second round of 2019.\\n\\nThose misses are glaringly evident on this team.\\n\\nThe most egregious part about Arcega-Whiteside, who was a healthy scratch in four games this season, is that Seattle took DK Metcalf seven picks after Arcega-Whiteside. Metcalf has 1,282 yards receiving this season. Arcega-Whiteside has 45.\\n\\nAnd while Reagor has a chance to be a good NFL wide receiver, Roseman, picking 21st in the first round, took Reagor over Justin Jefferson, who went with the very next pick to the Minnesota Vikings.\\n\\nJefferson has 1,267 yards receiving while Reagor, who missed five games to have thumb surgery, has 381.\\n\\nBut Roseman's problems don't stop there.\\n\\nThe Eagles are expected to be as much as $70 million over the salary cap in 2021, meaning that they'll have little flexibility to go after a marquee free agent even after releasing several veterans and/or restructuring contracts.\\n\\nWentz's contract, meanwhile, is quickly becoming an albatross. If the Eagles were to release Wentz, he would count $59.2 million in dead money against the salary cap. That would add another $25 million to their estimated $70 million cap deficit.\\n\\nIf they were to trade Wentz, the Eagles would still be on the hook for a $34 million dead money charge for 2021.\\n\\nThe Eagles experienced a similar situation with wide receiver Alshon Jeffery this season. He would have counted $26 million in dead money had he been released last spring. Ideally, that would have happened because Jeffery was already in decline and coming off foot surgery.\\n\\nInstead, the Eagles kept Jeffery, even as he missed eight games to start the season. He has just six catches for 115 yards in seven games. Roseman also traded for DeSean Jackson in the spring of 2019. He will end up playing in only eight of a possible 33 games.\\n\\nA new general manager would certainly have quite a mess to clean up.\\n\\nThe Eagles have 12 players who will count at least $10 million against the salary cap next season. That means that many veterans, such as tight end Zach Ertz, Jeffery, Jackson, defensive tackle Malik Jackson, likely won't be returning.\\n\\nBut it could also mean defensive tackle Fletcher Cox, defensive end Brandon Graham, right tackle Lane Johnson and perhaps even right guard Brandon Brooks will have to rework their contracts in order to stay.\\n\\nPerhaps that new GM is already on staff as the NFL Network reported last week that former Kansas City Chiefs and Cleveland Browns GM John Dorsey has been working as a consultant for the past few months.\\n\\nIf there is a change at general manager, whether it's Dorsey or someone else, that will likely mean a new coach is coming, too. Then again, if it's Dorsey, it's possible that Pederson could stay. Pederson was the offensive coordinator under Andy Reid when Dorsey was the general manager in Kansas City.\\n\\nStill, if the franchise goes with a new general manager and head coach, it's likely the Eagles might be trying to get high enough in the draft to take a quarterback in either Ohio State's Justin Fields or BYU's Zach Wilson, assuming that Clemson's Trevor Lawrence will go first overall to Jacksonville.\\n\\nBut that also means at least a few years of rebuilding, a luxury that Roseman and Pederson likely won't get even if they do return.\\n\\n3. Fire Pederson\\n\\nIt's possible that Lurie could decide that a coaching change is necessary.\\n\\nOn the one hand, Wentz had by far his worst season, and Pederson either couldn't or wouldn't get him on the move more; Pederson said earlier in the season that Wentz was dynamic.\\n\\nThen there was this from Sanders when asked what went wrong this season: Just not a lot of smart football throughout the whole season through all positions, throughout the team. As far as offensively, not very good execution from everybody, including myself, a lot of turnovers, including myself. I feel like a lot of things went wrong.\\n\\nPederson didn't have a lot to work with, and it's safe to say that no one expected Wentz to regress as much as he did.\\n\\nOn the other hand, if Lurie and/or Roseman were to determine that Hurts is the answer at quarterback, then perhaps Lurie might want to go after Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley, who coached Hurts in 2019, one year after he coached Kyler Murray, who's now a rising star with the Arizona Cardinals.\\n\\nLurie has always envisioned the Eagles as an innovative, cutting-edge offensive team. It's why he hired Chip Kelly as head coach in 2013 after watching Kelly's fast-paced offense at Oregon.\\n\\nBefore that, it was Andy Reid and his west coast offense that he learned from Mike Holmgren, who was a disciple of Bill Walsh.\\n\\nEven Pederson fit that bill when he was hired in 2016.\\n\\nSo if Lurie and/or Roseman were to determine that quarterbacks who can throw and run, such as Hurts and Murray, are the wave of the future, then it's quite possible that he would want an innovative young coach to develop Hurts.\\n\\nIf it's not Riley, then it could be Chiefs current offensive coordinator under Reid in Eric Bienemy. After all, they have helped Patrick Mahomes become the top quarterback in the NFL.\\n\\nBut there will be changes, whether it's in players, Pederson's coaching staff, Pederson himself, or the front-office structure.\\n\\nEven the players know this.\\n\\nI would love for everybody to be here, but this is the way this business is, Sanders said. We're going to have a whole different team next year and that's how it is every year.\\n\\nHonestly, I wish everybody could stay ... I hope I'm still here.\\n\\nSanders' return is one of the few things that's practically guaranteed.\\n\\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com. Follow on Twitter @Mfranknfl."}

With his case scheduled to move to trial in January, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if U.S. officials will even be able to help Josh in legal proceedings. The Venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that Josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\\n\\nThe tragedy is that Josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. I know Josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. As a case in point, Josh served for two years as a Mormon missionary in Washington prior to his marriage. It was in this setting that he learned Spanish and developed a deep love for the Hispanic people, culture and customs. That he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of Venezuela, is unthinkable.\\n\\nFrom the time of Josh's arrest last year, I have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. I have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with Venezuelan authorities. I even raised the issue of Josh's captivity with President Trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on Venezuela and called on President Nicolas Maduro to set Josh free.\\n\\nAs a leader looking to do what is good and just, President Maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of Josh and Thamy on humanitarian grounds. This action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. With this gesture of goodwill, the governments of Venezuela and the United States could move forward together towards a better future.\\n\\nThe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and I invite President Maduro to take the first step. Doing so would bring relief to the Holt family and usher in a new era of U.S.-Venezuela relations, initiating a conversation from which both nations could benefit.\\n\\nMore:The second 'Persian Spring' is upon us. Here's how we can make it last.\\n\\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\\n\\nVenezuela and the United States have significant policy differences, to be sure. But working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent American and his wife, who is herself a native of Venezuela. Josh and Thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.\\n\\nAs the senior member and former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I recognize the importance of state sovereignty and of a fair judicial process. But I believe just as strongly in protecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice.\\n\\nThat's why President Maduro should release Josh and Thamy Holt. He must honor human life and recognize longstanding international conventions.\\n\\nI call on him to help us bring Josh home.\\n\\nOrrin Hatch is the senior senator from Utah, and president pro tempore of the United States Senate."}
{"original": "Wendy R. Sherman\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. He was forced to postpone his trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in Iraq. As fraught as Pompeo's visit to Kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, Iraq trumped Kyiv after the New Year's Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.\\n\\nIt is President Donald Trump's failed policy toward Iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.\\n\\nIraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure. But Iraq also created strange bedfellows. The U.S. troops worked alongside Iraqi and Iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the Islamic State terrorism group. And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq, where Tehran holds considerable sway.\\n\\nThat uneasy balance was destroyed when Trump withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, better known as the Iran nuclear deal. Like other critics of the agreement, Trump believed it should have resolved all of America's issues with Iran. Trump believed we were giving Tehran benefits without a requisite return. He thought a maximum pressure campaign would ultimately bring Iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.\\n\\nTrump policies devastate US interests\\n\\nLike much of Trump's national security and foreign policy, his Iran approach is tactical and not strategic. The results have been devastating to U.S. interests. Iran's most extreme hard-liners, the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and Quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the United States couldn't be trusted to honor any agreement.\\n\\nIran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. Indeed, the IRGC has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under Trump's sanctions. And Iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.\\n\\nLearning to manage conflict:As Iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?\\n\\nIn Iraq, Iranian-backed militia, led by Kataeb Hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the Iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. A rocket attack by the Kataeb Hezbollah militia last Friday killed an American contractor and injured many. The Trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the New Year's Eve attack on our embassy.\\n\\nMost would agree that the United States had to respond in some way to the death of an American, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.\\n\\nRegardless, if the Trump administration really understood the dynamics of Iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the U.S. Embassy. Administration officials might have worked more closely with the Iraq government to think through the best way forward. Instead, in essence, Trump walked into Iran's trap.\\n\\nFor many Americans, the Baghdad militia chants of Death to America echoed the takeover of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.\\n\\nIran nuclear deal was solid progress\\n\\nThe immediate emergency at our embassy in Baghdad has subsided. Kataeb Hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to America. They want the 5,000 U.S. troops out of Iraq.\\n\\nNonetheless, perhaps even Pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.\\n\\nTrump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw American troops from just about everywhere. But a withdrawal from Iraq at this moment only serves Iran's desire to exert greater control over Iraq. To much of the world, it would signal U.S. disengagement and weakness — not strength.\\n\\nEven some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.\\n\\nDiplomatic amateur hour:Sondland's impeachment testimony proves Trump foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns\\n\\nConcerted action to curtail Iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of Americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. Had Trump stayed in the Iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the U.S. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge Iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.\\n\\nThree years into his presidency, Donald Trump owns the events and outcomes in Iraq and Iran, as he does in North Korea, Afghanistan, Venezuela, the Middle East, Russia, China and Hong Kong. Having diminished our State Department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.\\n\\nThe president may like it that way, but a change in his secretary of State's travel plans won't be enough to save the day, let alone the decade.\\n\\nWendy R. Sherman, a professor and the director of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard Kennedy School, was undersecretary of State for political affairs from 2011-15 and led U.S. negotiations on the Iran nuclear deal.

{"original": "WASHINGTON – Marking a dramatic conclusion to a bitter election, Vice President Mike Pence is set to preside Wednesday over a special joint session of Congress that will cement President-elect Joe Biden's election win – and a loss for President Donald Trump and himself.\\n\\nThe scene sets the stage for perhaps the most contentious electoral vote count in 144 years after Trump worked two months to overturn Biden's Nov. 3 election victory.\\n\\nThe usually perfunctory joint sessions have had past moments of tension. Vice President Al Gore oversaw his presidential election loss against George W. Bush after a fiercely fought recount battle in Florida decided by the Supreme Court.\\n\\nAudiotape:Trump is heard on recording pressuring Georgia secretary of state to 'find' votes\\n\\nAs Trump encourages protests Wednesday in Washington – and Republicans in Congress oppose certification – this year's session could be the most divisive since the election of 1876.\\n\\nFurther heightening the tensions is an audiotape obtained by The Washington Post in which Trump pressures Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse his loss to Biden in Georgia.\\n\\nAt Wednesday's joint session of Congress, Pence, serving in his capacity as president of the Senate, will be tasked with opening the electoral certificates from each state alphabetically to count the votes. At the session's conclusion, Pence, like Gore 20 years ago, is supposed to announce the winner.\\n\\nBiden defeated Trump 306-232 in the Electoral College vote Dec. 14,but procedural fireworks are expected throughout. A faction of House Republicans, led by Mo Brooks, R-Ala., intends to object to electoral votes from some states. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and 10 other senators said they will sign on to the objections.\\n\\nMore:A dozen Republican senators plan to object to certification of Biden's election win over Trump\\n\\nThe effort lacks the votes in the Democratic-controlled House and the Republican-led Senate. Although it wouldn't be the first time a president-elect's electoral votes were contested by members of the opposing party – it happened in 2001, 2005 and 2017, each led by Democrats – none of these instances had the level of Republican resistance expected Wednesday.\\n\\nHere are some of the past dramatic and controversial moments in Congress' counting of Electoral College votes:\\n\\n1877: Hayes-Tilden dispute comes close to constitutional crisis\\n\\nThe election of 1876, won by Republican Rutherford B. Hayes over Democrat Samuel Tilden, remains the most fiercely contested in U.S. history – even after the 2000 election and last November's election.\\n\\n'It really is over now': The 24 hours that probably thwarted Trump's effort to overturn the election\\n\\nThe two parties in Florida, South Carolina, Louisiana and Oregon both claimed victories and submitted electoral votes from rival slates of electors, presenting a constitutional crisis before Congress.\\n\\nA fight also ensued over the electoral votes of Vermont, won by Hayes but contested by Tilden.\\n\\nCongress established a bipartisan electoral commission to reach a solution. Through the Compromise of 1877, Hayes emerged the winner after he appeased Southern Democrats by agreeing to pull federal troops out of the South and ushering in the end of Reconstruction.\\n\\n'The moment of truth': The Electoral College prepares to hand Trump the loss he refuses to accept\\n\\nHayes won Vermont, Florida, South Carolina and Louisiana, leading him to a 185-184 electoral win, the narrowest in U.S. history.\\n\\nWe came within two days of having simultaneous inauguration ceremonies, which would have been intolerable because you can't have two presidents, said Ned Foley, director of the election law program at Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law. It was a very dicey situation.\\n\\n1961: Nixon declares rival Kennedy the winner\\n\\nVice President Richard Nixon, who lost to Democrat John F. Kennedy in the presidential election months before, presided over the joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 1961, that declared his rival Kennedy the winner.\\n\\nKennedy won the popular vote by a narrow 113,000 votes and the Electoral College by a wider 303-219. The Republican Party challenged results in 11 states.\\n\\nThe only state that had an outcome change was Hawaii – from Nixon to Kennedy. The state initially certified Nixon as the winner, but a post-election recount found Kennedy won Hawaii by 115 votes.\\n\\nIt meant votes from rival slates of Hawaii electors – one for Kennedy, the other for Nixon – were presented to Congress. Nixon, as president of the Senate, counted Hawaii's three electoral votes for Kennedy and recognized the Massachusetts Democrat as the new president.\\n\\nSpeaking from the House chair, Nixon noted it was the first time in 100 years that a candidate for president was forced to announce the result of an election that he lost. He said he could not think of a more striking and eloquent example of the stability of our constitutional system.\\n\\nIn our campaigns, no matter how hard fought they may be, no matter how close the election may turn out to be, those who lose accept the verdict and support those who win, Nixon said. It is in that spirit that I now declare that John F. Kennedy has been elected President of the United States, and Lyndon B. Johnson vice president of the United States.\\n\\n1969: VP Humphrey misses vote for Nixon\\n\\nLike Nixon and Gore, Vice President Hubert Humphrey was in line to preside over the certification of his own loss in 1969. Nixon defeated Humphrey in the election in 1968.\\n\\nBut Humphrey, the Democratic vice president of Lyndon B. Johnson, did not attend the joint congressional session. It's the most recent time in U.S. history that the Senate speaker pro tempore, Sen. Richard Russell, D-Ga., had to fill in for the vice president as Congress counted electoral votes.\\n\\n'Democracy prevailed': Joe Biden passes 270-vote threshold to win Electoral College\\n\\nHumphrey was in Oslo, Norway, attending the funeral of Trygve Lie, the first elected secretary-general of the United Nations.\\n\\nIf Pence were to miss the joint session, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the speaker pro tempore, would lead the meeting.\\n\\nThe session on Jan. 6, 1969, had another distinction: Rep. James O'Hara, D-Mich., filed the first formal objection to the Electoral College count in U.S. history when he opposed one of North Carolina's 13 electoral votes that went to segregationist George Wallace. Sen. Edmund Muskie, D-Maine, Humphrey's running-mate, signed on.\\n\\nThe vote for Wallace came from a faithless North Carolina elector who was pledged to vote for Nixon. O'Hara's effort failed in the Senate and House, and the single electoral vote went to Wallace.\\n\\n2001: Gore declares Bush the winner and gavels down objections\\n\\nAs Democrats decried that a conservative Supreme Court robbed their candidate of a win in Florida, Gore presided over the certification of his loss against Bush in 2001.\\n\\nIt came less than one month after Gore, who won the popular vote over Bush by 540,000 votes, lost when the Supreme Court stopped recount efforts in Florida. Bush won the state by 537 votes.\\n\\nMembers of the Congressional House Black Caucus spent 20 minutes objecting as they sought to block Florida's 25 electoral votes. Each time, Gore slammed his gavel to quiet his House allies.\\n\\nAny objections to votes submitted by a state's electoral slates require support from one House member and one senator to be considered. No senator signed on to their effort.\\n\\nThe whole number of electors appointed to vote for president of the United States is 538, of which a majority is 270, Gore said as he declared his opponent the winner. George W. Bush, of the state of Texas, has received for president of the United States 271 votes. Al Gore, of the state of Tennessee, has received 266 votes.\\n\\nHe added, May God bless our new president and our new vice president, and may God bless the United States of America.\\n\\n2005: Sen. Boxer signs on to House objection\\n\\nIn the joint meeting of Congress to certify Bush's win over Democrat John Kerry, Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, received a Senate signature to object to the electoral votes from Ohio.\\n\\nIt came from Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The two Democrats raised concerns about voting irregularities. Kerry said he did not support the effort.\\n\\nIf a senator signs onto a House objection of the electoral votes, the two chambers will meet for no more than two hours before voting on the objections. The same would happen Wednesday if Hawley, Cruz and other Republican senators object to Biden's victory in a state.\\n\\nI hate inconveniencing my friends, but I believe it is worth a couple of hours to shine some light on these issues, Boxer said at the joint sessions led by Vice President Dick Cheney.\\n\\nTheir objection lost handily, receiving just one vote in the Senate – Boxer's – and 31 votes in the House, all from Democrats.\\n\\n2017: Biden to Democrats: 'It is over'\\n\\nFour years ago, on Jan. 6, 2017, the roles were somewhat reversed from this week's dynamics: Biden presided over Trump's win over Democrat Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nHalf a dozen Democratic House members raised formal objections to the Electoral College vote count, but they lacked the backing of any senators. Biden repeatedly slammed the gavel on debate, saying the objections could not be entertained.\\n\\nThe objections were based on Russian election interference, allegations of voter suppression or what Democrats considered to be illegal votes cast by Republican members of the Electoral College.\\n\\nRep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., said, Mr. President, even as people waited hours in Georgia...\\n\\nBiden stopped her: There is no debate. There is no debate. If there is not one signed by a senator, the objection cannot be entertained.\\n\\nJayapal responded: Mr. President, the objection is signed by a member of the House but not yet by a member of the Senate.\\n\\nIt is over, Biden said as Republicans applauded.\\n\\nReach Joey Garrison on Twitter @joeygarrison."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nATLANTA (AP) — The College Football Playoff is here to stay.\\n\\nThe national championship game is still trying to make its mark.\\n\\nThe 4-year-old title game remains a bit of an afterthought compared to the well-entrenched bowl system, from its lack of a catchy name to its scattered timing to its scaled-backed format.\\n\\nEvery sport has its elements that fans might want to change or tweak or adjust, said Burke Magnus, ESPN's executive vice president from programming and scheduling. College football may have a few of those as well.\\n\\nThe four-team playoff began with the 2014 season, replacing a BCS system that matched the top two teams in a national championship game while leaving the bowls largely unchanged.\\n\\nNow, the six major bowls — Rose, Sugar, Cotton, Orange, Peach and Fiesta — rotate a pair of semifinal games that are generally played on New Year's Day, long the traditional end to the college football season.\\n\\nThe four major bowls that are not semifinals each year essentially divvy up the best of the non-playoff teams, also creating some attractive matchups. And, of course, the remaining bowls — a staggering 33 in all this season — are still around to provide a smorgasbord of postseason games/television programming from mid-December to the first day of the new year.\\n\\nBy the time the national championship game rolls around — Monday night's Alabama-Georgia matchup falls exactly a week after the semifinals, though the timing varies from year to year — it almost feels extraneous to the season.\\n\\nBill Hancock, executive director of the College Football Playoff, doesn't view it that way.\\n\\nWe see it as a three-game package, he said. The championship game becomes the iconic event. It is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\\n\\nThis season's semifinal games were highlighted by a thrilling Rose Bowl , in which Georgia rallied to beat Oklahoma 54-48 in a double overtime. The television ratings were huge, an average of 27 million viewers across ESPN and ESPN2 — a 39 percent increase over last year's early semifinal.\\n\\nThe ratings dipped for the nightcap, Alabama's methodical 24-6 victory Clemson in a rematch of the last two national championship games, but the 21.1 million viewers were still a 10 percent increase over the previous year's second semifinal.\\n\\nThe national championship game will surely surpass the Sugar Bowl ratings, but it may have a hard time matching those Rose Bowl numbers — especially given the all-Southeastern Conference title game.\\n\\nLast year's national championship game drew about 26.7 million viewers.\\n\\nThe semifinals are obviously important, SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey said. This year, you had two traditional games on New Year's Day that I think magnified it.\\n\\nBut, he quickly added, I don't look at this game as taking a back seat to anything.\\n\\nThe TV ratings highlight some of the challenges facing the championship game.\\n\\nNew Year's Day remains the capper to the season for many college football fans. Most of them have the day off from work and it's simply ingrained in the culture to cap off the holiday season by plopping in front of the television to take in games that stretch from morning to midnight. The Rose Bowl, which traditionally kicks off late afternoon Eastern time, is almost guaranteed huge ratings.\\n\\nThe Rose Bowl has the best television window in sports, Magnus said. Ever. Period. Not college football. Sports.\\n\\nThe national championship game is a prime-time affair, which provides a ratings boost, but there are plenty of other viewing options on a Monday night. And since many people have to work the next morning, the lack of a competitive game can be a real drain on the numbers.\\n\\nThe format of the national championship game also gives off a vibe that this game isn't as important as the bowls, which are played while schools are on their holiday breaks. Teams often spend up to a week at the bowl sites, meeting incessantly with the media and taking part in a wide range of promotional and charity events.\\n\\nBut, with classes resuming at the start of the new year, the national championship game is merely a long weekend . The teams arrive on Friday, hold one big session with the media on Saturday, get in their last practice, and then turn their attention to the game.\\n\\nOrganizers have attempted to spice things up for the fans.\\n\\nIn Atlanta, a series of concerts was held throughout the weekend at Centennial Olympic Park, though frigid weather put a damper on things. Borrowing a page from the Super Bowl, breakout star Kendrick Lamar is set to perform as part of the title game's first-ever halftime performance.\\n\\nStill, the College Football Playoff is up against some of the same issues as the Final Four in men's basketball.\\n\\nFor hoops fans, there's nothing like the Saturday semifinals, with back-to-back games a mere half-hour apart, matching the four best teams in the land. The national championship game, played two nights later in the same venue, often comes across as a letdown.\\n\\nThat's even more of an issue for college football. Over its first four years, the championship game has been held anywhere from week to 11 days after the semifinals, a gap will continue to vary from year to year depending on how the calendar shakes out. Organizers are still tinkering with the format.\\n\\nIn 2019, for instance, the Peach and Fiesta semifinal games are set to be played on Saturday, Dec. 28. The championship game will be held on Jan. 13 — a whopping 15 days later.\\n\\nHancock believes time will settle many of the issues facing the championship game.\\n\\nThis'll be the 80th year of the Final Four. It's the fourth CFP, he said. I'm really proud of the position where we are.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP College Football Writer Ralph Russo contributed to this report.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at www.twitter.com/pnewberry1963 .

{"original": "FRISCO, Texas — The Cowboys, after a week of uncertainty, announced Sunday evening that Jason Garrett's contract will not be extended.\\n\\nNo, the official statement from Jerry Jones did not say the Cowboys were firing—or even terminating—their head coach of the last decade.\\n\\nBut for the first time in more than 12 years, Garrett is no longer an employee of the Dallas Cowboys.\\n\\nThe Cowboys said the team would not seek a new agreement on a contract extension with Garrett. Jones included a statement thanking Garrett for more than 20 years with the Cowboys as a player, assistant coach and then head coach.\\n\\nJason Garrett's legacy with the Dallas Cowboys will always be that of someone who strived for greatness every day that he walked through the door, and as someone who instilled the virtues of enthusiasm, hard work and appreciation for the profession in all of the men who played with him and for him, Jones said in the statement. He is, and always will remain, a cherished member of the Dallas Cowboys family.\\n\\nGarrett texted his assistant coaches shortly after the team released a statement, a person familiar with the situation told USA TODAY Sports on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly comment on Garrett's message. The head coach thanked his assistants for their time, reiterating his pride in what they accomplished during the Cowboys' 8-8 2019 season and prior campaigns.\\n\\nAssistants were not formally notified about Garrett's future before Jones' statement to reporters, the person said. Even coaches whose contracts expired earlier last week continued to report to the Star on Friday after their contracts ended. Not until Saturday were they told by text message they no longer needed to come in. This was all part of a curious timeline that led to the team interviewing ex-NFL coaches Marvin Lewis and Mike McCarthy, per multiple reports, before officially announcing Garrett's exit Sunday during the third quarter of the wild-card game between the Eagles and Seahawks.\\n\\nBut Jones had long hinted at a departure. The Cowboys chose not to extend Garrett before 2019 as he coached the final season of his five-year deal.\\n\\nOPINION:Here's where the Cowboys should look for their next head coach\\n\\nDuring the season, too, Jones consistently suggested Garrett's future with the Cowboys wasn't a given. He praised coaches who beat the Cowboys in the aftermath of losses. He declared that Dallas got outcoached following a 13-9 November loss in New England. He told USA TODAY's Jarrett Bell in December that generally, my radar is turned on to other coaching candidates. Jones praised coaches like Urban Meyer and Baylor's Matt Rhule, also giving the not-so-convincing vote of confidence that Garrett will be coaching in the NFL next year.\\n\\nThe Cowboys part ways with their nine-year coach after he completed his fourth 8-8 season with the club. The Cowboys crushed the Redskins 47-16 to end the season, but Dallas still finished outside the playoff picture. Garrett had been the longest-tenured head coach in the NFL who had not won a Super Bowl and second-longest-tenured coach in franchise history.\\n\\nGarrett's Cowboys went 85-67 from when he became the interim coach in November 2010 and then assumed the mantle in 2011. Dallas won its division in three of the last six seasons but never advanced past the divisional round. Since the Cowboys' three Super Bowls in the 1990s, the team hasn't even advanced to a conference championship in 24 years.\\n\\nThat measuring stick was important to both Jerry Jones and vice president Stephen Jones, the two said at training camp in July, as Garrett entered the final season of his five-year contract without an extension. The Joneses stated their roster was more talented than the 2018 club that went 10-6, then beat the Seahawks in the wild-card round. They wanted postseason production to reflect that belief.\\n\\nThe Cowboys started the season hot with the first 3-0 open of Garrett's career. But games against the struggling Giants, Redskins and Dolphins weren't indicative of how the Cowboys would perform against playoff contenders. Dallas beat just two teams with a winning record and never again won in consecutive weeks after the 3-0 start. They raced to the league's best offense,averaging 431.5 yards per game. But four times they dropped matches by 4 points or fewer.\\n\\nYou want to be able to handle yourself well at those critical moments and we've done a good job in that in the past, Garrett said. Sometimes this year we have not done a good enough job.\\n\\nNFL NEWSLETTER:Sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\\n\\nEven so, Jones longed for Garrett to shepherd what the front office considered a talented roster over the hump. Garrett has been a long-term, very important, pleasant part of my life, Jones said in a more than 29-minute session with reporters on Dec. 29. If he's coaching 10 more years for the Cowboys or if he's not, he's done that. We've had that kind of life together.\\n\\nIn a weak NFC East, Jones maintained hope for a fairy-tale turnaround. The Cowboys starters stayed mostly healthy through the season. Quarterback Dak Prescott posted career bests with 4,902 yards and 30 touchdowns, and the offensive line allowing the fewest percentage of sacks on dropbacks of any team this season.\\n\\nDallas failed to translate that good fortune to wins.\\n\\nIt cost Garrett his job.\\n\\nPlayers said they couldn't focus too much on criticism of Garrett.\\n\\nHe's not the only one getting criticized, defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence said after the Cowboys lost control of the NFC East in December. We're all getting criticized.\\n\\nAdded Prescott of Garrett's expiring contract: I think it's the last game on my [contract] as well so I'll be damned if I speak on anybody else's future or their place.\\n\\nEven Garrett declined to entertain speculation, maintaining that he did not think about his future much and would not yet. The coach who always told his Cowboys players to focus on the moment — to have a good Wednesday, to ready for one good series, to think only about the immediate next opponent — said he thought not a whole lot about his future. Absolutely he wanted to continue coaching in the NFL and, if possible, with the Cowboys.\\n\\nBut I have no idea, he said, if he would get that opportunity.\\n\\nHe knows now.\\n\\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Jori Epstein on Twitter @JoriEpstein.\\n\\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

{"original": "David Swanson\\n\\nReviewed.com\\n\\nIntroduced in 2012, Dolby Atmos introduced moviegoers to immersive, three-dimensional audio. Many consumers may be aware of the name, but aren't quite sure how it works, what the requirements are, or how to bring it into their home theater systems. Samsung came to CES this year on a mission to change that.\\n\\nWith Dolby Atmos, during the mixing for a film or video game, engineers record and isolate each individual sound — from birds chirping to tires squealing — and convert them into an object. Each sound object is then assigned a particular location within the theater from which to emanate, using one or more speakers to establish the location.\\n\\nHands-On With Samsung's Wireless Dolby Atmos Soundbar\\n\\nWhat this means is that sounds are no longer two-dimensional, coming from one plane—left, right, or behind the viewer—but instead seem to come from all over the room. As many as 128 discrete audio tracks are isolated for theaters, requiring up to 64 speakers—a dealbreaker for even the most hardcore home audio enthusiasts. To bring Dolby Atmos home, the industry came up with upward-firing speakers, which allow audio to bounce off the ceiling. This helps blanket the room with sound, replicating much of the movie theater experience.\\n\\nAlthough various manufacturers have licensed the Dolby Atmos name for home speaker systems over the past year, at CES Samsung Electronics introduced a first-ever wireless soundbar package utilizing Dolby Atmos technology: the HW-K950. We took a look, and bent an ear.\\n\\nTo be clear, this is not just another soundbar.\\n\\nBuilding on Samsung's Wireless Audio 360 series, the HW-K950 is both Samsung's first soundbar to feature Dolby Atmos and the industry's first soundbar package to include a pair of Atmos-capable wireless rear speakers in the box. Combined, the set-up delivers powerful 5.4.1-channel sound that envelops viewers from all sides.\\n\\nComing in at 47 inches wide, the soundbar is 3.25 inches in height (not 2.1 inches tall, as reported elsewhere), making it well-suited to TVs 55 inches or larger. Three of the HW-K950's five speakers fire out, toward the viewers, and two project upwards.\\n\\nThe subwoofer is wireless (though it plugs in for power), and measures 17.75 inches in height. Two rear speakers measure a modest 7.75 inches high and each has two forward and two upwards-firing speakers. At CES, Samsung had a looped demo playing for the crowd in a small room near its main booth, but due to crowd noise and tight quarters it wasn't a real, fair test of the system's audio capabilities.\\n\\nThe key innovation here is the wireless design, which means you don't have to worry about hiding messy speaker wire. This also opens up new speaker placement options, which is important since speaker positioning is a vital component of optimal Dolby Atmos playback.\\n\\nThe soundbar package is only available in black for now, but Samsung says it's continuing to expand the array of colors and styles for additional speakers, and the company promises an improved app for phones, tablets, and Gear S and S2 smartwatches, for multi-room speaker placements.\\n\\nOne potential drawback is that the system is not compatible with the competing audio technology, DTS:X. But initial releases for home video appear to be encoded with both formats, so this may not be an issue—especially assuming the Dolby format is supported long-term.\\n\\nThe three-dimensional effect of Dolby Atmos produces a more realistic audio environment that attentive moviegoers can't help but notice. While existing movie theaters have been slow to invest in the technology in the U.S., filmmakers are eager to utilize Dolby Atmos. Dolby says several dozen movies and TV series have been released for home consumption in the format — a number sure to multiply in the months to come. Video games, like Star Wars: Battlefront, have also begun to capitalize on the increased spatial freedom.\\n\\nConsumers have also been hesitant to upgrade to Dolby Atmos at home. The technology requires not just receiver upgrades, but new speakers as well. Samsung's complete HW-K950 package delivers 5.1.4-channel sound and wireless satellites, and additional wireless speakers are available in patterns and colors that make them easier to integrate into home environments. In short, the HW-K950 appears to offer a practical and seamless solution for most living rooms. It's an attractive option for audio enthusiasts who have ruled out ceiling-fitted speakers at home.\\n\\nKeep in mind you'll still need to pony up for a Dolby Atmos compatible receiver, and pricing and a ship date for the HW-K950 have not yet been announced. While we're guessing it won't be cheap, at least the good news is you won't have to invest in a new Blu-ray player at the same time.\\n\\nFor more in-depth CES coverage, head to Reviewed.com."}

{"original": "USA TODAY\\n\\nYou're reading the Opposing View, one of two perspectives in Today's Debate. For Our View, read The choice between democracy and Trump is easy.\\n\\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, declined to provide an opposing view. Excerpts from the statement sent by Cruz and 10 other Republican senators:\\n\\nOn January 6, it is incumbent on Congress to vote on whether to certify the 2020 election results. That vote is the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud.\\n\\nAt that quadrennial joint session, there is long precedent of Democratic members of Congress raising objections to presidential election results, as they did in 1969, 2001, 2005, and 2017. And, in both 1969 and 2005, a Democratic senator joined with a Democratic House member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged.\\n\\nThe most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877, following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the Hayes-Tilden presidential race. Specifically, the elections in three states — Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina — were alleged to have been conducted illegally.\\n\\nIn 1877, Congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. Instead, Congress appointed an Electoral Commission — consisting of five Senators, five House Members, and five Supreme Court Justices — to consider and resolve the disputed returns.\\n\\nWe should follow that precedent. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\\n\\nAccordingly, we intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not regularly given and lawfully certified (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed.\\n\\nWe are not naive. We fully expect most if not all Democrats, and perhaps more than a few Republicans, to vote otherwise. But support of election integrity should not be a partisan issue. A fair and credible audit — conducted expeditiously and completed well before January 20 — would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next president. We owe that to the people."}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nASHBURN, Va. (AP) — Will Compton figured the Washington Redskins' defense wouldn't be a quick fix, and he was right.\\n\\nThe middle linebacker hoped for the best, but the unit ranked 28th in the NFL for the second straight year as its struggles contributed to what coach Jay Gruden called a barely above average 8-7-1 season. Slow starts and inconsistent offense hurt Washington down the stretch, but retooling the defense — again — is a top priority.\\n\\nCornerbacks Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland and linebacker Ryan Kerrigan will be back, but the Redskins could have a cast around them and possibly even a new coordinator if Joe Barry takes the fall for breakdowns and blunders that cost them a playoff berth.\\n\\nWe didn't do a great job of executing in certain areas of our defense, but we've just got to find a way to get better, whether it's coaching or new players, said defensive end Chris Baker, one of more than a dozen pending free agents. You can always get more talent, get more depth at each position.\\n\\nMore than just struggling against the run and pass, Washington was worst in the league in third-down defense and among the worst teams in the red zone. Whether that's scheme or personnel is a matter of debate but most likely a combination of the two.\\n\\nThe reason he's taking heat is because the people that don't execute his play, defensive end Ricky Jean Francois said. It's going to make it seem like 'Well he doesn't know what he's doing, he's not adjusting, he's not doing this.' Sometimes he may not have done that, but the majority of times when he did do it, did we follow him? And when we didn't, now he's in the hot seat. Now his job is on the line. So I really don't blame it fully on him.\\n\\nGruden said every player and coach would be evaluated and that Barry's status would ultimately be his call. Compton said he felt Barry put players in the right position to succeed a majority of the time.\\n\\nOn the personnel side, the Redskins could use a defensive lineman and a linebacker or two and have to figure out their safety situation. Hybrid Su'a Cravens could be a boon to the defense as a strong safety in his second NFL season.\\n\\nSome other things the Redskins need to resolve:\\n\\nCOUSINS' CONTRACT STATUS: The soap opera drama over quarterback Kirk Cousins' contract has been renewed for an encore after he played this season on the $19.95 million franchise tag. Because of the uncertainty on each side about a long-term fit, the Redskins' most likely course of action is tagging Cousins again at a cost of $23.94 million and evaluating again.\\n\\nIn his weekly radio appearance, Cousins was noncommittal when asked about his desire to stay and didn't know if the team wanted to commit to him for the long haul.\\n\\nWe haven't been able to talk since July 15, so I don't know if they've bought the engagement ring, if you will, Cousins said.\\n\\nWHAT YA GOT, ROOK: A lost year for rookie receiver Josh Doctson because of Achilles tendinitis means he could get thrown into a big role in his second season, despite just two catches in two games. The Redskins could lose DeSean Jackson and Pierre Garcon in free agency and don't know what they have in Doctson, a first-round pick out of TCU.\\n\\nThat unknown could force general manager Scot McCloughan to pay a premium to retain Garcon or Jackson.\\n\\nJONES' FUMBLED OPPORTUNITY: Matt Jones was given the No. 1 running back job and fumbled it away, becoming inactive for the final nine games of the season as undrafted rookie Robert Kelley took over. One season isn't evidence that Kelley can be a top-flight starter, but the Redskins have to decide whether to keep the very affordable Jones around to compete or cut ties.\\n\\nMatt, with what people call his issues with fumbles and everything, he'll get that fixed, said third-down back Chris Thompson, who showed his value as a change-of-pace runner, pass blocker and receiver. Fumbles are going to happen a time or two. But it's all about how you respond to it.\\n\\nBACK TO THE VETS: Pending free agent tight end Vernon Davis would like to be back with him hometown team for another season, and fellow 33-year-old DeAngelo Hall is willing to restructure his contract after tearing the ACL in his right knee in Week 3. Center Kory Lichtensteiger is probably as good as gone, and defensive tackle Kedric Golston's return is a major question mark as he'll be 34 and Anthony Lanier and Matt Ioannidis could step up as second-year players.\\n\\nHall knows being back isn't a sure thing.\\n\\nIf they come to the conclusion that, 'Hey we don't want you or 'You're too injury-prone,' then it is what it is, he said. I'll sit back and try to figure out, hey, do I want to go somewhere else and play because I do feel like I can still play, I can still be great.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAP Pro Football Writer Howard Fendrich contributed.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

{"original": "DETROIT – If Ypsilanti Prep Academy is anything, it's unique — at least to Michigan.\\n\\nWhile the name suggests a school, Ypsi Prep is a basketball training house for top teenagers, playing against the best high school teams in the country.\\n\\nInstead of switching classes several times a day and sweating prom dates, these young men finish their core courses one at a time through a first-of-its-kind program, and spend the rest of their time preparing to play at the next level.\\n\\nIt opened this year but has already played on national television and was nationally ranked by Max Preps, primarily because of Emoni Bates, its star player and son of its founder, Elgin Bates.\\n\\nEmoni Bates, a hoops prodigy and five-star Michigan State basketball commit, is projected to be the No. 1 pick in the NBA draft whenever he is eligible. (Current NBA rules require draftees to wait a year after high school graduation, but that could change as early as 2022.) For now, he and about a dozen other teenagers, seven of them Division I prospects, comprise a roster that has played in Michigan, Texas and Ohio against some of the top-ranked players in the country.\\n\\nNo. 1-ranked senior Chet Holmgren and several of his Minnesota high school state champion teammates beat Ypsi in Ann Arbor on Nov. 12 in the academy's first game. Then Duncanville (Texas), which has one of the nation's best sophomores, Ronald Holland, topped Ypsi on Nov. 28 in Texas. Ypsi has since beaten Ohio's ISA and Texas' Legacy School of Sport Sciences, each of which feature multiple Division I prospects.\\n\\nBronny James, son of LeBron James, and Amari Bailey, a top-five junior guard, are next for Ypsi on Jan. 9. The game in Fort Worth, Texas, against James' California Basketball Club will be televised on FS1.\\n\\nJaden Akins, the four-star prospect signed with Michigan State for the class of 2021, started the season with Ypsi Prep but left in December. Last week, Akins announced he was joining another prep school, Sunrise Christian Academy in Kansas, to finish his senior year.\\n\\nThe formation of Ypsi Prep and its ability to play games elsewhere has prompted questions about how it started and how it works. Elgin Bates billed it as a way to give Michigan's top talent the most elite competitions. Here's what we know:\\n\\nIs Ypsi Prep a school?\\n\\nNo, and it doesn't market itself as one. Elgin Bates was not specific this summer about the organization, registered as an LLC in July. He hasn't since publicly talked about the team, which had a game broadcast on ESPN2 and has its games streamed via a third-party subscription service.\\n\\nYpsi Prep is an academic-based basketball academy that provides its student-athletes an NCAA certified core curriculum while providing athletic and life skills training in preparation for college, Bates said via email.\\n\\nBates, who played Division II basketball and professionally overseas, has trained his son and others on the team through the AAU program Bates Fundamentals. The head coach for Ypsi Prep is Corey Tucker, who coached in Ohio for more than 15 years, according to his LinkedIn resumé.\\n\\nWhen asked if Ypsi receives taxpayer money, Bates said it does not, and that team expenses are paid by a nonprofit foundation and local and regional sponsors.\\n\\nNike and Gatorade, along with a host of small businesses, sponsor the team.\\n\\nYpsi Prep partners with a separate entity, Arbor Valley Academy, to provide its education services and has no relationship with the Michigan Department of Education. Nor does Ypsi have a relationship with the NCAA's eligibility center — the body that reviews each high school's or educational organization's courses for approval at the next level of athletics.\\n\\nWhat does MHSAA say about all this?\\n\\nNothing, really. Ypsi Prep plays outside of Michigan High School Athletics Association sanctions.\\n\\nThat means Ypsi Prep is not subject to the travel restrictions of MHSAA member schools — but it also cannot compete for a state title. Ypsi Prep has yet to play a team from Michigan, but has planned to play home games.\\n\\nEmoni Bates won an MHSAA title with his local public school, Ypsilanti Lincoln, as a freshman in 2019. Among 10,000-plus schools with athletics, only a few dozen, mostly small parochial schools and homeschools, play outside of MHSAA rule.\\n\\nAnd none of them do it quite like Ypsi Prep.\\n\\nWill Ypsi Prep players qualify for Division I competition?\\n\\nIf they complete courses at an approved institution, yes, but Ypsi alone doesn't provide that education. Each player must meet NCAA's core standards and provide transcripts from an approved entity; public school, private school, charter school or otherwise.\\n\\nBut the NCAA isn't in the business of authorizing an educational institution, per se. It tries to verify the institution can provide the required courses that high school athletes need to qualify for initial eligibility under NCAA rules. Then it can accept that student's transcripts.\\n\\nIt's not an accreditation process, because the NCAA doesn't have authority over high schools, said Tim Nevius, an attorney who regularly spars with the organization on behalf of student-athletes. The NCAA is a college and university member association that sets rules that determine the eligibility of its players.\\n\\nThe NCAA's eligibility center assesses each high school or education organization's curriculum and can give it a variety of designations, with periodic reassessment to follow. Arbor Valley was approved for the first time in September.\\n\\nAs a former NCAA employee, Nevius is well-versed in investigating misconduct on behalf of the institution. Now he has his own firm that represents players, but has no connection or knowledge of Ypsi or Arbor Valley.\\n\\nHe said it's possible for a school or educational outlet to be cleared in a matter of months if their paperwork is right. As of now, it appears if students who play at Ypsi pass courses at Arbor Valley Academy, they would be eligible to play in college. They would have to meet the eligibility center's amateurism requirements as well.\\n\\nTyler Davis can be contacted at tjdavis@freepress.com or on Twitter @TDavisFreep."}
{"original": "WASHINGTON – With President Donald Trump continuing to erroneously claim he won the election in the lead-up to Jan. 6, several Republican allies planned to fight the results when Congress met to formally count the votes of the Electoral College.\\n\\nBut the deadly pro-Trump riot that took place that day forced a recess to the process, and some GOP lawmakers backed down from their plans to object to President-elect Joe Biden's victory in some states.\\n\\nStates had already certified their Electoral College results, and Biden secured the election with 306 votes to Trump's 232.\\n\\nIn the next step of the certification process, the Constitution requires both chambers of Congress to meet before the inauguration to count the electoral votes from every state.

Pete Sessions, Texas\\n\\nSessions voted to support objections for both contested states.\\n\\nThese circumstances across the states have been handled differently, Sessions stated. But one thing that was consistent was the Trump team was denied access to actual facts of the case, which meant that they were then denied or delayed in providing facts necessary to a court.\\n\\nWe believe, and I believe, that what will happen on Jan. 6 is an official discussion will take place in Washington whereby we re-challenge the states to actually make a determination based upon the current facts that have since been developed as opposed to decisions made over a month ago, he said.\\n\\nRep.

Kelly Loeffler, Ga.\\n\\nLoeffler voted against the objections, reversing her previous position planning to support the objections. She attributed her change of mind to the violence that broke out in the Capitol that day.\\n\\nI cannot now in good conscience object to the certification of these votes, Loeffler said.\\n\\nIn a statement explaining her initial support for the objections, Loeffler previously said, The American people deserve a platform in Congress, permitted under the Constitution, to have election issues presented so that they can be addressed. That's why, on January 6th, I will vote to give President Trump and the American people the fair hearing they deserve and support the objection to the Electoral College certification process.\\n\\nMore:Georgia's Senate runoffs: Ossoff projected to win runoff, giving Democrats Senate majority\\n\\nSen.

Though I will continue to push for a thorough investigation into the election irregularities many Hoosiers are concerned with as my objection was intended, I have withdrawn that objection and will vote to get this ugly day behind us.\\n\\nWe intend to vote on January 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' (the statutory requisite), unless and until an emergency 10-day audit is completed, Braun previously wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nSen. Steve Daines, Mont.\\n\\nDaines was also among the Republicans who backed off his initial indication of support for the objections.\\n\\nIn light of the deplorable violence, and the assault on our constitution and law enforcement, the Senator believed it was best for our nation to move forward with as much unity as possible, and affirm the results, a spokesperson said.\\n\\nDaines previously joined the other GOP senators in demanding an election commission be formed to review the results of the presidential race.\\n\\nI believe it is important that we agree to hear the concerns of Americans, and that's why I believe it's important that we form the electoral commission. To answer the questions outstanding, find resolution and protect the democratic process, Daines said. Once completed, individual contested states would evaluate the commission's findings, and if necessary could convene [a] special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\\n\\nHowever, his press office insisted his position on whether he will object hinges on the formation of this commission.\\n\\nFor any headlines that read, 'Daines to Oppose Electoral College Vote or anything like it ... they are incorrect, or perhaps, more misleading, Daines spokesperson Katie Schottler told the Missoula Current. For all stories following today's news, if you are to include something like 'Daines is to object to electoral college vote,' it absolutely should be noted that it's contingent on the election commission, and it's focused on disputed states.\\n\\nSen. James Lankford, Okla.\\n\\nLankford previously said he planned to join other senators to object on Jan. 6, but ultimately did not do so.\\n\\nIn a previous statement, the Oklahoma Republican said that if we cannot agree to hear the concerns of millions of Americans, I am prepared to oppose the electors on January 6 since I cannot be certain that they were 'regularly made,' which is the statutory requirement.\\n\\nSen. Marsha Blackburn, Tenn.\\n\\nBlackburn previously announced she was joining her Senate colleagues in planning to object, but did not do so.\\n\\nI will vote in support of certifying the electoral college results, she tweeted following the violence at the Capitol.\\n\\nI cannot in good conscience turn a blind eye to the countless allegations of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, Blackburn previously posted on Twitter. On January 6, I will vote in favor of objecting to the certification of the electoral college results.\\n\\nSen. Bill Hagerty, Tenn.\\n\\nHagerty, recently sworn in, also changed course and voted to certify election results in contested states.\\n\\nHe had previously announced he would be joining Blackburn and his other GOP colleagues in objecting.\\n\\nOn behalf of Tennesseans, we are taking a united stand against the tainted electoral results from the recent Presidential election, said Hagerty and Blackburn in a joint statement. American democracy relies on the consent of the governed. Allegations of voter fraud, irregularities and unconstitutional actions diminish public confidence in what should be a free, fair and transparent process. Protecting the integrity of the electoral process is paramount to preserving trust and legitimacy in the final outcome.\\n\\nSen. Ron Johnson, Wis.\\n\\nJohnson was among the senators who changed course and did not object to states' electors after saying he would do so.\\n\\nIn a contentious Meet the Press interview, Johnson acknowledged that Biden won the election in Wisconsin but said it was still necessary to investigate unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud.\\n\\nMore:NBC's Chuck Todd grills Ron Johnson over election 'conspiracy theory.' Some Wisconsin Republicans reject his effort to challenge results.\\n\\nJohnson was previously among the group of senators planning to object.\\n\\nHe defended that decision on Meet the Press, saying, One of the points we make is we are not acting to thwart the democratic process. We're acting to protect it. The fact of the matter is we have an unsustainable state of affairs in this country where we have tens of millions of people who do not view this election result as legitimate.\\n\\nContributing: Joey Garrison and Rebecca Morin, USA TODAY; Brian Gordon and Gareth McGrath, Asheville Citizen Times; Jordyn Noennig, Milwaukee Journal Sentinel; Greg Hilburn, Monroe News-Star; Lawrence Andrea and Kaitlin Lang, Indianapolis Star; Candy Woodall, USA TODAY Network Pennsylvania Capitol Bureau; Todd Spangle, Detroit Free Press; Joshua Solomon, Treasure Coast Newspapers; Maya Lora and Gary White, The Ledger; Hannah K.

I think that it's important now to remain with this squad.\\n\\nThe Italian, who took charge this season, hinted at bringing in reinforcements in the January transfer window but said the Premier League leader is not close to recruiting anyone yet.\\n\\nHe has, however, ruled out bringing in a center back with France defender Kurt Zouma available again following a long-term knee injury.\\n\\nI don't think we need another central defender, Conte said.\\n\\nZouma will start Sunday's FA Cup third round match against third-tier Peterborough at Stamford Bridge, as will Belgium striker Michy Batshuayi, who has been given limited opportunities since his move from Marseille in the summer.\\n\\nI have a good opportunity in this game to see Michy from the start, Conte said. I think it's important. He's working a lot. I'm seeing that he's improving.

{"original": "Members of Congress expect a long day of bitter debate Wednesday as both houses convene at 1 p.m. to count Electoral College votes and recognize Democrat Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\\n\\nThough the vote count is usually a short, ceremonial event, objections by Republican allies of President Donald Trump – 13 senators and at least 100 House members – will force representatives to consider each objection and vote to accept or reject them. The contentious session could last late into the night.\\n\\nHouse Republicans will object to results in six states contested by Trump after the election: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Republican senators plan to target Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania.\\n\\nState officials have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, as Trump claimed. USA TODAY reported the president and Republican allies filed 62 lawsuits seeking to overturn election results in states Trump lost, according to Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who is tracking the results. Sixty-one of those suits have been dismissed.\\n\\nBiden won the Electoral College vote, 306 to 232. Those numbers are unlikely to change in Wednesday's count, since both houses of Congress must agree to accept objections. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, and Republican leaders who are against the challenge will not vote to accept.\\n\\nThe congressional session is mandated by the Constitution and follows the Electoral Count Act of 1887. How objections are handled in the process:\\n\\nJoint session\\n\\nSenate and House members meet in joint session in the House of Representatives chamber.\\n\\nVice President Mike Pence, president of the Senate, is the presiding officer.\\n\\nTrump tweeted that Pence has the authority to reject fraudulently chosen electors. Legal scholars say the Constitution does not give Pence that power.\\n\\nIf Pence can't preside, Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, the Senate pro tempore, or the longest-serving Senator of the majority party, takes over.\\n\\nResults delivered\\n\\nTwo mahogany boxes containing sealed certificates of the electoral votes of each state and the District of Columbia are brought in.\\n\\nCertificates opened\\n\\nThe presiding officer opens the certificates by state alphabetical order and gives them to four tellers, officers approved by Senate and House members of both parties. Each chamber appoints two tellers.\\n\\n'Call for objections, if any'\\n\\nThe tellers read each certificate out loud and record and count votes. The presiding officer asks if there are any objections.\\n\\nAny House or Senate member can object to the vote for any reason. The presiding officer will not respond to the objection unless:\\n\\nIt's in writing.\\n\\nIt's signed by both a House and Senate member.\\n\\nIf the objection is a joint House/Senate request, the joint session is suspended. The Senate leaves the House chamber and both houses go into separate sessions to debate it.\\n\\nMembers who plan to issue objections for these states:\\n\\nDebate is limited to two hours. Each member may speak only once, for up to five minutes.\\n\\nBy simple majority, both chambers vote to accept or reject the objection. The House and Senate return to the joint session and announce results. If:\\n\\nBoth chambers reject: Votes are counted\\n\\nVotes are counted One chamber accepts, the other rejects: Votes are counted\\n\\nVotes are counted Both chambers accept: Votes are not counted\\n\\nThe joint session then repeats the process with the next state.\\n\\nWinner announced\\n\\nThe electoral votes are counted, and the candidate with at least 270 wins. The presiding officer announces winners for president and vice president.\\n\\nIf neither candidate gets 270 votes – virtually impossible this time – the House would choose the president. Each state casts one vote.\\n\\nElectoral objections were last raised in 2005, when Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., claimed voting irregularities in Ohio. Their objections were rejected.\\n\\nThe joint session is the last legislative chance for objections to election results.

{"original": "Maeve McDermott\\n\\nUSATODAY\\n\\nBarely a week into 2017, the year's first celebrity feud has arrived.\\n\\nA decade ago, Chris Brown and Soulja Boy were just two young rappers climbing the charts, Soulja with his breakout hit Crank Dat and Brown with With You and Kiss Kiss. Ten years later, with a handful of celebrity feuds under each of their belts, the two singer/rappers are taking aim at one another.\\n\\nStarting with a string of social media insults, Chris Brown and Soulja Boy's war of the words inspired champion boxer Floyd Mayweather to organize a pay-per-view match against the two artists, supposedly scheduled for March.\\n\\nHere's how the feud devolved.\\n\\nSoulja likes Karrueche's pic\\n\\nIs anyone surprised that this started on Instagram? According to a string of NSFW tweets, Brown saw that Soulja liked a post of his ex, Karrueche Tran, and called him with some fighting words.\\n\\nThe difference between me and Chris is I shot a (expletive) before. And he hit a woman before. We not the same, he wrote in one inflammatory tweet.\\n\\nBreezy picks a fight\\n\\nSurprising no one, Brown was serious about that fight. His boxer friend Adrien Broner posted a string of Instagrams of Brown challenging his opponent to a celebrity boxing match, claiming Soulja is continuously calling him on Facetime and asking Broner to set up the gym.\\n\\nKarrueche and Chris trade words\\n\\nNaturally, things devolved between Karrueche and her rapper ex in dueling Instagram posts, also NSFW.\\n\\nI been chillen...working...eating my veggies...hitting these squats and minding my own business and that's exactly how I want to keep it, she wrote in the since-deleted, very relatable text post.\\n\\nBrown was less forgiving in his all-caps missive against his ex, where he claimed he's responsible for her success and the reason she has friends, some of whom he slept with. Nice.\\n\\nAll the while, the two rappers continued posting NSFW clips and tweets threatening each other, with Soulja bringing Brown's daughter Royalty into the mix. Happy New Year! Royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than Soulja Boy already. I'd be mad too, he wrote in one post.\\n\\nSoulja gets robbed?\\n\\nWell, that took a turn. Soulja offered to meet Brown in Compton for a street fight, and he made good on his word, going live on Instagram from the streets with a group of guys surrounding him, challenging him to come fight.\\n\\nThings escalated when one of the group members pushed Soulja, with another one picking up his phone. Did he get robbed? Was it staged? Will this ever end?\\n\\nSoulja's mom and Brown's lawyer get involved\\n\\nFast forward to Wednesday, when Soulja appeared to back down from his claims, posting a video apologizing for his erratic behavior and claiming he just received news his mom was in the hospital.\\n\\nIf that wasn't enough of a wake-up call, Brown's attorney, Mark Geragos, also got involved, threatening to file a lawsuit against Soulja.\\n\\nI'm not sure who you are but please confirm to the world that you will accept the defamation lawsuit I will file against you, he wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nFloyd Mayweather enters the ring.\\n\\nNot so fast. Soulja had a change of heart about his apology, calling on his friend Mayweather to train him to challenge Brown in the biggest fight of the century.\\n\\nMayweather and Soulja both posted a flyer for the event.\\n\\nBrown is seemingly on board, sharing his own graphic of his Photoshopped torso standing over his opponent in the ring.\\n\\nThe match may be for charity — but there's nothing charitable about this beef stretching two more months."}
{"original": "Jesse Ferguson\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nThis year is the 30th anniversary of NBC's Law & Order, which brought the dun, dun noise to life as the soundtrack of justice for millions of people.\\n\\nIn 2020, images and phrases associated with police procedures are no longer limited to television dramas; they're associated with the real live president of the United States. Too often, though, this is not the way progressives talk about him.\\n\\nDonald Trump got caught red handed. He used taxpayer-funded military aid to bribe a foreign government to help his reelection; it's an open-and-shut case. Naturally, Trump's Republican political allies are very upset that he got caught. Like a Scooby-Doo villain, they think he would have gotten away with it if not for that meddlesome whistleblower.\\n\\nBut the American people have watched a lot of Law & Order, and they understand what really happened here. They need only look at the latest round of smoking-gun emails, which confirms Trump's role in the plot.\\n\\nMost Americans get the picture\\n\\nThe coalition of progressive pollsters at Navigator Research found that by 22 percentage points (57 to 35%), more Americans say Trump has committed a crime as president — and the margin is an overwhelming 30 points for independents (55 to 25%). Both numbers are higher than support for impeachment itself.\\n\\nDon't trust progressive pollsters? The latest Fox News poll found that by 15 percentage points, more Americans say Trump has abused his power than not (53 to 38%), and that by 8 percentage points, more say he has committed bribery (45 to 37%).\\n\\nNotwithstanding their view on whether Trump should be impeached, people know that what he did was wrong. The latest NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that three-quarters of Americans say Trump has done something wrong. Regardless of their views on impeachment or removal, people see the air of corruption and criminality around him.\\n\\nWhat a change. From the late 1960s through the 2016 election, Republicans seemingly had a monopoly on the law-and-order narrative. For all the years I've worked in politics, Republicans have been the party with strength on the rule of law, a fundamental moral value at the core of their brand. Under Trump, they've traded that strength away.\\n\\nIn the same Navigator Research poll, more people say Trump thinks he's above the law than not — a difference of 24 points (62 to 38%). Americans now trust Democrats in Congress more than President Trump on the rule of law by a margin of 12 points (46 to 34%). In 2016, Trump promised to be the law-and-order president, but people now see a president who believes he's above the law.\\n\\nOnce is enough:Don't let 2020 become 2016. Beat Donald Trump.\\n\\nBeltway pundits and prognosticators, myself included, have been obsessed with the political fallout from impeachment. Will it fuel Trump or foment opposition? Will it strengthen the Democrats' House majority or backfire against them? But the American people aren't voting on impeachment. By the time the election rolls around, it will be in the rearview mirror.\\n\\nAfter all, the 1974 elections weren't a referendum on President Richard Nixon's impeachment. They were a referendum on his crime: Watergate. Likewise, what the people may vote on in 2020 is criminality and the rule of law. And if that happens, Trump is in trouble.\\n\\nMake 2020 about Trump's crimes\\n\\nTo make this argument, we have to meet voters where they are in this debate. Bottom line: If you're using language that never could have made it into an episode of Law & Order, you're doing it wrong. You're not using language that furthers our case or reaches people in this moment.\\n\\nDemocrats have to focus our argument on the repeated corrupt and criminal activities that Trump and his allies have been caught engaging in. The point isn't that he's violating norms; it's that he's violating laws. Don't just lament the way that Trump ignores the separation of powers by not having witnesses testify. Make it clear that he's gagging witnesses and refusing to answer questions himself.\\n\\nIf you defend the legal process instead of making the point that he attacks and belittles the very law enforcement officials who caught him, you're leaving voters behind. If you find yourself explaining the lack of prosecution after the Mueller report, hush money and Individual 1 by citing the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel guidance rather than explaining that Trump essentially has immunity, you're falling into his trap.\\n\\nWhat Joe Biden really thinks:Worse than even his policies, Donald Trump is destroying America's soul\\n\\nPeople may not track every nuance of this debate, but they smell the foul stench.

It's a project, an entertainment complex, that we believe will be responsive to the kind of things that we need to be successful with our fans in the Los Angeles market.\\n\\nRams moving back to Los Angeles with Chargers given option to join\\n\\nThe enclosed, glass-roofed facility – expected to be built for upwards of $2 billion, all privately financed – is just part of the plan. There could be as much as $15 billion in developing what amounts to a city that has the NFL as a featured aspect of it, Jones said.\\n\\nHouston Texans owner Bob McNair, among others, noted there will be space for the league-owned NFL Network on the premises and the ability for the stadium to be home to two teams, should the San Diego Chargers – who have first dibs – or Oakland Raiders choose to join the Rams there after their competing project in nearby Carson, Calif., lost out.\\n\\nSt. Louis mayor Francis Slay all but told the NFL what they can do with their new stadium.\\n\\nThe NFL ignored the facts, the loyalty of St. Louis fans, who supported the team through far more downs than ups, and the NFL ignored a strong market and viable plan for a new stadium, Slay said in a statement. I am proud of our effort and what St. Louis was able to accomplish in an extraordinarily short period of time. I thank everyone who worked so diligently on this project, especially the Governor's Task Force.\\n\\nInglewood mayor: Rams deal 'transformative moment' for one-time Lakers home\\n\\nKroenke, in a statement, defended his decision.\\n\\nWhile there understandably has been emotionally charged commentary regarding our motives and intentions, the speculation is not true and unfounded, Kroenke said. I am a Missouri native named after two St. Louis sports legends who I was fortunate enough to know on a personal level. This move isn't about whether I love St. Louis or Missouri. I do and always will. No matter what anyone says, that will never change.\\n\\nThe Inglewood City Council unanimously approved the Rams' plan in February 2015. But it wasn't until Tuesday's daylong session here the team's return to the market it abandoned under previous ownership after the 1994 season was finalized.\\n\\nEarlier in the day, the league committee appointed to study the L.A. issue said it was backing the competing Carson project. It was unbelievable, Jones said. I've never been in meeting where that many people voted for what the committee didn't.\\n\\nThe option to join the Rams in Inglewood, as well as an additional $100 million in financial support if the Chargers or Raiders can find solutions in their existing markets, was the solution owners settled on to try to advance the process for those franchises as well.\\n\\nBut it was Kroenke – the 68-year-old Missouri billionaire whose purchase of the Rams was approved in 2010 – standing at the podium Tuesday as the man who won the race to L.A.\\n\\nWe look forward to returning to Los Angeles and building a world-class NFL entertainment district in Inglewood, Kroenke said in a statement.\\n\\nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero."}
{"original": "Ted Slafsky\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nHealth care affordability ranks first or second among issues voters want Congress to tackle in 2019, according to numerous polls following the 2018 midterm elections. While Democrats and Republicans have very different opinions on hot button issues such as the Affordable Care Act and Medicare for All, they unite when it comes to anger over pharmaceutical costs.\\n\\nPresident Donald Trump has a plan to cut prescription drug prices, Democrats of all stripes have campaigned on tackling this. Should we expect to see big changes this year? As a 25-year veteran of the drug-pricing battle on Capitol Hill, I'm skeptical anything ambitious will be coming. Even so, there's new momentum for change. Here are my predictions for action on drug pricing in the new 116th Congress:\\n\\nRequire drug firms to list prices in TV ads\\n\\nIn October, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar unveiled a proposal to require pharma companies to publish a drug's list price in TV ads that blanket the airwaves. The drug industry has argued that the information could be misleading because patients often don't pay the list price. Even after these concerns are shared with the American public, a new Kaiser Health poll finds that a majority still supports it although by smaller margins.\\n\\nThe administration now appears amenable to a plan floated by industry group PhRMA that would provide more context to what a patient might actually pay at the counter. Assuming that the administration is able to overcome First Amendment challenges, I give it an 80 percent chance of becoming reality.\\n\\nAllow Medicare to negotiate drug prices\\n\\nOn the campaign trail in 2016, Trump embraced allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices for seniors. Democrats have introduced a series of bills that would accomplish this goal and have vowed to make this a top priority. But while a remarkable 92 percent of Americans support the idea and virtually every other country utilizes this approach, I highly doubt anything this ambitious will become reality any time soon.\\n\\nThe Trump administration would like to move forward on a pilot program to tie pricing for certain costly Medicare drugs to what other countries pay — which is often dramatically lower than what U.S. customers pay. But even before the regulation has been formally proposed, big pharma has launched an all-out assault. Considering that doctors, hospitals and patient groups have also come out against it, I would give it a practically zero chance of moving forward.\\n\\nPut restrictions on drug coverage\\n\\nThe Trump administration has also proposed allowing Medicare to restrict what drugs would be covered by health plans that negotiate prices on behalf of the 45 million seniors who participate in the Medicare Part D program. The tactic, commonly used in the private sector and in other countries, is to avoid the use of very expensive medications when there are cheaper versions that are therapeutically equivalent. Despite the drug industry's impressive ability to kill measures like this, I would give it an 80 percent chance of becoming law in a watered-down form.\\n\\nLet people buy medicine from other countries\\n\\nEvery new session of Congress, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduces bills to allow Americans to buy pharmaceuticals from Canada. While the bill sponsors often change, the legislation always ends up in the proverbial trash heap. The drug industry and some medical professionals have raised concerns about counterfeit medicines ending up in the hands of patients.\\n\\nCould 2019 be different? The stars are aligned for action. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb has formed a work group to explore the option of importing drugs in certain instances of price gouging. The work group's mandate is very limited, but no one expected that an agency overseen by a longtime advocate of the pharmaceutical industry would even consider this idea.\\n\\nSen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, a maverick and the new chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, will be pushing for a more ambitious plan to allow importation from Canada and will have plenty of support from congressional Democrats. Even the esteemed American Medical Association recently endorsed drug importation from Canada. Nonetheless, I give importation no more than a 25 percent chance. If it passes, it will be permissible only if patients travel north to get their medicine and pick it up in small quantities at licensed brick-and-mortar stores.\\n\\nWeaken monopoly power\\n\\nUnder the U.S. system, drug companies are granted patent protection and market exclusivity to produce new medicines that treat some of our most debilitating diseases. This is an important way to encourage innovation and risk-taking, but many academics and policymakers have pointed out that drug companies often abuse this monopoly power.\\n\\nA whopping 78 percent of patents approved by the FDA are for existing drugs rather than new ones. Drug manufacturers, already entitled to up to 20 years of patent protection, need only make slight modifications to get additional protections. To make matters worse, many brand name manufacturers will pay a generic company to delay introduction of cheaper alternatives.\\n\\nLed by Grassley and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., lawmakers have introduced several bills to spur competition. More than 100 House Democrats have even proposed to strip a company's patent rights when it refuses to lower prices. But don't count on any type of patent legislation to become law in the 116th Congress. A much better bet is the CREATES Act, which would speed generic drugs to market by giving generic companies early access to samples for comparison tests. I give it a 95 percent chance of passage.\\n\\nIs there anything that will definitely happen in 2019? In 2018, the drug industry spent a potentially record sum lobbying Congress. There is a 100 percent guarantee they will surpass that milestone this year.\\n\\nTed Slafsky, founder and principal of Wexford Solutions, previously served as CEO of an advocacy organization focused on drug pricing.

USA TODAY TV Critic Kelly Lawler breaks down every winner, loser, presenter and gag at the 77th Annual Golden Globe Awards.\\n\\nGervais lost his shock and awe\\n\\nWas Golden Globes host Ricky Gervais even trying in his fifth time at the Globes microphone? With a glass of beer on the lectern, Gervais looked a little tired when he opened the show, reminding viewers he didn't care anymore (and never really did). He had a lackluster, lazy parade of jokes about Baby Yoda and Joe Pesci (the internet has beat him to much better jokes on the tiny alien), Felicity Huffman making license plates (the audience definitely wasn't with him there), Cats, Martin Scorsese's height and movies about pedophiles.\\n\\nThere were a few chuckles to be had, but even fans of Gervais' harsh brand of humor would likely be disappointed. There weren't many barbs to his supposedly sharp humor, merely a few weak jabs at Apple and political celebrities. More than anything else, it was dull.\\n\\nMore:Golden Globes 2020: Kate McKinnon nails what it feels like to see yourself represented onscreen\\n\\nBut as Gervais said, They're just jokes, we're all gonna die soon, and there's no sequel. Glad to know Gervais is really done after this time.\\n\\nThe unsung winners\\n\\nHonestly, the best part of the awards from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the small organization that votes on the Globes, is that sometimes it helps shine a light on small films and TV shows that could use a boost. This year the lucky recipient was the great Ramy Youssef, the star and creator of Hulu's Ramy, who knew that this big room of Hollywood heavy hitters hadn't seen his show. But they'd better now.\\n\\nAnother underdog with a big win was The Missing Link, which edged out Frozen 2 for the best animated film award. The film comes from Laika Studios, which was behind the incredibly animated Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings. Their films don't sell as many toys as Elsa and Anna, but they are beautiful to behold.\\n\\nEyebrows, raised\\n\\nHave eyebrows ever been thanked at an awards show before? Stellan Skarsgard, who won best supporting actor in a limited TV series or movie for HBO's Chernobyl, helped kick off the night with an excellent and incredibly surprising speech. Sure, he thanked the series' director, writer and usual suspects. But he also thanked the man who made the prosthetic eyebrows for his character. It was funnier than anything Gervais said all night. Hopefully it starts a trend. Can't wait for someone to thank their fingernails.\\n\\nMore:Best dressed at the Golden Globes: Taylor Swift, Nicole Kidman and more stars stun\\n\\nMore:Worst dressed at the Golden Globes: Jennifer Lopez, Sofia Vergara, Cate Blanchett, more\\n\\nBong Joon-ho schools Americans on subtitles\\n\\nThe director of one of the year's most acclaimed films, South Korea's Parasite, accepted the award for foreign language film with this biting missive: Once you get over the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films. May we all heed his words of wisdom.\\n\\nKate McKinnon makes her case for next Globes host\\n\\nEllen DeGeneres won the Globes' Carol Burnett Award for excellence in television, and although she had her own acceptance speech, she was overshadowed by Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon's introduction. McKinnon was funny (listing all the clothes she wore doing her DeGeneres impressions) and deeply moving as she recalled how DeGeneres boosted her confidence as a young gay woman. She risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth, McKinnon said. That mix of hilarity and heart is exactly the kind of thing an awards-show host needs. Maybe McKinnon will step up next year.\\n\\nDJ Ansel?\\n\\nPresenter Ansel Elgort didn't say much when he presented best original song to Elton John and Bernie Taupin, but boy, did he sing! It was a little weird, but at least it was on pitch. Perhaps some guerrilla marketing for his upcoming role in Steven Spielberg's West Side Story remake? Sure, why not!\\n\\nMore:Russell Crowe misses Golden Globes win, sends messages on climate change amid Australia fires\\n\\nThe ever-charming Olivia Colman\\n\\nThe Crown actress Olivia Colman really wasn't prepared to win, and she admitted it flat out on stage. I've honestly gotten a little boozy, because I didn't think this was going to happen, she said to knowing laughter. Her rambling speech was still adorable, with a shout-out for her other show, Fleabag, which took the best comedy award earlier in the night. Yay, 'Fleabag'! Yay, Olivia!\\n\\nTom Hanks brings America's Dad to the show\\n\\nWith a cold and a few jokes about his clip reel including a scene from The Love Boat, Tom Hanks accepted the Cecil B. DeMille award in true Hanks fashion, with grace and humility, and choked up when talking about his family. Hanks paid tribute to actors, writers, directors and craftsmen he worked with, naming some, like his Captain Phillips co-star Barkhad Abdi, and even nodding to Skarsgard's eyebrow artist. He championed being on time. His speech made the pursuit of acting and filmmaking feel like a noble one, captivating the audience in the room and at home.\\n\\nSpeeches that actually said something\\n\\nA funny acceptance speech is always welcome, but so are those that elevate thank you to the HFPA to something deeper. Michelle Williams, Jared Harris, Patricia Arquette and even Russell Crowe – in a statement all the way from Australia – got political and moving in their speeches, without a hint of exploitation or grandstanding.\\n\\nGolden Globes 2020:The winners list\\n\\nGolden Globes 2020:Live updates on the night's biggest wins"}
{"original": "The first of the Eagles' offseason moves began Saturday when it was reported by the NFL Network that defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz will not be returning.\\n\\nSchwartz had run the Eagles' defense ever since Doug Pederson became the head coach in Jan. 2016. Pederson had given Schwartz full autonomy over the defense. Schwartz, 54, will apparently take a year off and contemplate retirement.\\n\\nIt was expected that the Eagles will make some changes after going 4-10-1 heading into their regular-season finale Sunday night against the Washington Football Team.\\n\\nBut Pederson, for one, expressed confidence this week that he will return for 2021. If that's the case, then it seemed likely that there would be changes on Pederson's staff.\\n\\nSchwartz, then, is the first change. Schwartz would not discuss his performance this season when asked on Tuesday, saying he's only thinking about the upcoming game against Washington.\\n\\nI've got too much respect for the guys that are going to be on the field, some of which are playing for the first time, Schwartz said. I've got too much respect for the game to talk about anything other than this game. I apologize for that, but that's where our focus is.\\n\\nThe Eagles defense is ranked 21st overall in yards allowed per game at 371 and 22nd in points allowed per game at 26.5.\\n\\nThose are both the worst rankings in Schwartz's five seasons with the Eagles. But injuries have ravaged all three position groups on defense during the season.\\n\\nThat includes the secondary where an undrafted rookie free agent in Michael Jacquet started at cornerback last Sunday against Dallas, and was beaten frequently by Cowboys receivers Michael Gallup and Amari Cooper.\\n\\nIn the last two games, the Eagles have allowed more than 500 yards in each game in losses to Arizona and the Cowboys.\\n\\nIn addition, defensive tackle Javon Hargrave, the Eagles' big free agent signing, had a slow start before playing well over the last several weeks.\\n\\nPederson has often spoken highly of Schwartz's work, most recently on Friday.\\n\\nObviously, his defenses historically have been top defenses in the National Football League – of course, when guys are healthy and all of that, Pederson said. I think as the season progressed this year, I thought the defense actually was doing some really good things for us and keeping the offense in these football games here down the stretch – creating takeaways and sort of stymieing the run game from our opponents, things of that nature.\\n\\nThe players had also spoken highly of Schwartz's coaching under difficult situations. The Eagles have played most of the past month without starting defensive backs Rodney McLeod and Avonte Maddox, both sidelined with knee injuries.\\n\\nI like Jim Schwartz. I love his defense, defensive end Brandon Graham said. I think sometimes because of injuries and certain things that happen, the defense that he runs, I feel like I'm always in position to make plays. Sometimes, it's tough. We don't have the personnel to do certain things, like McLeod going down. That's our general in the back that keeps everything together.\\n\\nThere's a lot of stuff that played its part this year. It just sucks, because I know Jim is a good coach and sometimes the way the season went, it gave people a bad name, for all of us. It was a bad name because we gave up 500 yards and it doesn't look good when you can't stop the bleeding.\\n\\nBefore coming to the Eagles, Schwartz had served as a defensive coordinator with the Tennessee Titans from 2001-08. During that time, the Titans reached the Super Bowl and won the AFC South three times.\\n\\nHe was the Detroit Lions' head coach from 2009-13, taking over a team that went 0-16 the season before he arrived, and taking them to the playoffs in his third season.

Alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases reported in December. The surge came after the Thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in January from the fallout of Christmas and New Year's gatherings. We are being overwhelmed right now, State Health Officer Scott Harris said. I believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad. The cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on Nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases Dec. 31. While there were some backlogged cases recorded in December, almost all of the reported cases were from December.\\n\\nAlaska\\n\\nAnchorage: Health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies Pfizer and Moderna. That figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in December. Thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in Alaska. Starting Monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. That group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. Almost 50 Alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last Monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. That group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the Daily News reports. Alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last Monday.\\n\\nArizona\\n\\nPhoenix: Despite a surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Doug Ducey on Saturday rejected the state's top education official's call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. Given the severity of our state's situation and the virus's trajectory after the holiday period, schools need a two-week quarantine period for education leaders and local officials to use local health data to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities, Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said in a Twitter thread. Hoffman called for the two-week quarantine period for schools after the Department of Health Services on Saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known COVID-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. However, Ducey spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. This is a local decision. The online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: Kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely. Many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.\\n\\nArkansas\\n\\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. There were 1,216 people in Arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. Arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. The Arkansas Department of Health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. Those case counts are down from Friday's record high, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on New Year's Day. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms.\\n\\nCalifornia\\n\\nLos Angeles: Hospitals struggling to provide enough oxygen for the sickest coronavirus patients in the Los Angeles area began to receive help Saturday when U.S. Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived to update their oxygen delivery systems. The collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. Some COVID-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. California started the new year Friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. The state Department of Public Health on Saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed COVID-19 cases. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of Saturday with COVID-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. The southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don't have any more beds for COVID-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.\\n\\nColorado\\n\\nDenver: A day after Gov. Jared Polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. The governor cited improving statewide COVID-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including Denver and the entire Front Range, but his announcement Wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the Denver Post reports. It appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said Mark Johnson, executive director of Jefferson County Public Health. The announcement came a day after Colorado said it had confirmed the United States' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. We don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with Christmas, New Year's or the new variant that is more infectious, Johnson said.\\n\\nConnecticut\\n\\nNew Haven: Some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. Superintendent Iline Tracey announced on the district website Thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting Jan. 19. The New Haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last March. Officials in New Haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in September as other districts in Connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. A plan to reopen New Haven's schools on Nov. 9 was shelved amid rising COVID-19 cases. Tracey said schools will open Jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. Two schools, Quinnipiac School and West Rock School, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, Tracey said.\\n\\nDelaware\\n\\nWilmington: After health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, announced the state's decision during Gov. John Carney's weekly coronavirus press briefing Tuesday. Front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, U.S. Postal Service workers and grocery store workers. The group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. But these people likely won't start getting the vaccine until mid- to late January due to the limited supply of the vaccine. Please be patient with us. There's just not enough vaccine for everyone right now, Rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. People who work in Delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in Delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia\\n\\nWashington: Curators Sam Vong and Shannon Perich at the National Museum of American History are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, WUSA-TV reports. As historians, what we really want to do is document what's going on before it kind of escapes from us, Vong said. The Smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that Americans' recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. All of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research, Perich said. The submissions can be mundane. What did it mean to sit in your home by yourself? asked Perich. The only way we're ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us. Or they can be extraordinary, like one of Vong's favorites so far from a former Bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. The submission period opened in December and runs through March.\\n\\nFlorida\\n\\nFort Lauderdale: Health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths Saturday. Florida's Department of Health did not release numbers on New Year's Day. The state has also chosen not to report COVID-19 cases on two other holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Florida to 1,354,833. The agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported Friday and 9,752 reported Saturday. The state's death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. On New Year's Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. Also on Thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department's HealthyFla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in England has been detected in a Martin County man with no recent travel history. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, which along with Miami-Dade and Broward counties have comprised the state's hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.\\n\\nGeorgia\\n\\nAugusta: As vaccines are being administered to health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, law enforcement and first responder agencies are in line to get them soon. Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey announced Wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to Phase 1A – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. Some Augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. The Richmond County Sheriff's Office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. Dr. Stephen Goggans, the director of the East Central Health District, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.\\n\\nHawaii\\n\\nHonolulu: Residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the U.S., health officials said. The Hawaii Department of Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It has not been detected in Hawaii. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the United Kingdom and South Africa and in the U.S. in Colorado, California and Florida. All we know is that we have not yet found it, State Laboratories Division Dr. Edward Desmond said. We're going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures. The vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. Health officials have said about 25,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. Local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in December to 65,250.\\n\\nIdaho\\n\\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. The Republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. The latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after November tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. For 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. Little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. Health and the economy are intertwined, Little said. Idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.\\n\\nIllinois\\n\\nChicago: The state's public health department reported 29 COVID-19-related deaths Saturday, the smallest one-day total in Illinois since mid-November. Not only was the total, included in a news release from the Illinois Department of Public Health, lower than any single day since Nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. The latest numbers bring the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. The health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. But the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. The cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on New Year's Day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\\n\\nIndiana\\n\\nIndianapolis: Anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among Hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state's top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. Many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by COVID-19 itself, Jennifer Sullivan, secretary of the state's Family and Social Services Administration, said during Gov. Eric Holcomb's weekly briefing Wednesday on the state's coronavirus response. That includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. Cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. As a way to help, Sullivan encouraged Hoosiers to use the state-run BeWellIndiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. Since April, more than 25,000 Hoosiers have completed those assessments. For more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, Sullivan said.\\n\\nIowa\\n\\nDes Moines: A federal judge has rejected an argument by Tyson Foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. Tyson was sued in August by the family of Isidro Fernandez, who worked at the company's plant in Waterloo, after he died April 26 from complications of COVID-19. More than 1,000 Tyson workers tested positive for the virus in May, and at least six died. The families of Fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. Tyson fired seven managers in December after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. The Fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at Tyson's request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including President Donald Trump, when it remained open in April. But last Monday, U.S. District Judge Linda Reade rejected the argument.\\n\\nKansas\\n\\nTopeka: The state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in England, the director of the state Department of Health and Environment said last week. No cases of the new strain have been detected in Kansas. Cases have been confirmed in Colorado, Florida and California. Dr. Lee Norman said Kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of COVID-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. Norman told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes COVID-19, including a Utah strain and a Wisconsin strain. Viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. Mostly, they don't make much difference, Norman said. They're more alike than different, quite honestly. The state on Friday reported another 138 deaths from COVID-19 since Wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. Kansas has confirmed 227,745 COVID-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since Wednesday, the health department said.\\n\\nKentucky\\n\\nLouisville: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. The previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Kentucky ranked No. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Boyle, Lawrence and Clinton counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Jefferson County, with 2,743 cases; Fayette County, with 1,170 cases; and Kenton County, with 702. Weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Oldham, Hardin and Jefferson counties. The share of Kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.\\n\\nLouisiana\\n\\nBaton Rouge: With the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don't begin until Monday and require a scheduled appointment. The Louisiana Department of Health said Friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 Moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. Still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which Neel described as a promising sign. With thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.\\n\\nMaine\\n\\nAugusta: Protesters gathered outside the Maine Statehouse on Saturday to criticize how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. WABI-TV reports the protest organized by the Swinging Gate Organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. There's this undercurrent of pent-up energy that's not doing well under this governor's rule, and it's important to harness that organic energy that's out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied, said event organizer Dick Campbell. More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced Sunday. One additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. Just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on Dec. 19 to 528 on Saturday.\\n\\nMaryland\\n\\nBaltimore: The Maryland Department of Health is working with regional and federal partners to test patient samples for infection with the new variant of the coronavirus. The Baltimore Sun reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are collaborating with the state's public health lab, as well as state laboratories in California and Delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. There have been at least two cases of the COVID-19 variant identified in the U.S., one in California and another in Colorado. A Maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in Maryland. The CDC has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. But it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.\\n\\nMassachusetts\\n\\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill Friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in Massachusetts to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment. It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. Baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of COVID-19 on the health care system, among other steps. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at UMass Lowell last week instead will open Monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. While the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. Lowell General Hospital currently has 63 COVID-19 patients at its main campus.\\n\\nMichigan\\n\\nCalumet: A judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration got a restraining order against Cafe Rosetta in Calumet, a small town in Houghton County. Since November, bars and restaurants in Michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kristi Painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. She ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. I did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … I observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled 'Legal Fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,'  Painter said in a court filing. Cafe co-owner Amy Heikkinen, a mother of six, said she can't afford to limit her business to carryout orders. She said sales are up because of her dispute with authorities. It's my right to earn an income to protect and feed my family, she said. That's the right of every American. You can't make me not work.\\n\\nMinnesota\\n\\nMinneapolis: The state on Saturday reported 54 deaths from COVID-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. The new numbers bring the state's pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. A total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. The Department of Health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. In that period, the state reported one of the nation's lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. Gov. Tim Walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for New Year's celebrations. The attorney general has sued one such bar, Alibi Drinkery in Lakeville, for repeated violations of the order. Despite a court injunction ordering it to close, people packed into the bar for a New Year's party, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.\\n\\nMississippi\\n\\nColumbus: A hospital is offering $5,000 bonuses for qualified nurses as it works to recruit staff during a pandemic and at a time when health care workers are in short supply. WCBI reports Baptist Memorial Hospital - Golden Triangle is offering a number of incentives including the bonus as it works to recruit amid a nationwide nursing shortage. Johnny Judson is responsible for recruiting nurses for the hospital. I am literally in every school, nursing school, in the area, including along the Alabama border, he told the station. I go up to north Mississippi, south Mississippi, and I go to these nursing schools, and I talk to these students. He said the country's nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. The bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. Judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. We put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don't lower the standards, he said.\\n\\nMissouri\\n\\nJefferson City: The chairman of the Missouri Veterans Commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since September. Tim Noonan told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday that he was resigning, citing comments Gov. Mike Parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. A summary of the investigation was released earlier in December, but Noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the Post-Dispatch to release the full report. Officials inside Parson's administration and state Sen. Jill Schupp, a Democrat from Creve Coeur, had urged Noonan to release the full report, and he did so after Attorney General Eric Schmitt directed him to, Noonan said. That came after Parson on Wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. I'm not going to worry about everybody's personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman, Parson said. I'm just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that's my whole focus. Noonan said he resigned because of those comments.\\n\\nMontana\\n\\nBozeman: Montana PBS has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. The new schedule for the Learn at Home broadcast was set to launch Monday and continue through the end of the school year June 4, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. We know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a TV that receives our broadcast signal, Montana PBS Director of Education Nikki Vradenburg said. Chief Operator Paul Heitt-Rennie estimated most households have tuned into the Learn at Home program. He said Nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. Every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going, Vradenburg said.\\n\\nNebraska\\n\\nOmaha: Restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. The Omaha World-Herald reports the Nebraska Restaurant Association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. The waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. This is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said Zoe Olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. Olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. The proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. But the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. When you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said Chris Wagner, executive director of Project Extra Mile, an Omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.\\n\\nNevada\\n\\nLas Vegas: Community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state's diverse communities and reach out in Spanish and other languages as Nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. Erika Marquez, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas public health professor and vice chair of the Nevada Minority Health & Equity Coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. We had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time, Marquez told the Las Vegas Sun. Nevada is a diverse state with a 29% Latino population that includes native Spanish speakers. Nevada also has a fast-growing group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than English at home, according to data shared by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Marquez's coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Thai.\\n\\nNew Hampshire\\n\\nConcord: The state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run COVID-19 vaccination sites when it moves to Phase 2. Perry Plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. He told WMUR-TV the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. We expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we're ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the State of New Hampshire as quickly as possible, Plummer said. The first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. The second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. As of Friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.\\n\\nNew Jersey\\n\\nTrenton: More than 70% of the state's supply of COVID-19 vaccine had not been used as of Thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. Of the 265,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered to New Jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by Thursday afternoon. Despite months of planning, state officials said Wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. Remember, you need health care workers to do this, Gov. Phil Murphy said at a briefing. I'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. The slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 New Jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the rollout of the Moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before Christmas. Persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of Pfizer doses had been administered as of Wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that I've seen nationally.\\n\\nNew Mexico\\n\\nAlbuquerque: More than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. That's about half of the companies that applied, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The number (of applications) that we couldn't fund was very hard for us, said Marquita Russel, CEO of the New Mexico Finance Authority, the state agency that administered the program. The state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by New Mexico lawmakers. The program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. About $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state's four largest cities. Russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. In all, 6,530 applications were funded. Russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.\\n\\nNew York\\n\\nNew York: The New York City Sheriff's Department shut down a series of illegal New Year's Eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced Friday. More than 300 people gathered Thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th Street in Queens, the department said on Twitter. Five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. Deputies also raided an illegal gathering on Prince Street in Soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. Four people were charged with multiple offenses. The patrons were not wearing masks in the venue's overcrowded sixth floor. Deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at Stars Hall in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. The organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.\\n\\nNorth Carolina\\n\\nRaleigh: COVID-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with COVID-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state's hospitals. Two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. That's a difference of 793 people. On Friday, the last day for which data is available, the state's health department says 13.6% of COVID-19 tests came back positive. That brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least April. The average is seen as giving a better indication of COVID-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. Every day since Christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including Thursday's record-high 15.5%.\\n\\nNorth Dakota\\n\\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is prioritizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to those who speak Dakota and Lakota languages. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KXMB-TV the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. It's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. We don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. That's why it's so important, Faith said. The Standing Rock reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in North Dakota. Faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. Front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the Fort Yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. In addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. Tribal Health Director Margaret Gates said the Lakota and Dakota speakers are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.\\n\\nOhio\\n\\nColumbus: As Gov. Mike DeWine applies pressure to get COVID-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. Vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. In some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation, said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. On Wednesday, DeWine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.\\n\\nOklahoma\\n\\nOklahoma City: The state has reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. Oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus Friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said Saturday. The Oklahoma State Department of Health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. There were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in Oklahoma on New Year's Day, according to the department. The state's record was set last Monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in Oklahoma hospitals. Over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nOregon\\n\\nPortland: A health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The worker, an employee at Wallowa Memorial Hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late Thursday. The health authority said vaccines for COVID-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, health officials said in a press release. An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen, or if they must go to the hospital. Health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines.\\n\\nPennsylvania\\n\\nPhiladelphia: Scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south Philadelphia stomping grounds for a New Year's celebration of Mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd Street in South Philadelphia on Friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. Some wore masks, but many did not. Mayor Jim Kenney announced in July that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. Some Mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. City spokeswoman Lauren Cox said there were no major issues Friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. She urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.\\n\\nRhode Island\\n\\nProvidence: The first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot Saturday. Dr. Christian Arbelaez, an emergency room physician at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the Providence Journal reports. The moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-Thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after Christmas and New Year's Day. It's this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone? Arbelaez said. Do we have capacity? Do we have front-line workers well enough? Those are all the things that worry me. More than 20,500 people have received their first shots in Rhode Island, according to state health officials.\\n\\nSouth Carolina\\n\\nColumbia: Nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Administration announced Wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. Among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. The grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. The state had to turn down another several million dollars' worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. The volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. That delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, Frank Knapp, president of the state's Small Business Chamber of Commerce, told The Post and Courier. The monies were allocated by the Legislature in September to spend federal COVID-19 aid for South Carolina. The state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.\\n\\nSouth Dakota\\n\\nSioux Falls: A federal judge says a state court can't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a Codington County trial. U.S. District Judge Charles B. Kornmann also criticized South Dakota's response to the pandemic, saying it has done little, if anything, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Kornmann ordered that unless the Codington County state court resolves Matthew Kurtenbach's May 2019 case by Jan. 15, Kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. South Dakota cannot 'take advantage' of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials, the judge wrote. Kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. At one point, Kornmann directly criticized Gov. Kristi Noem's actions during the pandemic. The Governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. She has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading, the judge wrote.\\n\\nTennessee\\n\\nMemphis: The Shelby County Health Department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said Saturday. The health department started vaccinating first responders with the Moderna vaccine Dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson Joan Carr. Doug McGowen, chief operating officer for the City of Memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the Shelby County community, and it's going to take a while to get all of those individuals vaccinated. Some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. As of Saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department's two drive-thru centers had been filled. The health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass COVID-19 testing sites.\\n\\nTexas\\n\\nDallas: Coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly Saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. Texas reported 12,319 COVID-19 patients in hospitals Saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. But even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from Friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. Intensive care units in several parts of Texas were full or nearly full, with 626 ICU beds available statewide Saturday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 487 probable cases. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Texas came back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\\n\\nUtah\\n\\nSalt Lake City: Less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of COVID-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, Deseret News reports. The initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said Rich Lakin, immunization program director with the Utah Department of Health. We hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. Utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson Tom Hudachko said Thursday. More than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state Thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. What's making the difference, Hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. In Davis County, a mass drive-thru clinic at the Legacy Events Center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. At long-term care facilities, CVS and Walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.\\n\\nVermont\\n\\nStamford: The town has voted to overturn in its community Gov. Phil Scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The select board of the town of about 800 people along the Massachusetts border voted 3-2 Tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. Scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. Potvin said Friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of Vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.\\n\\nVirginia\\n\\nRichmond: State Sen. Ben Chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, Senate Republicans said Friday. Chafin represented southwest Virginia and was from Russell County. A Republican, he was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state Senate in 2014. He was 60. Lawmakers from around the state mourned Chafin's death late Friday. I knew Ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in Moccasin Valley, working the land just as generations of his family had done before him, Gov. Ralph Northam said. He loved the outdoors, and he loved serving people even more. Senate Republicans said in a statement: He served to ensure that his region and community, and the people he loved, would never be forgotten. Chafin is the first Virginia lawmaker to die from the virus.\\n\\nWashington\\n\\nVancouver: Quartz Mountain Distillers was surprised last week by a $14,060 fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. Owner Randy Kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in April. The family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the Columbian reports. All distillers that made hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic were facing the fine. The Department of Health & Human Services on Thursday announced it was directing the FDA not to enforce the fine after the FDA received heavy backlash on social media. Small businesses who stepped up to fight COVID-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so, the Department of Health & Human Services said on Twitter. Kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. If the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. I'd just have to lock the door and walk away, he said.\\n\\nWest Virginia\\n\\nCharleston: The state has reported a weekly record in the number of positive coronavirus cases entering the new year. West Virginia had at least 6,915 confirmed virus cases for the six-day period last week, excluding Sunday, according to health statistics. Officials have cautioned that figures could be skewed due to a lag in reporting cases over the Christmas holiday period. Sunday's cases won't be reported until Monday. Still, the state had its three highest daily figures last week since the start of the pandemic: at least 1,385 positive cases Tuesday, 1,618 Wednesday and 1,516 Thursday. Last week's cases marked the ninth weekly record in the past 13 weeks. The previous record of 6,871 positive cases was set two weeks ago. There also were a record 810 people hospitalized for the virus Friday. As of Saturday there were a record 27,418 active cases of the virus statewide, up 57% in the past month.\\n\\nWisconsin\\n\\nGrafton: What was initially thought to be a major human error of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the Aurora Medical Center Grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. A pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be useless to those who received them. On Dec. 26, Aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. After further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. On Wednesday, Aurora notified Grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. The pharmacist was arrested Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were also investigating, police said. Jeff Bahr, president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, called the pharmacist a bad actor. According to Grafton police, the now-former pharmacist intentionally took the vials out of the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing it would render the vaccines useless and make people who received them believe they were vaccinated when they were not.\\n\\nWyoming\\n\\nCheyenne: Bars and restaurants across the state will be allowed to return to normal operating hours beginning next Saturday as COVID-19 hospitalizations decline in the state. Gov. Mark Gordon made the announcement last Saturday, praising businesses for adapting to health orders and thanking the people of Wyoming who recognized the strain on their hospitals and health care workers and acted accordingly, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. These have not been easy times for anyone, he said. We are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state's schools and businesses to continue to remain open. The updated health orders allow bars and restaurants to resume on-site consumption from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., and they allow gyms to increase the number of participants in group fitness classes from 10 to 25. Counties can still opt out of the requirements if local conditions move to safer levels in accordance with White House metrics.\\n\\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports"}

{"original": "AP\\n\\nNEW YORK (AP) — The sales pitch from the Jets to prospective head coaching candidates begins with Sam Darnold.\\n\\nEverything else is a distant second.\\n\\nSure, being in the New York/New Jersey area is an obvious attraction, and Jets chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson spun his own take on a classic line by saying earlier this week that if you succeed in the Big Apple, you're a freaking legend.\\n\\nBut it's hard to even get close to that status without a franchise quarterback. A quick look through Jets history is all it takes to prove that. It's Broadway Joe — and a 50-year wait for a Super Bowl return. And counting.\\n\\nDarnold, though, provides promise for frustrated fans that he might be The One. He's a 21-year-old, redheaded symbol of hope in a smart, athletic and still-developing quarterback who has his sights firmly set on being great.\\n\\nThat's what will excite coaching candidates and free agents the most, with the fact the Jets and general manager Mike Maccagnan have about $100 million in salary cap space to play with this offseason and the No. 3 overall draft pick an added bonus.\\n\\nNow we're going to be able to build with Sam, Johnson said, build around Sam and with some great players we have on this team already.\\n\\nThe Jets' brass was in Kansas City on Wednesday to kick off the team's interviews, sitting down with Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy. New York is also expected to schedule meetings with the likes of former Green Bay coach Mike McCarthy, Tampa Bay offensive coordinator Todd Monken, Dallas passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach Kris Richard, former Detroit and Indianapolis coach Jim Caldwell and USC offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury.\\n\\nWhoever is hired as Todd Bowles' replacement will report directly to Johnson and not Maccagnan, a structure the owner believes works. Maccagnan will have a major say in the hire, though, working closely with Johnson and VP of player development Brian Heimerdinger to find the coach who will attempt to end the team's eight-year postseason drought.\\n\\nAnd, with Darnold leading the way.\\n\\nThe person doesn't have to be an offensive- or defensive-minded coach, per se, Maccagnan said. But we definitely want to make sure they have a plan in place to develop our young quarterback in Sam Darnold.\\n\\nDarnold had an up-and-down rookie season after being drafted with the No. 3 overall pick. He was the second quarterback selected, two spots after Baker Mayfield went to Cleveland — which is looking for a coach of its own and also has a potential face of the franchise as a major selling point.\\n\\nThe final stats for Darnold are mediocre, at best: 2,865 yards, 57.7 percent completion rate, 17 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, 77.6 quarterback rating in 13 games. But, it's the way he finished that has the organization feeling so good.\\n\\nIn the four games after returning from a foot injury that sidelined him for three contests, Darnold was 80 of 125 (64 percent) for 931 yards and six touchdowns with one INT. He showed clear improvement in his ability to see the field, read defenses, be smart with the football and wasn't as skittish behind an offensive line that struggled mightily early in the season.\\n\\nI thought in the beginning of the year, I took a while to get comfortable and then once I got comfortable in the offense and how things were, I felt very confident when I was out there, Darnold said. Again, just going to keep growing and keep trying to make those strides and watch the tape. See how I can get better and move forward from there.\\n\\nDarnold won't have a direct role in the decision-making process, but hoped to chat with management to share his perspective on the situation. And, the Jets are planning to give him some preliminary face-time with the man who might be his coach.\\n\\nGiven the opportunity, I'd like the potential head coaches that come through here to have a chance to spend a little time with him just so they get a feel for Sam, Maccagnan said. I do think that's actually one of the attractive parts of our job is that we have some good, young players. Again, we still have things we need to do and improve upon, but we have a lot of salary cap space. We have our draft picks and the idea of potentially working with a young quarterback like Sam is an attractive thing.\\n\\nDarnold isn't concerned about the potential changes that coincide with the arrival of a new coach. He can adapt, he insisted, and simply wants to win.\\n\\nI'm confident that whatever offense is here and whoever the coordinator is, whether it's the head coach or an offensive coordinator, Darnold said, I'm confident in my ability to be able to run an offense and lead that way.\\n\\nThe Jets' final pick will be linked with Darnold moving forward — and maybe for many years. The young quarterback would like this to be the last coaching change of his NFL career.\\n\\nYou always want someone to come in here and provide stability and hopefully we can win a lot of games together, Darnold said. That's always the goal.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}

Rob Schumacher/The Republic\\n\\nLeer en español\\n\\nThe USA TODAY Network launched a series on the Latino community in the U.S. called Hecho en USA, or made in America. Roughly 80% of all Latinos living in the U.S. are American citizens. But media coverage of Hispanics tends to focus on immigration and crime, instead of how Latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns. Hecho en USA tells the stories of the nation's 59.9 million Latinos – a growing economic and cultural force, many of whom are increasingly born in the United States.\\n\\nPHOENIX – Inside a banquet hall at the Corona Ranch and Rodeo Grounds, tired couples and little girls with long braids dance to the easy sway of ranchera music.\\n\\nElection Day has turned into a sweaty-hot May night in Phoenix, and Carlos Garcia, the candidate everyone is here for, is waiting for the votes to be tallied. Standing under a puffy mulberry tree, he's listening to campaign supporters swap stories and nursing his beer.\\n\\nThe historic race is still too close to call.\\n\\nIf elected, Garcia, a longtime human-rights activist, will become the first Mexican immigrant to serve on the Phoenix City Council. He'll represent the fifth-largest and fastest-growing city in the nation. He'll lead a Latino-majority district once known as the segregated part of town where Latinos and black families in Phoenix could own businesses and homes.\\n\\nAs if to ease nerves, Garcia directs the people crowded around him to a woman whose coal-black hair whispers against her shiny hoop earrings. She's holding a piggy bank the size of a mango. It's stamped: Carlos for Phoenix Council District 8.\\n\\nTell them about the piggy bank, Garcia says, nodding at Jacinta Gonzalez.\\n\\nIn 2016, Garcia, Gonzalez and other protesters set out to block a road leading to a Donald Trump campaign rally outside Phoenix. Gonzalez was arrested – by deputies of then-Sheriff Joe Arpaio, famous for being known as America's toughest sheriff and for being held in criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge's order to stop racially profiling Latinos.\\n\\nAfter deputies questioned Gonzalez about her citizenship, she sued and won a settlement. And she turned that money into something Garcia desperately needed, the thing many rising Latino candidates lack: campaign funding.\\n\\nWe don't have access to big donors, we don't have access to corporations that are going to invest in his type of leadership, so we have to find other ways to support, she says. And so sometimes that's litigation, sometimes that's fundraisers, sometimes that's car washes. We do whatever we're able to do, because we need hope and we need the belief that we can actually do things differently. And we can change the culture of how people get to office and what people do when they're there.\\n\\nJacinta Gonzalez locks her neck to a vehicle blocking the principal route of a rally for President Donald Trump in Phoenix. Lucy Sandoval/Puente Arizona.\\n\\nDespite the nation's ballooning Hispanic population, Latinos running and winning political offices across the U.S. are too often an anomaly. Even in Hispanic-majority districts, Latinos don't run or win elections at the rates of their white counterparts, various studies show. Now, candidates such as Garcia – and his supporters – are looking to change that.\\n\\nNationally, there are an estimated 58.9 million Latinos, making up about 18.1% of the U.S. population and accounting for the nation's second-largest ethnic group, after whites. Yet only about 6,700 elected officials are Latino, according to a 2018 analysis by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, or NALEO. That amounts to a political representation rate of 1.2% in local, state and federal elected offices.\\n\\nWhen Garcia made his campaign public, most people didn't expect him to win, and not just because of his anti-establishment background. Statistics are stacked against outsider Latino candidates as much as they are traditional ones.\\n\\nBut ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, Latinos across the U.S. have rallied against policies and rhetoric they feel target their community and are working to build momentum. Political activists are recruiting Latinx candidates to run in local and federal contests and aiming to win.\\n\\nLatinos will need more than passion to reach political equity, said Angela Ocampo, a University of Michigan political science professor. Indeed, if Latinos continue to be elected at the same rate as they have in recent years, it will likely be more than 50 years before parity is reached, she said.\\n\\nIt's going to take a very long time, Ocampo said. It's even worse when we look at gender, at Latina representation.\\n\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., listens as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testifies before the House Financial Services Committee in October. Jack Gruber, USA TODAY\\n\\nMore Latinos running for political office\\n\\nIn recent months, Latinos have been courted to run for congressional seats in Texas, Colorado and New Mexico. At the local level, Regina Romero was elected in early November as the first female mayor of Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, making her the only Latina mayor in the 50 largest cities in the U.S. In 2018, Democrat Michelle Luján Grisham, a 12th-generation New Mexican, was elected as the first Latina Democratic governor of New Mexico. She replaced Susana Martinez, a Latina Republican.\\n\\nSome political analysts are calling it the Trump effect, a backlash against political rhetoric and measures they believe harm Latinos, migrants and people of color. Ahead of 2020 White House and congressional races, that phenomenon could favor Democrats, who historically garner more support from Latino voters.\\n\\nBut for decades, Latino candidates like Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York or Garcia have received sparse support from mainstream political machines.\\n\\nLike Garcia, Ocasio-Cortez, a self-identified democratic socialist, built her campaign around community support that few establishment politicos saw coming. The 29-year-old, born in the Bronx, was working in a bar to support her family before she was elected in 2018, becoming the youngest woman in Congress.\\n\\nOcasio-Cortez's ethnicity stands out. There were only four Latino U.S. senators and 34 U.S. representatives as of January 2018, according to NALEO. That number increased slightly after the 2018 election when voters sent four additional Latino members to the House and made the 116th Congress the most representative of Latinos in history. Still, that's just a fraction of the nation's 100 senators and 435 representatives.\\n\\nAnalysts point to varied reasons for the disparity, including policies that suppress the Latino vote and political funding systems that benefit candidates perceived as viable winners, which in many cases are white people picked by top Republican and Democratic party leaders.\\n\\nThese parties and their donors, they're very influential, but in many cases, Latinos are receiving limited support from the important actors as they're trying to launch their campaign, Ocampo said.\\n\\nOcampo analyzed congressional races in Latino-majority districts. She found that even with the majority-minority advantage, electoral success falters. For example, Latinos are the largest ethnic group in California (40%) but make up only 24% of the California Legislature, according to a 2018 Ocampo study.\\n\\nAnd in New York, where Latinos make up about 19% of the population, there are only 20 Latino state legislators, accounting for about 9% of all New York state lawmakers.\\n\\nThe outlook for Latina lawmakers is especially bleak, Ocampo said. Of the 6,749 elected Latino office-holders across local, state and federal levels, only 2,485 were women.\\n\\nThe highest rate of parity by Latino political representation is in Florida and New Mexico. New Mexico has the nation's highest percentage of the Latino population at 48.8%. In Florida, the state with the sixth-largest Latino population, Latinos represent 26.1% of the population, according to 2018 U.S. Census data. But the state's estimated 4.8 million Latinos in Florida have benefited from decades of political activism in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Venezuelan and other Hispanic communities largely in Miami that has resulted in an unusual number of Hispanic lawmakers holding local and statewide offices.\\n\\nData shows that when candidates of color run, their races draw more voters of color to elections, and those voters are more likely to vote for a candidate from their own racial or ethnic background, said Matt Barreto, a University of California, Los Angeles, professor of political science and Chicana/o studies and co-founder of Latino Decisions, a political research firm.\\n\\nU.S. Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-TX) (L) and U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) face off in a debate at the KENS 5 studios on Oct. 16, 2018 in San Antonio, Texas. Pool, Getty Images\\n\\nThe research suggests that they aren't being recruited, they are not being sought out by the Democratic Party or the Republican Party, he said.\\n\\nThe Latino vote isn't monolithic, but the growing demographic can wield power in competitive races won by the margins.\\n\\nMark Lopez, a Pew demographer, noted that while Latinos tend to vote at a higher rate for Democratic candidates, there's a significant conservative Latino voting bloc. He points to the 2004 election when former President George Bush captured an estimated 45% of the Latino vote. Roughly 29% of Latinos voted for Trump in 2016 after he launched his campaign by calling Mexicans rapists.\\n\\nIn the closely watched Texas Senate race in 2018, Ted Cruz won over Beto O'Rourke. Cruz, the incumbent, repeatedly pointed out to voters that he was the son of a Cuban immigrant and that O'Rourke was not Hispanic. Cruz ultimately captured 50.9% of the vote in the tightest U.S. Senate race in Texas since 1978. O'Rourke, who also targeted his campaign to appeal to Latinos, captured 64% of the Hispanic vote.\\n\\nU.S. Sen.

Joaquin Castro, D-TX, arrives for a news conference to discuss the Supreme Court case involving Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals on Nov. 12, 2019. Drew Angerer, Getty Images\\n\\nLatinos inspired by civil rights fight\\n\\nFor Democratic Texas U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, who chairs the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, it's simple: Either you have a voice on issues that affect you, your family and your community, or others make those decisions for you.\\n\\nBy next year, Hispanics are expected to become the largest ethnic minority voting group to be eligible to vote in a presidential election, according to a study of the 2020 electorate released earlier this year by the Pew Research Center. In all, 32 million Latinos will be eligible to vote compared with 30 million voters who are black. It would mark the first federal election where Hispanic voters outnumber black voters.\\n\\nCastro said Latinos have made great strides since the civil rights era in the 1960s, when Latinos battling discrimination formed the Chicano movement to fight for the rights of Mexican Americans.\\n\\nIt was a community that was marginalized, and in some places, repressed, he said. When my grandmother came to Texas, there were signs that said, No dogs, Mexicans or Negroes allowed.\\n\\n​Former Democratic presidential candidate and former HUD Secretary Julián Castro speaks at the Liberty and Justice Celebration at the Wells Fargo Arena on Nov. 01, 2019, in Des Moines, Iowa. Scott Olson, Getty Images\\n\\nCastro and his brother, former presidential candidate Julián Castro, grew up in San Antonio, a city where Latino politicians run and win. Their mother, Rosie Castro, was a Chicana activist who in the 1970s joined La Raza Unida, a third-political party seeking to engage Latinos in politics.\\n\\nCastro said he and his brother entered politics because they grew up watching Latinos raise their voices as activists and successfully run for office. In 1992, San Antonio-born Henry Bonilla was the first Hispanic Republican from Texas elected to Congress. And in 1981, Henry Cisneros became one of the first Latino mayors in the U.S. when he was elected by San Antonio voters. San Antonio had not had a Latino mayor since the 1800s, before Texas became a state. Later, Cisneros was appointed by former President Bill Clinton as U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\\n\\nHenry Cisneros inspired a lot of young people, I think you see that often times, when there's a first in the community who runs for something, Castro said. The turnout rate for the Hispanic community was astronomical during Cisneros' election.\\n\\nCastro's brother, Julián Castro, was the only Latino in the 2020 presidential race before he dropped out last week.\\n\\nI think for a community that for many years had been marginalized and left out of politics, to now see someone from the community running for the highest office in the nation is important, Joaquin Castro said in an interview before his brother exited the campaign.\\n\\nJulián Castro has always embraced his Mexican immigrant roots. He followed in Cisneros' footsteps to become mayor of San Antonio in 2009. But a recent poll by Telemundo Noticias showed he lagged in Latino voter support compared with other Democratic presidential hopefuls. The November poll showed Castro in a three-way tie for fourth place among Latino voters, with only 2% support, while Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the candidates among those voters, with 26% and 18%, respectively.\\n\\nShow caption Hide caption Latino voters carry signs that read Unite the Vote as they are serenaded by mariachis on their way to their polling station to cast their... Latino voters carry signs that read Unite the Vote as they are serenaded by mariachis on their way to their polling station to cast their ballots in the 2018 midterm general election in Los Angeles, California, Nov. 6, 2018. MIKE NELSON, EPA-EFE\\n\\nMore Latinos are voting in local and federal elections\\n\\nThe White House isn't the only political arena where Latinos are demanding a voice.\\n\\nIn 2006, when the nation considered a seminal immigration reform bill, there were only two Latinos in the Senate and 28 in the House.\\n\\nThat was a critical bill that needed more Latino voices, said Barreto, of UCLA. That issue was so consequential at the time. It was a bill that was going to affect the lives of more than 10 million undocumented immigrants, many of them Latino.\\n\\nSome political analysts say the lingering effects of failed action helped spur today's hardline immigration policies and public divide over nationalism and migrant's rights.\\n\\nBut Barreto said lagging representation goes deeper than immigration issues.\\n\\nEvery bill matters, he said. There's a Latino angle to education reform, economic policies, health care.\\n\\nThese aren't white issues, these are everyone's issues, he added. Black, Latino, Asian communities, we should all be equally represented. That's what we should expect in a healthy democracy.\\n\\nAnd the Latino vote is only poised to become more influential. Latinos represent the greatest number of Americans under 18, at 18.3 million, according to a 2018 Pew report.\\n\\nGrassroots groups and larger ones like the Latino Vote Project have launched massive voter-registration drives in recent election cycles. Latino voter turnout in 2018, at 40%, reached a record high, increasing from 6.8 million in 2014 to 11.7 million. That's the second-largest turnout among Latinos of any election year, presidential or midterm.\\n\\nLopez, the Pew researcher, said Latinos may be motivated to protect their rights and place in the U.S. About half of Latinos surveyed said their standing in the nation had worsened in 2018, compared with 32% who said the same in the weeks after Trump won the 2016 presidential election, according to a Pew report.\\n\\nAn estimated 55% of Latinos said they were worried that a family member or friend could be deported, and two-thirds said the Trump administration's policies had been harmful to Latinos. That's up from similar feelings about Barack Obama, at 15% in 2010, and George W. Bush, at 41% in 2007.\\n\\nMany experienced some kind of discrimination event, like being told not to speak Spanish, Lopez said. Their lives have changed in a somewhat negative way in the last few years, primarily, since the election of Donald Trump.\\n\\nCouncilman Carlos Garcia (right) makes a point as the Phoenix City Council conducts a meeting at the Orpheum Theatre in downtown Phoenix, July 2, 2019. Councilman Sal Dicicio listens (left). Tom Tingle/The Republic\\n\\nFrom protesting the government to running for elected office\\n\\nIn many ways, Garcia had already taken his place in history long before election night in Arizona.\\n\\nYears before his Election Day party, while attorneys for Arizona and civil rights groups were battling over Senate Bill 1070 – the state's notorious show me your papers law – Garcia and other protesters stood outside the Phoenix courthouse under the brutal July sun blocking the intersection. When police officers moved in to make arrests, Garcia was in the middle, wearing a white T-shirt with the words We will not comply.\\n\\nAfter Trump was elected, he traveled to Arizona in 2017 for a speech in downtown Phoenix. Garcia joined hundreds of people protesting the president's visit in the wake of a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that turned deadly when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of demonstrators. The mostly peaceful protest outside the Phoenix Convention Center turned chaotic when police used tear gas and stun grenades on the crowd.\\n\\nHundreds of people later attended a Phoenix City Council meeting demanding officials hold police accountable. By then, Trump had pardoned Arpaio for the contempt conviction, further roiling many in the crowd.\\n\\nThe Phoenix Law Enforcement Association wrote a Facebook post on candidate Carlos Garcia. Via Facebook\\n\\nGarcia stood before officials in a blue T-shirt that read Not one more deportation. He told council members the community would hold them accountable.\\n\\nTo think that we spent three-quarters of a million dollars for this person, this president, to come spew hatred and bigotry, to come spit in our face and pardon the sheriff who was convicted, Garcia said. The city paid for a campaign rally. We have an opportunity to ... do this and to stand up for not only Phoenix but cities across the country.\\n\\nTwo years later, the Mexican immigrant's face was plastered on campaign ads across south Phoenix where Garcia lives in a community with deep Latino roots. In the photo, Garcia wore a familiar cornflower blue traditional Mexican guayabera shirt, his baby girl on his shoulders and his wife, a teacher, and his son standing in front of him.\\n\\nNew City of Phoenix councilman for District 8, Carlos Garcia, poses with his family after taking the oath of office during the inauguration ceremony on June 6, 2019, at the Orpheum Theatre in Phoenix, Arizona.

Earlier in the evening, Garcia called her onstage, named her the campaign's No. 1 donor and gave her the memento.\\n\\nCarlos has been on the front lines – organizing, fighting against SB 1070, fighting against Joe Arpaio, she says, her eyes filling with tears. It's actually been a great joy of mine to be able to use the same money that came from Arpaio, the same money that came from the state's incarceration system, to actually support his run for City Council.\\n\\nLike this story? Subscribe to support journalism like this every day.\\n\\nAs the desert night fades, Danny Ortega, a Phoenix attorney who has fought for civil rights since the Chicano movement, leans against a wood-carved bar watching Garcia mingle with campaign supporters. Ortega says young and old Latinos backed Garcia because they saw a candidate who looked like them, cared about them and sacrificed for them.\\n\\nFor too long, we lost our way, Ortega says, standing with his longtime friend Alfredo Gutierrez, who served for 14 years in the Arizona Legislature and has protested with Garcia. Too many Latinos thought they had to act white to win. Now, they're seeing the power in our own identity.\\n\\nGarcia moves closer to a grove of old trees, where it's quiet. He says it's justice that money won from a lawman who targeted his family and community, would help him overcome the campaign financing barrier most Latinos face when they run for office.\\n\\nI've had six people in my family that have been deported, I grew up undocumented. And I hold that truth, he says, shaking his head. I grew up working class. I'm a single child of a single parent. And with my mom's strength, that she was able to raise me, that she was able to succeed in this country and make sure that I got through school, went to college, I've been able to help my community for the last 16 years.\\n\\nBy the night's final vote tally, Garcia holds a slim two-point margin. As his supporters leave the plaza, no one knows if Garcia's lead will hold.\\n\\nIn the morning, the final election results are in. Garcia is at home with his family. With six words on his Facebook page, he says what everyone who supported the outsider Latino candidate – despite the odds – is waiting to hear: We got it! Thank you all!\\n\\nHe wins the race with 51.47% of the vote. By 384 votes, Garcia, and the community who voted for him, has made history.\\n\\nHelp support quality journalism like this. Subscribe!

{"original": "Matthew Frankel\\n\\nThe Motley Fool\\n\\nYou haven't even filed your 2016 tax return yet, so it may seem a bit early to think about your 2017 taxes. However, smart tax planning is a year-round activity – not just something you do when you prepare your return. In that spirit, here are five things you could do in 2017 that could reduce your taxes and boost your refund.\\n\\nGet a change of scenery\\n\\nIf you've been toying with the idea of moving to a different area of the country, it may interest you to know that moving expenses are tax deductible if the move is related to the start of a new job.\\n\\nYou don't even need to have a new job lined up before you move. For your expenses to qualify, the move needs to pass two tests:\\n\\nTime test: You must work full-time for 39 out of the 52 weeks immediately following the move. In other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break.\\n\\nYou must work full-time for 39 out of the 52 weeks immediately following the move. In other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break. Distance test: According to the IRS' wording, Your new workplace must be at least 50 miles farther from your old home than your old job location was from your old home. If you had no previous workplace, your new job location must be at least 50 miles from your old home. While this is a bit technical, the point is that your move needs to be sufficiently far away from your old job location to justify the tax break.\\n\\nIf these two tests are satisfied, you can deduct expenses such as driving mileage, packing supplies, shipping costs, hired movers, storage expenses, and lodging expenses on the way to your new home.\\n\\nThe best part of all is that the moving expenses deduction is an above-the-line deduction, which means that you can take it whether or not you itemize deductions on your tax return.\\n\\nIRS: Here's when you can begin filing your 2016 taxes\\n\\nTake a class\\n\\nIt's well-known that college students may qualify for a tax credit for paying tuition, known as the American Opportunity Credit. However, this is only good for the first four years of college, and only if a degree or certificate is being pursued.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the lesser-known Lifetime Learning Credit doesn't have these restrictions. The credit is worth 20% of up to $10,000 worth of educational expenses, and there is no degree program, credit hour or other requirement. You can take a single class for personal enrichment or to obtain career skills and qualify for this credit. If you take a class that costs $1,000, this credit can give you $200 of that amount back.\\n\\nThe biggest restriction on the Lifetime Learning Credit is income-related. For the 2017 tax year, the credit phases out for incomes above $55,000 (singles) and $110,000 (married filing jointly), and disappears completely above incomes of $65,000 and $130,000, respectively.\\n\\nBuy a house\\n\\nIf you have been on the fence about buying a house, the tax benefits could be the motivation you need to finally get into a home of your own.\\n\\nThere are several lucrative tax breaks available for homeowners, including:\\n\\nThese trends could affect your money in 2017\\n\\n1. Mortgage interest: You can deduct the interest on up to $1 million worth of mortgages on a first or second home. This is the big one -- if you have a $300,000 mortgage at 4% interest, this deduction can be well over $10,000 per year for the first few years of your mortgage.\\n\\n2. Mortgage insurance: If you have to pay mortgage insurance, which typically happens if you put less than 20% down on your home, this may be tax-deductible as well, subject to income limitations.\\n\\n3. Points: If you paid discount points to get a better interest rate, these are deductible as well.\\n\\n4. Property taxes: The property taxes you pay on your primary residence are deductible. In high-tax states, like New Jersey for example, this can be an especially nice tax break.\\n\\n5. Capital gains exclusion: When you eventually sell your home, you can make up to $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) in profit before you have to pay income taxes on your gains.\\n\\nHere's a more detailed discussion of how buying a home can save you money on your taxes.\\n\\nBe generous when charities need it most\\n\\nAccording to WalletHub, 20% of all charitable donations occur during the last 48 hours of the year. And it would be fair to assume that many more donations happen in the weeks before the end of the year when everyone is in the giving spirit.\\n\\nThe point is that charitable organizations need money all year round, not just at the end of the year. For 2017, consider giving to charity steadily throughout the year. For example, if you donate to your local animal shelter like I do, consider handing them a donation check in, say, May. Of course, they'll appreciate your donations whenever they come, but it could be an especially welcome gift if it comes at a time of limited cash flow.\\n\\nAlso, wouldn't it be easier on your wallet to donate periodically throughout the year, as opposed to trying to cram your donations in at the last minute?\\n\\nThe skinny about freelance money: How to get comfortable with income, taxes and expenses\\n\\nHere's a thorough discussion on the rules and documentation requirements for charitable donations to make sure you get to deduct every dollar you donate.\\n\\nThe best tax break of all\\n\\nOf all the available tax breaks, I tend to look at retirement-related tax breaks as the best of all. As I've written before, not only can saving for retirement boost your tax refund, but it can also help set you up for financial freedom later in life.\\n\\nIf you contribute to a tax-deferred type of retirement account, such as a traditional IRA or through a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plan, your contributions may be tax-deductible. Think of it this way – if you contribute $5,000 to a traditional IRA and you're in the 25% tax bracket, we're talking about $1,250 in tax savings.\\n\\nOn top of this deduction, low- to moderate-income taxpayers may qualify for the Saver's Credit, which is literally free money just for contributing to a retirement account. This tax credit can be worth up to $1,000 for singles or $2,000 for couples, so it's worth looking into.\\n\\nThe best part is that you'll be doing your future self a favor. Let's say that you contribute the $5,500 maximum to a traditional IRA every year for 30 years. You'll end up contributing a total of $165,000, and will most likely save tens of thousands of dollars on your taxes along the way. Based on the stock market's historical returns, your account could swell to more than $800,000 in those three decades -- quite a nest egg.\\n\\nTax-smart strategies for retirement savings\\n\\nBy saving for retirement, you can get a nice tax break now and a retirement nest egg for later. That's why I say it's the best tax break of all.\\n\\nTry any of our Foolish newsletter services free for 30 days.

'The Martian' crew keeping the party down to Earth\\n\\nA smiling Matt Damon entered the party, Globe statuette in hand. After wading through a sea of well-wishers, he clinked glasses with his Martian director, Ridley Scott. How will Damon commemorate his potato-eating protagonist in the film? Maybe I'll get (Scott) a potato soufflé or something, said Damon. Scott's plans after the (many) party stops celebrating his movie's best comedy win were earth-bound. After that, bed, he smiled.\\n\\n3. Jennifer Lawrence's smooch\\n\\nLawrence, best dramatic film actress winner for Joy, planted a bright orange kiss on director David O. Russell's cheek. I'm gonna keep this lipstick, because of the respect that we were given tonight, he told us on his way into the party. You never know what's going to happen this (awards) season, and it may be all I get. Lawrence met up with Russell inside the party after a quick-change – she swapped her bright red Dior gown for a short black Versace dress.\\n\\nThe 'InStyle' party had:\\n\\n4. Photogenic pairs\\n\\nIf there is no photo proof, did you actually attend the Globes? Everyone was snapping shots inside the InStyle bash, which offered stars colorful macarons, a bumping dance floor and a venue bathed in purple lights. Vanessa Hudgens and boyfriend Austin Butler waited in line for the photo booth, while Today Show co-hosts Al Roker and Natalie Morales took videos of their entrance into the party. Meanwhile, sisters Kylie Jenner and Kourtney Kardashian took selfies on a fan's iPhone – because she had a cute accent, according to Kardashian.\\n\\nRanked: Ricky Gervais' greatest (and groaniest) Golden Globe jokes\\n\\n5.Party traffic\\n\\nThe many Globes after-parties are all held inside the Beverly Hilton, within walking distance from one another, so naturally, the stars like to party hop. On our way to the InStyle bash, we saw: duet partners Selena Gomez and Charlie Puth power-walking from party-to-party, Globe-winner Brie Larson changing locales after switching shoes (she had on flat jellies) and married couple Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed holding hands and getting ready to head home.\\n\\nThe HBO party had:\\n\\n6. Raves for Ricky\\n\\nAt the HBO bash, a big star magnet that takes over the Hilton's pool area and an adjoining restaurant, Gervais got a thumbs up from a guy who knows what it's like to host a big show – Brooklyn Nine-Nine star Andy Samberg. I loved him. I always love Ricky. I'm always going to root for the comedian, though, said Samberg, who received critical praise for the job he did at the Emmys in September.\\n\\nSamberg said Gervais delivered his trademark, edgy comedy. That's what he does. He doesn't care. He goes for it. He's a very brave comic, said the actor, whose Fox series recently moved to Tuesday as part of a two-hour comedy block. I think he embodies what comedy is, really about where he'll say the things that chill the room, but then he wins them back with a really great punch line, which is impressive. He doesn't back off anything.\\n\\nAmerica Ferrera, Eva Longoria throw the classiest shade at Golden Globes\\n\\nWhen a reporter mentioned the ooohs that followed some Gervais jokes in the interview room, Samberg said, I was saying that. He did a lot of stuff I wouldn't do. The cool thing about Gervais is that he genuinely seems not to care. That's when a comedian gets dangerous.\\n\\n7. Khaleesi...and Ned Stark\\n\\nAt the Game of Thrones table, there was Emilia Clarke, who plays Khaleesi (a Dothraki queen). And at one Thrones table, it looked like there was an apparition. Could that be Ned Stark, whose first-season beheading was an early sign of Thrones' shocking twists and turns? It wasn't Ned, but it was the actor who played him, Sean Bean.\\n\\nWhen a reporter told Bean he was disappointed that Ned got killed so early in the series, the actor replied, Me, too. But Bean, one of the stars of Globes-winning film, The Martian, is keeping busy. He finished a run on TNT's Legends and he said he plays a Centurion in The Young Messiah, which follows Jesus Christ at a young age.\\n\\nRicky Gervais calls Sean Penn a snitch over 'El Chapo'\\n\\n8. Han Solo\\n\\nEven in a room full of stars, Harrison Ford was a focus of attention at HBO, with partygoers, photographers and even other actors aware of his presence...\\n\\n9. A happy Oyelowo\\n\\nDenzel Washington's lifetime achievement award presentation was a highlight of the evening for David Oyelowo, who was nominated for his performance in HBO's Nightingale. Denzel is my hero. To see him honored is fantastic, said Oyelowo, whose A United Kingdom and Queen of Katwe, the latter with Lupita Nyong'o, are scheduled to hit theaters this year.\\n\\n10. An uncanny connection\\n\\nWalton Goggins, a star of Quentin Tarantino's The Hateful Eight, and Tony Goldwyn, the president on ABC's Scandal, shared a bear hug near at the base of the stairs leading into the party. How did they know each other? He directed episodes of Justified, said Goggins. (Although many fans know Goldwyn from his acting work, he's often busy behind the scenes directing and producing.) Goldwyn marveled at Goggins' performance in the Tarantino film: Isn't he great?\\n\\nReview: Impish Gervais pokes fun at Globes, and its stars\\n\\nThe Weinstein/Netflix party had:\\n\\n11. A Moët vending machine\\n\\nThat's right, guests could literally deposit a (free) coin to get a (free) mini bottle of Moët champagne. We were so enamored we took a video.\\n\\nOh, and there was a Laura Mercier beauty bar, too. #treats!\\n\\n10 must-know moments from the Golden Globes\\n\\n12. A surge toward Katy Perry\\n\\nHalfway through the party Katy Perry showed up and joined Orlando Bloom in a corner booth. The party surged in their direction, causing extra security to flank their tables. The two later left with a carful of friends.\\n\\n13. Ricky Gervais hamming it up\\n\\nBy the time the Globes host joined the bash (around 9:15 p.m.), Gervais was ready to relax. To prove it, the comedian hammed it up by cheekily laying atop a banquette (Most Interesting Man in the World-style). Nearby, Jamie Foxx arrived (mini champagne bottle in hand) and promptly took selfies with model Jourdan Dunn and Harvey Weinstein. Did we mention we saw Aziz Ansari pulling out his Beyonce Single Ladies moves? Because it was epic.\\n\\n14. Helen Mirren getting her groove on\\n\\nLook no further than Mirren's cocktail table for the best vibes. That's where Morgan Freeman was sitting, and when Stevie Wonder songs came on, the two stars, plus their friends, got up and started getting down. (It only got better when the DJ slid into Jade's Don't Walk Away.)\\n\\nRicky Gervais & Mel Gibson are the Miley Cyrus & Nicki Minaj of the Globes\\n\\n15. Costume changes\\n\\nLike J-Law, at the Weinstein/Netflix bash fashion gals Kate Bosworth and Olivia Palermo both changed before they arrived. After her long, sparkly red carpet look, Bosworth opted for a second embellished Dolce Gabbana number (this time featuring trousers). I'm not very good at being at a party in a train. This is a little more party friendly, she told us.\\n\\nRicky Gervais zings 'unfaithful' Ben Affleck at Golden Globes\\n\\nThe Amazon party had:\\n\\n16. Cool movie news\\n\\nTransparent actors Jeffrey Tambor and Bradley Whitford, both Emmy winners, were among the stars attending Amazon's party in the Beverly Hilton's top-floor Stardust Ballroom, as the streaming service joined other networks and studios hosting post-Globes bashes. Whitford said he's looking forward to his upcoming film, Get Out, which also stars Catherine Keener. Key & Peele's Jordan Peele will direct what promises to be an intriguing combination: a horror film that deals with race. I think Jordan is one of the most talented people on the planet, Whitford said. I can't wait to work with him.\\n\\nThe Universal/NBC/Focus Features party had:\\n\\n17. Amy and her new man:\\n\\nTrainwreck star Amy Schumer held court at a center table with her new boyfriend Ben Hanisch and her sister Kim Caramele, along with Judd Apatow and America Ferrara. But come 9 p.m., Schumer had enough, she blew a kiss to Ferrara across the table and headed for the exit, with Kim helping out with her gown's train. As they exited, they passed Eva Longoria who was posing for pictures with friends of her own.\\n\\n18. Lots of trophies\\n\\nThere were winners to be had at the party. Christian Slater clutched his Golden Globe as he happily hugged Longoria and received back-slaps as he sailed through the party. Kate Winslet dazzled as cameras came to life with her entry. But no one was more appreciative then her Steve Jobs co-star Michael Fassbender. He immediately stepped in front of the flashes to bow down, hands upraised, repeatedly to Winslet and her new Golden Globe trophy. The smiling Fassbender raised his head up long enough to hug Winslet and engage in goofy conversation.\\n\\n19. Typical boyfriend-girlfriend convos\\n\\nFassbender might not have won a Golden Globe trophy, but that did not dampen the Irish actor's mood. He partied in a private area with girlfriend Alicia Vikander, who had her parents in tow. Fassbender was a picture-taking machine, happily accepting party-goers' requests to pose for selfies. Finally, Vikander had to lay down the law as she readied to exit the party. Michael, come on, she said with a smile. Fassbender took a final picture with fans, gave a smiling, Gotta go! and exited the party behind Vikander.\\n\\n20. The everlasting Eddie Redmayne\\n\\nThe Danish Girl went home empty-handed from the Golden Globes. But director Tom Hooper was happy to party with his stars Vikander (along with boyfriend Fassbender) and Eddie Redmayne, who flew in from the set of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them on Sunday afternoon. The jet-lagged Redmayne stayed as long as he could at the party before departing. He's got amazing stamina, said Hooper.\\n\\n21. A swift J.Lo sighting\\n\\nHow do you know a party is dying down quickly? When Jennifer Lopez does a 180-degree entrance. Lopez entered hand-in-hand with boyfriend Casper Smart, causing a string of party-goers to follow the star couple. But as Lopez eyed the increasingly-celebrity-free event, she suddenly stopped on a dime, causing a pile-up of followers behind her. She made a sudden turn right and marched straight for a side exit, a security guard lighting up the carpet ahead of her to prevent any stumbles. All told, Lopez, who previously hit the InStyle party, was at this bash for less than five minutes.\\n\\n22. A sweet sign off\\n\\nNine-year-old Room star Jacob Tremblay stayed out past 11:15 p.m., but was wide-eyed as he took final snaps on the empty red carpet before departing. He posed with his parents in front of a Golden Globe sign to remember the night. Tremblay than walked towards the valet line, arm linked with his mother's, starring up at the lights before getting into the family car."}

(AP) — Alabama left tackle Cam Robinson doesn't think an offensive coordinator change a week ahead of the national championship game will bother the Crimson Tide.\\n\\nSteve Sarkisian took over the top-ranked Tide's offense Monday when Lane Kiffin left a week earlier than expected for his new job as Florida Atlantic's coach. Both Kiffin and coach Nick Saban described the move as a mutual decision, but it left only a week for Sarkisian to get the offense ready for the title game against Clemson in Tampa, Florida.\\n\\nRobinson said the perception outside the program with an offensive coordinator change this close to the national title game might be the world is coming to an end.\\n\\nBut not here, he said. We just go out and practice and do exactly what we've been doing all year. It's just a new voice. That's it.\\n\\nSaban said Sarkisian knows the offense inside and out, and he's banking on that making for an easy transition for the title game.\\n\\nSarkisian, a former USC and Washington head coach, has been an offensive analyst with the team this season.\\n\\nThe guy has been with us the whole year, the whole football season, Saban said. He knows the offense. He knows the players. He's worked on the game plans every week. He knows the system inside and out, knows the terminology.\\n\\nI don't have any failsafe. I just feel like I have to make decisions based on what's best for the players to have the best chance to be successful and we made the decision and we're not talking about it anymore. We're moving forward and we're looking forward and everybody is going to do everything they can to support the people that are here now to make it work.\\n\\nAlabama quarterback Jalen Hurts had just 57 yards passing in a 24-7 semifinal victory over Washington, while backup tailback Bo Scarbrough ran for 180 yards. Saban clearly didn't like what he saw in some respects from that offensive performance.\\n\\nWe had 25 negative plays in the last game so what do you think I saw? he said. We had poor execution, a lot of poor fundamentals. Didn't execute well. Weren't very consistent.\\n\\nSaban said he doesn't want to change the offensive philosophy but has other players he wants to get involved in the offense.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nDENVER (AP) — Nikola Jokic considers himself a point guard who just so happens to be trapped in a center's 250-pound frame.\\n\\nI'm telling that to everybody, the Denver Nuggets standout said. But nobody believes in that except me.\\n\\nIt's as good a description as any for the hard-to-label and even harder-to-stop play of the 7-footer nicknamed Joker.\\n\\nHe doesn't exactly have the most athletic look or leap out of the gym, but he's elevated the Western Conference-leading Nuggets to new heights this season. Jokic is in line to become Denver's first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2010-11 and is being mentioned in the MVP conversation.\\n\\nJokic shrugs off all the attention. He's just an unassuming big man doing uncommon things on the court so often it's becoming common.\\n\\nA 7-2 Magic Johnson, Knicks coach David Fizdale said as he over-inflated Jokic's height in comparing him to the Los Angeles Lakers Hall of Famer. He's as good of a passer as any guard in the league. He can shoot 3s. But his ball handling is something I admire.\\n\\nJokic (pronounced yo-kitch) sees the floor with a point guard's vision, knocks down long-range jumpers with a shooting guard's poise and drives with a big man's mentality. He's earned the respect of San Antonio coach Gregg Popovich, who's spent some time chatting with Jokic. Popovich appreciates the various levels to the game of the 23-year-old from Serbia — enough to even rib him.\\n\\nHe's kind of pudgy, Popovich cracked. He doesn't jump out of the gym. He doesn't run that fast, but he might be one of the smartest players in the league. And he's got skills and he knows how to use them and he enjoys the hell out of himself out there. He's been very important for them, obviously.\\n\\nAt 24-11, the Nuggets are tied for their best NBA start in franchise history through 35 games with the 1976-77 squad. He's been a big reason why, averaging 18 points, 7.6 assists and 9.9 rebounds.\\n\\nHis recent play with three starters sidelined by injuries led TNT analyst Charles Barkley to anoint Jokic as a front-runner in the MVP race. His co-hosts didn't exactly agree.\\n\\nWait, he's not impacting the game? Barkley incredulously retorted.\\n\\nNo arguments from the Nuggets faithful. The fans serenaded Jokic with a chorus of M-V-P after his third triple-double of the season — and 19th of his career — in a win over the Knicks on Tuesday. He took it in stride.\\n\\nWhatever they want to do, said Jokic, a second-round pick in 2014 who signed a max contract over the summer worth around $147 million for five seasons. But maybe when we're finalists.\\n\\nReally, he's just a low-key player who in the offseason can be found back home in Serbia hanging out with family, friends or his two race horses.\\n\\nAsk him about Bella Marguerite, the newest horse in his stable, and his eyes light up.\\n\\nShe's scared but calm when the race comes, he recently said. She's a completely different animal. She's fast.\\n\\nOnce the ball goes up, he's a different breed of center.\\n\\nIn some ways an anomaly, Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle said. He doesn't show super athletic ability. He plays the game close to the floor. But it's one of the great things about the NBA game, guys like him that have the size and skill and know how to use leverage and angles and their vision and senses can be All-Star-caliber players.\\n\\nJokic grew up watching the likes of Tim Duncan, Dirk Nowitzki, Boris Diaw and Shaquille O'Neal. He's also been studying Bill Walton and Hakeem Olajuwon, to name a few.\\n\\nMixed a little bit of old and new guys, Jokic said.\\n\\nIt's hard to pinpoint his best game this season, but this one ranks up there: On Oct. 20 against Phoenix, when he joined Wilt Chamberlain as the only NBA players to record a 30-point triple-double (35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) while being perfect (11 for 11) from the field.\\n\\nHe raised his game even higher with starters Gary Harris, Paul Millsap and Will Barton out of the lineup (Harris and Millsap have recently returned).\\n\\nHe's always carried the same demeanor, the same swagger, guard Monte Morris said. Nothing's really changed.\\n\\nThis is something the Nuggets hope will change: Jokic making the All-Star Game . Not since Anthony wore No. 15 in Denver — Jokic's number now — has a Nuggets player suited up in the game.\\n\\nIf he doesn't make it, the great thing about Nikola is that it will sting, we all will be upset and hurt by it, but it doesn't get in the way of our team goals, coach Michael Malone said. He's truly a team player. He cares about the team first. That's why he's a unique young man.\\n\\nAs for Jokic's assertion he's really a point guard in a center's frame, Malone didn't quite buy it.\\n\\nHe's just a great player, Malone said, trapped in a great player's body.\\n\\n___\\n\\nAssociated Press freelancer Raul Dominguez in San Antonio contributed to this report.\\n\\n___\\n\\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports"}

But he said officials have seen instances involving websites advertising fake vaccines.\\n\\nVACCINE:How will I know when it's my turn to get vaccinated against COVID-19?\\n\\nAt least one fraud investigation has been made public in New York. The state's attorney general's office is investigating whether a health-care provider in Orange County misrepresented itself to state officials to obtain vaccine doses and distributed them to members of the public who aren't on the state's priority list. Parcare Community Health Network said in a statement that it is cooperating with investigators.\\n\\nIn late December, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced that health-care providers who fraudulently obtain vaccines could face up to $1 million in fines and loss of state license. Cuomo also said this week that he plans to propose a bill that would impose criminal penalties to medical providers and other entities who sell or give vaccines to those who aren't yet eligible.\\n\\nFederal prosecutors in Maryland also recently seized websites claiming to be biotechnology companies developing treatments for COVID-19.

So far, less than 4.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine even though more than 15.4 million have been distributed, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\n\\nThe FBI, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Federal Trade Commission and other agencies have recently sent alerts warning of vaccine-related fraud.\\n\\nThe Justice Department has made prosecuting coronavirus-related frauds among its top priorities, charging individuals and companies for submitting fraudulent applications to obtain millions of dollars in government aids and loans for small businesses, hoarding and gouging prices of personal protective equipment, wire fraud and money laundering.\\n\\nLast month, a Cameroon national was accused of selling nonexistent puppies and other animals online as companions for socially isolated victims. Authorities said Fodje Bobga and his co-conspirators charged hundreds of dollars a puppy and claimed the pets would be shipped to victims' homes.

Ocasio-Cortez, who voted for Pelosi as speaker Thursday, has said she will oppose a rules package, crafted by Democratic leaders. She opposes its new budget rules that she tweeted are a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg.\\n\\nMinnesota's Ilhan Omar and Michigan's Rashida Tlaib: First Muslim women in Congress\\n\\nMinnesota voters elected Omar, and Michigan voters elected Tlaib. Omar also became Minnesota's first Somali-American legislator, the first woman of color elected to Congress from the state and the first woman in Congress to wear a hijab, a Muslim head covering. Democrats will vote on new rules, clarifying the prohibition on wearing hats in the House does not apply to religious headwear.\\n\\nOmar, who sported a red hijab Thursday, said she understands the symbolism of her historic election, especially in a time when there is so much divisiveness in our nation…It still tells people that there is hope and we should still be optimistic about the American dream. And it's really not one off. There are so many of us that are walking into Congress that really are showing this nation that we are capable of having the American dream realized.\\n\\nFor her ceremonial swearing-in photo, Tlaib put her hand on her Koran. She also wore a traditional Palestinian robe made by her mom.\\n\\nFor my mom, it honors her in so many ways, she said.\\n\\nAside from making history, Tlaib said the whole event made her a little emotional.\\n\\nJust being here, you have to think, 'Is it really happening?' she said.\\n\\nAyanna Pressley: Massachusetts' first black congresswoman\\n\\nPressley, a former Boston City Councilor who became the first black women to represent Massachusetts in the House, tweeted a picture of the plaque bearing her name outside her new door in one of the House office buildings.\\n\\nPressley rushed around National Statuary Hall, hoping to find her place in in line to take her photo with Pelosi.\\n\\nIt feels good,'' she said of the day.\\n\\nJahana Hayes: Connecticut's first black congresswoman\\n\\nDemocrat Jahana Hayes became the state's first black woman – along with the state's first black Democrat – elected to the House.

{"original": "When San Antonio Spurs assistant coach Becky Hammon took over for ejected head coach Gregg Popovich last week, she became the first woman to coach an NBA team in a regular-season game.\\n\\nHammon, who is usually reticent on the topic, acknowledged the significance.\\n\\nObviously, it's a big deal, Hammon told reporters after the game Dec. 30. It's a substantial moment.\\n\\nThere's an even bigger moment looming: the day an NBA team hires a woman as its head coach.\\n\\nIt's right in front of us. It's going to happen, basketball pioneer Nancy Lieberman, who was the first woman to coach a G League team, told USA TODAY Sports during an interview last year.\\n\\nShe's not the only believer. Toronto Raptors president Masai Ujiri, whose Raptors have women in key positions throughout the basketball staff, and Richard Lapchick, author of the detailed racial and gender report cards for sports leagues, also said it's on the horizon.\\n\\n'BLOW TO THE HEART':Lakers' LeBron James responds to Jacob Blake ruling\\n\\nDURANT OUT:Expected to miss a week to quarantine after COVID-19 exposure\\n\\nBut how soon? A season? Two years? Five years? Hammon interviewed for the Indiana job after last season, but the Pacers hired Nate Bjorkgren.\\n\\nI would not be surprised if somebody isn't hired for the next season, Lapchick told USA TODAY Sports in July. But I would certainly think that within a season, for sure.\\n\\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said in 2017 that it is on him to ensure that it happens sooner rather than later.\\n\\nWhen asked what it will take for a team to hire a woman as head coach, Popovich gave a typical Popovich reply: I'm not the answer man, he said. That depends on people and organizations.\\n\\nIt is a thoughtful response.\\n\\nThere's no difference between a woman who knows the game and a man who knows the game, Popovich said. It's just another prejudice that probably has to be overcome just like a lot of other prejudices in the world become less and less as people pay attention to them.\\n\\nIt's a process, and it doesn't happen quickly but I think the more women there are, obviously it becomes more commonplace and more the rule and it'll depend on organizations realizing there are women who can do this. Every woman can't. Every man can't.\\n\\nBut the point is, there's got to be enough to choose from and it's got to become pretty commonplace before I think somebody's going to pull the trigger.\\n\\nSix female assistant coaches in NBA\\n\\nHammon is one of six female NBA assistant coaches with Cleveland's Lindsay Gottlieb, Sacramento's Lindsey Harding, New Orleans' Teresa Weatherspoon, Dallas Jenny Boucek and Memphis' Sonia Raman. Los Angeles Clippers' Natalie Nakase is listed as player development assistant and is working with franchise's G League team this season. Milwaukee's Sidney Dobner is a video and player development assistant.\\n\\nThat marks a decline over last season's number of women coaches. Niele Ivey and Kara Lawson left NBA jobs for top jobs with women's teams. Lawson was an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics, and Ivey an assistant for the Memphis Grizzlies but both took over prominent women's college basketball programs – Lawson at Duke and Ivey at Notre Dame.\\n\\nKaren Stack Umlauf was not retained as a Chicago Bulls assistant when Billy Donovan replaced Jim Boylen, and Brittni Donaldson moved from an assistant coach with the Raptors to the franchise's G League team. It's a strong possibility Donaldson returns to the Raptors when the pandemic subsides.\\n\\nNone of the new head coaches this season hired a women's assistant coach, though New Orleans' Stan Van Gundy retained Weatherspoon.\\n\\nNBA president of league operations Byron Spruell noted the league in 2019 partnered with the National Basketball Coaches Association to create a deeper and more inclusive pool of coaching candidates.\\n\\nAlong with women, the league is looking at coaches who are people of color. In a league that is 74% Black, according to Lapchick's most recent study, there were seven Black coaches at the start of the 2019-20 season. There are seven this season even though Nate McMillan and Doc Rivers were not retained. Rivers ended up in Philadelphia and Ty Lue took over for Rivers with the Clippers.\\n\\nThe league has avoided pushing teams to hire one candidate or another.\\n\\nThe answer is ultimately yes to should the teams be able to hire who they want, Silver said on Sept. 30. I don't see a way to operate a league where the league office, the commissioner is dictating to a team who they should or shouldn't hire.\\n\\nHaving said that, I know we can do better. … We're in discussions with all of those teams about making sure there's a diverse slate of candidates. We've looked at what might be an equivalent to a Rooney type rule in the NBA, and I'm not sure it makes sense. I'm open-minded if there are other ways to address it.\\n\\nThe same approach applies to female coaches.\\n\\nWe want it to happen organically, and when the right opportunity matches the right person, this will happen, Spruell said. We just feel we're so well positioned. If it happens tomorrow or the next day or this season or a few seasons away, we're really close. But we're not putting a timetable on it.\\n\\n'When she speaks we are all ears'\\n\\nJust six years ago, Hammon was the only women's assistant, and just three seasons ago, Hammon and Boucek were the only two. But teams see the value of hiring smart basketball minds regardless of gender, including the growing number of women in front-office roles.\\n\\nIt's something that it's sad we have to talk about it, Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams told USA TODAY Sports. We're all coaches. The coaching position has no gender. I've been around ladies who have coached the game. I'm blown away at the concept that we even have to talk about what do we have to do to get them (a head-coaching gig). …\\n\\nI'm saddened and frustrated on one end because we have to talk about it. At the same time, I'm glad we are.\\n\\nWhen asked about the topic in July 2019 at the NBA's Las Vegas Summer League, Hammon said, I've said it before, half the population has not been tapped for their basketball knowledge. It's an untapped resource, and the more people can see how it works, the better.\\n\\nNBA players on a team with a woman's assistant said they would have no problem with a female head coach. San Antonio guard DeMar DeRozan said, When she speaks we are all ears.\\n\\nAcross social media, NBA players, including Steph Curry, Ja Morant and Andre Drummond, took note of Hammon coaching after Popovich's ejection.\\n\\nBecky's in a spot now where she's in a position of power, Spurs guard Patty Mills told USA TODAY Sports. She's able to direct guys on what to do and that all comes from work ethic and what she does behind the scenes and getting herself and our team ready for games. She is an NBA coach who knows her (expletive) and gets it done.\\n\\nIn a cutthroat business, teams hire coaches who can generate success.\\n\\nThe players will know if you know something or not, Lieberman said. If you're not qualified, you're not going to be there.\\n\\nLieberman also comprehends the pressure the first female head coach will face. They're going to be asked the same questions over and over, she said. Are you good enough? Why did you get hired? How come there's not enough women in the NBA? Is there going to be jealousy? C'mon, are you kidding? Yes, there's going to be jealousy.\\n\\nThese jobs are really important, and there's some amazing male coaches in the NBA. It's important, yes, for equality and that next step to happen. But it's also incumbent on us to know that we're also competing against some very highly accomplished assistant coaches and NBA coaches. You don't get jobs any longer in life (based) on resumes. You get them on relationships.\\n\\nThat's why Lieberman said it's important for teams to hire more women's assistant coaches. A lot of these women have not built the relationships on a level that maybe our male counterparts have, she said.\\n\\nExperience can change that.\\n\\nHer knowledge of the game, the ins-and-outs of the game, is the reason why she's in the position she is, Spurs guard Derrick White said. It's the reason why she will just keep growing and growing and eventually become a head coach.\\n\\nContributing: Mark Medina"}

{"original": "WASHINGTON – Nearly 40% of judges President Donald Trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward LGBTQ rights, according to a new report by the LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal.\\n\\nThe report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of Trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\\n\\nOur analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of LGBTQ people as 'less than,' said Sharon McGowan, legal director for Lambda Legal.\\n\\nTrump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the Supreme Court – an accomplishment made possible by Senate Republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for President-elect Joe Biden.\\n\\nAfter four years as president, Trump has appointed three Supreme Court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.\\n\\nA whiter judiciary:Trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one Hispanic nominee\\n\\nAccording to Lambda Legal's report, released Tuesday, the Trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.\\n\\nThis outpaced Trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. During the Obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. Previous administrations going back to President Ronald Reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.\\n\\nI think in many ways, Trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the Trump administration, McGowan said.\\n\\nWhile the Supreme Court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of Americans.\\n\\nTrump's legacy:Biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'\\n\\nCarrie Severino, chief counsel at the conservative Judicial Crisis Network, which has promoted and applauded Trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the Trump administration is not about meeting quotas.\\n\\n(Trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, Severino said. The fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the Constitution.\\n\\nTrump judges:Trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\\n\\nConversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes\\n\\nThe report by Lambda Legal – which analyzed publicly available records on Trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to LGBTQ rights.\\n\\nIn 2019, Judge James Ho, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a Texas prison. Ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.\\n\\nLater that year, Judge David Stras, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' First Amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. The judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.\\n\\nLast year, Judge Kyle Duncan, whom Trump also nominated to the 5th Circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. Duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.\\n\\nAlso last year, two Trump-nominated judges to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting LGBTQ minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. The American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association have discredited the practice.\\n\\nBut in the opinion, Judge Britt Grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' First Amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. Judge Barbara Lagoa agreed with Grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.\\n\\nIn a candid speech in November to the conservative Federalist Society, Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito lamented society's hostility against traditional views on marriage.\\n\\nYou can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, Alito said. Until very recently, that's what the vast majority of Americans thought. Now it's considered bigotry.\\n\\nThe speech was widely criticized by Democrats and advocates, including McGowan. Lambda Legal also opposed Alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.\\n\\nMcGowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.\\n\\nIn the past, she said, Lambda Legal has won cases before Republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the Trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against LGBTQ rights.\\n\\nWe can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by Republicans or Democrats. We did not oppose every single Trump nominee. We did not paint them with the same brush, McGowan said. But, she added, There should be a baseline below which we would never fall.\\n\\nContributing: Richard Wolf"}
{"original": "AP\\n\\nOWINGS MILLS, Md. (AP) — Once considered a perennial contender, the Baltimore Ravens have gone two years without a winning season and reached the playoffs only once since 2012.\\n\\nAfter going 5-12 last season, the Ravens flirted with a postseason berth before dropping three of their last four games to finish 8-8.\\n\\nSomething's got to change if Baltimore is to reclaim its position among the NFL's elite.\\n\\nThough coach John Harbaugh conceded Tuesday that the Ravens desperately need to upgrade their roster — most notably at cornerback — he will stick with offensive coordinator Marty Mornhinweg, defensive coordinator Dean Pees and special teams coordinator Jerry Rosburg.\\n\\nMy heart, my gut and my head says this is the best way to go, Harbaugh said.\\n\\nMornhinweg was promoted from quarterbacks coach to his current position in early October after Harbaugh dismissed Marc Trestman. Despite the shift, Baltimore finished 17th in total offense and was ranked 28th in yards rushing.\\n\\nJoe Flacco threw for a career-high 4,317 yards and had 20 touchdown passes, but the Ravens averaged 42 passes and 23 rushes per game — an imbalance Harbaugh wants to see corrected in 2017.\\n\\nMarty believes in running the football, and I believe in running the football, Harbaugh said. We have not run the football well enough or enough, really, for the last two years. That has to change, and I think it goes hand-in-hand with being good at it and doing it a lot more than we do it.\\n\\nTerrance West led the team with 774 yards rushing and rookie Kenneth Dixon had 382. Harbaugh expects both to be back next season, and hopes to add another couple of backs to the mix.\\n\\nHarbaugh would also like to see Flacco, the 2012 Super Bowl MVP, perform better in his 10th NFL season. His paycheck this season ranks third among NFL quarterbacks and restricted the Ravens' movement within the salary cap.\\n\\nWe have a quarterback, and he's in that level of compensation, so we need to get him playing at that level, Harbaugh said. We need to put a group and a scheme around him that puts him in that place.\\n\\nSome priorities for the Ravens this offseason:\\n\\nFREE AGENT SHUFFLE: Baltimore lists 12 unrestricted free agents, most notably nose tackle Brandon Williams, receiver Kamar Aiken, right tackle Rick Wagner and Pro Bowl fullback Kyle Juszczyk.\\n\\nThe Ravens can't keep them all, especially because they're being squeezed by the salary cap and have many holes to fill.\\n\\nEverything's on the table in terms of how we can improve, Harbaugh said, and the financial part is a big piece of it.\\n\\nCORNERBACKS NEEDED: Baltimore's defense was ranked No. 1 through Week 12. Over the final four weeks, however, the Ravens allowed an average of 28.5 points per game.\\n\\nThat shortcoming can be attributed in part because of the ankle injury that sidelined Jimmy Smith and left journeyman Shareece Wright and rookie Tavon Young as the starting cornerbacks.\\n\\nWe need to add more corners. There's no question about it, Harbaugh said. If we can do that, that's going to dramatically impact our defense.\\n\\nHEALTHY FLACCO: Coming off a knee injury that ended his 2015 season after 10 games, Flacco didn't miss a start, but admittedly was not at his best.\\n\\nWhen you are only seven or eight months out of an injury, no matter what it is, there is going to be a growing process for it, Flacco said. This offseason will definitely help with that.\\n\\nBOUNCE-BACK YEAR: The Ravens have some decisions to make at tight end.\\n\\nDennis Pitta led the Ravens with 86 catches, a statistic that is noteworthy because he was returning from a second hip operation that sidelined him for the entire 2015 season.\\n\\nI'll be able to look back on this season and be proud of what I was able to accomplish, based on my circumstances coming in, Pitta said. It's obvious that as a team, we fell short of a lot of our goals. But if I can take away anything, it will be that I was able to come back successfully and will be able to build on this moving forward.\\n\\nPitta's contribution was necessary because the Ravens were thin at the position, losing Benjamin Watson, Crockett Gillmore and Maxx Williams to injury. In addition, Nick Boyle was suspended for using performance-enhancing substances.\\n\\nIf Pitta, 31, is to return, it will be with a salary cut.\\n\\nCLASSY ROOKIES: The Ravens hope their 2017 class is as productive as the current class. Ronnie Stanley (drafted sixth overall) was solid at left tackle, Dixon ran hard, Young played decently on defense and special teams, and Alex Lewis was a fixture on the offensive line before sustaining an ankle injury in November.\\n\\nI feel like every single one of those guys is going to be a good player, Harbaugh said, and a number of those guys have proven it already.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP"}
{"original": "GREENVILE, S.C. – Although she has dedicated her life's work to researching Black history at Clemson University, Dr. Rhondda Thomas wants you to know she's not a historian. She's a storyteller.\\n\\nEach story she discovers – whether it's infant Katie, an enslaved girl who was listed on the deed of the plantation when it was sold to John C. Calhoun's son in 1854, or Jimmie Gunn, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based musician who was invited to perform on Clemson's all-white campus in the 1930s – is vital, the Calhoun Lemon professor of literature said.\\n\\nThomas tells these stories through Call My Name, a nonprofit research project (and now a book) that seeks to tell the public about the Black people who helped Clemson University and the land it sits on.\\n\\nWe strive to give every person that we identify a story ... because together, they create a beautiful mosaic of history that is painful. It has love, it has joy, it has horror. It has all of the human emotions that are associated with being on this planet, Thomas said.\\n\\nFor months, Thomas has been working to identify and tell the stories of the 604 people buried in unmarked graves at Woodland Cemetery, Clemson's on-campus graveyard that sits under the shadow of Memorial Stadium.\\n\\nBut without remains – the red clay in which they are buried is acidic enough to dissolve bone – and without a lot of documentation, Thomas is turning to the surrounding communities to help connect modern descendants and residents with the stories buried in the clay.\\n\\nThomas has formed a community outreach panel, which will begin work this month to connect the history, stories and research at Woodland to communities in Pendleton, Clemson, Central and Seneca.\\n\\nThe panel's immediate goal is education, to shine a light on who is buried among the white faculty and alumni at Woodland, which researchers believe include enslaved Africans, sharecroppers, convict laborers and domestic workers who lived and worked in Clemson up until the cemetery was formally dedicated in the 1920s, Thomas said.\\n\\nWho were they? Clemson University has found 604 unmarked graves on its South Carolina campus\\n\\nWhile Thomas doesn't know if they will be able to identify any of the people buried across the steep hills making up the cemetery, she knows many families in the area have ancestral ties to Fort Hill Plantation and the many ways the land was used after it was sold.\\n\\nThose graves have been there for a long time. So we didn't discover them. They were recovered, Thomas said. The university used ground-penetrating radar to determine the location of 604 graves, discoveries they announced in October.\\n\\nAnd now that the final resting places are known, the work to tell their stories begins.\\n\\nIf (the public) believes they have family members that are buried on Cemetery Hill, please reach out to us. We want to talk to them, Thomas said.\\n\\nWant to read more stories like this?:Sign up for USA TODAY's This Is America newsletter\\n\\nTelling the complete history\\n\\nAfter the nation's racial reckoning in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis in May, Thomas said the importance of honoring Black history has never been more important.\\n\\nHistory gives us an opportunity to learn about the past, and honor the past as we make decisions on how to live in the present and in the future. And because African Americans were so integral to the development of our country, and at Clemson University, it's a history that needs to be front and center, Thomas said.\\n\\nSince Floyd's death, Clemson University trustees voted to remove two names of men known for racism, Calhoun and Benjamin Tillman. Calhoun was a slave owner and secessionist whose plantation became Clemson University. Benjamin Pitchfork Tillman was a governor and white supremacist whose name adorned Clemson's most iconic building.\\n\\nPresident Jim Clements established a task force on racial equity. Clemson football players organized a Black Lives Matter demonstration. Hundreds of students have rallied together to demand more inclusive support for Black students.\\n\\nBut even amid the activism and change of today, Thomas said, the past can't be ignored. Especially for Black people, who are reminded of the legacy of racism and slavery in South Carolina and beyond every time they look in the mirror, she said.\\n\\nIt's very difficult for me to forget this history because it's written on my skin. I'm a descendant of enslaved people and slaveholders and slavers. And so every time I look in the mirror, I see that history. I can't leave it in the past, because it's written on my body.\\n\\nClemson University voted to tell the complete history of Clemson in 2015, which includes the legacy of slavery and using convict laborers and sharecroppers to farm and build Clemson's earliest campus buildings.\\n\\nThe work at Woodland is just one part of telling that story, Thomas said. The rest will come with activism, time and progress.\\n\\nI don't see the cemetery project as the game-changer. It's just something that we need to do.\\n\\nIt's one of the many things that we need to do in order to fully embrace Clemson's history, to connect with local African American communities, to sit down together and figure out how the university can be more supportive of the whole state as a land-grant institution.\\n\\nFollow Zoe Nicholson on Twitter: @zoenicholson_"}
{"original": "Sally Jacobs\\n\\nPRI\\n\\nGeorge Keays is not a rogue kind of a man. A Colorado real estate agent and grandfather of three, the 65-year-old practices yoga and meditates regularly. But the U.S. government, he says, has left him no choice but to break the law. If, that is, he intends to stay alive.\\n\\nKeays has stage 4 lung cancer. As his treatment options appeared to be dwindling this fall, he went to Cuba for a vaccine treatment despite a federal law that prohibits Americans from going there for health care. Now, with President Trump's recent tightening of the regulations governing travel to Cuba, it has become much harder to travel there. But Keays needs more of the vaccine. This spring, he's going back.\\n\\nI am not looking to break the law. But I am not looking to die, either, Keays declared. People with stage 4 cancer, like me, should be allowed to try whatever they want to stay alive, whatever they think will work. The last thing they need is the government on your neck over some archaic regulation saying just take what is available here and die.\\n\\nKeays has abundant company. In the two years since relations between the U.S. and Cuba were normalized under President Barack Obama, a growing number of lung cancer patients traveled to Cuba for a vaccine called Cimavax, and more recently, a newer vaccine, Vaxira. These patients are an elusive group. None of those who went apparently provided their real reason for going to Cuba when applying for a visa, nor did many of them declare to U.S. customs officials that they were bringing multiple vials of the vaccine into the U.S. on their return. Few even tell their doctors they are taking the injections for fear they will refuse to treat them further.\\n\\nI can only see it as compromising him because now he has a patient on a drug that is not approved by the FDA, said a patient in Florida named Larry, who asked that his last name not be used. Larry has gone to Cuba twice for the vaccine — both times without telling his doctor because, He might be afraid he would be sued, or he might stop treating me.\\n\\nJust how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. Neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In January, the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y., launched a clinical trial of Cimavax with Cuba's Center of Molecular Immunology, which developed the vaccine. It is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the Cuban revolution.\\n\\nRoswell is now doing research to determine if they want to do a similar trial with Vaxira. It will take years for either of the drugs to receive any final approval.\\n\\nFor many patients, including some who were not accepted into the Roswell trial, travel to Cuba has become a much-talked-about option. So popular has the practice become that patients on Internet support groups routinely trade anecdotes and travel tips about their Cuban journeys. Until, that is, Trump threw a wrench into the process.\\n\\nMajor changes for patients going to Cuba\\n\\nThe change in regulations governing travel to Cuba that went into effect in November altered one of the most popular categories of travel to Cuba initiated by Obama, known as people-to-people, which allowed travelers to go to Cuba on their own. That's how many Americans have been quietly going to the island for medical care, even though doing so is prohibited under the U.S. embargo against Cuba. Now, people in this category must travel with an organization and have a guide present.\\n\\nAmericans can continue to travel on their own to Cuba for the purpose of professional research or to provide support for the Cuban people. But given that travelers in those categories are required to maintain a full schedule of activities, it's likely that neither will be a good option for cancer patients.\\n\\nAt the La Pradera International Health Center in Havana, where most American cancer patients go for treatment, Dr. Anabely Estévez García felt the impact of the new regulations in her inbox as soon as Trump announced back in June that the changes were in the works. American patients began canceling their plans in a flood.\\n\\nWe can not go at this time, a Texas man emailed García on the day of Trump's announcement. President Trump changed everything today. It is not possible to go directly from here. Keep us in touch.\\n\\nA patient in New York on the brink of travel wrote that she had decided to wait a little longer. Now, it will be harder to get there as our President has made it impossible to travel alone.\\n\\nNancy Kelly, 71, a California patient who traveled to Cuba for Vaxira this past spring, emailed that she was worried about the new regulations, too. How would she replenish her vaccine supply when it ran out in October? She decided not to go herself but sent a friend to Cuba to pick up more for her.\\n\\nIt was important to get back to Cuba before Trump's restrictions went into effect, sighed Kelly. With the new restrictions, I would need to go through a third country. The problem is that the vaccine has to be refrigerated, so, if you were on a long flight, that was going to be a problem.\\n\\nThe tighter regulations are only part of what is keeping patients from going. Another factor is the State Department advisory issued this past September warning American citizens not to go to Cuba due to alleged assaults against American Embassy staff. Investigators have yet to determine exactly who or what was behind the assaults, and the staff in Havana has been significantly reduced. For some travelers, it's all just too much.\\n\\nSince relations between the U.S. and Cuba were normalized at the end of 2014, the number of patients going to the plush La Pradera clinic at the city's edge had risen steadily. In 2016, 50 Americans came for treatment. Last year, the number of inquiries about the vaccines tripled over the previous year, while 47 patients had already made the journey to Cuba in the first eight months of 2017, according to García. Now, the numbers have plateaued.\\n\\nThere are many patients who are suitable for treatment but who do not come for political reasons, said García, seated in a treatment room at La Pradera this fall. As a physician, I feel very bad because I believe our vaccine is a good treatment that can extend these people's lives.\\n\\nBecause their own doctors are often not involved, patients wanting to go to Cuba must make arrangements themselves. First, they get in touch with La Pradera either through email or one of a number of medical tourism agencies in the U.S. or in Canada. They then send their medical records for evaluation by La Pradera physicians who determine if they are eligible for one of the vaccines, and if so, which one.\\n\\nUnder the Obama-era regulations, accepted patients usually informed the airlines issuing their visas that they were going for educational purposes or under the general people-to-people category. Questions were rarely asked and most flew directly to Cuba.\\n\\nPatients stay at the La Pradera clinic, a resort-like facility with a swimming pool and fountains, for four days, during which they receive their first of several doses of the vaccine. Each dose consists of four injections — two to the arms and two to the buttocks. One dose costs about $860, so the total cost of the trip, including airfare, lodging and a supply of the medication to take back home, can run well over $10,000.\\n\\nAt P&G Travel in Ontario, long one of the more popular agencies among Americans for booking travel to Cuba, the numbers are both up and down. Since Trump announced in June that he would be reversing aspects of the Obama administration's overtures to Cuba, the number of Americans booking travel directly from the U.S. to Cuba through the agency has plummeted by 60%. Instead, they're now going through third countries just like they used to do before Obama's normalization of relations. Since June, the number of bookings by Americans going to the island from countries other than the U.S. has increased by 30%, according to Tathiana Gonzalez, the agency's Cuba travel specialist.\\n\\nYou're either going to go or not go, said Gonzalez. When you're given a month to live, you go. It's kind of basic.\\n\\nWhat they are going for is part of the new wave of immunotherapy treatment that works by triggering a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Cimavax, for example, stimulates the immune system to make antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor, or EGF, that cancer cells need to grow, effectively starving the cancer. Vaxira is somewhat different; it triggers an immune response against a molecule specific to several cancers and is intended to ultimately block the cancer's growth. Only patients who have already received chemotherapy are eligible for the vaccines.\\n\\nCubans research a lung cancer vaccine\\n\\nWhile Cuba is often recognized for its pristine beaches and throbbing rumbas, it is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry. Prompted by the country's high rate of lung cancer, researchers began work on a lung cancer vaccine back in the mid-1990s. In the most recent of several Cuban trials, patients receiving Cimavax lived about three to five months longer than those who did not. Available to Cubans for free since 2011, it has been given to more than 5,000 patients worldwide.\\n\\nCimavax is currently available in Cuba, Colombia, Peru, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Paraguay. Vaxira, which one Cuban clinical trial indicates can extend life by up to two months, is currently undergoing more testing in Argentina. It is available in that country and in Cuba.\\n\\nRoswell scientists began collaborating with Havana's Center of Molecular Immunology, which developed the vaccines, in 2011, and scientists from both countries have worked in one another's laboratories frequently over the years. In the Roswell trial, Cimavax is being combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, which blocks proteins on cancer cells, called Opdivo.\\n\\nWhile talk of Cimavax has circulated in American medical circles for years, much less is known about Vaxira. Roswell researchers are currently doing preclinical studies of Vaxira in animals to determine if the vaccine merits a possible human trial. Dr. Igor Puzanov, director of the early phase clinical trials program at Roswell, said that it could take up to a year before a decision can be made on whether to proceed.\\n\\nWe know what the vaccine is supposed to do, he said. It's just too early to say if it does it.\\n\\nMeanwhile, at the Center of Molecular Immunology, scientists are now focused on taking Cimavax to a next step. They are working to extend patients' survival rate by identifying markers in those who are responsive to the vaccine. Patients with high concentrations of the EGF protein, for example, have been shown to be more responsive to the vaccine than those who do not. Camilo Rodriguez, a clinical researcher at the center who has worked on Cimavax for 15 years, says he believes that eventually, the vaccine might be used on a host of cancers.\\n\\nWe feel that the vaccine could be very effective against prostate cancer, for example, because those patients often have a high degree of EGF and that is related to the spread of cancer, said Rodriguez, seated in his laboratory. Eventually, we feel this could be useful in all kinds of cancer affecting the head, neck, bladder and prostate.\\n\\nAmerican doctors are not so sure. While some are cautiously optimistic about Cimavax and await the outcome of the Roswell trial with interest, others complain that the vaccine has been oversold and is in sore need of further study. Dr. Robert Doebele, associate professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado- Denver and a senior editor of the American Association for Cancer Research's journal Clinical Cancer Research, recalls sitting in a meeting with a dozen other oncologists discussing the best way to market a drug. Someone in the room called out, Do whatever Cimavax does!\\n\\nWe all let out a collective groan, said Doebele, who is George Keays' oncologist. It was hilarious. The fact is that I spend several hours a month answering questions from my patients about this. It's very prominent on the Internet and patients are understandably desperate to learn about it. But the fact is that we just don't know if this works yet.\\n\\nDr. Roy S. Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale University and a nationally recognized expert in the treatment of lung cancer, shares those reservations. Herbst says that without seeing new stats, it's not that impressive. For the moment, he added, I am not too worried about people not being able to go to Cuba.\\n\\nLike several other doctors of the patients interviewed for this story, Doebele advised Keays not to go to Cuba for the vaccine. One reason for that is that Keays is currently taking Tagrisso, a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Doebele is concerned that if Keays shows improvement while taking that and one of the Cuban vaccines, it will be impossible to tell which medication was responsible. But Doebele has other worries.\\n\\nMy biggest concern is safety because of the lack of oversight and regulation. I can't control what he does; I don't even know where he's getting it. Was it even a legitimate clinic where he got it? said Doebele. I thought I'd talked him out of it.\\n\\nBut he hadn't. Keays did apply to participate in the Roswell trial, as Doebele suggested, but he was put on the waiting list. He became frustrated that he might wind up in the placebo group in the study, and so he decided to go right to the front of the line. Cuba.\\n\\nKeays arrived at the La Pradera clinic in October and was advised that the vaccine most suited to his cancer was Vaxira. After consulting with his family doctor, Boulder internist William L. Blanchet, who was traveling with him, Keays received his first dose.\\n\\nTwenty minutes after I received it, I felt a little tired, but that was it, said Keays. The next day, I went for an hour run. I felt great.\\n\\nIf Keays was impressed by the professionalism of the doctors, Blanchet was even more so.\\n\\nOn paper, this looks very promising, Blanchet said of the vaccine. It resonates as being medically sound and potentially a major addition. It's too soon to recommend it to patients, but I would make them aware of it and let them make the decision. If I was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, I would definitely go down and have this be part of my therapy.\\n\\nOne of the other patients at La Pradera when Keays was there was Eduardo Sanchez, of Spain, a lean man with graying hair. Diagnosed with advanced stage 4 lung cancer, Sanchez said he, too, had exhausted most of the treatments available to him. Like most American patients, he learned much of what he knew of the Cuban vaccines on the Internet.\\n\\nUnfortunately, in Spain, there is no information about the Cimavax or the Vaxira, he said. It's too early for me to say, but I am very hopeful.\\n\\nQuestions on how to bring back the vaccine\\n\\nFor advanced stage cancer patients like Sanchez and Keays, going to Cuba can be difficult in itself. The trip is tiring and can be daunting for those for whom the treatment may be viewed as something of a last resort. Now, American patients face an even higher hurdle in the new and somewhat confusing regulations. The question many patients are wrestling with is how to get in and out of the country without getting caught, given the likelihood of greater scrutiny.\\n\\nOver the past two years, it appears that no one has been apprehended. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's personal importation policy allows some unapproved medications to be brought into the country, provided there is not an adequate alternative available in the U.S. and the amount does not exceed a three-month supply. But spokesmen for both the FDA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection say there is no record of either of the Cuban vaccines having been brought into the country or seized at the border.\\n\\nJust how to bring the vaccine into the U.S. is a hot topic on the online health care social network, Inspire, which supports a lung cancer group of about 53,000 members. Judy Ingels, 74, is one of them. Diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2015, Ingels went on Tarceva and her tumor shrunk somewhat. After she saw a CNN report on Cimavax at the end of 2016, she decided to go to Cuba while she was relatively well and still able to do so. Last spring, she and her family traveled from their home in Santa Rosa, Calif., to Havana, where she received her first treatment of the vaccine. All told, the trip cost about $16,000. That she was breaking the law did not trouble her in the slightest.\\n\\nI just didn't get hung up on it, said Ingels. My husband said, 'When they ask what your purpose is, just don't mention anything about medicine.'\\n\\nIngels had no trouble carrying an eight-month supply of Cimavax back into the U.S. in a hand-held refrigerated lunch bag. When she told the Transportation Security Administration agent in Florida that she was carrying a vaccine, he opened her bag and poked around but asked no questions.\\n\\nIn the months that followed, Ingels's tumor shrunk perceptibly, a fact that she attributes to Cimavax. Now, however, her supply has run out and she wants more. Presuming that she cannot travel with a guided group, given her purpose, she is considering hiring one of several professional mules who will fly to Cuba to get the vaccine for a fee. Two of them contacted by PRI declined to be interviewed.\\n\\nWe're weighing the options, said Ingels. We might travel ourselves through the Bahamas. But I have also talked to an individual who has offered to do this.\\n\\nNancy Kelly, who had a friend travel to Cuba on her behalf, was considering a return trip. But when a scan last fall showed that her tumor is growing, she changed her plans — at least for the moment. The change in her circumstance has not dimmed the retired administrative judge's anger at the government's imposition of limitations on American patients' ability to seek the treatment they want.\\n\\nI think it's absolutely outrageous. What Trump has done makes it so much more difficult to go, said Kelly. The restrictions that do not permit doctors in different countries to corroborate to help save lives is absolutely terrible.\\n\\n\\n\\nKeays is running into a similar problem since a recent scan showed that a mass on his liver is growing. Doebele, his oncologist, believes that means that neither the Vaxira nor the Tagrisso is working. Doebele has suggested Keays go off the Vaxira, in part, so that he might qualify for other treatments, but Keays continues to have faith. He's planning on returning to Havana in the spring for more of the vaccine. Keays intends to apply for a visa under the category of professional research arguing that he is a guinea pig for the Vaxira vaccine. He has become, after all, something of an expert on the subject. Over the past two years, he's tried a wide variety of treatments: two targeted therapies, multiple forms of radiation and a lot of meditation. He's been on Vaxira now for two months.\\n\\nIn between doctor's appointments, Keays has been working on a letter to the chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, hoping he might intervene on patients' behalf. He's getting other patients to write, too.\\n\\nI intend to do whatever I can to expose how these restrictions steal the hope, and possibly, the life, from patients suffering with terminal cancer, as well as other sicknesses that might benefit from Cuba's advances in medicine, declared Keays. The ignorance in this new policy is astounding.\\n\\nIn the meantime, for patients disheartened by an American government and doctors who seem to offer them only discouragement regarding Cuba, there is one source of potential support: travel agents like Tathiana Gonzalez in Ontario.\\n\\nUnaffected by the U.S. regulations, Gonzalez routinely forwards dozens of American patients' medical records to La Pradera, on their behalf, to see if they qualify for one of the vaccines. It's the only instance in which she gets involved in her clients' medical needs because, she says, the process is so stressful. She's the first to admit that she's no medical researcher, but she notices that some of the cancer patients that she's helped get to Cuba have lived for years. Like her clients, she waits anxiously for a response from the Cuban doctors: Are they accepted to go, or not?\\n\\nIt's such an emotional roller coaster, exclaimed Gonzalez. If they're not accepted, I cry because their cancer is so advanced. If they are accepted, I rejoice! I say, 'You're going! You are going to Cuba!'\\n\\nThis story was reported with a grant from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting. It was originally published on PRI.org.

I will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform. And if the 90% of Americans who do support common-sense gun reforms join me, we will elect the leadership we deserve.\\n\\nObama explained his position in a televised forum on guns Thursday night.\\n\\nI meant what I said, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper, saying the National Rifle Association has a stranglehold on Congress in this debate.\\n\\nThe majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than what you see in Washington. And the reason that Washington doesn't work well in part is because the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful, or those with the most money have the most influence, Obama said. And, you know, I'm going to throw my shoulders behind folks who want to actually solve problems instead of just, you know, getting a high score from an interest group.\\n\\nObama's pronouncement comes two days after White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest appeared to equivocate on that question, saying, I don't want to make a formal declaration here without having spoken to the president about it.\\n\\nObama to defend gun executive actions on CNN\\n\\nBut Earnest also said it's unlikely that Obama would ever have to choose between the gun issue and supporting a Democrat. Take, for example, Sen. Patrick Toomey, R-Pa., who co-sponsored a provision in 2013 that would have closed the so-called gun show loophole.\\n\\nThe president certainly gave Sen. Toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue. I think there are a lot of other things on which the President and Sen. Toomey disagree, so it's hard to imagine a scenario where the president is willing to campaign for Sen. Toomey, Earnest said, I suspect that Mr. Toomey's Democratic opponent, once he has one, will have at least as good of a record as Sen.

Pruden\\n\\nOpinion contributor\\n\\nWhen I was young, I was told, as were many of you, that I had to be patient.\\n\\nIt might come after a question like, Are we there yet? or, while standing at the Christmas tree waiting for some errant family member to get out of bed, it might have been, Can I open my presents now?\\n\\nIn that time of my life, I thought being patient just meant I had to sort of chill out. When I looked it up in the dictionary (truthfully, when I Googled it) I found a bit more ominous definition: Patience is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble or suffering without getting angry or upset.\\n\\nI contracted COVID-19 in early March, at the beginning of the East Coast experience. In fact, I was one of the very first admitted to my hospital for this condition.\\n\\nI say my hospital because I have worked at St. Joseph's for nearly 40 years as an emergency physician, and have found it to be a wondrous experience.\\n\\nTo say I was ravaged by this illness would be an understatement. Of the 31 days I spent on the intensive care unit, 18 of them were spent on a ventilator. I lost 80 pounds, and could not even turn over in bed on my own. But more intense than the loss of weight (I needed to lose some) and the loss of strength was the never ending awareness that I could not get enough air.\\n\\nNew year, new America:All the things to leave behind in 2020\\n\\nI became the poster child for impatience when I had to lie flat for my second CT scan, which occurred just before my second intubation. Lying flat made breathing so difficult that I remember screaming at the technicians to please, please hurry. It was the closest I have ever been to experiencing sheer terror.\\n\\nBy the time I was being discharged for rehab, I could just about feed myself and brush my hair. Fortunately, I am mostly bald headed so it did not take much effort to do that.\\n\\nWhat does this have to do with patience?\\n\\nWhen my fiancée, Liz, and I made arrangements for an August wedding, we were active in our St. Mark's church choir, we got pleasure in actually going to the movies and we just loved to dance.\\n\\nNow it was the middle of April, and I was oxygen dependent, I had no taste for food and I could barely stand with assistance, let alone dance.\\n\\nSomething to look forward to:Good riddance to 2020. Biden's win and the COVID vaccine ensure 2021 will be better.\\n\\nAlthough it has now stopped, for some still unexplained reason, flesh was peeling from my hands to the degree that my son Christopher and I joked that I could use them in a zombie apocalypse movie.\\n\\nFor me, the guideposts for patience were embodied in the Serenity Prayer. You know …\\n\\nGod, give me grace to accept with serenity\\n\\nthe things that cannot be changed,\\n\\nCourage to change the things\\n\\nwhich should be changed,\\n\\nand the Wisdom to distinguish\\n\\nthe one from the other\\n\\nThis was a chance for me to embody that prayer. The trick has always been defining that which I could change and that which I could not change.\\n\\nNo one knew why the skin on my hands was flaking. Perhaps it was a reaction to the 5,000 medications I had been given. The hope was that it would go away by itself, so I could listen to The Beatles and Let It Be, or I could listen to the movie Frozen'' and Let it Go, but I had to move on to something else.\\n\\nIn order for me to learn to relearn to stand on my own, to walk, to lift things, the medical team would identify the specific deficit, and the physical therapists would drive me relentlessly to do it just 10 more times. I even gave them murderous nicknames, which only seemed to intensify their efforts. They were special.\\n\\nFront-line doctor:Overworked doctors, nurses are getting vaccinated. Here's why you should too.\\n\\nAs for the oxygen dependence, I was having pain with each deep breath.

Suffice it to say that I was laughing so deeply I was forced to take deep breaths in spite of the pain.\\n\\nSo as far as patience goes, I think one must strive to identify the things in our control and work hard to make them happen.\\n\\nMore important, one must accept the things that are beyond our control and let the fates do as they will. The hard part is knowing which is which.\\n\\nIncidentally, Liz and I danced for four hours at our wedding.\\n\\nDr. James N.

{"original": "Michael O'Hanlon\\n\\nOpinion columnist\\n\\nWhat should America's next president, Democrat or Republican, do about Afghanistan? With an electorate tired of forever wars and a new Pentagon strategy focusing on great-power rivalry with Russia or China, the temptation for presidential candidates to promise a complete U.S. departure is palpable.\\n\\nInstead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current U.S. deployment in Iraq. That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. That time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the Afghan government and the Taliban by the end of 2020.\\n\\nBy the time America's next president is inaugurated on Jan. 20, 2021, America's role in the Afghanistan War will be approaching its 20th anniversary. Afghans themselves will have been at war continuously at least twice as long, if one dates the beginning of the modern conflict to the Soviet invasion there in 1979.\\n\\nWe may be exhausted with war, but that doesn't mean our part is over\\n\\nAmericans are understandably tired of this war. It has by any measure been a frustration, especially when measured against the more ambitious nation-building goals of the first Obama term.\\n\\nHowever, the recent Washington Post story alleging that officials engaged in Pentagon Papers-like deception of the American public about the mission is badly misleading. Whether it was the initial Bush administration strategy on Afghanistan, the McChrystal review early in the Obama years, or any of the subsequent Obama/Trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.\\n\\nNonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. The Afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. Even more to the point for Americans, the United States has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within Afghan borders. The United States probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.\\n\\nThe bad news is that there is likely no near-term exit strategy; this reality should be faced head on. The good news is that, in strategic and military and budgetary terms, the cost of the mission is sustainable.\\n\\nA future force of 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other NATO military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 GIs there. It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.\\n\\nThe advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. By laying out a plan designed to last for several years, Washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual Afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter Obama and Trump years.\\n\\nThe number of U.S. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually. The size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the Afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. But for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.\\n\\nPeace process:U.S. presidential hopefuls owe Afghan women their support\\n\\nThis idea for a smaller but enduring U.S. military presence in Afghanistan will go against much of the preferred sentiment of the Democratic base. But Democrats do not have the luxury of sweepingly opposing long-term military missions while castigating President Donald Trump for ending them recklessly in the way he just nearly did, yet again, in Syria.\\n\\nOf course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.\\n\\nAl-Qaida remains present in Afghanistan and just over the border in Pakistan, where drones flying from bases in Afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. The presence of the Islamic State terrorist group in Afghanistan has been growing, too. Neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the United States.\\n\\nEven so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of America's and NATO's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. Thus, Trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-Qaida and ISIS.\\n\\nWe cannot fight without boots on the ground\\n\\nSome will say terrorism in and near Afghanistan can be checked even without an American military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the Taliban. Perhaps any future al-Qaida or ISIS presence on Afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the Indian Ocean. Or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in Afghanistan.\\n\\nBut that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. Few saw the ISIS caliphate coming in Iraq and Syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. And the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the Hindu Kush. Standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.\\n\\nWith 5,000 American troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in Afghanistan, the United States could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at Bagram near Kabul in the nation's center, near Kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either Khost or Jalalabad in the east. It also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in Kabul, to help the Afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.\\n\\nIt's time to leave Afghanistan:Take the deal, President Trump; 18 years is enough\\n\\nThe annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. It would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the Afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.\\n\\nCommitting to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to Pakistan and the Taliban that the new U.S. president would not be expecting a Hail Mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. Perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.\\n\\nThe United States needs a policy that recognizes Afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, U.S. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. That overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.\\n\\nMichael O'Hanlon, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and author of Beyond NATO: A New Security Architecture for Eastern Europe.

Przybyla\\n\\nUSA TODAY\\n\\nWASHINGTON – President Trump plans to press Republican congressional leaders this weekend at Camp David to make a major infrastructure package their top legislative priority this year, as his administration readies a blueprint he'll tout in the State of the Union address on January 30, according to two White House officials.\\n\\nThe White House will release a proposal in mid to late January that will call for a wholesale change in the way the U.S. approaches big infrastructure projects, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is being finalized.\\n\\nTrump's pledge to renew the country's roads, bridges and airports was a major populist promise from his 2016 presidential campaign. But it was put on hold as GOP congressional leaders pursued traditional Republican agenda items in his first year in office, including tax cuts and failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare.\\n\\nAt a presidential retreat in the Maryland mountains this weekend, one official said Trump will make clear that House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., should put infrastructure above other priorities including Ryan's push to overhaul entitlement programs.\\n\\nSigning the tax bill late last year, Trump challenged Democrats to work with him on infrastructure in 2018. I really believe infrastructure can be bipartisan, Trump said Dec. 22. I actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road.\\n\\nYet Trump's confidence that Democrats – and Republican fiscal conservatives – are willing to play ball on infrastructure may be overblown. The main pothole on the road to infrastructure improvements will be securing funding, which will be even more challenging after Republicans pushed through a tax bill expected to add $1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade along party lines.\\n\\nThere's a desire among legislators in both parties to accomplish something significant in the area of infrastructure, said Dave Schnittger, a former deputy chief of staff to ex-House Speaker John Boehner, an Ohio Republican. But the idea of doing a large scale package begs the obvious question, which is 'how do you pay for it?'\\n\\nMore:Trump signs tax and spending bills, challenges Democrats to work with him on infrastructure next\\n\\nMore:Trump order seeks to speed up infrastructure projects, but advocates say it will waste tax dollars\\n\\nTrump's plan would move the country away from a project-based system in which the federal government identifies infrastructure needs and gives money. The White House now plans to delegate that role to states and private investors, who would also provide the bulk of the funding.\\n\\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers estimates that some $2 trillion is needed to upgrade the country's transit systems and address solid and hazardous waste, levees, ports, railways and schools.\\n\\nThe Trump plan aims to generate $1 trillion for improvements, including a $200 billion federal funding commitment, according to the White House officials. The rest would be made up by state and local governments and private investors.\\n\\nThe federal dollars will go toward incentives for private investors, rural projects, and transformative projects such as high-speed rail or major tunnels, according to the officials. It will also include money for workforce development.\\n\\nThe plan to boost private sector participation would be a big change from the country's previous approach.\\n\\nAccording to the nonprofit research group Rand Corporation, 97% of the funding for U.S. highways, bridges and roads comes from public sources. What's more, Trump's own budget request for fiscal 2018 cut infrastructure spending overall by $55 billion.\\n\\nUnlike with taxes, which passed with a simple majority, Trump will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate to pass infrastructure legislation – which means he'll need at least nine Democrats to sign on board. And many have said they are skeptical of placing so much responsibility for public works in the hands of private investors and localities.\\n\\nThey also may be wary of handing Trump another major legislative win before the 2018 midterm elections. Trump is pushing infrastructure to follow through on a major populist economic promise, especially with his tax bill being attacked as primarily benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers and his efforts to renegotiate trade deals like NAFTA still in flux.\\n\\nA former Manhattan real estate developer, Trump considers infrastructure, more than taxes and health care, in his wheelhouse, and his team sees rebuilding the country as an easy political win.\\n\\nPeople forget President Trump is a builder, said former Trump senior communications adviser Jason Miller. Infrastructure is an important next step in investing in our country.\\n\\nMore:Trump: Infrastructure To Be 'Envy of The World'\\n\\nWhat's more, the need for major upgrades is critical. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave all U.S. infrastructure – including transit, including air, rail, roads and bridges – a grade of D+ for 2017. The nation's state of disrepair has been demonstrated by recent events including a major power outage at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport, Amtrak rail derailments causing deaths and a New York City subway system in a state of disrepair.\\n\\nMore:Amtrak accidents hurt safety reputation, but railroad remains popular with Congress, riders\\n\\nFunding challenges\\n\\nYet Trump's own legislative wins may now work against him.\\n\\nThe new GOP tax law just made it harder for states and localities to raise money because property and income tax deductions aren't worth as much as they were in 2017. Democrats warn that Trump also extinguished a major potential funding source for infrastructure – a tax on overseas corporate earnings once floated by Trump economic advisers – that was instead used to finance lower corporate tax rates.\\n\\nThere is also resistance among rank-and-file Republicans to add to the deficit, especially right after the House voted for $81 billion in hurricane disaster relief. Congress also needs to focus on finding additional spending cuts for a two-year government spending deal that is McConnell's top priority versus forking over more money the infrastructure project.\\n\\nHelping states fund projects\\n\\nThe White House insists it is working on ways to help states finance projects.\\n\\nA dozen federal agencies have been coordinating on the blueprint with D.J. Gribbin, a special assistant to the president, who is the White House's point person on this issue. Gribbin previously worked in the private sector on infrastructure public-private partnerships and for Koch Industries, the company owned by the billionaire GOP mega donors and brothers Charles and David Koch.\\n\\nThe White House is open to hearing from states on ways to raise funds, including if they want to advocate for levying internet taxes that could help fund critical projects, according to the officials.\\n\\nTrump's idea to create a dedicated fund for rural projects is aimed at building support from a GOP conference that hails primarily from rural areas and would struggle more than urban areas to finance their share of the costs or attract private investors.\\n\\nThe history on infrastructure spending on the Hill has generally been split on urban and rural lines, not so much party lines, said Debra Knopman, the author of a recent Rand Corporation report on infrastructure. If your focus is on Amtrak and fixing the Northeast corridor, Knopman said, many rural lawmakers aren't going to be as interested.\\n\\nCritical needs\\n\\nAt issue is how to incentivize private companies to invest in projects that may be in the interest of public safety and commerce but not necessarily profit-making ventures, such as upgrading the lead-laced water pipes in Flint, Mich.\\n\\nAccording to Knopman's report, the federal Highway Trust Fund and many of the state funds for drinking water and wastewater treatment plants have not been operating on a sustainable basis for some time now, and communities with declining tax bases struggle to maintain their roads, bridges, and water systems and repay their debts to bond holders.\\n\\nThere's a question of how far you can go with bringing in private investment to, quote solve the problem, Knopman continued. And when it comes to places like Flint, she said, there's just no market there."}
{"original": "Associated Press\\n\\nBono and the guys in U2 are big football fans, as in soccer.\\n\\nSo when they sang about Sunday Bloody Sunday and New Year's Day, they had no intention of describing the end of the 2016 NFL season.\\n\\nYet, the firings of Chip Kelly and Trent Baalke in San Francisco, Mike McCoy in San Diego, and the resignation of Gary Kubiak for health reasons in Denver certainly rang true to those rock classics.\\n\\nUsually, the axings take place the day after the regular season concludes. Except, of course, for the teams in a rush to get into the personnel market extra early, which in '16 were the Jaguars (Gus Bradley), Rams (Jeff Fisher) and Bills (Rex Ryan).\\n\\nOn Sunday, while other franchises were scrambling to make the playoffs or improve their postseason standing, the coaching carousel spun wildly in California. With Fisher already canned in Los Angeles, Kelly and McCoy became unemployed within an hour of each other.\\n\\nBoth moves were predictable, as was the release of Baalke, whose success as a GM with the 49ers now, it's clear, was dependent on how Jim Harbaugh molded and improved the players Baalke gave him. Baalke won a power struggle with Harbaugh, who headed to Michigan. The Niners became historically bad without him, and Baalke's choice of Kelly to work with such a weak roster looks worse than hiring caretaker Jim Tomsula after Harbaugh left. At least Tomsula went 5-11, three more victories than Kelly managed.\\n\\nIndeed, his only wins in a 2-14 record came against the Rams, so maybe LA owner Stan Kroenke will turn to Kelly.\\n\\nDon't count on it.\\n\\nDespite my feelings for Trent and Chip, I felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary, 49ers CEO Jed York said in a statement. The performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. We all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. That is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.\\n\\nThe new direction for the Chargers looks like it will be north a bit to become a tenant of Kroenke and the Rams in the new Inglewood, California palace that will open in a few years. McCoy's team lost its last five games and finished second for two straight seasons in the tough AFC West. Injuries tore it apart, too, but with the focus on whether the Chargers would move to LA, it was hard to judge what kind of job McCoy was doing.\\n\\nApparently Chargers chairman Dean Spanos wants a totally fresh start when the club abandons its long-time home.\\n\\nWhich means both of the new teams in Los Angeles, which was without the NFL since 1995 until the Rams moved back last year, will be riding the coaching carousel.\\n\\nMore moves could be coming, too. Is Chuck Pagano safe in Indianapolis? Might the Saints do something with Sean Payton? What about Bears coach John Fox?\\n\\nSafe for another year are Todd Bowles and Mike Maccagnan, who the Jets are bringing back. And Cleveland coach Hue Jackson, despite a 1-15 record. And Marvin Lewis despite the meltdown in Cincinnati.\\n\\nThe saddest news comes from Denver. Never was there a question about Gary Kubiak returning after leading the Broncos to their Super Bowl win last February. But Kubiak's health issues forced him to step aside, disappointing fans, players and John Elway alike.\\n\\nWe love Kube, we love how he treated us, said cornerback Aqib Talib. We pray he gets healthy.\\n\\nDenver won't have any trouble filling Kubiak's spot. One of the hot candidates, for example, is Atlanta offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan, son of Mike Shanahan, who coached Elway to two Super Bowl championships.\\n\\nGiven how well Kubiak fit in the Broncos' family, such a hire makes a lot of sense.\\n\\nThen again, sensibility isn't always a criteria in NFL coaching circles.\\n\\n___\\n\\nFor more NFL coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"}
