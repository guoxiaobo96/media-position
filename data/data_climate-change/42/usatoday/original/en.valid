depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.\n\nthen there's all that lingo that comes with mastering the biological theories behind dieting, like ketosis and alkaline and lectin — phrases that make you feel like you're in a science class rather than just trying to shed a few pounds or live a healthier life.\n\nhave no fear, because we've got a simplified guide for you about the trendiest diets going into the new year — that self-conscious time when everyone's reevaluating their lifestyle.\n\non wednesday, u.s. news and world report released its annual rankings of the best diets for 2019, revealing the mediterranean diet was the best overall choice.\n\nmore:mediterranean is the best way to eat in 2019, according to new diet rankings\n\nmore:need a new diet this new year? here's how to pick one and stick with it\n\nmore:how to get fit and stay in shape in the new year\n\neach diet description below is a rating of its effectiveness, based on u.s. news and world report rankings. we've included their findings, based on input from a panel of health experts, on weight loss and healthiness for each diet. while doing this study they took into account the diet being relatively easy to follow, nutritious, safe, effective for weight loss and protective against diabetes and heart disease.\n\nhere are the diet trends you're likely to see referenced in celebrity instagram captions in 2019.\n\nketogenic\n\nperhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the ketogenic, or keto, diet. celebs like kourtney kardashian, al roker and vinny guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname keto guido on the new seasons of jersey shore) have popularized the diet. ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. so, instead, it burns fat. the keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. u.s. news & world report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 3.1/5 weight loss | 1.5/5 healthy\n\npaleo\n\nthe philosophy of this diet is in the name. the paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our paleolithic ancestors. in case you need to brush up on your high school science, the paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. and, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the paleolithic era, paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. those who follow the paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to stone age-approved meals.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 2.5/5 weight loss | 2.7/5 healthy\n\nalkaline diet\n\nacid is the enemy of the alkaline diet. the thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. you may be thinking: what else is there to eat? the alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. these are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a ph value of 7, which is neutral, or above. foods with a ph value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. that said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the ph values of your food will change the overall ph balance of your body. it will do that naturally. however, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 2.1/5 weight loss | 3.0/5 healthy\n\nwhole30\n\na popular diet that spurred a new york times bestselling book, whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. a head of broccoli? go for it. a piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? not so much. the program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life. this program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 2.4/5 on weight loss | 2.4/5 on healthy\n\nmediterranean\n\nthe mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the mediterranean. the diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on bad cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. for example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. in essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 3.0/5 on weight loss | 4.9/5 on healthy\n\nflexitarian\n\nthink of the flexitarian diet as vegetarian with a lot of cheat days. the term applies to people who typically eat meatless but occasionally incorporate meat or fish into their diet. new york times columnist mark bittman (who also wrote vb6: eat vegan before 6:00) has a big role in popularizing this diet. bittman, as his book title suggests, advocates eating vegan before 6 p.m. an easier way to ease into this diet is by doing a few meatless days a week, says dawn jackson blatner, the author of the flexitarian diet and a registered dietitian, until you reach the top tier, which is five meatless days a week.\n\nu.s. news & world report: 3.4/5 on weight loss | 4.7/5 on healthy\n\nlectin-free\n\nwe can trace the popularity of this diet back to kelly clarkson's praise of the plant paradox cookbook by dr. steve gundry. she said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. an extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation. an extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. it's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.\n\nu.s. news & world report: no ranking available
thomas maresca\n\nspecial to usa today\n\nseoul — when north and south korea meet tuesday for the first time in two years, both sides hope the talks will lead to improved relations beyond next month's winter olympics near here.\n\nat the same time, u.s. and south korean leaders vowed that the dialogue won't weaken their hard stance against the north's burgeoning nuclear and missile programs.\n\nthe will to enhance north-south relations must be backed up not by words, but by practical actions to foster inter-korean reconciliation and unity, and reunification, the north's official korean central news agency (kcna) said in an editorial sunday.\n\n\n\nthe two koreas will meet in the border village of panmunjom, located in the demilitarized zone that has divided the korean peninsula since a war ended in 1953 with an armistice but no peace treaty.\n\nnorth korea alerted the south over the weekend that it will send its veteran negotiator on inter-korean relations, ri son gwon, to lead its five-person delegation to the meeting. ri has represented pyongyang for cross-border military talks since 2006.\n\n\n\nthe meeting will discuss the north's potential participation in the winter olympics being held feb. 9-25 in pyeongchang, south korea, as well as ways to ease the tensions after several months of provocative missile launches by the north and the isolated country's sixth nuclear test in september.\n\n\n\nboth sides appear to hope that the olympics can be a platform for improving relations between the neighbors.\n\nmore:kim jong un's purported birthday is no holiday in north korea\n\nmore:china clamps down on north korea trade as part of u.n. sanctions\n\nnorth korean dictator kim jong un said in a new year's day address that the olympics would be a good occasion to show the greatness of the korean people and suggested that pyongyang was willing to send a delegation to the games.\n\n\n\nchang ung, north korea's representative to the international olympic committee, told reporters at beijing's international airport on saturday that his country is likely to participate in the winter games, japan's kyodo news agency reported.\n\nnorth korea would likely send figure skating pair ryom tae ok and kim ju sik to the games. they captured a bronze medal last february at the asian winter games in japan.\n\n\n\nsouth korean president moon jae in has repeatedly said he wants the pyeongchang olympics to be a means for re-engagement and conflict resolution with the north.\n\n\n\ni will strive to make the pyeongchang olympics the 'peace olympics' and furthermore to peacefully resolve the north korean nuclear issue so that this can be a year when peace is cultivated on the korean peninsula, moon said friday.\n\n\n\nmoon also said he wouldn't take a soft stance with the north and vowed to strengthen south korea's military. i won't be weak-kneed or just focus on dialogue, as we did in the past, moon said.\n\nthe remarks were seen as way to placate conservatives in south korea, who are skeptical of talks with the north.\n\ncritics in south korea have expressed concern that the north will use the olympics as a way to skirt international sanctions and try to drive a wedge between seoul and washington.\n\nthe united states agreed to south korea's request to delay joint military exercises during the winter games last week during a phone call between president trump and moon.\n\nthe two leaders agreed to continue the campaign of maximum pressure against north korea and to not repeat mistakes of the past, the white house said.\n\ntrump said over the weekend that he supported north korean participation in the olympics and hoped the talks would extend further.\n\ni would love to see them take it beyond the olympics, he said. and at the appropriate time, we'll get involved, trump added, while at the camp david presidential retreat saturday.\n\ntrump said he would be willing to speak directly with kim, but doubled down on his tough talk against north korea's communist leader.\n\nhe knows i'm not messing around, not even a little bit, trump said.\n\nnikki haley, the u.s. ambassador to the united nations, said trump's comments didn't indicate a change in policy. there is no turnaround, she said sunday on abc's this week.\n\nwhat he has basically said is, 'yes, there could be a time where we talk to north korea, but a lot of things have to happen before that actually takes place. they have to stop testing. they have to be willing to talk about banning their nuclear weapons.' ... what we're trying to do is make sure we don't repeat what's happened the last 25 years, she said.\n\ntuesday's agenda in sorting out matters related to the olympics includes whether the north's delegation would travel to the games by land and whether the two koreas will march under a unified korean flag during the opening and closing ceremonies.\n\nalso at stake are the costs of accommodations and other expenses. the international olympic committee has said it is willing to cover north korea's costs if pyongyang takes part in the games, but some have questioned whether that would violate united nations sanctions imposed on the north for its missile and nuclear tests.\n\nsouth korea's unification minister, cho myoung gyon, hoped the discussion of the olympics paves the way for better ties.\n\nit is good that the resumption of inter-korean talks could set the tone for an improvement in ties between the two koreas, and better relations could become a small catalyst for helping resolving the north korean nuclear issue, he told reporters friday.
nancy armour\n\nusa today sports\n\nthere are no failed coaches in the nfl, only ones who haven't been rehired yet.\n\nat least, that's how it seems at this time of year. as sure as there will be a flurry of pink slips around the nfl after the end of the regular season, so it is, too, that the various wish lists will look remarkably similar, the names on them all familiar.\n\nmike shanahan, 63, has been off the sidelines for two years, and you can still see the smoke from the dumpster fire he left in washington. he might have two super bowl rings, but he's won only one playoff game without that guy named elway.\n\nnfl coaching carousel: breaking down every hire\n\nchip kelly's final season in philadelphia was such a train wreck eagles owner jeffrey lurie didn't bother waiting for the end of the season to get rid of him. his questionable personnel moves (yeah, demarco murray was a huge upgrade over lesean mccoy), personality quirks and 6-9 record this year were bad enough, but you cross a line when you mess with a team's annual holiday party.\n\ndoug marrone is not exactly what you'd call loyal or successful, and pat shurmur has been less than overwhelming as a head coach and an offensive coordinator.\n\nyet if rumors and league sources are to be believed, all of them are candidates for some of the six jobs – and counting – that are available. should sean payton decide he needs a change of scenery, or the new orleans saints make that decision for him, the coaching carousel will screech to a halt to let him board, too.\n\nprobably even let him have his pick of horses.\n\neven tom coughlin, who is 69 and three years removed from his last winning season, surely got a few phone calls after saying tuesday he's not necessarily done with coaching.\n\nbell: one pressing question for every nfl playoff team\n\nthe nfl is a bottom-line business, no question. but when owners are spending the equivalent of a small country's gdp on player salaries, they tend to be leery of taking a flyer on someone who could as easily be the next marty mornhinweg as he could be bill belichick.\n\nor, put more simply, you don't let your 16-year-old have the first test drive of your new ferrari, even if he or she did just ace the driver's test.\n\nthere are owners who will take a chance on highly regarded coordinators, especially if they're familiar with them or the coach-to-be has the right connections. but more often than not, they'll go with someone who's got experience -- even when that experience ought to come with a disclaimer and anti-nausea pills.\n\nhow else to explain norv turner being a head coach for three teams despite having seven winning seasons in 15 years? or eric mangini landing on his feet after his new york jets ended the 2008 season in a tailspin.\n\nafc wild-card matchup previews: chiefs at texans, steelers at bengals\n\nheck, rex ryan was out of work for all of two weeks despite winning 26 games in his last four seasons as jets coach. should ryan find himself out of work if the buffalo bills falter again next season, you can be sure another team will be waiting to snatch him and his penchant for lofty promises.\n\nsee, owners are always certain it will be different with their team. that the mistakes a coach made in his first stop will help him avoid similar pitfalls in the second. or third. maybe even fourth.\n\nafter all, belichick wasn't the second coming of vince lombardi when he was in cleveland. far from it. pete carroll looked as if he was better suited for the college game until he went to seattle. the folks in philadelphia would probably give just about anything to have andy reid back right about now.\n\nbut more often than not, they are the exception to the rule.\n\nhiring an experienced coach, even one with baggage, might seem like a shortcut to success. just remember that the guy who seems like the answer to all of your problems was once the source of someone else's.\n\nfollow nancy armour on twitter@nrarmour\n\nphotos: nfl coaching carousel
it's easy to want clarity on what the philadelphia eagles have to do following a season that will mercifully end sunday.\n\nbut first, the eagles have to decide on their quarterback, their head coach and their general manager.\n\nonce they do that, they can decide how to fix a season that went horribly wrong in so many ways.\n\nrest assured, something will change on a team that is 4-10-1 heading into its finale against the washington football team on sunday night. it's even likely that eagles president and ceo jeffrey lurie already knows what he wants to do.\n\nwhere could he go? five potential nfl landing spots for carson wentz if he leaves eagles\n\neric bieniemy is ready to be head coach:which nfl team will finally take him?\n\nthe eagles' dream has already been messed up.\n\nhere is a look at each possible scenario for the eagles' offseason:\n\n1. keep the status quo\n\nthe easiest solution, of course, is for lurie to keep general manager howie roseman, head coach doug pederson and quarterback carson wentz as the starter.\n\nthat way, the eagles can keep the framework in place in which wentz remains the franchise quarterback. it will then be up to roseman to improve the players around him and pederson to coach them better.\n\nthat seems to be the preference of pederson, who again on friday expressed confidence that he will return for 2021. he said he will meet with lurie, as he always does after a season, early next week.\n\nbut if pederson is returning, he said his priority is fixing wentz, who will finish the season sitting for the last 4 1/2 games while rookie jalen hurts took over.\n\nwentz completed a career-low 57.4% of his passes before he was benched dec. 6 in favor of rookie jalen hurts. he also threw an nfl-high 15 interceptions and has been sacked a league-high 50 times.\n\nit's a big dropoff from his previous four seasons.\n\ni think these last four games have allowed carson to just kind of take a step back and just evaluate and just see and work on some things that we've helped him with, and things that we continue to help him with as we move forward, pederson said.\n\nthat's probably been the biggest thing that's come out of these last couple of weeks. listen, i've got a ton of confidence in carson wentz and always have. our offseason is going to be geared towards getting things fixed as quarterbacks, and obviously as a team, and that falls on my shoulder.\n\non the one hand, the eagles can make the case that much of wentz's struggles stemmed from the injury-ravaged offensive line in which jason kelce was the only starter to make it through the entire season in addition to a wide receiver corps led by rookies and first-year players.\n\nthe eagles will end up using 14 different line combinations in their 16 games, an nfl record. two starters – left tackle andre dillard and right guard brandon brooks – missed the entire season. and three others – right tackle lane johnson, left guard isaac seumalo and left tackle/right guard jason peters – missed at least seven games.\n\npeters, who will turn 39 years old in january, is the only one in that group who's not expected back.\n\ni look at the injuries and that's something we've got to talk about in the offseason, pederson said. we've got to discuss that and see if i need to change up practice or if i need to maybe practice harder or be more physical in training camp.\n\nthe quarterback, whether it's wentz or hurts, will also have an entire offseason with young receivers in jalen reagor, john hightower and quez watkins.\n\nthat didn't happen last spring because of the pandemic.\n\nthe more you do things, the more repetition, the more chemistry, is always better, reagor said. getting an offseason, being able to do otas, will only make us better because we'll be around each other more, so it's kind of self-explanatory.\n\nbut if lurie truly believes in roseman and pederson – they did lead the eagles to their first-ever super bowl victory just three years ago – he could bring in a senior-type adviser to help with the draft, free agency and other type of decisions.\n\nhe could also force pederson to give up play-calling duties on offense. pederson has been reluctant to give up play-calling duties in the past, even though he admitted doing just that from time to time during the season.\n\n2. fire roseman\n\nroseman's draft record has been spotty at best since he got full control over personnel decisions in 2016.\n\nto his credit, roseman hit on all five his 2018 draft picks, most notably with tight end dallas goedert and defensive end josh sweat, along with running back miles sanders in the second round of 2019.\n\nbut he also missed badly on several others, most notably with cornerbacks sidney jones and rasul douglas in the second and third rounds, respectively, of the 2017 draft, and wide receiver j.j. arcega-whiteside in the second round of 2019.\n\nthose misses are glaringly evident on this team.\n\nthe most egregious part about arcega-whiteside, who was a healthy scratch in four games this season, is that seattle took dk metcalf seven picks after arcega-whiteside. metcalf has 1,282 yards receiving this season. arcega-whiteside has 45.\n\nand while reagor has a chance to be a good nfl wide receiver, roseman, picking 21st in the first round, took reagor over justin jefferson, who went with the very next pick to the minnesota vikings.\n\njefferson has 1,267 yards receiving while reagor, who missed five games to have thumb surgery, has 381.\n\nbut roseman's problems don't stop there.\n\nthe eagles are expected to be as much as $70 million over the salary cap in 2021, meaning that they'll have little flexibility to go after a marquee free agent even after releasing several veterans and/or restructuring contracts.\n\nwentz's contract, meanwhile, is quickly becoming an albatross. if the eagles were to release wentz, he would count $59.2 million in dead money against the salary cap. that would add another $25 million to their estimated $70 million cap deficit.\n\nif they were to trade wentz, the eagles would still be on the hook for a $34 million dead money charge for 2021.\n\nthe eagles experienced a similar situation with wide receiver alshon jeffery this season. he would have counted $26 million in dead money had he been released last spring. ideally, that would have happened because jeffery was already in decline and coming off foot surgery.\n\ninstead, the eagles kept jeffery, even as he missed eight games to start the season. he has just six catches for 115 yards in seven games. roseman also traded for desean jackson in the spring of 2019. he will end up playing in only eight of a possible 33 games.\n\na new general manager would certainly have quite a mess to clean up.\n\nthe eagles have 12 players who will count at least $10 million against the salary cap next season. that means that many veterans, such as tight end zach ertz, jeffery, jackson, defensive tackle malik jackson, likely won't be returning.\n\nbut it could also mean defensive tackle fletcher cox, defensive end brandon graham, right tackle lane johnson and perhaps even right guard brandon brooks will have to rework their contracts in order to stay.\n\nperhaps that new gm is already on staff as the nfl network reported last week that former kansas city chiefs and cleveland browns gm john dorsey has been working as a consultant for the past few months.\n\nif there is a change at general manager, whether it's dorsey or someone else, that will likely mean a new coach is coming, too. then again, if it's dorsey, it's possible that pederson could stay. pederson was the offensive coordinator under andy reid when dorsey was the general manager in kansas city.\n\nstill, if the franchise goes with a new general manager and head coach, it's likely the eagles might be trying to get high enough in the draft to take a quarterback in either ohio state's justin fields or byu's zach wilson, assuming that clemson's trevor lawrence will go first overall to jacksonville.\n\nbut that also means at least a few years of rebuilding, a luxury that roseman and pederson likely won't get even if they do return.\n\n3. fire pederson\n\nit's possible that lurie could decide that a coaching change is necessary.\n\non the one hand, wentz had by far his worst season, and pederson either couldn't or wouldn't get him on the move more; pederson said earlier in the season that wentz was dynamic.\n\nthen there was this from sanders when asked what went wrong this season: just not a lot of smart football throughout the whole season through all positions, throughout the team. as far as offensively, not very good execution from everybody, including myself, a lot of turnovers, including myself. i feel like a lot of things went wrong.\n\npederson didn't have a lot to work with, and it's safe to say that no one expected wentz to regress as much as he did.\n\non the other hand, if lurie and/or roseman were to determine that hurts is the answer at quarterback, then perhaps lurie might want to go after oklahoma coach lincoln riley, who coached hurts in 2019, one year after he coached kyler murray, who's now a rising star with the arizona cardinals.\n\nlurie has always envisioned the eagles as an innovative, cutting-edge offensive team. it's why he hired chip kelly as head coach in 2013 after watching kelly's fast-paced offense at oregon.\n\nbefore that, it was andy reid and his west coast offense that he learned from mike holmgren, who was a disciple of bill walsh.\n\neven pederson fit that bill when he was hired in 2016.\n\nso if lurie and/or roseman were to determine that quarterbacks who can throw and run, such as hurts and murray, are the wave of the future, then it's quite possible that he would want an innovative young coach to develop hurts.\n\nif it's not riley, then it could be chiefs current offensive coordinator under reid in eric bienemy. after all, they have helped patrick mahomes become the top quarterback in the nfl.\n\nbut there will be changes, whether it's in players, pederson's coaching staff, pederson himself, or the front-office structure.\n\neven the players know this.\n\ni would love for everybody to be here, but this is the way this business is, sanders said. we're going to have a whole different team next year and that's how it is every year.\n\nhonestly, i wish everybody could stay ... i hope i'm still here.\n\nsanders' return is one of the few things that's practically guaranteed.\n\ncontact martin frank at

mark zuckerberg is doing away with new year's resolutions like learning mandarin and overcoming public speaking fears for something more long-term.\n\nthe facebook chief executive announced thursday in a blog post that he plans to focus on goals in 2020 and beyond.\n\nrather than having year-to-year challenges, i've tried to think about what i hope the world and my life will look in 2030 so i can make sure i'm focusing on those things, zuckerberg wrote.\n\nthis shift comes after a trying 2019 for the tech giant. in july, facebook was fined a record-breaking $5 billion by the federal trade commission for violating consumers' privacy.\n\nnow, the road ahead looks more like helping small businesses and philanthropic efforts for the next generation.\n\nby then, if things go well, my daughter max will be in high school, we'll have the technology to feel truly present with another person no matter where they are, and scientific research will have helped cure and prevent enough diseases to extend our average life expectancy by another 2.5 years, he said.\n\npolitical ads:facebook will still allow but give users options on what they see\n\nfacebook says:it's cracking down on deepfakes, manipulated media\n\nwhat you can do to stop its spread:facebook disinformation in the 2020 presidential election\n\nso what's on facebook's radar for the next decade? the tech executive's goals includes five focus areas:\n\ngenerational change\n\na new private social network\n\ndecentralization of opportunity\n\nthe next computing platform\n\nnew forms of governance\n\nbut the biggest question stemming from zuckerberg's top five is: how should we govern the large new digital communities that the internet has enabled?\n\nover the years, facebook has been in the hot seat for its many controversial policies and initiatives as tensions continue to rise around the push to break up big tech.\n\nplatforms like facebook have to make tradeoffs on social values we all hold dear – like between free expression and safety, or between privacy and law enforcement, or between creating open systems and locking down data and access, he said.\n\ni don't think private companies should be making so many important decisions that touch on fundamental democratic values.\n\nand with that, zuckerberg introduced his solution of the creation of an independent oversight board. the board's focus will be to handle appeals for content decisions.\n\nwhile, this is just one of many proposed solutions surrounding zuckerberg's 10-year plan, the road to 2030 looks quite ambitious. it could even include more accountability.\n\nthis decade, i hope to use my position to establish more community governance and more institutions like this, zuckerberg said. if this is successful, it could be a model for other online communities in the future.
john anderson\n\nfor green bay press-gazette\n\ni am looking for news on the (green bay) packers search for a (general manager) but instead am struck cold by the headline in this very paper — sears to close green bay store.\n\nthis cannot be. this is not right. this is … this is heartbreaking.\n\nsears has closed hundreds of stores across the country the past few years, i know this. it's not a new headline. however, until today (monday), i hadn't considered the possibility that corporate decision-makers would shutter this sears. my sears!\n\nthis isn't just some sears store to me any more than lambeau field is just some stadium or john wayne is just some cowboy or frank sinatra is just some singer.\n\nno. where most see just a department store, i see family history.\n\njan. 10:sears 'will consider all other options' if refinancing fails, ceo eddie lampert warns\n\njan. 4:is your local kmart or sears closing?\n\ni don't make it from infancy in iowa to the sportscenter anchor desk at espn without this sears. does not happen. my life is tethered to the brown brick building at the corner of military and mason. actually, it's sixth street, but we won't worry about the precise location until i learn to ride a bike and my mom needs to know exactly where i am at all times.\n\nmy mother is a 24-year-old widow with a 3-year-old daughter and a 6-month-old son. it's november 1965 when her husband, my father, is killed in a car crash on a gravel road in rural iowa.\n\ni will never know my kenny anderson. my sister can recall some. my mom has all the memories, and in 1965, there are some hard days.\n\nthe three of us live in a small house in mason city, iowa. a place made famous as river city by music man composer meredith wilson. there are good neighbors on either side of us. dear friends who help look out for us.\n\na few months pass and in february 1966, larry neville, the neighbor on the left as you face our front door, gets transferred to be head of the appliance department at a new sears store in green bay. larry was born in green bay and this is a chance for him and his wife, verna, to return home.\n\nthat summer, my mom takes us to green bay to visit the nevilles. there's something about it that feels right. something warm and inviting. i wonder if it would have felt that way in winter?\n\nby the end of the year, mom needs a change. iowa is home and all of her family is there, but so too is my father's memory. change can't erase all the sadness, but it can take away the everyday reminders. change is a chance to reset and move forward.\n\njan. 4:100+ kmart, sears stores to close this spring\n\ndec. 31:sears bought few national tv ads during the holiday season, data show\n\nso as 1967 dawns, she follows the nevilles' lead and we move.\n\nit is january. it is cold. but it still feels right.\n\nmy sister and i will grow up green bay: the packers, paper mills, kennedy elementary school, lombardi, southwest, fish on fridays.\n\nthe sears store has made it so.\n\nfrom there, my sears tale is mostly retail. everything a kid could possibly imagine needing — clothes, winter clothes, shoes, sporting goods, records. and everything he can't imagine needing — carpet, drapes, house paint, tires and tools.\n\nas i grow up, i wear out sears' indestructible toughskins jeans like they are brown paper bags. the holes i make in the knees are patched with swaths of denim transplanted from pairs of jeans i'd outgrown the year before. the denim cycle of life if you will.\n\nmy mother remarries. my father is gone but i have a dad, walter collins, the best man i've ever known. he loves us unconditionally. he also loves tools on the condition they are craftsman tools from sears.\n\ntools are birthday gifts and christmas gifts for dad and my stepbrothers.\n\nfor my sister, there are barry manilow albums (yes, i know the lyrics but only because she played them loudly and repeatedly) and andy gibb 45s.\n\ndec. 26:is 2018 the end of the road for sears or toys r us?\n\ndec. 20:here are the 26 retailers and apparel companies most at risk in 2018\n\nmom? if it has a bow on it, she'll love it.\n\nfor me — what wouldn't i like to have? but if i must pick just one thing, then it's the football shirt (these are the days before the nfl cashed in on merchandising) with an action photo that looks remarkably like john brockington on the front.\n\nthe building with the giant swan-like s on its side is our destination.\n\nmy friends and i have bikes and allowance money.\n\nwe've biked the route a thousand times, beginning from my house on biemeret street (as vexing to spell today at age 52 as it was when filling out forms in grade school).\n\naround the corner and down katers drive we go. hang a right on langlade. then a left through the parking lots of a restaurant and gas station/convenience store. be careful at the intersection of ninth and military. i can still hear my mom imploring me to this day, please, be careful when crossing at ninth and military!\n\nthe whole trip is a ride past buildings that remain today but places that are long gone: the village inn, western gas station, red owl, st. agnes bakery, the water tower, ponderosa, van boxtel ford.\n\nfinally, we arrive at sears. always the backside of the store. military and sixth. the merchandise pick-up entrance by the automotive garage bays. come to think of it, i'm not sure i've ever gone in the front door of the place. we shop, we look, we loiter, we even, sometimes, buy. childhood at its best.\n\neventually, we graduate to the city bus and trips to port plaza mall. then we graduate high school and college and i move to oklahoma, arizona and connecticut. i have a family of my own. and when our house needs a new washer and dryer, naturally, we go to sears.\n\nand i tell my kids for the umpteenth time about the sears in my hometown. they know the one. the one that brought nana and auntie les and dad to green bay.\n\nit's more than a store. it's my story.\n\njohn anderson is a journalist and an anchor of espn's sportscenter. this column first appeared in the green bay press-gazette.
orrin g. hatch\n\nright now, one of our own is suffering in a leaky prison cell in latin america, cut off from family, friends and many of the people he loves the most. joshua holt, a constituent of mine and an upstanding american citizen, was arrested by venezuelan authorities in june 2016 and jailed on false charges. his health is quickly failing, and he desperately needs our help.\n\njosh's story is the nightmare of any american traveling abroad.\n\nmore:iran unrest threatens tehran's tyrants. can protesters drive them out?\n\nmore:on immigration, trump is positioned to do what obama and bush couldn't\n\njosh first flew to venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, thamara caleno holt, a young venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage. in clear violation of the vienna convention, venezuelan authorities not only denied josh medical attention but also barred access to u.s. consular officials for the first several weeks of his incarceration.\n\nfor months, josh's case has languished in venezuelan courts. and while venezuelan authorities dither, josh continues to suffer in prison, alone and afraid in an alien country. with his case scheduled to move to trial in january, government authorities have offered no clarification as to how long the trial will take, or if u.s. officials will even be able to help josh in legal proceedings. the venezuelan government has also refused to guarantee that josh will receive much-needed medical attention, even as his health continues to deteriorate.\n\nthe tragedy is that josh is completely innocent of the crimes for which he stands accused. i know josh to be a good and honorable man with a pure heart. as a case in point, josh served for two years as a mormon missionary in washington prior to his marriage. it was in this setting that he learned spanish and developed a deep love for the hispanic people, culture and customs. that he would ever inflict harm on anyone, let alone the good people of venezuela, is unthinkable.\n\nfrom the time of josh's arrest last year, i have done everything in my power to secure his freedom. i have enlisted help from the highest levels of government, including from secretary of state rex tillerson, who has encouraged our diplomats on the ground to stand firm in their negotiations with venezuelan authorities. i even raised the issue of josh's captivity with president trump, who not long after, enacted heavy sanctions on venezuela and called on president nicolas maduro to set josh free.\n\nas a leader looking to do what is good and just, president maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of josh and thamy on humanitarian grounds. this action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. with this gesture of goodwill, the governments of venezuela and the united states could move forward together towards a better future.\n\nthe path to greater peace begins with simple steps, and i invite president maduro to take the first step. doing so would bring relief to the holt family and usher in a new era of u.s.-venezuela relations, initiating a conversation from which both nations could benefit.\n\nmore:the second 'persian spring' is upon us. here's how we can make it last.\n\npolicing the usa: a look at race, justice, media\n\nvenezuela and the united states have significant policy differences, to be sure. but working out our disagreements should not require the life of an innocent american and his wife, who is herself a native of venezuela. josh and thamy deserve to live as free citizens — not as bargaining chips in a game of global politics.\n\nas the senior member and former chairman of the senate judiciary committee, i recognize the importance of state sovereignty and of a fair judicial process. but i believe just as strongly in protecting human rights and upholding the principles of justice.\n\nthat's why president maduro should release josh and thamy holt. he must honor human life and recognize longstanding international conventions.\n\ni call on him to help us bring josh home.\n\norrin hatch is the senior senator from utah, and president pro tempore of the united states senate.
wendy r. sherman\n\nopinion columnist\n\nsecretary of state mike pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. he was forced to postpone his trip to kyiv, ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in iraq. as fraught as pompeo's visit to kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, iraq trumped kyiv after the new year's eve attack on the u.s. embassy in baghdad.\n\nit is president donald trump's failed policy toward iran that has brought us to this combustible moment.\n\niraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 u.s. invasion that upended the middle east and cost so much in u.s. lives and treasure. but iraq also created strange bedfellows. the u.s. troops worked alongside iraqi and iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the islamic state terrorism group. and even as washington was confronting iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in iraq, where tehran holds considerable sway.\n\nthat uneasy balance was destroyed when trump withdrew from the joint comprehensive plan of action, better known as the iran nuclear deal. like other critics of the agreement, trump believed it should have resolved all of america's issues with iran. trump believed we were giving tehran benefits without a requisite return. he thought a maximum pressure campaign would ultimately bring iran to its knees, or incite a popular uprising against its theocratic regime.\n\ntrump policies devastate us interests\n\nlike much of trump's national security and foreign policy, his iran approach is tactical and not strategic. the results have been devastating to u.s. interests. iran's most extreme hard-liners, the iranian revolutionary guards corps (irgc) and quds force, which never wanted the nuclear deal, have gained more power, arguing that the united states couldn't be trusted to honor any agreement.\n\niran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. indeed, the irgc has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under trump's sanctions. and iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.\n\nlearning to manage conflict:as iraq violence flares, how do we stop wars from happening in the 2020s?\n\nin iraq, iranian-backed militia, led by kataeb hezbollah, have worked to increase their power as the iraq central government has nearly collapsed under the weight of months of popular protests against government corruption. a rocket attack by the kataeb hezbollah militia last friday killed an american contractor and injured many. the trump administration retaliated with airstrikes two days later, leading to the new year's eve attack on our embassy.\n\nmost would agree that the united states had to respond in some way to the death of an american, but whether the airstrike was the right and proportionate measure is debatable.\n\nregardless, if the trump administration really understood the dynamics of iraq, it might have anticipated a move like the attack on the u.s. embassy. administration officials might have worked more closely with the iraq government to think through the best way forward. instead, in essence, trump walked into iran's trap.\n\nfor many americans, the baghdad militia chants of death to america echoed the takeover of the u.s. embassy in tehran in 1979, raising the specter of another hostage crisis.\n\niran nuclear deal was solid progress\n\nthe immediate emergency at our embassy in baghdad has subsided. kataeb hezbollah has withdrawn its militia from outside the compound, declaring that they have delivered the necessary message to america. they want the 5,000 u.s. troops out of iraq.\n\nnonetheless, perhaps even pompeo understands that a longer-term challenge remains, and thus his change of travel plans.\n\ntrump has repeatedly said he wants to withdraw american troops from just about everywhere. but a withdrawal from iraq at this moment only serves iran's desire to exert greater control over iraq. to much of the world, it would signal u.s. disengagement and weakness — not strength.\n\neven some of the harshest critics of the iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. the iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. such a capability would project even greater iranian power in the middle east and deter the ability of washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.\n\ndiplomatic amateur hour:sondland's impeachment testimony proves trump foreign policy is run by corrupt clowns\n\nconcerted action to curtail iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. had trump stayed in the iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the u.s. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.\n\nthree years into his presidency, donald trump owns the events and outcomes in iraq and iran, as he does in north korea, afghanistan, venezuela, the middle east, russia, china and hong kong. having diminished our state department, intelligence agencies and military, the very institutions that could have helped him construct an effective national security and foreign policy, he is now on his own.\n\nthe president may like it that way, but a change in his secretary of state's travel plans won't be enough to save the day, let alone the decade.\n\nwendy r. sherman, a professor and the director of the center for public leadership at harvard kennedy school, was undersecretary of state for political affairs from 2011-15 and led u.s. negotiations on the iran nuclear deal. she is a member of usa today's board of contributors and the author of not for the faint of heart: lessons in courage, power and persistence. follow her on twitter: @wendyrsherman
washington – marking a dramatic conclusion to a bitter election, vice president mike pence is set to preside wednesday over a special joint session of congress that will cement president-elect joe biden's election win – and a loss for president donald trump and himself.\n\nthe scene sets the stage for perhaps the most contentious electoral vote count in 144 years after trump worked two months to overturn biden's nov. 3 election victory.\n\nthe usually perfunctory joint sessions have had past moments of tension. vice president al gore oversaw his presidential election loss against george w. bush after a fiercely fought recount battle in florida decided by the supreme court.\n\naudiotape:trump is heard on recording pressuring georgia secretary of state to 'find' votes\n\nas trump encourages protests wednesday in washington – and republicans in congress oppose certification – this year's session could be the most divisive since the election of 1876.\n\nfurther heightening the tensions is an audiotape obtained by the washington post in which trump pressures georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger to find enough votes to reverse his loss to biden in georgia.\n\nat wednesday's joint session of congress, pence, serving in his capacity as president of the senate, will be tasked with opening the electoral certificates from each state alphabetically to count the votes. at the session's conclusion, pence, like gore 20 years ago, is supposed to announce the winner.\n\nbiden defeated trump 306-232 in the electoral college vote dec. 14,but procedural fireworks are expected throughout. a faction of house republicans, led by mo brooks, r-ala., intends to object to electoral votes from some states. sen. josh hawley, r-mo., sen. ted cruz, r-texas, and 10 other senators said they will sign on to the objections.\n\nmore:a dozen republican senators plan to object to certification of biden's election win over trump\n\nthe effort lacks the votes in the democratic-controlled house and the republican-led senate. although it wouldn't be the first time a president-elect's electoral votes were contested by members of the opposing party – it happened in 2001, 2005 and 2017, each led by democrats – none of these instances had the level of republican resistance expected wednesday.\n\nhere are some of the past dramatic and controversial moments in congress' counting of electoral college votes:\n\n1877: hayes-tilden dispute comes close to constitutional crisis\n\nthe election of 1876, won by republican rutherford b. hayes over democrat samuel tilden, remains the most fiercely contested in u.s. history – even after the 2000 election and last november's election.\n\n'it really is over now': the 24 hours that probably thwarted trump's effort to overturn the election\n\nthe two parties in florida, south carolina, louisiana and oregon both claimed victories and submitted electoral votes from rival slates of electors, presenting a constitutional crisis before congress.\n\na fight also ensued over the electoral votes of vermont, won by hayes but contested by tilden.\n\ncongress established a bipartisan electoral commission to reach a solution. through the compromise of 1877, hayes emerged the winner after he appeased southern democrats by agreeing to pull federal troops out of the south and ushering in the end of reconstruction.\n\n'the moment of truth': the electoral college prepares to hand trump the loss he refuses to accept\n\nhayes won vermont, florida, south carolina and louisiana, leading him to a 185-184 electoral win, the narrowest in u.s. history.\n\nwe came within two days of having simultaneous inauguration ceremonies, which would have been intolerable because you can't have two presidents, said ned foley, director of the election law program at ohio state university's moritz college of law. it was a very dicey situation.\n\n1961: nixon declares rival kennedy the winner\n\nvice president richard nixon, who lost to democrat john f. kennedy in the presidential election months before, presided over the joint session of congress on jan. 6, 1961, that declared his rival kennedy the winner.\n\nkennedy won the popular vote by a narrow 113,000 votes and the electoral college by a wider 303-219. the republican party challenged results in 11 states.\n\nthe only state that had an outcome change was hawaii – from nixon to kennedy. the state initially certified nixon as the winner, but a post-election recount found kennedy won hawaii by 115 votes.\n\nit meant votes from rival slates of hawaii electors – one for kennedy, the other for nixon – were presented to congress. nixon, as president of the senate, counted hawaii's three electoral votes for kennedy and recognized the massachusetts democrat as the new president.\n\nspeaking from the house chair, nixon noted it was the first time in 100 years that a candidate for president was forced to announce the result of an election that he lost. he said he could not think of a more striking and eloquent example of the stability of our constitutional system.\n\nin our campaigns, no matter how hard fought they may be, no matter how close the election may turn out to be, those who lose accept the verdict and support those who win, nixon said. it is in that spirit that i now declare that john f. kennedy has been elected president of the united states, and lyndon b. johnson vice president of the united states.\n\n1969: vp humphrey misses vote for nixon\n\nlike nixon and gore, vice president hubert humphrey was in line to preside over the certification of his own loss in 1969. nixon defeated humphrey in the election in 1968.\n\nbut humphrey, the democratic vice president of lyndon b. johnson, did not attend the joint congressional session. it's the most recent time in u.s. history that the senate speaker pro tempore, sen. richard russell, d-ga., had to fill in for the vice president as congress counted electoral votes.\n\n'democracy prevailed': joe biden passes 270-vote threshold to win electoral college\n\nhumphrey was in oslo, norway, attending the funeral of trygve lie, the first elected secretary-general of the united nations.\n\nif pence were to miss the joint session, sen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, the speaker pro tempore, would lead the meeting.\n\nthe session on jan. 6, 1969, had another distinction: rep. james o'hara, d-mich., filed the first formal objection to the electoral college count in u.s. history when he opposed one of north carolina's 13 electoral votes that went to segregationist george wallace. sen. edmund muskie, d-maine, humphrey's running-mate, signed on.\n\nthe vote for wallace came from a faithless north carolina elector who was pledged to vote for nixon. o'hara's effort failed in the senate and house, and the single electoral vote went to wallace.\n\n2001: gore declares bush the winner and gavels down objections\n\nas democrats decried that a conservative supreme court robbed their candidate of a win in florida, gore presided over the certification of his loss against bush in 2001.\n\nit came less than one month after gore, who won the popular vote over bush by 540,000 votes, lost when the supreme court stopped recount efforts in florida. bush won the state by 537 votes.\n\nmembers of the congressional house black caucus spent 20 minutes objecting as they sought to block florida's 25 electoral votes. each time, gore slammed his gavel to quiet his house allies.\n\nany objections to votes submitted by a state's electoral slates require support from one house member and one senator to be considered. no senator signed on to their effort.\n\nthe whole number of electors appointed to vote for president of the united states is 538, of which a majority is 270, gore said as he declared his opponent the winner. george w. bush, of the state of texas, has received for president of the united states 271 votes. al gore, of the state of tennessee, has received 266 votes.\n\nhe added, may god bless our new president and our new vice president, and may god bless the united states of america.\n\n2005: sen. boxer signs on to house objection\n\nin the joint meeting of congress to certify bush's win over democrat john kerry, rep. stephanie tubbs jones, d-ohio, received a senate signature to object to the electoral votes from ohio.\n\nit came from sen. barbara boxer, d-calif. the two democrats raised concerns about voting irregularities. kerry said he did not support the effort.\n\nif a senator signs onto a house objection of the electoral votes, the two chambers will meet for no more than two hours before voting on the objections. the same would happen wednesday if hawley, cruz and other republican senators object to biden's victory in a state.\n\ni hate inconveniencing my friends, but i believe it is worth a couple of hours to shine some light on these issues, boxer said at the joint sessions led by vice president dick cheney.\n\ntheir objection lost handily, receiving just one vote in the senate – boxer's – and 31 votes in the house, all from democrats.\n\n2017: biden to democrats: 'it is over'\n\nfour years ago, on jan. 6, 2017, the roles were somewhat reversed from this week's dynamics: biden presided over trump's win over democrat hillary clinton.\n\nhalf a dozen democratic house members raised formal objections to the electoral college vote count, but they lacked the backing of any senators. biden repeatedly slammed the gavel on debate, saying the objections could not be entertained.\n\nthe objections were based on russian election interference, allegations of voter suppression or what democrats considered to be illegal votes cast by republican members of the electoral college.\n\nrep. pramila jayapal, d-wash., said, mr. president, even as people waited hours in georgia...\n\nbiden stopped her: there is no debate. there is no debate. if there is not one signed by a senator, the objection cannot be entertained.\n\njayapal responded: mr. president, the objection is signed by a member of the house but not yet by a member of the senate.\n\nit is over, biden said as republicans applauded.\n\nreach joey garrison on twitter @joeygarrison.
ap\n\natlanta (ap) — the college football playoff is here to stay.\n\nthe national championship game is still trying to make its mark.\n\nthe 4-year-old title game remains a bit of an afterthought compared to the well-entrenched bowl system, from its lack of a catchy name to its scattered timing to its scaled-backed format.\n\nevery sport has its elements that fans might want to change or tweak or adjust, said burke magnus, espn's executive vice president from programming and scheduling. college football may have a few of those as well.\n\nthe four-team playoff began with the 2014 season, replacing a bcs system that matched the top two teams in a national championship game while leaving the bowls largely unchanged.\n\nnow, the six major bowls — rose, sugar, cotton, orange, peach and fiesta — rotate a pair of semifinal games that are generally played on new year's day, long the traditional end to the college football season.\n\nthe four major bowls that are not semifinals each year essentially divvy up the best of the non-playoff teams, also creating some attractive matchups. and, of course, the remaining bowls — a staggering 33 in all this season — are still around to provide a smorgasbord of postseason games/television programming from mid-december to the first day of the new year.\n\nby the time the national championship game rolls around — monday night's alabama-georgia matchup falls exactly a week after the semifinals, though the timing varies from year to year — it almost feels extraneous to the season.\n\nbill hancock, executive director of the college football playoff, doesn't view it that way.\n\nwe see it as a three-game package, he said. the championship game becomes the iconic event. it is the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.\n\nthis season's semifinal games were highlighted by a thrilling rose bowl , in which georgia rallied to beat oklahoma 54-48 in a double overtime. the television ratings were huge, an average of 27 million viewers across espn and espn2 — a 39 percent increase over last year's early semifinal.\n\nthe ratings dipped for the nightcap, alabama's methodical 24-6 victory clemson in a rematch of the last two national championship games, but the 21.1 million viewers were still a 10 percent increase over the previous year's second semifinal.\n\nthe national championship game will surely surpass the sugar bowl ratings, but it may have a hard time matching those rose bowl numbers — especially given the all-southeastern conference title game.\n\nlast year's national championship game drew about 26.7 million viewers.\n\nthe semifinals are obviously important, sec commissioner greg sankey said. this year, you had two traditional games on new year's day that i think magnified it.\n\nbut, he quickly added, i don't look at this game as taking a back seat to anything.\n\nthe tv ratings highlight some of the challenges facing the championship game.\n\nnew year's day remains the capper to the season for many college football fans. most of them have the day off from work and it's simply ingrained in the culture to cap off the holiday season by plopping in front of the television to take in games that stretch from morning to midnight. the rose bowl, which traditionally kicks off late afternoon eastern time, is almost guaranteed huge ratings.\n\nthe rose bowl has the best television window in sports, magnus said. ever. period. not college football. sports.\n\nthe national championship game is a prime-time affair, which provides a ratings boost, but there are plenty of other viewing options on a monday night. and since many people have to work the next morning, the lack of a competitive game can be a real drain on the numbers.\n\nthe format of the national championship game also gives off a vibe that this game isn't as important as the bowls, which are played while schools are on their holiday breaks. teams often spend up to a week at the bowl sites, meeting incessantly with the media and taking part in a wide range of promotional and charity events.\n\nbut, with classes resuming at the start of the new year, the national championship game is merely a long weekend . the teams arrive on friday, hold one big session with the media on saturday, get in their last practice, and then turn their attention to the game.\n\norganizers have attempted to spice things up for the fans.\n\nin atlanta, a series of concerts was held throughout the weekend at centennial olympic park, though frigid weather put a damper on things. borrowing a page from the super bowl, breakout star kendrick lamar is set to perform as part of the title game's first-ever halftime performance.\n\nstill, the college football playoff is up against some of the same issues as the final four in men's basketball.\n\nfor hoops fans, there's nothing like the saturday semifinals, with back-to-back games a mere half-hour apart, matching the four best teams in the land. the national championship game, played two nights later in the same venue, often comes across as a letdown.\n\nthat's even more of an issue for college football. over its first four years, the championship game has been held anywhere from week to 11 days after the semifinals, a gap will continue to vary from year to year depending on how the calendar shakes out. organizers are still tinkering with the format.\n\nin 2019, for instance, the peach and fiesta semifinal games are set to be played on saturday, dec. 28. the championship game will be held on jan. 13 — a whopping 15 days later.\n\nhancock believes time will settle many of the issues facing the championship game.\n\nthis'll be the 80th year of the final four. it's the fourth cfp, he said. i'm really proud of the position where we

a new episode of mlb network presents focuses on mets manager terry collins, who reached the world series for the first time in his four-decade professional baseball career in 2015. the program covers collins' career as a minor-league utility player — during which he once rode the bench for 52 straight games — and his prior stints as a big-league manager in both houston and anaheim.\n\nbut the last segment dives into the 2015 world series, and specifically collins' decision to leave matt harvey in to pitch the ninth inning of the deciding game 5. collins intended to take harvey out for closer jeurys familia, but harvey argued his way back to the mound only to allow a walk and a double to the first two batters he faced. the royals tied the game that inning and went on to win the series with a 7-2 victory in 12 innings.\n\ncollins talked about his decision in the show, saying that he still believes it was the wrong one but he has moved on:\n\ni saw the passion in his eyes — 'i want this game.' that's why i think he's great, and i think that's what's going to make him great: he wants to compete. and he wants to compete on the biggest stage, and in the biggest moment. so i gave him that chance…. i don't know what would have happened after that, but in my mind, we should have made the change. i had my bad three days. i let it bother me for three days and then i said, 'look, you've got to move on. you're going to kill yourself over this, and it's too late. it's over.'\n\nmlb network presents: terry collins, a life in baseball debuts tuesday night at 9 p.m. et.
trying to get out of the garden state? you may not be alone.\n\naccording to an annual study from united van lines, new jersey was the top state people were moving out of in 2018, while vermont topped the list as the top state people moved to.\n\nthe company, which has tracked interstate moves for the study since 1977, used data from the more than 200,000 household moves it completed in 2018 within the 48 contiguous states and washington, d.c.\n\nthe data showed that roughly two-thirds of new jersey moves were outbound in 2018. new jersey has been in the top 10 for outbound moves for the past 10 years, united van lines said.\n\nillinois (65.9%), connecticut (62%), new york (61.5%) and kansas (58.7%) rounded out the top five list for states people were leaving.\n\non the other hand, over 7 in 10 moves in vermont were inbound in 2018. among the other states that people moved to: oregon (63.8%), idaho (62.4%), nevada (61.8%) and arizona (60.2%).\n\naccording to united van lines, the data overall shows a growing number of moves to western and southern regions, while northeastern states saw a growing number of moves away.\n\nthe data collected by united van lines aligns with longer-term migration patterns to southern and western states, trends driven by factors like job growth, lower costs of living, state budgetary challenges and more temperate climates, michael stoll, a public policy professor and economist at ucla, said in a statement.\n\ncareer changes accounted for about half of all moves across the country, according to a survey from united van lines. retirement, lifestyle change and family were also among top reasons for moving in some regions.\n\nidaho welcomed the highest percentage of movers seeking a new lifestyle at roughly 25 percent, while new mexico led the way for retirees with 42 percent of movers wrapping up their careers.\n\nunlike a few decades ago, retirees are leaving california, instead choosing other states in the pacific west and mountain west, stoll added.\n\nfollow ryan miller on twitter @ryanw_miller\n\nmore:2018 year in review: 50 stories from 50 states that moved us\n\nmore:beto o'rourke, freekah and other words you've been saying wrong all year\n\nmore:blood pressure drug recalls, mollie tibbetts, toys r us and roseanne: our most-read stories of 2018
maria puente\n\nusa today\n\na prankster climbed up a mountain in los angeles overnight to welcome the new year sunday by altering the world-famous hollywood sign to read hollyweed, police say.\n\nlos angelenos recovering from new year's eve celebrations might have been blurry-eyed as the sun came up on mount lee but they couldn't have missed noticing there was something wrong with the familiar 350-feet-long sign.\n\naccording to sgt. guy juneau, the watch commander for the los angeles police department's security services division (which handles security for public buildings and facilities), a lone gentleman made his way up the mountain, scaled a protective fence, clambered over the sign and placed two tarps covering the two os.\n\nit now reads 'weed,' juneau told usa today. he escaped but (the stunt) was captured on security video footage.\n\nbut by 10:45 a.m. p.t., the tarps had been removed and all was right once again on the hollywood sign, according to cbs los angeles' live coverage.\n\npolice are investigating and if the man is arrested, he will be prosecuted for misdemeanor trespassing, juneau said.\n\nbut it isn't the first time the sign with its 45-foot-tall letters has been vandalized; juneau says there's an incident at least once a year.\n\nit's thrill-seekers, looking for media attention, he said. it's l.a., part of our l.a.-crazy, he added, chuckling. but seriously, he said, we can't have the sign saying that.\n\npolice had to press to restore the sign quickly; finding work crews on a holiday proved difficult, he said.\n\nthe prankster may have had a political motive: celebrating california voters' approval in november of proposition 64, which legalized the recreational use of marijuana, beginning in 2018.\n\nbesides hosting the sign, the mountain also is host to the communications towers used by police and fire departments, he said, which is why the police have an officer assigned to keep watch up there.\n\nand by the way, he said, it's very dangerous to climb up this mountain, located in the hollywood hills section of the santa monica mountains. the sign was put up in 1923 as an advertisement for a local real-estate development.\n\nhe took a risk, juneau said of the tarp-wielding climber. he could have been killed.\n\nif the police were unamused (or trying to be), los angelenos on twitter were laughing in their new year lattes.\n\nas someone named caesar tweeted, it might be a sign of a coming good year.\n\nsomebody changed the hollywood sign to hollyweed and if that doesn't mean that 2017 will be a good year then idk what does, he posted.
frisco, texas — the cowboys, after a week of uncertainty, announced sunday evening that jason garrett's contract will not be extended.\n\nno, the official statement from jerry jones did not say the cowboys were firing—or even terminating—their head coach of the last decade.\n\nbut for the first time in more than 12 years, garrett is no longer an employee of the dallas cowboys.\n\nthe cowboys said the team would not seek a new agreement on a contract extension with garrett. jones included a statement thanking garrett for more than 20 years with the cowboys as a player, assistant coach and then head coach.\n\njason garrett's legacy with the dallas cowboys will always be that of someone who strived for greatness every day that he walked through the door, and as someone who instilled the virtues of enthusiasm, hard work and appreciation for the profession in all of the men who played with him and for him, jones said in the statement. he is, and always will remain, a cherished member of the dallas cowboys family.\n\ngarrett texted his assistant coaches shortly after the team released a statement, a person familiar with the situation told usa today sports on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to publicly comment on garrett's message. the head coach thanked his assistants for their time, reiterating his pride in what they accomplished during the cowboys' 8-8 2019 season and prior campaigns.\n\nassistants were not formally notified about garrett's future before jones' statement to reporters, the person said. even coaches whose contracts expired earlier last week continued to report to the star on friday after their contracts ended. not until saturday were they told by text message they no longer needed to come in. this was all part of a curious timeline that led to the team interviewing ex-nfl coaches marvin lewis and mike mccarthy, per multiple reports, before officially announcing garrett's exit sunday during the third quarter of the wild-card game between the eagles and seahawks.\n\nbut jones had long hinted at a departure. the cowboys chose not to extend garrett before 2019 as he coached the final season of his five-year deal.\n\nopinion:here's where the cowboys should look for their next head coach\n\nduring the season, too, jones consistently suggested garrett's future with the cowboys wasn't a given. he praised coaches who beat the cowboys in the aftermath of losses. he declared that dallas got outcoached following a 13-9 november loss in new england. he told usa today's jarrett bell in december that generally, my radar is turned on to other coaching candidates. jones praised coaches like urban meyer and baylor's matt rhule, also giving the not-so-convincing vote of confidence that garrett will be coaching in the nfl next year.\n\nthe cowboys part ways with their nine-year coach after he completed his fourth 8-8 season with the club. the cowboys crushed the redskins 47-16 to end the season, but dallas still finished outside the playoff picture. garrett had been the longest-tenured head coach in the nfl who had not won a super bowl and second-longest-tenured coach in franchise history.\n\ngarrett's cowboys went 85-67 from when he became the interim coach in november 2010 and then assumed the mantle in 2011. dallas won its division in three of the last six seasons but never advanced past the divisional round. since the cowboys' three super bowls in the 1990s, the team hasn't even advanced to a conference championship in 24 years.\n\nthat measuring stick was important to both jerry jones and vice president stephen jones, the two said at training camp in july, as garrett entered the final season of his five-year contract without an extension. the joneses stated their roster was more talented than the 2018 club that went 10-6, then beat the seahawks in the wild-card round. they wanted postseason production to reflect that belief.\n\nthe cowboys started the season hot with the first 3-0 open of garrett's career. but games against the struggling giants, redskins and dolphins weren't indicative of how the cowboys would perform against playoff contenders. dallas beat just two teams with a winning record and never again won in consecutive weeks after the 3-0 start. they raced to the league's best offense,averaging 431.5 yards per game. but four times they dropped matches by 4 points or fewer.\n\nyou want to be able to handle yourself well at those critical moments and we've done a good job in that in the past, garrett said. sometimes this year we have not done a good enough job.\n\nnfl newsletter:sign up now to get football news delivered to your inbox\n\neven so, jones longed for garrett to shepherd what the front office considered a talented roster over the hump. garrett has been a long-term, very important, pleasant part of my life, jones said in a more than 29-minute session with reporters on dec. 29. if he's coaching 10 more years for the cowboys or if he's not, he's done that. we've had that kind of life together.\n\nin a weak nfc east, jones maintained hope for a fairy-tale turnaround. the cowboys starters stayed mostly healthy through the season. quarterback dak prescott posted career bests with 4,902 yards and 30 touchdowns, and the offensive line allowing the fewest percentage of sacks on dropbacks of any team this season.\n\ndallas failed to translate that good fortune to wins.\n\nit cost garrett his job.\n\nplayers said they couldn't focus too much on criticism of garrett.\n\nhe's not the only one getting criticized, defensive end demarcus lawrence said after the cowboys lost control of the nfc east in december. we're all getting criticized.\n\nadded prescott of garrett's expiring contract: i think it's the last game on my [contract] as well so i'll be damned if i speak on anybody else's future or their place.\n\neven garrett declined to entertain speculation, maintaining that he did not think about his future much and would not yet. the coach who always told his cowboys players to focus on the moment — to have a good wednesday, to ready for one good series, to think only about the immediate next opponent — said he thought not a whole lot about his future. absolutely he wanted to continue coaching in the nfl and, if possible, with the cowboys.\n\nbut i have no idea, he said, if he would get that opportunity.\n\nhe knows now.\n\nfollow usa today sports' jori epstein on twitter @joriepstein.\n\nif you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you. join our facebook

david swanson\n\nreviewed.com\n\nintroduced in 2012, dolby atmos introduced moviegoers to immersive, three-dimensional audio. many consumers may be aware of the name, but aren't quite sure how it works, what the requirements are, or how to bring it into their home theater systems. samsung came to ces this year on a mission to change that.\n\nwith dolby atmos, during the mixing for a film or video game, engineers record and isolate each individual sound — from birds chirping to tires squealing — and convert them into an object. each sound object is then assigned a particular location within the theater from which to emanate, using one or more speakers to establish the location.\n\nhands-on with samsung's wireless dolby atmos soundbar\n\nwhat this means is that sounds are no longer two-dimensional, coming from one plane—left, right, or behind the viewer—but instead seem to come from all over the room. as many as 128 discrete audio tracks are isolated for theaters, requiring up to 64 speakers—a dealbreaker for even the most hardcore home audio enthusiasts. to bring dolby atmos home, the industry came up with upward-firing speakers, which allow audio to bounce off the ceiling. this helps blanket the room with sound, replicating much of the movie theater experience.\n\nalthough various manufacturers have licensed the dolby atmos name for home speaker systems over the past year, at ces samsung electronics introduced a first-ever wireless soundbar package utilizing dolby atmos technology: the hw-k950. we took a look, and bent an ear.\n\nto be clear, this is not just another soundbar.\n\nbuilding on samsung's wireless audio 360 series, the hw-k950 is both samsung's first soundbar to feature dolby atmos and the industry's first soundbar package to include a pair of atmos-capable wireless rear speakers in the box. combined, the set-up delivers powerful 5.4.1-channel sound that envelops viewers from all sides.\n\ncoming in at 47 inches wide, the soundbar is 3.25 inches in height (not 2.1 inches tall, as reported elsewhere), making it well-suited to tvs 55 inches or larger. three of the hw-k950's five speakers fire out, toward the viewers, and two project upwards.\n\nthe subwoofer is wireless (though it plugs in for power), and measures 17.75 inches in height. two rear speakers measure a modest 7.75 inches high and each has two forward and two upwards-firing speakers. at ces, samsung had a looped demo playing for the crowd in a small room near its main booth, but due to crowd noise and tight quarters it wasn't a real, fair test of the system's audio capabilities.\n\nthe key innovation here is the wireless design, which means you don't have to worry about hiding messy speaker wire. this also opens up new speaker placement options, which is important since speaker positioning is a vital component of optimal dolby atmos playback.\n\nthe soundbar package is only available in black for now, but samsung says it's continuing to expand the array of colors and styles for additional speakers, and the company promises an improved app for phones, tablets, and gear s and s2 smartwatches, for multi-room speaker placements.\n\none potential drawback is that the system is not compatible with the competing audio technology, dts:x. but initial releases for home video appear to be encoded with both formats, so this may not be an issue—especially assuming the dolby format is supported long-term.\n\nthe three-dimensional effect of dolby atmos produces a more realistic audio environment that attentive moviegoers can't help but notice. while existing movie theaters have been slow to invest in the technology in the u.s., filmmakers are eager to utilize dolby atmos. dolby says several dozen movies and tv series have been released for home consumption in the format — a number sure to multiply in the months to come. video games, like star wars: battlefront, have also begun to capitalize on the increased spatial freedom.\n\nconsumers have also been hesitant to upgrade to dolby atmos at home. the technology requires not just receiver upgrades, but new speakers as well. samsung's complete hw-k950 package delivers 5.1.4-channel sound and wireless satellites, and additional wireless speakers are available in patterns and colors that make them easier to integrate into home environments. in short, the hw-k950 appears to offer a practical and seamless solution for most living rooms. it's an attractive option for audio enthusiasts who have ruled out ceiling-fitted speakers at home.\n\nkeep in mind you'll still need to pony up for a dolby atmos compatible receiver, and pricing and a ship date for the hw-k950 have not yet been announced. while we're guessing it won't be cheap, at least the good news is you won't have to invest in a new blu-ray player at the same time.\n\nfor more in-depth ces coverage, head to reviewed.com.
few events in american history transformed our nation as momentously as the ratification of women's right to vote 100 years ago. as we approach the centennial in august, the usa today network is launching an ambitious commemoration of this major step toward the universal right to vote.\n\nwe'll provide much more than a history lesson. our project – women of the century – will inspire women, girls and their allies to work toward a better america.\n\nwe know that ratification of the 19th amendment a century ago resonates today, its echoes evident in efforts to advance women's rights in our laws, workplaces and societal expectations. the past and present are connected in an ongoing effort to secure women's futures.\n\nstarting in february, through the combined power of 260 newsrooms across the usa, we will explore this constitutional change, what it has accomplished and what's left to be done.\n\nwe'll do it through interviews with trailblazing american women from across all 50 states and the district of columbia, live events designed to empower and enfranchise, stories that cover the movement's victories and shortcomings, augmented reality experiences that bring alive the suffragists in their struggles and triumphs and much more.\n\nwe believe it's vital that you are a part of this ambitious project.\n\nin january, we ask our readers and viewers to nominate women from their towns, cities and states who have made a difference on a state or national level in areas such as arts & literature, business, civil rights, education, entertainment, law, media, nonprofits & philanthropy, politics, science & medicine and sports. we'll use your input and the help of historians, scholars and other experts to highlight more than 500 women who have inspired us over the past 100 years.\n\nyou can get started nominating women at usatoday.com/womenofthecentury/.\n\nwe won't focus solely on women in the public sphere. we are excited to announce that in connection with women of the century, the usa today network is launching womankind, an extension of our humankind franchise, to celebrate unsung women who make the world a better place through their good work and example.\n\nwe invite you to nominate women – or even yourself – on this form.\n\nwe're excited to serve as a gathering place for you to discover and remember the women who changed american history and to support and honor the women of today who keep the fight alive.
usa today\n\nyou're reading the opposing view, one of two perspectives in today's debate. for our view, read the choice between democracy and trump is easy.\n\nsen. ted cruz, r-texas, declined to provide an opposing view. excerpts from the statement sent by cruz and 10 other republican senators:\n\non january 6, it is incumbent on congress to vote on whether to certify the 2020 election results. that vote is the lone constitutional power remaining to consider and force resolution of the multiple allegations of serious voter fraud.\n\nat that quadrennial joint session, there is long precedent of democratic members of congress raising objections to presidential election results, as they did in 1969, 2001, 2005, and 2017. and, in both 1969 and 2005, a democratic senator joined with a democratic house member in forcing votes in both houses on whether to accept the presidential electors being challenged.\n\nthe most direct precedent on this question arose in 1877, following serious allegations of fraud and illegal conduct in the hayes-tilden presidential race. specifically, the elections in three states — florida, louisiana, and south carolina — were alleged to have been conducted illegally.\n\nin 1877, congress did not ignore those allegations, nor did the media simply dismiss those raising them as radicals trying to undermine democracy. instead, congress appointed an electoral commission — consisting of five senators, five house members, and five supreme court justices — to consider and resolve the disputed returns.\n\nwe should follow that precedent. to wit, congress should immediately appoint an electoral commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. once completed, individual states would evaluate the commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.\n\naccordingly, we intend to vote on january 6 to reject the electors from disputed states as not regularly given and lawfully certified (the statutory requisite), unless and until that emergency 10-day audit is completed.\n\nwe are not naive. we fully expect most if not all democrats, and perhaps more than a few republicans, to vote otherwise. but support of election integrity should not be a partisan issue. a fair and credible audit — conducted expeditiously and completed well before january 20 — would dramatically improve americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next president. we owe that to the people.
ap\n\nashburn, va. (ap) — will compton figured the washington redskins' defense wouldn't be a quick fix, and he was right.\n\nthe middle linebacker hoped for the best, but the unit ranked 28th in the nfl for the second straight year as its struggles contributed to what coach jay gruden called a barely above average 8-7-1 season. slow starts and inconsistent offense hurt washington down the stretch, but retooling the defense — again — is a top priority.\n\ncornerbacks josh norman and bashaud breeland and linebacker ryan kerrigan will be back, but the redskins could have a cast around them and possibly even a new coordinator if joe barry takes the fall for breakdowns and blunders that cost them a playoff berth.\n\nwe didn't do a great job of executing in certain areas of our defense, but we've just got to find a way to get better, whether it's coaching or new players, said defensive end chris baker, one of more than a dozen pending free agents. you can always get more talent, get more depth at each position.\n\nmore than just struggling against the run and pass, washington was worst in the league in third-down defense and among the worst teams in the red zone. whether that's scheme or personnel is a matter of debate but most likely a combination of the two.\n\nthe reason he's taking heat is because the people that don't execute his play, defensive end ricky jean francois said. it's going to make it seem like 'well he doesn't know what he's doing, he's not adjusting, he's not doing this.' sometimes he may not have done that, but the majority of times when he did do it, did we follow him? and when we didn't, now he's in the hot seat. now his job is on the line. so i really don't blame it fully on him.\n\ngruden said every player and coach would be evaluated and that barry's status would ultimately be his call. compton said he felt barry put players in the right position to succeed a majority of the time.\n\non the personnel side, the redskins could use a defensive lineman and a linebacker or two and have to figure out their safety situation. hybrid su'a cravens could be a boon to the defense as a strong safety in his second nfl season.\n\nsome other things the redskins need to resolve:\n\ncousins' contract status: the soap opera drama over quarterback kirk cousins' contract has been renewed for an encore after he played this season on the $19.95 million franchise tag. because of the uncertainty on each side about a long-term fit, the redskins' most likely course of action is tagging cousins again at a cost of $23.94 million and evaluating again.\n\nin his weekly radio appearance, cousins was noncommittal when asked about his desire to stay and didn't know if the team wanted to commit to him for the long haul.\n\nwe haven't been able to talk since july 15, so i don't know if they've bought the engagement ring, if you will, cousins said.\n\nwhat ya got, rook: a lost year for rookie receiver josh doctson because of achilles tendinitis means he could get thrown into a big role in his second season, despite just two catches in two games. the redskins could lose desean jackson and pierre garcon in free agency and don't know what they have in doctson, a first-round pick out of tcu.\n\nthat unknown could force general manager scot mccloughan to pay a premium to retain garcon or jackson.\n\njones' fumbled opportunity: matt jones was given the no. 1 running back job and fumbled it away, becoming inactive for the final nine games of the season as undrafted rookie robert kelley took over. one season isn't evidence that kelley can be a top-flight starter, but the redskins have to decide whether to keep the very affordable jones around to compete or cut ties.\n\nmatt, with what people call his issues with fumbles and everything, he'll get that fixed, said third-down back chris thompson, who showed his value as a change-of-pace runner, pass blocker and receiver. fumbles are going to happen a time or two. but it's all about how you respond to it.\n\nback to the vets: pending free agent tight end vernon davis would like to be back with him hometown team for another season, and fellow 33-year-old deangelo hall is willing to restructure his contract after tearing the acl in his right knee in week 3. center kory lichtensteiger is probably as good as gone, and defensive tackle kedric golston's return is a major question mark as he'll be 34 and anthony lanier and matt ioannidis could step up as second-year players.\n\nhall knows being back isn't a sure thing.\n\nif they come to the conclusion that, 'hey we don't want you or 'you're too injury-prone,' then it is what it is, he said. i'll sit back and try to figure out, hey, do i want to go somewhere else and play because i do feel like i can still play, i can still be great.\n\n___\n\nap pro football writer howard fendrich contributed.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/ap_nfl

(current nba rules require draftees to wait a year after high school graduation, but that could change as early as 2022.) for now, he and about a dozen other teenagers, seven of them division i prospects, comprise a roster that has played in michigan, texas and ohio against some of the top-ranked players in the country.\n\nno. 1-ranked senior chet holmgren and several of his minnesota high school state champion teammates beat ypsi in ann arbor on nov. 12 in the academy's first game. then duncanville (texas), which has one of the nation's best sophomores, ronald holland, topped ypsi on nov. 28 in texas. ypsi has since beaten ohio's isa and texas' legacy school of sport sciences, each of which feature multiple division i prospects.\n\nbronny james, son of lebron james, and amari bailey, a top-five junior guard, are next for ypsi on jan. 9. the game in fort worth, texas, against james' california basketball club will be televised on fs1.\n\njaden akins, the four-star prospect signed with michigan state for the class of 2021, started the season with ypsi prep but left in december. last week, akins announced he was joining another prep school, sunrise christian academy in kansas, to finish his senior year.\n\nthe formation of ypsi prep and its ability to play games elsewhere has prompted questions about how it started and how it works. elgin bates billed it as a way to give michigan's top talent the most elite competitions. here's what we know:\n\nis ypsi prep a school?\n\nno, and it doesn't market itself as one. elgin bates was not specific this summer about the organization, registered as an llc in july. he hasn't since publicly talked about the team, which had a game broadcast on espn2 and has its games streamed via a third-party subscription service.\n\nypsi prep is an academic-based basketball academy that provides its student-athletes an ncaa certified core curriculum while providing athletic and life skills training in preparation for college, bates said via email.\n\nbates, who played division ii basketball and professionally overseas, has trained his son and others on the team through the aau program bates fundamentals. the head coach for ypsi prep is corey tucker, who coached in ohio for more than 15 years, according to his linkedin resumé.\n\nwhen asked if ypsi receives taxpayer money, bates said it does not, and that team expenses are paid by a nonprofit foundation and local and regional sponsors.\n\nnike and gatorade, along with a host of small businesses, sponsor the team.\n\nypsi prep partners with a separate entity, arbor valley academy, to provide its education services and has no relationship with the michigan department of education. nor does ypsi have a relationship with the ncaa's eligibility center — the body that reviews each high school's or educational organization's courses for approval at the next level of athletics.\n\nwhat does mhsaa say about all this?\n\nnothing, really. ypsi prep plays outside of michigan high school athletics association sanctions.\n\nthat means ypsi prep is not subject to the travel restrictions of mhsaa member schools — but it also cannot compete for a state title. ypsi prep has yet to play a team from michigan, but has planned to play home games.\n\nemoni bates won an mhsaa title with his local public school, ypsilanti lincoln, as a freshman in 2019. among 10,000-plus schools with athletics, only a few dozen, mostly small parochial schools and homeschools, play outside of mhsaa rule.\n\nand none of them do it quite like ypsi prep.\n\nwill ypsi prep players qualify for division i competition?\n\nif they complete courses at an approved institution, yes, but ypsi alone doesn't provide that education. each player must meet ncaa's core standards and provide transcripts from an approved entity; public school, private school, charter school or otherwise.\n\nbut the ncaa isn't in the business of authorizing an educational institution, per se. it tries to verify the institution can provide the required courses that high school athletes need to qualify for initial eligibility under ncaa rules. then it can accept that student's transcripts.\n\nit's not an accreditation process, because the ncaa doesn't have authority over high schools, said tim nevius, an attorney who regularly spars with the organization on behalf of student-athletes. the ncaa is a college and university member association that sets rules that determine the eligibility of its players.\n\nthe ncaa's eligibility center assesses each high school or education organization's curriculum and can give it a variety of designations, with periodic reassessment to follow. arbor valley was approved for the first time in september.\n\nas a former ncaa employee, nevius is well-versed in investigating misconduct on behalf of the institution. now he has his own firm that represents players, but has no connection or knowledge of ypsi or arbor valley.\n\nhe said it's possible for a school or educational outlet to be cleared in a matter of months if their paperwork is right. as of now, it appears if students who play at ypsi pass courses at arbor valley academy, they would be eligible to play in college. they would have to meet the eligibility center's amateurism requirements as well.\n\ntyler davis can be contacted at tjdavis@freepress.com or on twitter @tdavisfreep.
washington – with president donald trump continuing to erroneously claim he won the election in the lead-up to jan. 6, several republican allies planned to fight the results when congress met to formally count the votes of the electoral college.\n\nbut the deadly pro-trump riot that took place that day forced a recess to the process, and some gop lawmakers backed down from their plans to object to president-elect joe biden's victory in some states.\n\nstates had already certified their electoral college results, and biden secured the election with 306 votes to trump's 232.\n\nin the next step of the certification process, the constitution requires both chambers of congress to meet before the inauguration to count the electoral votes from every state. the typically ceremonial event drew more attention this year when a group of republican lawmakers said they planned to contest the results.\n\nany objection to a state's results would require support from at least one house representative and one senator to be considered, and the two chambers would meet separately to debate and vote on any disputes.\n\nvice president mike pence officially declared biden the winner at 3:41 a.m. est on jan. 7, after lawmakers reconvened to complete the process following the violence at the capitol. votes to object to state results proceeded for only two states, arizona and pennsylvania, while others lacked the support needed to come to a vote. the efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nmore:trump officials who have resigned following riot at us capitol\n\nthese are the lawmakers who brought challenges to states' electoral college results or voted to overturn the election results, followed by those who backed down from their earlier stance.\n\nlawmakers who objected\n\nsen. tommy tuberville, alabama\n\ntuberville voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ntuberville, a freshman republican senator who was sworn into office jan. 3, first indicated in december that he might fight the vote.\n\nit's impossible. it is impossible what happened, tuberville, said referring to biden's victory. but we're going to get that corrected.\n\nyou'll see what's coming. you've been reading about in the house. we're going to have to do it in the senate, tuberville stated.\n\nmore:sen.-elect tommy tuberville suggests he might challenge electoral college count; other gop senators mum\n\non saturday, he announced his support for cruz's effort, saying he will vote to reject electors from disputed states until that commission has an opportunity to conduct its review, which i believe can and should happen before inauguration day.\n\nrep. mo brooks, alabama\n\nbrooks voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\nbrooks led the effort in the house of representatives to reject biden's electoral college victory. the gop congressman said he wanted to reject the electoral votes certified by states such as georgia and pennsylvania that he claims had flawed election systems.\n\nthe congressman said dozens of members plan on challenging the results.\n\nrep. jerry carl, alabama\n\ncarl voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\ni have legitimate concerns about the integrity of our elections process, and there are serious questions my colleagues and i are seeking answers to, the freshman congressman said.\n\nhe continued, americans deserve the right to participate in free and fair elections, but many voters feel they were robbed of this opportunity in states where verified fraud and irregularities occurred on november 3rd. if given the opportunity to challenge electors from these states, i will certainly do so. president trump has had our backs, and now is the time for us to have his as he rightfully pursues challenges to election fraud.\n\nrep. mike rogers, alabama\n\nrogers voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\nrogers said in a statement he will join other lawmakers in an effort to challenge the electoral college votes in key states.\n\nhe claimed the allegations of election fraud must be thoroughly investigated before congress can act. the results of a handful of states critical to both campaigns are in serious doubt. our elections should be free, fair and transparent. the 2020 election was not. therefore, i will object to the results of the electoral college.\n\nrep. barry moore, alabama\n\nmoore voted to support objections for both the contested states.\n\nmoore said on twitter that he would back brooks' challenge in congress.\n\nit's my honor to stand with @repmobrooks, he tweeted. we met in his office yesterday it's time to stand it's time we draw a line i. the sand and advance #electionintegrity ...it's the new #woke.\n\nrep. robert aderholt, alabama\n\naderholt voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\naderholt released a statement explaining his position on congress certifying the electoral process, saying that it is clear to me that congress has the final review of the electoral process and this is not just a ceremonial act.\n\ntherefore, based on the overwhelming questions that have been raised about moving forward with the approval of the electors from the states aderhold stated, saying he came to the conclusion that there are too many reports of serious fraud for this not to be debated in the house and senate.\n\nwe owe it to the american people to investigate what exactly transpired during this election year, and if state laws were broken by activist judges who decided to make election law on their own, he continued, also saying he supports cruz's efforts for a commission.\n\nrep. gary palmer, alabama\n\npalmer voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrep. andy biggs, arizona\n\nbiggs voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nbiggs, who chairs the conservative house freedom caucus, told fox business the group that met with trump discussed the process for objecting to electoral votes on jan. 6.\n\nwe think we're going to actually be able to contest this, as you say, with at least one objection from the house — and we'll have dozens of objectors in the house — and then at least one in the senate, and we think we'll have more than that, he said.\n\nrep. paul gosar, arizona\n\ngosar voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ngosar confirmed that he was among the earliest republicans to sign onto brooks' effort, hoping to prevent the house from certifying the results of the electoral college on jan. 6, the usa

voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ni do believe there is enough evidence of compromised processes and breakdowns in election integrity by certain state legislatures that do in fact warrant a closer examination, garcia said in a statement. we need a full forensic audit of several states to ensure all americans have confidence in our elections.\n\nrep. kevin mccarthy, california\n\nmccarthy voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nmccarthy, the house minority leader, expressed support ahead of congress meeting for his colleagues' efforts.\n\ni think it's right that we have the debate. i mean, you see now that senators are going to object, the house is going to object — how else do we have a way to change the election problems? mccarthy said.\n\nrep. ken calvert, california\n\ncalvert voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrep. darrell issa, california\n\nissa voted to support objections for both contested

states.\n\nseveral states removed voter safeguards during the 2020 elections that violated provisions in their respective state constitutions and the united states constitution, boebert said in a statement.\n\nshe continued, as a representative sworn to defend the u.s. constitution, it is my responsibility to object to the electoral college results that were recorded under these circumstances. the american people deserve secure and fair elections. unfortunately, the 2020 election was neither of those things.\n\nrep. doug lamborn, colorado\n\nlamborn voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nlamborn told colorado public radio, there were irregularities in ... some of these states.\n\nwhether it rises to the level of widespread fraud, i'd like to get to the bottom of that, and i don't have an answer for that, he continued.\n\nrep. matt gaetz, florida\n\ngaetz voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ngaetz, one of trump's most vocal supporters on capitol hill, tweeted he will join fellow gop lawmakers to object to electors from states that didn't run clean elections.\n\nrep. byron donalds, florida\n\ndonalds voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ndonalds wrote in a statement he will object to the certification to ask legitimate questions to restore faith in our election system.\n\nunlike my democratic colleagues, he continued, i refuse to turn a blind eye to the fact that several states, including the commonwealth of pennsylvania, neglected the oath of their constitution and the united states constitution to follow their election laws.\n\nrep. john rutherford, florida\n\nrutherford voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrutherford tweeted that he will object to electoral college results

civil litigation remains pending.\n\nrep. bill posey, florida\n\nposey voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nthere has not been a serious investigation by federal agencies into the growing body of evidence of election fraud, posey told usa today network paper tcpalm in a statement monday, and among the court cases dismissed, most were dismissed on technical grounds rather than review of evidence of fraud, thus i will object as the evidence must be examined.\n\nmore:reps. posey, mast ready to vote against certifying fair election, call for investigations\n\nrep. brian mast, florida\n\nmast voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nit's clear that congress only intends to act when it will hurt president trump, and i will not go along with this farce,  mast said in his statement. therefore, in the absence of a congressional investigation into fraud in the 2020 presidential election, i will oppose certifying the results.\n\nrep. scott franklin, florida\n\nfranklin voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nfranklin announced monday that he will join fellow republicans in challenging the results of the 2020 election on wednesday.\n\nfollowing the election, there has been a lack of transparency in counting votes in several states that merit closer scrutiny, franklin said in a statement. for that reason, i will join my republican colleagues in challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election to ensure that there is a fair election process that counts every legally casted vote.\n\nmore:lakeland rep. scott

were notified and, according to georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, the signature audit performed in the state found no evidence of voter fraud.\n\nafter weeks of researching georgia's

of georgia, laudermilk said, continuing that he will object.\n\nrep. rick allen, georgia\n\nallen voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\nrep. earl l. buddy carter, georgia\n\ncarter

by senator cruz and other members of the senate to immediately appoint an electoral commission to do a ten day audit of the votes cast would, if nothing else, help restore confidence in our elections moving forward, he continued.\n\nrep. richard hudson, north carolina\n\nhudson voted to support objections for both contested states.\n\ni know there are many who will disagree with my decision to

perhaps, more misleading, daines spokesperson katie schottler told the missoula current. for all stories following today's news, if you are to include something like 'daines is to object to electoral

members of congress expect a long day of bitter debate wednesday as both houses convene at 1 p.m. to count electoral college votes and recognize democrat joe biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nthough the vote count is usually a short, ceremonial event, objections by republican allies of president donald trump – 13 senators and at least 100 house members – will force representatives to consider each objection and vote to accept or reject them. the contentious session could last late into the night.\n\nhouse republicans will object to results in six states contested by trump after the election: arizona, georgia, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin. republican senators plan to target arizona, georgia and pennsylvania.\n\nstate officials have found no evidence of widespread voter fraud, as trump claimed. usa today reported the president and republican allies filed 62 lawsuits seeking to overturn election results in states trump lost, according to marc elias, a democratic election lawyer who is tracking the results. sixty-one of those suits have been dismissed.\n\nbiden won the electoral college vote, 306 to 232. those numbers are unlikely to change in wednesday's count, since both houses of congress must agree to accept objections. democrats, who control the house of representatives, and republican leaders who are against the challenge will not vote to accept.\n\nthe congressional session is mandated by the constitution and follows the electoral count act of 1887. how objections are handled in the process:\n\njoint session\n\nsenate and house members meet in joint session in the house of representatives chamber.\n\nvice president mike pence, president of the senate, is the presiding officer.\n\ntrump tweeted that pence has the authority to reject fraudulently chosen electors. legal scholars say the constitution does not give pence that power.\n\nif pence can't preside, sen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, the senate pro tempore, or the longest-serving senator of the majority party, takes over.\n\nresults delivered\n\ntwo mahogany boxes containing sealed certificates of the electoral votes of each state and the district of columbia are brought in.\n\ncertificates opened\n\nthe presiding officer opens the certificates by state alphabetical order and gives them to four tellers, officers approved by senate and house members of both parties. each chamber appoints two tellers.\n\n'call for objections, if any'\n\nthe tellers read each certificate out loud and record and count votes. the presiding officer asks if there are any objections.\n\nany house or senate member can object to the vote for any reason. the presiding officer will not respond to the objection unless:\n\nit's in writing.\n\nit's signed by both a house and senate member.\n\nif the objection is a joint house/senate request, the joint session is suspended. the senate leaves the house chamber and both houses go into separate sessions to debate it.\n\nmembers who plan to issue objections for these states:\n\ndebate is limited to two hours. each member may speak only once, for up to five minutes.\n\nby simple majority, both chambers vote to accept or reject the objection. the house and senate return to the joint session and announce results. if:\n\nboth chambers reject: votes are counted\n\nvotes are counted one chamber accepts, the other rejects: votes are counted\n\nvotes are counted both chambers accept: votes are not counted\n\nthe joint session then repeats the process with the next state.\n\nwinner announced\n\nthe electoral votes are counted, and the candidate with at least 270 wins. the presiding officer announces winners for president and vice president.\n\nif neither candidate gets 270 votes – virtually impossible this time – the house would choose the president. each state casts one vote.\n\nelectoral objections were last raised in 2005, when rep. stephanie tubbs jones, d-ohio, and sen. barbara boxer, d-calif., claimed voting irregularities in ohio. their objections were rejected.\n\nthe joint session is the last legislative chance for objections to election results. lawsuits filed in court are still possible.\n\nsource usa today network reporting and research; congressional research service; constitutioncenter.org; associated press

stanislav djorgovski of the harvard-smithsonian center for astrophysics told the associated press back in 1987. ″that's something very new and changes our conception of how galaxies form,″ djorgovski

battery by restraint, los angeles county district attorney jackie lacey announced today.\n\nwe believe the evidence will show that the defendant used his power and influence to gain access to his victims and then commit violent crimes against them, lacey said in a statement, adding that she commended the victims who spoke out and bravely recounted what happened to them. it is my hope that all

ap\n\nfrankfurt, germany (ap) — germany's football president is against enlarging the world cup.\n\nreinhard grindel says in an interview published on the federation's website that fifa proposals to enlarge the tournament from 32 teams to 40 or 48 have considerable weaknesses that are also clearly shown in fifa factsheets.\n\ngrindel says, at the dfb, we're fundamentally convinced that the tried and tested model of 32 participating nations should be held. the world championships were always tournaments that inspired . why should that change?\n\nthe dfb president warns that the quality of the tournament could suffer in soccer's core markets if more participants are added, and that conflicts could emerge between national teams and clubs if we overburden the players.
maeve mcdermott\n\nusatoday\n\nbarely a week into 2017, the year's first celebrity feud has arrived.\n\na decade ago, chris brown and soulja boy were just two young rappers climbing the charts, soulja with his breakout hit crank dat and brown with with you and kiss kiss. ten years later, with a handful of celebrity feuds under each of their belts, the two singer/rappers are taking aim at one another.\n\nstarting with a string of social media insults, chris brown and soulja boy's war of the words inspired champion boxer floyd mayweather to organize a pay-per-view match against the two artists, supposedly scheduled for march.\n\nhere's how the feud devolved.\n\nsoulja likes karrueche's pic\n\nis anyone surprised that this started on instagram? according to a string of nsfw tweets, brown saw that soulja liked a post of his ex, karrueche tran, and called him with some fighting words.\n\nthe difference between me and chris is i shot a (expletive) before. and he hit a woman before. we not the same, he wrote in one inflammatory tweet.\n\nbreezy picks a fight\n\nsurprising no one, brown was serious about that fight. his boxer friend adrien broner posted a string of instagrams of brown challenging his opponent to a celebrity boxing match, claiming soulja is continuously calling him on facetime and asking broner to set up the gym.\n\nkarrueche and chris trade words\n\nnaturally, things devolved between karrueche and her rapper ex in dueling instagram posts, also nsfw.\n\ni been chillen...working...eating my veggies...hitting these squats and minding my own business and that's exactly how i want to keep it, she wrote in the since-deleted, very relatable text post.\n\nbrown was less forgiving in his all-caps missive against his ex, where he claimed he's responsible for her success and the reason she has friends, some of whom he slept with. nice.\n\nall the while, the two rappers continued posting nsfw clips and tweets threatening each other, with soulja bringing brown's daughter royalty into the mix. happy new year! royalty is 2 and has 5 times more money than soulja boy already. i'd be mad too, he wrote in one post.\n\nsoulja gets robbed?\n\nwell, that took a turn. soulja offered to meet brown in compton for a street fight, and he made good on his word, going live on instagram from the streets with a group of guys surrounding him, challenging him to come fight.\n\nthings escalated when one of the group members pushed soulja, with another one picking up his phone. did he get robbed? was it staged? will this ever end?\n\nsoulja's mom and brown's lawyer get involved\n\nfast forward to wednesday, when soulja appeared to back down from his claims, posting a video apologizing for his erratic behavior and claiming he just received news his mom was in the hospital.\n\nif that wasn't enough of a wake-up call, brown's attorney, mark geragos, also got involved, threatening to file a lawsuit against soulja.\n\ni'm not sure who you are but please confirm to the world that you will accept the defamation lawsuit i will file against you, he wrote on twitter.\n\nfloyd mayweather enters the ring.\n\nnot so fast. soulja had a change of heart about his apology, calling on his friend mayweather to train him to challenge brown in the biggest fight of the century.\n\nmayweather and soulja both posted a flyer for the event.\n\nbrown is seemingly on board, sharing his own graphic of his photoshopped torso standing over his opponent in the ring.\n\nthe match may be for charity — but there's nothing charitable about this beef stretching two more months.
jesse ferguson\n\nopinion contributor\n\nthis year is the 30th anniversary of nbc's law & order, which brought the dun, dun noise to life as the soundtrack of justice for millions of people.\n\nin 2020, images and phrases associated with police procedures are no longer limited to television dramas; they're associated with the real live president of the united states. too often, though, this is not the way progressives talk about him.\n\ndonald trump got caught red handed. he used taxpayer-funded military aid to bribe a foreign government to help his reelection; it's an open-and-shut case. naturally, trump's republican political allies are very upset that he got caught. like a scooby-doo villain, they think he would have gotten away with it if not for that meddlesome whistleblower.\n\nbut the american people have watched a lot of law & order, and they understand what really happened here. they need only look at the latest round of smoking-gun emails, which confirms trump's role in the plot.\n\nmost americans get the picture\n\nthe coalition of progressive pollsters at navigator research found that by 22 percentage points (57 to 35%), more americans say trump has committed a crime as president — and the margin is an overwhelming 30 points for independents (55 to 25%). both numbers are higher than support for impeachment itself.\n\ndon't trust progressive pollsters? the latest fox news poll found that by 15 percentage points, more americans say trump has abused his power than not (53 to 38%), and that by 8 percentage points, more say he has committed bribery (45 to 37%).\n\nnotwithstanding their view on whether trump should be impeached, people know that what he did was wrong. the latest nbc news/wall street journal poll found that three-quarters of americans say trump has done something wrong. regardless of their views on impeachment or removal, people see the air of corruption and criminality around him.\n\nwhat a change. from the late 1960s through the 2016 election, republicans seemingly had a monopoly on the law-and-order narrative. for all the years i've worked in politics, republicans have been the party with strength on the rule of law, a fundamental moral value at the core of their brand. under trump, they've traded that strength away.\n\nin the same navigator research poll, more people say trump thinks he's above the law than not — a difference of 24 points (62 to 38%). americans now trust democrats in congress more than president trump on the rule of law by a margin of 12 points (46 to 34%). in 2016, trump promised to be the law-and-order president, but people now see a president who believes he's above the law.\n\nonce is enough:don't let 2020 become 2016. beat donald trump.\n\nbeltway pundits and prognosticators, myself included, have been obsessed with the political fallout from impeachment. will it fuel trump or foment opposition? will it strengthen the democrats' house majority or backfire against them? but the american people aren't voting on impeachment. by the time the election rolls around, it will be in the rearview mirror.\n\nafter all, the 1974 elections weren't a referendum on president richard nixon's impeachment. they were a referendum on his crime: watergate. likewise, what the people may vote on in 2020 is criminality and the rule of law. and if that happens, trump is in trouble.\n\nmake 2020 about trump's crimes\n\nto make this argument, we have to meet voters where they are in this debate. bottom line: if you're using language that never could have made it into an episode of law & order, you're doing it wrong. you're not using language that furthers our case or reaches people in this moment.\n\ndemocrats have to focus our argument on the repeated corrupt and criminal activities that trump and his allies have been caught engaging in. the point isn't that he's violating norms; it's that he's violating laws. don't just lament the way that trump ignores the separation of powers by not having witnesses testify. make it clear that he's gagging witnesses and refusing to answer questions himself.\n\nif you defend the legal process instead of making the point that he attacks and belittles the very law enforcement officials who caught him, you're leaving voters behind. if you find yourself explaining the lack of prosecution after the mueller report, hush money and individual 1 by citing the justice department's office of legal counsel guidance rather than explaining that trump essentially has immunity, you're falling into his trap.\n\nwhat joe biden really thinks:worse than even his policies, donald trump is destroying america's soul\n\npeople may not track every nuance of this debate, but they smell the foul stench. they know that if an average american citizen had done any one of a dozen things that trump has done, they'd be in jail.\n\nthe president shouldn't be above the law.\n\nthis is why this scandal is so deeply damaging to president trump. long after the debate around impeachment is over, the lasting stink will still surround him. a majority of the country believes he's a criminal. people no longer hear the soundtrack from the apprentice when they see him; they hear that dun, dun from a new series — law & order: djt\n\njesse ferguson, a national democratic strategist, was deputy national press secretary for hillary clinton's 2016 presidential campaign, executive director of the democratic congressional campaign committee's independent expenditure program and communications director of the dccc. follow him on twitter: @jessefferguson
tom pelissero\n\nusa today sports\n\nhouston – an ambitious project that encompasses far more than a football stadium won over nfl owners, who voted to approve the rams' relocation to the los angeles area on tuesday.\n\ndallas cowboys owner jerry jones – a native of inglewood, calif., where the stadium is to open in 2019 on the site of the former hollywood park horse track – called rams owner stan kroenke's vision for bringing the team back to the city it abandoned 21 years ago absolutely the greatest plan ever conceived in sports, as far as how to put the show on.\n\nafter a two-decade absence from one of the nation's largest media markets, nfl commissioner roger goodell has said the league finally found the signature project that would fulfill its stated goal of a solution to succeed in l.a. for the long haul.\n\nit's more than just a stadium, goodell said. it's a project, an entertainment complex, that we believe will be responsive to the kind of things that we need to be successful with our fans in the los angeles market.\n\nrams moving back to los angeles with chargers given option to join\n\nthe enclosed, glass-roofed facility – expected to be built for upwards of $2 billion, all privately financed – is just part of the plan. there could be as much as $15 billion in developing what amounts to a city that has the nfl as a featured aspect of it, jones said.\n\nhouston texans owner bob mcnair, among others, noted there will be space for the league-owned nfl network on the premises and the ability for the stadium to be home to two teams, should the san diego chargers – who have first dibs – or oakland raiders choose to join the rams there after their competing project in nearby carson, calif., lost out.\n\nst. louis mayor francis slay all but told the nfl what they can do with their new stadium.\n\nthe nfl ignored the facts, the loyalty of st. louis fans, who supported the team through far more downs than ups, and the nfl ignored a strong market and viable plan for a new stadium, slay said in a statement. i am proud of our effort and what st. louis was able to accomplish in an extraordinarily short period of time. i thank everyone who worked so diligently on this project, especially the governor's task force.\n\ninglewood mayor: rams deal 'transformative moment' for one-time lakers home\n\nkroenke, in a statement, defended his decision.\n\nwhile there understandably has been emotionally charged commentary regarding our motives and intentions, the speculation is not true and unfounded, kroenke said. i am a missouri native named after two st. louis sports legends who i was fortunate enough to know on a personal level. this move isn't about whether i love st. louis or missouri. i do and always will. no matter what anyone says, that will never change.\n\nthe inglewood city council unanimously approved the rams' plan in february 2015. but it wasn't until tuesday's daylong session here the team's return to the market it abandoned under previous ownership after the 1994 season was finalized.\n\nearlier in the day, the league committee appointed to study the l.a. issue said it was backing the competing carson project. it was unbelievable, jones said. i've never been in meeting where that many people voted for what the committee didn't.\n\nthe option to join the rams in inglewood, as well as an additional $100 million in financial support if the chargers or raiders can find solutions in their existing markets, was the solution owners settled on to try to advance the process for those franchises as well.\n\nbut it was kroenke – the 68-year-old missouri billionaire whose purchase of the rams was approved in 2010 – standing at the podium tuesday as the man who won the race to l.a.\n\nwe look forward to returning to los angeles and building a world-class nfl entertainment district in inglewood, kroenke said in a statement.\n\nfollow tom pelissero on twitter @tompelissero.
ted slafsky\n\nopinion contributor\n\nhealth care affordability ranks first or second among issues voters want congress to tackle in 2019, according to numerous polls following the 2018 midterm elections. while democrats and republicans have very different opinions on hot button issues such as the affordable care act and medicare for all, they unite when it comes to anger over pharmaceutical costs.\n\npresident donald trump has a plan to cut prescription drug prices, democrats of all stripes have campaigned on tackling this. should we expect to see big changes this year? as a 25-year veteran of the drug-pricing battle on capitol hill, i'm skeptical anything ambitious will be coming. even so, there's new momentum for change. here are my predictions for action on drug pricing in the new 116th congress:\n\nrequire drug firms to list prices in tv ads\n\nin october, health and human services secretary alex azar unveiled a proposal to require pharma companies to publish a drug's list price in tv ads that blanket the airwaves. the drug industry has argued that the information could be misleading because patients often don't pay the list price. even after these concerns are shared with the american public, a new kaiser health poll finds that a majority still supports it although by smaller margins.\n\nthe administration now appears amenable to a plan floated by industry group phrma that would provide more context to what a patient might actually pay at the counter. assuming that the administration is able to overcome first amendment challenges, i give it an 80 percent chance of becoming reality.\n\nallow medicare to negotiate drug prices\n\non the campaign trail in 2016, trump embraced allowing the government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug prices for seniors. democrats have introduced a series of bills that would accomplish this goal and have vowed to make this a top priority. but while a remarkable 92 percent of americans support the idea and virtually every other country utilizes this approach, i highly doubt anything this ambitious will become reality any time soon.\n\nthe trump administration would like to move forward on a pilot program to tie pricing for certain costly medicare drugs to what other countries pay — which is often dramatically lower than what u.s. customers pay. but even before the regulation has been formally proposed, big pharma has launched an all-out assault. considering that doctors, hospitals and patient groups have also come out against it, i would give it a practically zero chance of moving forward.\n\nput restrictions on drug coverage\n\nthe trump administration has also proposed allowing medicare to restrict what drugs would be covered by health plans that negotiate prices on behalf of the 45 million seniors who participate in the medicare part d program. the tactic, commonly used in the private sector and in other countries, is to avoid the use of very expensive medications when there are cheaper versions that are therapeutically equivalent. despite the drug industry's impressive ability to kill measures like this, i would give it an 80 percent chance of becoming law in a watered-down form.\n\nlet people buy medicine from other countries\n\nevery new session of congress, a bipartisan group of lawmakers introduces bills to allow americans to buy pharmaceuticals from canada. while the bill sponsors often change, the legislation always ends up in the proverbial trash heap. the drug industry and some medical professionals have raised concerns about counterfeit medicines ending up in the hands of patients.\n\ncould 2019 be different? the stars are aligned for action. food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb has formed a work group to explore the option of importing drugs in certain instances of price gouging. the work group's mandate is very limited, but no one expected that an agency overseen by a longtime advocate of the pharmaceutical industry would even consider this idea.\n\nsen. chuck grassley, r-iowa, a maverick and the new chairman of the senate finance committee, will be pushing for a more ambitious plan to allow importation from canada and will have plenty of support from congressional democrats. even the esteemed american medical association recently endorsed drug importation from canada. nonetheless, i give importation no more than a 25 percent chance. if it passes, it will be permissible only if patients travel north to get their medicine and pick it up in small quantities at licensed brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nweaken monopoly power\n\nunder the u.s. system, drug companies are granted patent protection and market exclusivity to produce new medicines that treat some of our most debilitating diseases. this is an important way to encourage innovation and risk-taking, but many academics and policymakers have pointed out that drug companies often abuse this monopoly power.\n\na whopping 78 percent of patents approved by the fda are for existing drugs rather than new ones. drug manufacturers, already entitled to up to 20 years of patent protection, need only make slight modifications to get additional protections. to make matters worse, many brand name manufacturers will pay a generic company to delay introduction of cheaper alternatives.\n\nled by grassley and sen. amy klobuchar, d-minn., lawmakers have introduced several bills to spur competition. more than 100 house democrats have even proposed to strip a company's patent rights when it refuses to lower prices. but don't count on any type of patent legislation to become law in the 116th congress. a much better bet is the creates act, which would speed generic drugs to market by giving generic companies early access to samples for comparison tests. i give it a 95 percent chance of passage.\n\nis there anything that will definitely happen in 2019? in 2018, the drug industry spent a potentially record sum lobbying congress. there is a 100 percent guarantee they will surpass that milestone this year.\n\nted slafsky, founder and principal of wexford solutions, previously served as ceo of an advocacy organization focused on drug pricing. follow him on twitter: @tslafsky
should the 2020 golden globes have brought the notorious ricky gervais back as a host? did the right movies and tv shows win the awards? who made the best speech? usa today tv critic kelly lawler breaks down every winner, loser, presenter and gag at the 77th annual golden globe awards.\n\ngervais lost his shock and awe\n\nwas golden globes host ricky gervais even trying in his fifth time at the globes microphone? with a glass of beer on the lectern, gervais looked a little tired when he opened the show, reminding viewers he didn't care anymore (and never really did). he had a lackluster, lazy parade of jokes about baby yoda and joe pesci (the internet has beat him to much better jokes on the tiny alien), felicity huffman making license plates (the audience definitely wasn't with him there), cats, martin scorsese's height and movies about pedophiles.\n\nthere were a few chuckles to be had, but even fans of gervais' harsh brand of humor would likely be disappointed. there weren't many barbs to his supposedly sharp humor, merely a few weak jabs at apple and political celebrities. more than anything else, it was dull.\n\nmore:golden globes 2020: kate mckinnon nails what it feels like to see yourself represented onscreen\n\nbut as gervais said, they're just jokes, we're all gonna die soon, and there's no sequel. glad to know gervais is really done after this time.\n\nthe unsung winners\n\nhonestly, the best part of the awards from the hollywood foreign press association, the small organization that votes on the globes, is that sometimes it helps shine a light on small films and tv shows that could use a boost. this year the lucky recipient was the great ramy youssef, the star and creator of hulu's ramy, who knew that this big room of hollywood heavy hitters hadn't seen his show. but they'd better now.\n\nanother underdog with a big win was the missing link, which edged out frozen 2 for the best animated film award. the film comes from laika studios, which was behind the incredibly animated coraline and kubo and the two strings. their films don't sell as many toys as elsa and anna, but they are beautiful to behold.\n\neyebrows, raised\n\nhave eyebrows ever been thanked at an awards show before? stellan skarsgard, who won best supporting actor in a limited tv series or movie for hbo's chernobyl, helped kick off the night with an excellent and incredibly surprising speech. sure, he thanked the series' director, writer and usual suspects. but he also thanked the man who made the prosthetic eyebrows for his character. it was funnier than anything gervais said all night. hopefully it starts a trend. can't wait for someone to thank their fingernails.\n\nmore:best dressed at the golden globes: taylor swift, nicole kidman and more stars stun\n\nmore:worst dressed at the golden globes: jennifer lopez, sofia vergara, cate blanchett, more\n\nbong joon-ho schools americans on subtitles\n\nthe director of one of the year's most acclaimed films, south korea's parasite, accepted the award for foreign language film with this biting missive: once you get over the 1-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films. may we all heed his words of wisdom.\n\nkate mckinnon makes her case for next globes host\n\nellen degeneres won the globes' carol burnett award for excellence in television, and although she had her own acceptance speech, she was overshadowed by saturday night live star kate mckinnon's introduction. mckinnon was funny (listing all the clothes she wore doing her degeneres impressions) and deeply moving as she recalled how degeneres boosted her confidence as a young gay woman. she risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth, mckinnon said. that mix of hilarity and heart is exactly the kind of thing an awards-show host needs. maybe mckinnon will step up next year.\n\ndj ansel?\n\npresenter ansel elgort didn't say much when he presented best original song to elton john and bernie taupin, but boy, did he sing! it was a little weird, but at least it was on pitch. perhaps some guerrilla marketing for his upcoming role in steven spielberg's west side story remake?

the first of the eagles' offseason moves began saturday when it was reported by the nfl network that defensive coordinator jim schwartz will not be returning.\n\nschwartz had run the eagles' defense ever since doug pederson became the head coach in jan. 2016. pederson had given schwartz full autonomy over the defense. schwartz, 54, will apparently take a year off and contemplate retirement.\n\nit was expected that the eagles will make some changes after going 4-10-1 heading into their regular-season finale sunday night against the washington football team.\n\nbut pederson, for one, expressed confidence this week that he will return for 2021. if that's the case, then it seemed likely that there would be changes on pederson's staff.\n\nschwartz, then, is the first change. schwartz would not discuss his performance this season when asked on tuesday, saying he's only thinking about the upcoming game against washington.\n\ni've got too much respect for the guys that are going to be on the field, some of which are playing for the first time, schwartz said. i've got too much respect for the game to talk about anything other than this game. i apologize for that, but that's where our focus is.\n\nthe eagles defense is ranked 21st overall in yards allowed per game at 371 and 22nd in points allowed per game at 26.5.\n\nthose are both the worst rankings in schwartz's five seasons with the eagles. but injuries have ravaged all three position groups on defense during the season.\n\nthat includes the secondary where an undrafted rookie free agent in michael jacquet started at cornerback last sunday against dallas, and was beaten frequently by cowboys receivers michael gallup and amari cooper.\n\nin the last two games, the eagles have allowed more than 500 yards in each game in losses to arizona and the cowboys.\n\nin addition, defensive tackle javon hargrave, the eagles' big free agent signing, had a slow start before playing well over the last several weeks.\n\npederson has often spoken highly of schwartz's work, most recently on friday.\n\nobviously, his defenses historically have been top defenses in the national football league – of course, when guys are healthy and all of that, pederson said. i think as the season progressed this year, i thought the defense actually was doing some really good things for us and keeping the offense in these football games here down the stretch – creating takeaways and sort of stymieing the run game from our opponents, things of that nature.\n\nthe players had also spoken highly of schwartz's coaching under difficult situations. the eagles have played most of the past month without starting defensive backs rodney mcleod and avonte maddox, both sidelined with knee injuries.\n\ni like jim schwartz. i love his defense, defensive end brandon graham said. i think sometimes because of injuries and certain things that happen, the defense that he runs, i feel like i'm always in position to make plays. sometimes, it's tough. we don't have the personnel to do certain things, like mcleod going down. that's our general in the back that keeps everything together.\n\nthere's a lot of stuff that played its part this year. it just sucks, because i know jim is a good coach and sometimes the way the season went, it gave people a bad name, for all of us. it was a bad name because we gave up 500 yards and it doesn't look good when you can't stop the bleeding.\n\nbefore coming to the eagles, schwartz had served as a defensive coordinator with the tennessee titans from 2001-08. during that time, the titans reached the super bowl and won the afc south three times.\n\nhe was the detroit lions' head coach from 2009-13, taking over a team that went 0-16 the season before he arrived, and taking them to the playoffs in his third season. he served as the buffalo bills defensive coordinator in 2014 before coming to the eagles.\n\ncontact martin frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com. follow on twitter @mfranknfl.
the last time marvin lewis and the cincinnati bengals made a major change on the defensive coaching staff, it was in january 2008, when he tapped longtime friend mike zimmer to come in to run his defense.\n\nthat partnership lasted six years, when zimmer left to become the head coach of the minnesota vikings. zimmer's thumbprint lasted until this week, when zimmer disciple paul guenther officially left to coordinate the defense in oakland.\n\nmore:paul guenther out as cincinnati bengals defensive coordinator, joins jon gruden and oakland raiders\n\nmore:ex-bengals oc zampese interviewing with browns, per report\n\nmore:bengals wr coach james urban bolts for baltimore\n\nwith a clean slate, lewis hopes that teryl austin can provide the same kind of boost that zimmer's reboot did when the bengals became a perennial top-eight defense in the league from 2009-13.\n\nthe enquirer has confirmed austin agreed to terms to become the team's dc early on monday and the club made it official later on monday.\n\nit's an honor to join the bengals organization, austin said in a statement released by the team. i look forward to leading an aggressive group of young men and helping them and the team achieve our goals.\n\nlewis said he liked austin's coaching mentality.\n\nhe is a bright and aggressive coach with a wealth of experience, lewis said in his team-issued statement. i look forward to working alongside him to take full advantage of our talented defensive personnel.\n\naustin, 52, doesn't have the long history coordinating that zimmer did but he comes off of four seasons in detroit where the lions went 36-28 overall with two playoff appearances.\n\nthe lions' defensive ranks those years were:\n\n2014: no. 2 overall, no. 3 in scoring\n\n2015: no. 18 overall, no. 23 in scoring\n\n2016: no. 18 overall, no. 13 in scoring\n\n2017: no. 27 overall, no. 21 in scoring\n\naustin also coordinated the 2010 university of florida defense under urban meyer, a team that went 8-5. bengals defensive back josh shaw was on that team.\n\nmore:report: teryl austin to interview for cincinnati bengals coordinator job\n\nmore:detroit lions block teryl austin from green bay packers interview\n\nmore:detroit lions interview dc teryl austin for head coach\n\naustin is a pennsylvania native and played collegiately at the university of pittsburgh. he also played in the world league in 1991. he began coaching at penn state in 1991 and eventually worked his way through wake forest, syracuse and michigan before mike holmgren and defensive coordinator ray rhodes hired him as the seattle seahawks' defensive backs coach in 2003.\n\naustin held that position through 2006 before taking the same position with ken wisenhunt and defensive coordinator clancy pendergast in arizona from 2007-09.\n\nmeyer gave him his first coordinator shot in 2010, but after meyer left florida for health reasons, austin was not retained by will muschamp. that sent austin to baltimore, where he was the secondary coach for john harbaugh and defensive coordinators chuck pagano (2011) and dean pees (2012-13).\n\nformer ravens offensive coordinator jim caldwell then took austin to detroit for the last four seasons.\n\nmore:mike brown-marvin lewis fact or fiction: are cincinnati bengals cheap with players?\n\nmore:mike brown-marvin lewis fact or fiction: cincinnati bengals lacking halftime adjustments?
ap\n\nmiami (ap) — the last miami play was designed by heat coach erik spoelstra to put the ball in josh richardson's hands, and with it came the right to decide who would take his team's biggest shot of the game.\n\nhe chose himself.\n\nit was the right call.\n\nrichardson's layup with 5.1 seconds left capped a miami rally from eight points down in the fourth, donovan mitchell missed a jumper for utah at the buzzer and the heat simply stole one in the final moments to beat the utah jazz 103-102 on sunday.\n\nhe drew it up for me and i was kind of surprised, richardson said.\n\nso surprised, in fact, that richardson emerged from that huddle telling wayne ellington and tyler johnson to get ready for his pass. but a lane opened to the rim, richardson laid the ball home and the heat won their fourth straight — all by single digits, miami's longest stretch of such wins since november 2012.\n\nutah played a very good basketball game, spoelstra said. in many ways, they deserved to win this one. but we've got to make up some ground. we've given up some games that we wish we could have had back, so quite frankly we need to steal some.\n\ntyler johnson and goran dragic each scored 16 points for miami. richardson and hassan whiteside each had 14, james johnson 13 and kelly olynyk had 12.\n\nmitchell scored 19 of his 27 points in the second half, but couldn't save utah from dropping its seventh straight on the road. he went into the backcourt to take the final inbounds pass and wound up taking a jumper from the right side that missed as time expired.\n\nmitchell kicked himself afterward, realizing too late rodney hood might have been open.\n\ni should have made the right read instead of shooting it, mitchell said.\n\nhood scored 17 points, thabo sefolosha added 13 and derrick favors 11 for the jazz, who fell to 3-17 on the road.\n\nwe obviously did a few things right, jazz coach quin snyder said. it doesn't feel like it right now.\n\nmiami improved to 2-14 when trailing after three quarters.\n\nthe heat led for 20 of the 24 first-half minutes, but their lead was only 49-47 at the break.\n\nmitchell was 3 for 12 in the opening half, after going 5 for 14 against the heat when the teams met in november. it was like he was due to break out — and did just that, needing only 3 minutes to score utah's first 11 points of the second half.\n\nhe made his first five shots of the third, ended up 6-for-8 for 13 points in the quarter and utah took a 75-74 lead into the fourth. mitchell put the jazz up 93-85 with 6:28 left, but miami finished on a 18-9 spurt.\n\nfind a way at the end, spoelstra said.\n\ntip-ins\n\njazz: the 3:30 p.m. est tip is the earliest for utah this season. ... the jazz scored 74 points in the teams' first meeting this season; joe johnson's jumper with 1:09 left in the third gave utah 75 on sunday. ... utah is off until wednesday, which means the jazz — who had time for exactly one non-gameday practice in december — will get one during this trip.\n\nheat: miami plays seven of its next eight, and 11 of its next 14, on the road. ... there's been no change yet in the status of dion waiters, who sought a second opinion on his sprained left ankle last week. waiters missed his sixth consecutive game. ... the heat sent derrick walton jr. to sioux falls of the g league over the weekend, after he appeared in 12 games with miami.\n\nsilver watches\n\nnba commissioner adam silver watched the game from the stands. he's in miami for league marketing meetings scheduled for this week.\n\nboth sides\n\nwhiteside had tip-ins on consecutive possessions in the first quarter, 22 seconds apart, which sounds great — until realizing it happened on both ends of the floor. favors was credited with the basket when whiteside accidentally deflected the ball in for two utah points, and on the ensuing miami possession the heat center tipped in a miss by dragic.\n\nup next\n\njazz: visit washington on wednesday night, as their trip continues.\n\nheat: visit toronto on tuesday night, then visit indiana on wednesday.
ap\n\nwashington (ap) — just because all-star point guard john wall is out for the season, that doesn't mean the washington wizards think they're finished.\n\nbradley beal had 24 points, jeff green added 22 and thomas bryant scored 16 to go with a career-high 15 rebounds as washington beat the atlanta hawks 114-98 on wednesday night.\n\nwall, scheduled for surgery on his left heel jan. 8, hasn't played in any of the past three games but the wizards have won the last two.\n\nwe all have to be better, beal said. we know how much weight he carries, and his importance to this franchise and this team. we're definitely going to miss him. we hate that he's out. we're not sitting here saying we're a better team without him. ... we have to realize, accept the fact that he won't be with us this year and we've got to do our best to make a run at it.\n\ntomas satoransky had 14 points, seven assists and a career-best 11 rebounds for the wizards, who improved to 15-23. they've won consecutive games for the first time since taking three straight from dec. 1-5.\n\nsatoransky filled in for wall last season when he had surgery on his left knee and missed 41 games. as a result, satoransky doesn't feel the pressure he did a year ago.\n\ni maybe felt like that last year because it was an uncertain situation for me, he said. now, i know my role. people know me. they have confidence in me. that's how i feel on the court. i know what i can bring to the team. obviously, it's different than john, but you have to play smart.\n\natlanta was led by alex len, who a season-high 24 points and 11 rebounds. john collins scored 21.\n\nthe wizards took the lead midway through the first quarter. the hawks got close several times in the second half before finally tying it at 94 when len hit a jumper with 6:44 to play.\n\nwashington then went on a 17-2 run to build a 111-96 lead with 1:35 left.\n\nbeal, who was just 2 for 9 in the first half, quickly hit a basket and a 3-pointer. green followed with another 3 to put the wizards ahead 102-94 with 5:03 remaining.\n\ntip-ins\n\nhawks: c dewayne dedmon returned to the lineup after missing two games with left knee soreness. ... g kent bazemore was out for a second game with a sprained right ankle. ... atlanta coach lloyd pierce was assessed a technical foul in the third quarter.\n\nwizards: f markieff morris missed his third straight game with upper back/neck stiffness. he saw a specialist and the wizards were awaiting results. ... f otto porter returned to the lineup after missing 10 games with a bruised right knee. he didn't start for the first time this season and was restricted to 13 minutes. he scored nine points.\n\na different look\n\ncollins said atlanta changed its game plan with wall out for washington, but it didn't work.\n\njohn wall was going to be out and they move the ball, collins said. a lot of people tend to eat when he's out so we knew they were going to try and to come and have a balanced game and that's what they did tonight.\n\nmaking adjustments\n\nwizards coach scott brooks knows he needs to change up schemes without his star guard.\n\nwe're going to have to play this way, brooks said. we're going to have to scrap, put our hard hat on.\n\nup next\n\nhawks: visit the milwaukee bucks on friday in the finale of a three-game road trip.\n\nwizards: visit the miami heat on friday in the opener of a three-game trip.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nba: https://apnews.com/nba and https://twitter.com/ap_sports
from usa today network and wire reports\n\nalabama\n\nmontgomery: the state notched almost a third of its coronavirus cases in december, an alarming bulge that echoed the warnings of medical experts who said the state would see some dark days before the widespread availability of a vaccine to fight the pandemic. alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable covid-19 cases reported in december. the surge came after the thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in january from the fallout of christmas and new year's gatherings. we are being overwhelmed right now, state health officer scott harris said. i believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad. the cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases dec. 31. while there were some backlogged cases recorded in december, almost all of the reported cases were from december.\n\nalaska\n\nanchorage: health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies pfizer and moderna. that figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in december. thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in alaska. starting monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. that group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. almost 50 alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. that group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the daily news reports. alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last monday.\n\narizona\n\nphoenix: despite a surge of coronavirus cases, gov. doug ducey on saturday rejected the state's top education official's call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. given the severity of our state's situation and the virus's trajectory after the holiday period, schools need a two-week quarantine period for education leaders and local officials to use local health data to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities, superintendent of public instruction kathy hoffman said in a twitter thread. hoffman called for the two-week quarantine period for schools after the department of health services on saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known covid-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. however, ducey spokesman c.j. karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. this is a local decision. the online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely. many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.\n\narkansas\n\nlittle rock: coronavirus hospitalizations in arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. there were 1,216 people in arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of covid-19 on saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. the arkansas department of health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of covid-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. those case counts are down from friday's record high, but gov. asa hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on new year's day. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms.\n\ncalifornia\n\nlos angeles: hospitals struggling to provide enough oxygen for the sickest coronavirus patients in the los angeles area began to receive help saturday when u.s. army corps of engineers crews arrived to update their oxygen delivery systems. the collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. some covid-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. california started the new year friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. the state department of public health on saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed covid-19 cases. more than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of saturday with covid-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. the southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural san joaquin valley to the mexico border. hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don't have any more beds for covid-19 patients. makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.\n\ncolorado\n\ndenver: a day after gov. jared polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. the governor cited improving statewide covid-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including denver and the entire front range, but his announcement wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the denver post reports. it appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said mark johnson, executive director of jefferson county public health. the announcement came a day after colorado said it had confirmed the united states' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. we don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with christmas, new year's or the new variant that is more infectious, johnson said.\n\nconnecticut\n\nnew haven: some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. superintendent iline tracey announced on the district website thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting jan. 19. the new haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last march. officials in new haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in september as other districts in connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. a plan to reopen new haven's schools on nov. 9 was shelved amid rising covid-19 cases. tracey said schools will open jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. two schools, quinnipiac school and west rock school, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, tracey said.\n\ndelaware\n\nwilmington: after health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the covid-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. dr. karyl rattay, director of the delaware division of public health, announced the state's decision during gov. john carney's weekly coronavirus press briefing tuesday. front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, u.s. postal service workers and grocery store workers. the group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. but these people likely won't start getting the vaccine until mid- to late january due to the limited supply of the vaccine. please be patient with us. there's just not enough vaccine for everyone right now, rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. people who work in delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.\n\ndistrict of columbia\n\nwashington: curators sam vong and shannon perich at the national museum of american history are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, wusa-tv reports. as historians, what we really want to do is document what's going on before it kind of escapes from us, vong said. the smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that americans' recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. all of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research, perich said. the submissions can be mundane. what did it mean to sit in your home by yourself? asked perich. the only way we're ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us. or they can be extraordinary, like one of vong's favorites so far from a former bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. the submission period opened in december and runs through march.\n\nflorida\n\nfort lauderdale: health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths saturday. florida's department of health did not release numbers on new year's day. the state has also chosen not to report covid-19 cases on two other holidays, thanksgiving and christmas. the two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed covid-19 cases in florida to 1,354,833. the agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported friday and 9,752 reported saturday. the state's death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. on new year's eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in covid-19 cases ever detected in florida, with 17,192 new cases. also on thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department's healthyfla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in england has been detected in a martin county man with no recent travel history. martin county is north of palm beach county, which along with miami-dade and broward counties have comprised the state's hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.\n\ngeorgia\n\naugusta: as vaccines are being administered to health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, law enforcement and first responder agencies are in line to get them soon. gov. brian kemp and georgia department of public health commissioner dr. kathleen toomey announced wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to phase 1a – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. some augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. the richmond county sheriff's office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. dr. stephen goggans, the director of the east central health district, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.\n\nhawaii\n\nhonolulu: residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the u.s., health officials said. the hawaii department of health, along with the centers for disease control and prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the honolulu star-advertiser reports. it has not been detected in hawaii. confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the united kingdom and south africa and in the u.s. in colorado, california and florida. all we know is that we have not yet found it, state laboratories division dr. edward desmond said. we're going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures. the vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. health officials have said about 25,000 covid-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in december to 65,250.\n\nidaho\n\nboise: gov. brad little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. the republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. the latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after november tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. for 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with covid-19 patients. among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. health and the economy are intertwined, little said. idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.\n\nillinois\n\nchicago: the state's public health department reported 29 covid-19-related deaths saturday, the smallest one-day total in illinois since mid-november. not only was the total, included in a news release from the illinois department of public health, lower than any single day since nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. the latest numbers bring the number of covid-19-related deaths in illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. the health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. but the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. the cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on new year's day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the chicago sun-times.\n\nindiana\n\nindianapolis: anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state's top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by covid-19 itself, jennifer sullivan, secretary of the state's family and social services administration, said during gov. eric holcomb's weekly briefing wednesday on the state's coronavirus response. that includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. as a way to help, sullivan encouraged hoosiers to use the state-run bewellindiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. since april, more than 25,000 hoosiers have completed those assessments. for more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, sullivan said.\n\niowa\n\ndes moines: a federal judge has rejected an argument by tyson foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. tyson was sued in august by the family of isidro fernandez, who worked at the company's plant in waterloo, after he died april 26 from complications of covid-19. more than 1,000 tyson workers tested positive for the virus in may, and at least six died. the families of fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. tyson fired seven managers in december after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. the fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at tyson's request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including president donald trump, when it remained open in april. but last monday, u.s. district judge linda reade rejected the argument.\n\nkansas\n\ntopeka: the state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in england, the director of the state department of health and environment said last week. no cases of the new strain have been detected in kansas. cases have been confirmed in colorado, florida and california. dr. lee norman said kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of covid-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. norman told reporters during a statehouse news conference that kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes covid-19, including a utah strain and a wisconsin strain. viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. mostly, they don't make much difference, norman said. they're more alike than different, quite honestly. the state on friday reported another 138 deaths from covid-19 since wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. kansas has confirmed 227,745 covid-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since wednesday, the health department said.\n\nkentucky\n\nlouisville: new coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. the previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes covid-19. kentucky ranked no. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a usa today network analysis of johns hopkins university data shows. testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. labs and testing sites closed. people traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. the worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in boyle, lawrence and clinton counties. adding the most new cases overall were jefferson county, with 2,743 cases; fayette county, with 1,170 cases; and kenton county, with 702. weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. the worst increases from the prior week's pace were in oldham, hardin and jefferson counties. the share of kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a usa today network analysis of covid tracking project data shows.\n\nlouisiana\n\nbaton rouge: with the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don't begin until monday and require a scheduled appointment. the louisiana department of health said friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. health department spokeswoman aly neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which neel described as a promising sign. with thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, gov. john bel edwards announced thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.\n\nmaine\n\naugusta: protesters gathered outside the maine statehouse on saturday to criticize how democratic gov. janet mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. wabi-tv reports the protest organized by the swinging gate organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. there's this undercurrent of pent-up energy that's not doing well under this governor's rule, and it's important to harness that organic energy that's out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied, said event organizer dick campbell. more than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced sunday. one additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. the seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on dec. 19 to 528 on saturday.\n\nmaryland\n\nbaltimore: the maryland department of health is working with regional and federal partners to test patient samples for infection with the new variant of the coronavirus. the baltimore sun reports the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention are collaborating with the state's public health lab, as well as state laboratories in california and delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. there have been at least two cases of the covid-19 variant identified in the u.s., one in california and another in colorado. a maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in maryland. the cdc has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. but it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.\n\nmassachusetts\n\nboston: gov. charlie baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. the republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in massachusetts to cover covid-19 testing and treatment. it also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of covid-19 on the health care system, among other steps. meanwhile, a covid-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at umass lowell last week instead will open monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. while the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. lowell general hospital currently has 63 covid-19 patients at its main campus.\n\nmichigan\n\ncalumet: a judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in michigan's upper peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. gov. gretchen whitmer's administration got a restraining order against cafe rosetta in calumet, a small town in houghton county. since november, bars and restaurants in michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. kristi painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. she ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. i did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … i observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled 'legal fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,'  painter said in a court filing. cafe co-owner amy heikkinen, a mother of six, said she can't afford to limit her business to carryout orders. she said sales are up because of her dispute with authorities. it's my right to earn an income to protect and feed my family, she said. that's the right of every american. you can't make me not work.\n\nminnesota\n\nminneapolis: the state on saturday reported 54 deaths from covid-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. the new numbers bring the state's pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. a total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. the department of health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. in that period, the state reported one of the nation's lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to johns hopkins researchers. gov. tim walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for new year's celebrations. the attorney general has sued one such bar, alibi drinkery in lakeville, for repeated violations of the order. despite a court injunction ordering it to close, people packed into the bar for a new year's party, the st. paul pioneer press reports.\n\nmississippi\n\ncolumbus: a hospital is offering $5,000 bonuses for qualified nurses as it works to recruit staff during a pandemic and at a time when health care workers are in short supply. wcbi reports baptist memorial hospital - golden triangle is offering a number of incentives including the bonus as it works to recruit amid a nationwide nursing shortage. johnny judson is responsible for recruiting nurses for the hospital. i am literally in every school, nursing school, in the area, including along the alabama border, he told the station. i go up to north mississippi, south mississippi, and i go to these nursing schools, and i talk to these students. he said the country's nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. the bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. we put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don't lower the standards, he said.\n\nmissouri\n\njefferson city: the chairman of the missouri veterans commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since september. tim noonan told the st. louis post-dispatch on thursday that he was resigning, citing comments gov. mike parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. a summary of the investigation was released earlier in december, but noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the post-dispatch to release the full report. officials inside parson's administration and state sen. jill schupp, a democrat from creve coeur, had urged noonan to release the full report, and he did so after attorney general eric schmitt directed him to, noonan said. that came after parson on wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. i'm not going to worry about everybody's personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman, parson said. i'm just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that's my whole focus. noonan said he resigned because of those comments.\n\nmontana\n\nbozeman: montana pbs has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in march to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. the new schedule for the learn at home broadcast was set to launch monday and continue through the end of the school year june 4, the bozeman daily chronicle reports. the shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. we know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a tv that receives our broadcast signal, montana pbs director of education nikki vradenburg said. chief operator paul heitt-rennie estimated most households have tuned into the learn at home program. he said nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going, vradenburg said.\n\nnebraska\n\nomaha: restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. the omaha world-herald reports the nebraska restaurant association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. the waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. this is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said zoe olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. the proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. but the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. when you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said chris wagner, executive director of project extra mile, an omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.\n\nnevada\n\nlas vegas: community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state's diverse communities and reach out in spanish and other languages as nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. erika marquez, a university of nevada, las vegas public health professor and vice chair of the nevada minority health & equity coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. we had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time, marquez told the las vegas sun. nevada is a diverse state with a 29% latino population that includes native spanish speakers. nevada also has a fast-growing group of asian american and pacific islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than english at home, according to data shared by asian and pacific islander american vote. marquez's coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in english, spanish, vietnamese, korean, chinese and thai.\n\nnew hampshire\n\nconcord: the state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run covid-19 vaccination sites when it moves to phase 2. perry plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. he told wmur-tv the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. we expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we're ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the state of new hampshire as quickly as possible, plummer said. the first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. the second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. as of friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.\n\nnew jersey\n\ntrenton: more than 70% of the state's supply of covid-19 vaccine had not been used as of thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. of the 265,000 doses of the pfizer and moderna vaccines that have been delivered to new jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by thursday afternoon. despite months of planning, state officials said wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. remember, you need health care workers to do this, gov. phil murphy said at a briefing. i'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. the slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 new jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. state health commissioner judy persichilli said the rollout of the moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before christmas. persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of pfizer doses had been administered as of wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that i've seen nationally.\n\nnew mexico\n\nalbuquerque: more than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. that's about half of the companies that applied, the albuquerque journal reports. the number (of applications) that we couldn't fund was very hard for us, said marquita russel, ceo of the new mexico finance authority, the state agency that administered the program. the state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by new mexico lawmakers. the program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. about $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state's four largest cities. russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. in all, 6,530 applications were funded. russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.\n\nnew york\n\nnew york: the new york city sheriff's department shut down a series of illegal new year's eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced friday. more than 300 people gathered thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th street in queens, the department said on twitter. five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. deputies also raided an illegal gathering on prince street in soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. four people were charged with multiple offenses. the patrons were not wearing masks in the venue's overcrowded sixth floor. deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at stars hall in the sunset park section of brooklyn. the organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.\n\nnorth carolina\n\nraleigh: covid-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. the news & observer of raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with covid-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state's hospitals. two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. that's a difference of 793 people. on friday, the last day for which data is available, the state's health department says 13.6% of covid-19 tests came back positive. that brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least april. the average is seen as giving a better indication of covid-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. every day since christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including thursday's record-high 15.5%.\n\nnorth dakota\n\nfort yates: the standing rock sioux tribe is prioritizing the distribution of covid-19 vaccines to those who speak dakota and lakota languages. standing rock tribal chairman mike faith told kxmb-tv the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. it's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. we don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. that's why it's so important, faith said. the standing rock reservation straddles the north dakota and south dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in north dakota. faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the fort yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. in addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. tribal health director margaret gates said the lakota and dakota speakers are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.\n\nohio\n\ncolumbus: as gov. mike dewine applies pressure to get covid-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. in some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. this is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. this is a whole different operation, said dr. andy thomas, chief clinical officer at ohio state university's wexner medical center. on wednesday, dewine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.\n\noklahoma\n\noklahoma city: the state has reported more than 1,000 new covid-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said saturday. the oklahoma state department of health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. there were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in oklahoma on new year's day, according to the department. the state's record was set last monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in oklahoma hospitals. over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from johns hopkins university.\n\noregon\n\nportland: a health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the moderna covid-19 vaccine, according to the oregon health authority. the worker, an employee at wallowa memorial hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late thursday. the health authority said vaccines for covid-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. the centers for disease control and prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a covid-19 vaccine, health officials said in a press release. an allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or epipen, or if they must go to the hospital. health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the covid-19 vaccines.\n\npennsylvania\n\nphiladelphia: scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south philadelphia stomping grounds for a new year's celebration of mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd street in south philadelphia on friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. some wore masks, but many did not. mayor jim kenney announced in july that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. some mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. city spokeswoman lauren cox said there were no major issues friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. she urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.\n\nrhode island\n\nprovidence: the first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot saturday. dr. christian arbelaez, an emergency room physician at rhode island hospital in providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the providence journal reports. the moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after christmas and new year's day. it's this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone? arbelaez said. do we have capacity? do we have front-line workers well enough? those are all the things that worry me. more than 20,500 people have received their first shots in rhode island, according to state health officials.\n\nsouth carolina\n\ncolumbia: nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. the state department of administration announced wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. the grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. the state had to turn down another several million dollars' worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. the volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. that delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, frank knapp, president of the state's small business chamber of commerce, told the post and courier. the monies were allocated by the legislature in september to spend federal covid-19 aid for south carolina. the state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\nsouth dakota\n\nsioux falls: a federal judge says a state court can't use the covid-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a codington county trial. u.s. district judge charles b. kornmann also criticized south dakota's response to the pandemic, saying it has done little, if anything, to mitigate the spread of covid-19. kornmann ordered that unless the codington county state court resolves matthew kurtenbach's may 2019 case by jan. 15, kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. south dakota cannot 'take advantage' of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials, the judge wrote. kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. at one point, kornmann directly criticized gov. kristi noem's actions during the pandemic. the governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. she has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading, the judge wrote.\n\ntennessee\n\nmemphis: the shelby county health department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said saturday. the health department started vaccinating first responders with the moderna vaccine dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson joan carr. doug mcgowen, chief operating officer for the city of memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the shelby county community, and it's going to take a while to get all of those individuals vaccinated. some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. as of saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department's two drive-thru centers had been filled. the health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass covid-19 testing sites.\n\ntexas\n\ndallas: coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. texas reported 12,319 covid-19 patients in hospitals saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. but even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. intensive care units in several parts of texas were full or nearly full, with 626 icu beds available statewide saturday, according to the texas department of state health services. the department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of covid-19 and 487 probable cases. the actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in texas came back positive, according to data from johns hopkins university.\n\nutah\n\nsalt lake city: less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of covid-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, deseret news reports. the initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said rich lakin, immunization program director with the utah department of health. we hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson tom hudachko said thursday. more than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. what's making the difference, hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. in davis county, a mass drive-thru clinic at the legacy events center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. at long-term care facilities, cvs and walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.\n\nvermont\n\nstamford: the town has voted to overturn in its community gov. phil scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the covid-19 pandemic. the select board of the town of about 800 people along the massachusetts border voted 3-2 tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. the three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. select board member daniel potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. he asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. potvin said friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.\n\nvirginia\n\nrichmond: state sen. ben chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, senate republicans said friday. chafin represented southwest virginia and was from russell county. a republican, he was first elected to the house of delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state senate in 2014. he was 60. lawmakers from around the state mourned chafin's death late friday. i knew ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in moccasin valley, working the land just as generations of his family had

fine from the u.s. food and drug administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. owner randy kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in april. the family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the columbian reports. all distillers that made hand sanitizer during the covid-19 pandemic were facing the fine. the department of health & human services on thursday announced it was directing the fda not to enforce the fine after the fda received heavy backlash on social media. small businesses who stepped up to fight covid-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so, the department of health & human services said on twitter. kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. if the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. i'd just have to lock the door and walk away, he said.\n\nwest

of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the aurora medical center grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. a pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be useless to those who received them. on dec. 26, aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. after further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. on wednesday, aurora notified grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. the pharmacist was arrested thursday. the fbi and the u.s. food and drug administration were also investigating, police said. jeff bahr, president of aurora health care medical

for anyone, he said. we are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state's schools and businesses to continue to remain

words scaled by the frequency that president trump has used them in tweets during his term in office, according to the trump twitter archive.\n\nwashington — president donald trump spent much of the 2020 presidential campaign insisting that he could only lose if the election was rigged against him, and he has spent nearly every day since his defeat claiming his dire predictions of fraud had come to pass.\n\nbut just as he cried foul before a single vote was cast – something he also did in 2016 – trump has maintained he was robbed of victory without any credible evidence to support that belief.\n\ndespite assurances from his own departments of justice and homeland security that no serious fraud occurred, trump has raged against the election result and mounted a relentless campaign to reverse president-elect joe biden's 306-232 electoral college win.\n\nmore: congress' count of electoral college votes could be most contentious in 144 years. here are past dramatic moments\n\nthe president, his lawyers and his allies have filed scores of lawsuits; made repeated allegations of election fraud in news and social media; organized protests; tried to convince state legislatures to take action; and held hearings in various state houses, hotel ballrooms and, at one point, a landscaping company. and on wednesday, 13 senators and more than 100 republican lawmakers plan to object to the certification of biden's win when congress meets in a joint session.\n\nall those efforts to overturn the election can be a bit dizzying, so usa today has broken it down by the numbers to help make sense of it all.\n\nelection lawsuits: 62\n\nthe president and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to overturn election results in states the president lost, according to marc elias, a democratic election lawyer who is tracking the outcomes.\n\nelection lawsuit defeats: 61\n\nout of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential election, 61 have failed, according to elias.\n\nsome cases were dismissed for lack of standing and others based on the merits of the voter fraud allegations. the decisions have came from both democratic-appointed and republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by trump.\n\nmore: 'it really is over now': the 24 hours that likely thwarted trump's effort to overturn the election\n\nstate supreme courts in arizona, nevada and arizona each rejected or declined to hear trump's appeals to overturn results in those states, while the pennsylvania and michigan supreme courts denied multiple lawsuits.\n\nthe 60th and 61st losses came in recent days.\n\nlast friday, a trump-appointed federal judge in texas dismissed a lawsuit from rep. louie gohmert, r-texas, that argued vice president mike pence has the conditional power to decide which states' electoral college votes to count.\n\nmore: a look at what several state supreme courts said about rejecting attempts to overturn biden's election win\n\non monday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by voters in wisconsin, pennsylvania, georgia, michigan and arizona that argued state legislatures should have met after the election to certify votes.\n\nthe lone victory for the trump team was a small one. a pennsylvania judge sided with the trump campaign, ruling that voters could not go back and cure their ballots if they failed to provide proper identification three days after the election. the ruling affected few votes and did not change the outcome in pennsylvania, which biden won by 81,660 votes.\n\nnumber of contested states: 6\n\nthe vast majority of the lawsuits were in six pivotal battleground states that biden won: arizona, georgia, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin.\n\ntrump won five of the states four years ago in his victory over hillary clinton, but biden flipped each to the democratic column.\n\nhouse republicans who plan to object to electoral college results wednesday said they plan to target these same six states.\n\nnumber of times the us supreme court sided against trump: 2\n\nthe u.s. supreme court twice refused to take up trump-endorsed lawsuits that sought to overturn the results of the nov. 3 election.\n\nin a one-sentence denial, the supreme court on dec. 8 rejected a request from pennsylvania republicans that sought to overturn biden's win in the state. the challenge, led rep. mike kelly, r-pa., claimed that the republican-led state legislature's expansion of absentee voting violated the state's constitution.\n\nthree days later, the supreme court refused to let texas challenge the election results in four battleground states critical to trump's defeat. the court said texas did not demonstrate a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections.\n\nnumber of recounts: 3\n\ngeorgia held two recounts of its presidential election results, both reaffirming biden's win in the state. wisconsin had one recount that confirmed biden's victory there.\n\nthe first recount in georgia – a hand recount ordered by the state – found biden won by 12,284 votes, a narrower margin than the 14,196-vote lead he held immediately following the election. local election administrators identified uncounted ballots in four counties. each was the result of human error.\n\nthe second recount in georgia – one requested by the trump campaign – narrowed biden's victory to 11,779 votes\n\nvotes trump gained from recounts: 2,343\n\nin wisconsin, biden gained 74 votes following a partial recount of the state's results that focused only on two democratic strongholds, milwaukee and dane counties. it increased biden's statewide margin to 20,682 votes out of about 3 million cast.\n\nadding the differences in both states together, trump gained 2,343 votes as a result of the georgia and wisconsin recounts.\n\nnumber of elections trump has claimed were rigged: at least 6\n\nthis is not the first time trump has declared an election had been rigged or stolen.\n\non election day in 2012, when president barack obama defeated his republican challenger mitt romney, trump tweeted that there were reports of voting machines switching romney votes to obama.\n\npay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen, he said.\n\nfour years later, when sen. ted cruz, r-texas, defeated trump in the iowa caucuses, trump tweeted, ted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad!\n\nted cruz didn't win iowa, he stole it. that is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. bad! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 3, 2016\n\ntrump also said the 2016 democratic primary was rigged against sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and, as in 2020, he declared the 2016 general election race was rigged against him before it even took place. even after winning the election and being sworn in as president, trump baselessly insisted more than 3 million illegal votes were cast against him. a white house commission trump created to investigate election fraud disbanded without finding any evidence to support the president's claims.\n\ntrump went on to allege fraud in the 2018 midterm elections and to imply there was something nefarious about the late changing vote totals in tight races, though such changes are routine in close elections where projections cannot be made immediately.\n\njust out — in arizona, signatures don't match. electoral corruption - call for a new election? we must protect our democracy! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) november 9, 2018\n\nthe president also declared in 2020, without evidence, that the democratic primary had once again been rigged against sanders.\n\nnumber of electoral votes changed as the result of trump's effort: 0\n\ndespite all the lawsuits, recounts and false voter fraud allegations, the electoral college on dec. 14 elected biden the next president by a margin of 306 to 232 – marking no change in the electoral outcome.\n\nbiden finished with a record 81,281,502 votes nationally, defeating trump in the popular vote by a sizable 7 million votes.\n\nwith 51.3% of the national popular vote, biden won with the highest share of the vote for a challenger of an incumbent president since franklin d. roosevelt in 1932. trump won 46.8% of the vote nationally.\n\ndays until biden's inauguration\n\nwednesday's joint session of congress will have procedural fireworks as 13 u.s. senators and more than 100 republican house members plan to object to electoral votes from potentially six battleground states that biden won.\n\nbut the efforts are doomed to fail, lacking the votes in the democratic-controlled house and even in the republican-led senate. because each objection could lead to hours of debate in the house and senate, the session could be a marathon.\n\nbut in the end, biden and harris will be inaugurated as the next president and vice president at noon on jan. 20.
ap\n\nnew york (ap) — the sales pitch from the jets to prospective head coaching candidates begins with sam darnold.\n\neverything else is a distant second.\n\nsure, being in the new york/new jersey area is an obvious attraction, and jets chairman and ceo christopher johnson spun his own take on a classic line by saying earlier this week that if you succeed in the big apple, you're a freaking legend.\n\nbut it's hard to even get close to that status without a franchise quarterback. a quick look through jets history is all it takes to prove that. it's broadway joe — and a 50-year wait for a super bowl return. and counting.\n\ndarnold, though, provides promise for frustrated fans that he might be the one. he's a 21-year-old, redheaded symbol of hope in a smart, athletic and still-developing quarterback who has his sights firmly set on being great.\n\nthat's what will excite coaching candidates and free agents the most, with the fact the jets and general manager mike maccagnan have about $100 million in salary cap space to play with this offseason and the no. 3 overall draft pick an added bonus.\n\nnow we're going to be able to build with sam, johnson said, build around sam and with some great players we have on this team already.\n\nthe jets' brass was in kansas city on wednesday to kick off the team's interviews, sitting down with chiefs offensive coordinator eric bieniemy. new york is also expected to schedule meetings with the likes of former green bay coach mike mccarthy, tampa bay offensive coordinator todd monken, dallas passing game coordinator/defensive backs coach kris richard, former detroit and indianapolis coach jim caldwell and usc offensive coordinator kliff kingsbury.\n\nwhoever is hired as todd bowles' replacement will report directly to johnson and not maccagnan, a structure the owner believes works. maccagnan will have a major say in the hire, though, working closely with johnson and vp of player development brian heimerdinger to find the coach who will attempt to end the team's eight-year postseason drought.\n\nand, with darnold leading the way.\n\nthe person doesn't have to be an offensive- or defensive-minded coach, per se, maccagnan said. but we definitely want to make sure they have a plan in place to develop our young quarterback in sam darnold.\n\ndarnold had an up-and-down rookie season after being drafted with the no. 3 overall pick. he was the second quarterback selected, two spots after baker mayfield went to cleveland — which is looking for a coach of its own and also has a potential face of the franchise as a major selling point.\n\nthe final stats for darnold are mediocre, at best: 2,865 yards, 57.7 percent completion rate, 17 touchdowns, 15 interceptions, 77.6 quarterback rating in 13 games. but, it's the way he finished that has the organization feeling so good.\n\nin the four games after returning from a foot injury that sidelined him for three contests, darnold was 80 of 125 (64 percent) for 931 yards and six touchdowns with one int. he showed clear improvement in his ability to see the field, read defenses, be smart with the football and wasn't as skittish behind an offensive line that struggled mightily early in the season.\n\ni thought in the beginning of the year, i took a while to get comfortable and then once i got comfortable in the offense and how things were, i felt very confident when i was out there, darnold said. again, just going to keep growing and keep trying to make those strides and watch the tape. see how i can get better and move forward from there.\n\ndarnold won't have a direct role in the decision-making process, but hoped to chat with management to share his perspective on the situation. and, the jets are planning to give him some preliminary face-time with the man who might be his coach.\n\ngiven the opportunity, i'd like the potential head coaches that come through here to have a chance to spend a little time with him just so they get a feel for sam, maccagnan said. i do think that's actually one of the attractive parts of our job is that we have some good, young players. again, we still have things we need to do and improve upon, but we have a lot of salary cap space. we have our draft picks and the idea of potentially working with a young quarterback like sam is an attractive thing.\n\ndarnold isn't concerned about the potential changes that coincide with the arrival of a new coach. he can adapt, he insisted, and simply wants to win.\n\ni'm confident that whatever offense is here and whoever the coordinator is, whether it's the head coach or an offensive coordinator, darnold said, i'm confident in my ability to be able to run an offense and lead that way.\n\nthe jets' final pick will be linked with darnold moving forward — and maybe for many years. the young quarterback would like this to be the last coaching change of his nfl career.\n\nyou always want someone to come in here and provide stability and hopefully we can win a lot of games together, darnold said. that's always the goal.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nfl: https://apnews.com/nfl and https://twitter.com/ap_nfl

of office during inauguration ceremony on june 6, 2019, at the orpheum theatre in phoenix, ariz. rob schumacher/the republic\n\nleer en español\n\nthe usa today network launched a series on the latino community in the u.s. called hecho en usa, or made in america. roughly 80% of all latinos living in the u.s. are american citizens. but media coverage of hispanics tends to focus on immigration and crime, instead of how latino families live, work and learn in their hometowns. hecho en usa tells the stories of the nation's 59.9 million latinos – a growing economic and cultural force, many of whom are increasingly born in the united states.\n\nphoenix – inside a banquet hall at the corona ranch and rodeo grounds, tired couples and little girls with long braids dance to the easy sway of ranchera music.\n\nelection day has turned into a sweaty-hot may night in phoenix, and carlos garcia, the candidate everyone is here for, is waiting for the votes to be tallied. standing under a puffy mulberry tree, he's listening to campaign supporters swap stories and nursing his beer.\n\nthe historic race is still too close to call.\n\nif elected, garcia, a longtime human-rights activist, will become the first mexican immigrant to serve on the phoenix city council. he'll represent the fifth-largest and fastest-growing city in the nation. he'll lead a latino-majority district once known as the segregated part of town where latinos and black families in phoenix could own businesses and homes.\n\nas if to ease nerves, garcia directs the people crowded around him to a woman whose coal-black hair whispers against her shiny hoop earrings. she's holding a piggy bank the size of a mango. it's stamped: carlos for phoenix council district 8.\n\ntell them about the piggy bank, garcia says, nodding at jacinta gonzalez.\n\nin 2016, garcia, gonzalez and other protesters set out to block a road leading to a donald trump campaign rally outside phoenix. gonzalez was arrested – by deputies of then-sheriff joe arpaio, famous for being known as america's toughest sheriff and for being held in criminal contempt of court for ignoring a federal judge's order to stop racially profiling latinos.\n\nafter deputies questioned gonzalez about her citizenship, she sued and won a settlement. and she turned that money into something garcia desperately needed, the thing many rising latino candidates lack: campaign funding.\n\nwe don't have access to big donors, we don't have access to corporations that are going to invest in his type of leadership, so we have to find other ways to support, she says. and so sometimes that's litigation, sometimes that's fundraisers, sometimes that's car washes. we do whatever we're able to do, because we need hope and we need the belief that we can actually do things differently. and we can change the culture of how people get to office and what people do when they're there.\n\njacinta gonzalez locks her neck to a vehicle blocking the principal route of a rally for president donald trump in phoenix. lucy sandoval/puente arizona.\n\ndespite the nation's ballooning hispanic population, latinos running and winning political offices across the u.s. are too often an anomaly. even in hispanic-majority districts, latinos don't run or win elections at the rates of their white counterparts, various studies show. now, candidates such as garcia – and his supporters – are looking to change that.\n\nnationally, there are an estimated 58.9 million latinos, making up about 18.1% of the u.s. population and accounting for the nation's second-largest ethnic group, after whites. yet only about 6,700 elected officials are latino, according to a 2018 analysis by the national association of latino elected and appointed officials, or naleo. that amounts to a political representation rate of 1.2% in local, state and federal elected offices.\n\nwhen garcia made his campaign public, most people didn't expect him to win, and not just because of his anti-establishment background. statistics are stacked against outsider latino candidates as much as they are traditional ones.\n\nbut ahead of the 2020 presidential elections, latinos across the u.s. have rallied against policies and rhetoric they feel target their community and are working to build momentum. political activists are recruiting latinx candidates to run in local and federal contests and aiming to win.\n\nlatinos will need more than passion to reach political equity, said angela ocampo, a university of michigan political science professor. indeed, if latinos continue to be elected at the same rate as they have in recent years, it will likely be more than 50 years before parity is reached, she said.\n\nit's going to take a very long time, ocampo said. it's even worse when we look at gender, at latina representation.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., listens as facebook ceo mark zuckerberg testifies before the house financial services committee in october. jack gruber, usa today\n\nmore latinos running for political office\n\nin recent months, latinos have been courted to run for congressional seats in texas, colorado and new mexico. at the local level, regina romero was elected in early november as the first female mayor of tucson, arizona's second-largest city, making her the only latina mayor in the 50 largest cities in the u.s. in 2018, democrat michelle luján grisham, a 12th-generation new mexican, was elected as the first latina democratic governor of new mexico. she replaced susana martinez, a latina republican.\n\nsome political analysts are calling it the trump effect, a backlash against political rhetoric and measures they believe harm latinos, migrants and people of color. ahead of 2020 white house and congressional races, that phenomenon could favor democrats, who historically garner more support from latino voters.\n\nbut for decades, latino candidates like democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york or garcia have received sparse support from mainstream political machines.\n\nlike garcia, ocasio-cortez, a self-identified democratic socialist, built her campaign around community support that few establishment politicos saw coming. the 29-year-old, born in the bronx, was working in a bar to support her family before she was elected in 2018, becoming the youngest woman in congress.\n\nocasio-cortez's ethnicity stands out. there were only four latino u.s. senators and 34 u.s. representatives as of january 2018, according to naleo. that number increased slightly after the 2018 election when voters sent four additional latino members to the house and made the 116th congress the most representative of latinos in history. still, that's just a fraction of the nation's 100 senators and 435 representatives.\n\nanalysts point to varied reasons for the disparity, including policies that suppress the latino vote and political funding systems that benefit candidates perceived as viable winners, which in many cases are white people picked by top republican and democratic party leaders.\n\nthese parties and their donors, they're very influential, but in many cases, latinos are receiving limited support from the important actors as they're trying to launch their campaign, ocampo said.\n\nocampo analyzed congressional races in latino-majority districts. she found that even with the majority-minority advantage, electoral success falters. for example, latinos are the largest ethnic group in california (40%) but make up only 24% of the california legislature, according to a 2018 ocampo study.\n\nand in new york, where latinos make up about 19% of the population, there are only 20 latino state legislators, accounting for about 9% of all new york state lawmakers.\n\nthe outlook for latina lawmakers is especially bleak, ocampo said. of the 6,749 elected latino office-holders across local, state and federal levels, only 2,485 were women.\n\nthe highest rate of parity by latino political representation is in florida and new mexico. new mexico has the nation's highest percentage of the latino population at 48.8%. in florida, the state with the sixth-largest latino population, latinos represent 26.1% of the population, according to 2018 u.s. census data. but the state's estimated 4.8 million latinos in florida have benefited from decades of political activism in cuban, puerto rican, venezuelan and other hispanic communities largely in miami that has resulted in an unusual number of hispanic lawmakers holding local and statewide offices.\n\ndata shows that when candidates of color run, their races draw more voters of color to elections, and those voters are more likely to vote for a candidate from their own racial or ethnic background, said matt barreto, a university of california, los angeles, professor of political science and chicana/o studies and co-founder of latino decisions, a political research firm.\n\nu.s. rep.

being recruited, they are not being sought out by the democratic party or the republican party, he said.\n\nthe latino vote isn't monolithic, but the growing demographic can wield power in competitive races won by the margins.\n\nmark lopez, a pew demographer, noted that while latinos tend to vote at a higher rate for democratic candidates, there's a significant conservative latino voting bloc. he points to the 2004 election when former president george bush captured an estimated 45% of the latino vote. roughly 29% of latinos voted for trump in 2016 after he launched his campaign by calling mexicans rapists.\n\nin the closely watched texas senate race in 2018, ted cruz won over beto o'rourke. cruz, the incumbent, repeatedly pointed out to voters that he was the son of a cuban immigrant and that o'rourke was not hispanic. cruz ultimately captured 50.9% of the vote in the tightest u.s. senate race in texas since 1978. o'rourke, who also targeted his campaign to appeal to latinos, captured 64% of the hispanic vote.\n\nu.s. sen. marco rubio of florida speaks during the 75th general assembly of the inter american press association (iapa), in coral gables, florida, oct. 6, 2019.

chairs the congressional hispanic caucus, it's simple: either you have a voice on issues that affect you, your family and your community, or others make those decisions for you.\n\nby next year, hispanics are expected to become the largest ethnic minority voting group to be eligible to vote in a presidential election, according to a study of the 2020 electorate released earlier this year by the pew research center. in all, 32 million latinos will be eligible to vote compared with 30 million voters who are black. it would mark the first federal election where hispanic voters outnumber black voters.\n\ncastro said latinos have made great strides since the civil rights era in the 1960s, when latinos battling discrimination formed the chicano movement to fight for the rights of mexican americans.\n\nit was a community that was marginalized, and in some places, repressed, he said. when my grandmother came to texas, there were signs that said, no dogs, mexicans or negroes allowed.\n\n​former democratic presidential candidate and former hud secretary julián castro speaks at the liberty and justice celebration at the wells fargo arena on nov. 01, 2019, in des moines, iowa. scott olson, getty images\n\ncastro and his brother, former presidential candidate julián castro, grew up in san antonio, a city where latino politicians run and win. their mother, rosie castro, was a chicana activist who in the 1970s joined la raza unida, a third-political party seeking to engage latinos in politics.\n\ncastro said he and his brother entered politics because they grew up watching latinos raise their voices as activists and successfully run for office. in 1992, san antonio-born henry bonilla was the first hispanic republican from texas elected to congress. and in 1981, henry cisneros became one of the first latino mayors in the u.s. when he was elected by san antonio voters. san antonio had not had a latino mayor since the 1800s, before texas became a state. later, cisneros was appointed by former president bill clinton as u.s. secretary of housing and urban development.\n\nhenry cisneros inspired a lot of young people, i think you see that often times, when there's a first in the community who runs for something, castro said. the turnout rate for the hispanic community was astronomical during cisneros' election.\n\ncastro's brother, julián castro, was the only latino in the 2020 presidential race before he dropped out last week.\n\ni think for a community that for many years had been marginalized and left out of politics, to now see someone from the community running for the highest office in the nation is important, joaquin castro said in an interview before his brother exited the campaign.\n\njulián castro has always embraced his mexican immigrant roots. he followed in cisneros' footsteps to become mayor of san antonio in 2009. but a recent poll by telemundo noticias showed he lagged in latino voter support compared with other democratic presidential hopefuls. the november poll showed castro in a three-way tie for fourth place among latino voters, with only 2% support, while joe biden and bernie sanders are leading the candidates among those voters, with 26% and 18%, respectively.\n\nshow caption hide caption latino voters carry signs that read unite the vote as they are serenaded by mariachis on their way to their

needed more latino voices, said barreto, of ucla. that issue was so consequential at the time. it was a bill that was going to affect the lives of more than 10 million undocumented immigrants, many of them latino.\n\nsome political analysts say the lingering effects of failed action helped spur today's hardline immigration policies and public divide over nationalism and migrant's rights.\n\nbut barreto said lagging representation goes deeper than immigration issues.\n\nevery bill matters, he said. there's a latino angle to education reform, economic policies, health care.\n\nthese aren't white issues, these are everyone's issues, he added. black, latino, asian communities, we should all be equally represented. that's what we should expect in a healthy democracy.\n\nand the latino vote is only poised to become more influential. latinos represent the greatest number of americans under 18, at 18.3 million, according to a 2018 pew report.\n\ngrassroots groups and larger ones like the latino vote project have launched massive voter-registration drives in recent election cycles. latino voter turnout in 2018, at 40%, reached a record high, increasing from 6.8 million in 2014 to 11.7 million. that's the second-largest turnout among latinos of any election year, presidential or midterm.\n\nlopez, the pew researcher, said latinos may be motivated to protect their rights and place in the u.s. about half of latinos surveyed said their standing in the nation had worsened in 2018, compared with 32% who said the same in the weeks after trump won the 2016 presidential election, according to a pew report.\n\nan estimated 55% of latinos said they were worried that a family member or friend could be deported, and two-thirds said the trump administration's policies had been harmful to latinos. that's up from similar feelings about barack obama, at 15% in 2010, and george w. bush, at 41% in 2007.\n\nmany experienced some kind of discrimination event, like being told not to speak spanish, lopez said. their lives have changed in a somewhat negative way in the last few years, primarily, since the election of donald trump.\n\ncouncilman carlos garcia (right) makes a point as the phoenix city council conducts a meeting at the orpheum theatre in downtown phoenix, july 2, 2019. councilman sal dicicio listens (left). tom tingle/the republic\n\nfrom protesting the government to running for elected office\n\nin many ways, garcia had already taken his place in history long before election night in arizona.\n\nyears before his election day party, while attorneys for arizona and civil rights groups were battling over senate bill 1070 – the state's notorious show me your papers law – garcia and other protesters stood outside the phoenix courthouse under the brutal july sun blocking the intersection. when police officers moved in to make arrests, garcia was in the middle, wearing a white t-shirt with the words we will not comply.\n\nafter trump was elected, he traveled to arizona in 2017 for a speech in downtown phoenix. garcia joined hundreds of people protesting the president's visit in the wake of a rally in charlottesville, virginia, that turned deadly when a white nationalist drove his car into a crowd of demonstrators. the mostly peaceful protest outside the phoenix convention center turned chaotic when police used tear gas and stun grenades on the crowd.\n\nhundreds of people later attended a phoenix city council meeting demanding officials hold police accountable. by then, trump had pardoned arpaio for the contempt conviction, further roiling many in the crowd.\n\nthe phoenix law enforcement association wrote a facebook post on candidate carlos garcia. via facebook\n\ngarcia stood before officials in a blue t-shirt that read not one more deportation. he told council members the community would hold them accountable.\n\nto think that we spent three-quarters of a million dollars for this person, this president, to come spew hatred and bigotry, to come spit in our face and pardon the sheriff who was convicted, garcia said. the city paid for a campaign rally. we have an opportunity to ... do this and to stand up for not only phoenix but cities across the country.\n\ntwo years later, the mexican immigrant's face was plastered on campaign ads across south phoenix where garcia lives in a community with deep latino roots. in the photo, garcia wore a familiar cornflower blue traditional mexican guayabera shirt, his baby girl on his shoulders and his wife, a teacher, and his son standing in front of him.\n\nnew

of a saguaro-studded mountain.\n\ngonzalez and her piggy bank the size of a mango still have the floor. earlier in the evening, garcia called her onstage, named her the campaign's no. 1 donor and gave her the memento.\n\ncarlos has been on the front lines – organizing, fighting against sb 1070, fighting against joe arpaio, she says, her eyes filling with tears. it's actually been a great joy of mine to be able to use the same money that came from arpaio, the same money that came from the state's incarceration system, to actually support his run for city council.\n\nlike this story? subscribe to support journalism like this every day.\n\nas the desert night fades, danny ortega, a phoenix attorney who has fought for civil rights since the chicano movement, leans against a wood-carved bar watching garcia mingle with campaign supporters. ortega says young and old latinos backed garcia because they saw a candidate who looked like them, cared about them and sacrificed for them.\n\nfor too long, we lost our way, ortega says, standing with his longtime friend alfredo gutierrez, who served for 14 years in the arizona legislature and has protested with garcia. too many latinos thought they had to act white to win. now, they're seeing the power in our own identity.\n\ngarcia moves closer to a grove of old trees, where it's quiet. he says it's justice that money won from a lawman who targeted his family and community, would help him overcome the campaign financing barrier most latinos face when they run for office.\n\ni've had six people in my family that have been deported, i grew up undocumented. and i hold that truth, he says, shaking his head. i grew up working class. i'm a single child of a single parent. and with my mom's strength, that she was able to raise me, that she was able to succeed in this country and make sure that i got through school, went to college, i've been able to help my community for the last 16 years.\n\nby the night's final vote tally, garcia holds a slim two-point margin. as his supporters leave the plaza, no one knows if garcia's lead will hold.\n\nin the morning, the final election results are in. garcia is at home with his family. with six words on his facebook page, he says what everyone who supported the outsider latino candidate – despite the odds – is waiting to hear: we got it! thank you all!\n\nhe wins the race with 51.47% of the vote. by 384 votes, garcia, and the community who voted for him, has made history.\n\nhelp support quality journalism like this. subscribe! get news and insights sent to your inbox. sign up for

matthew frankel\n\nthe motley fool\n\nyou haven't even filed your 2016 tax return yet, so it may seem a bit early to think about your 2017 taxes. however, smart tax planning is a year-round activity – not just something you do when you prepare your return. in that spirit, here are five things you could do in 2017 that could reduce your taxes and boost your refund.\n\nget a change of scenery\n\nif you've been toying with the idea of moving to a different area of the country, it may interest you to know that moving expenses are tax deductible if the move is related to the start of a new job.\n\nyou don't even need to have a new job lined up before you move. for your expenses to qualify, the move needs to pass two tests:\n\ntime test: you must work full-time for 39 out of the 52 weeks immediately following the move. in other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break.\n\nyou must work full-time for 39 out of the 52 weeks immediately following the move. in other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break. distance test: according to the irs' wording, your new workplace must be at least 50 miles farther from your old home than your old job location was from your old home. if you had no previous workplace, your new job location must be at least 50 miles from your old home. while this is a bit technical, the point is that your move needs to be sufficiently far away from your old job location to justify the tax break.\n\nif these two tests are satisfied, you can deduct expenses such as driving mileage, packing supplies, shipping costs, hired movers, storage expenses, and lodging expenses on the way to your new home.\n\nthe best part of all is that the moving expenses deduction is an above-the-line deduction, which means that you can take it whether or not you itemize deductions on your tax return.\n\nirs: here's when you can begin filing your 2016 taxes\n\ntake a class\n\nit's well-known that college students may qualify for a tax credit for paying tuition, known as the american opportunity credit. however, this is only good for the first four years of college, and only if a degree or certificate is being pursued.\n\non the other hand, the lesser-known lifetime learning credit doesn't have these restrictions. the credit is worth 20% of up to $10,000 worth of educational expenses, and there is no degree program, credit hour or other requirement. you can take a single class for personal enrichment or to obtain career skills and qualify for this credit. if you take a class that costs $1,000, this credit can give you $200 of that amount back.\n\nthe biggest restriction on the lifetime learning credit is income-related. for the 2017 tax year, the credit phases out for incomes above $55,000 (singles) and $110,000 (married filing jointly), and disappears completely above incomes of $65,000 and $130,000, respectively.\n\nbuy a house\n\nif you have been on the fence about buying a house, the tax benefits could be the motivation you need to finally get into a home of your own.\n\nthere are several lucrative tax breaks available for homeowners, including:\n\nthese trends could affect your money in 2017\n\n1. mortgage interest: you can deduct the interest on up to $1 million worth of mortgages on a first or second home. this is the big one -- if you have a $300,000 mortgage at 4% interest, this deduction can be well over $10,000 per year for the first few years of your mortgage.\n\n2. mortgage insurance: if you have to pay mortgage insurance, which typically happens if you put less than 20% down on your home, this may be tax-deductible as well, subject to income limitations.\n\n3. points: if you paid discount points to get a better interest rate, these are deductible as well.\n\n4. property taxes: the property taxes you pay on your primary residence are deductible. in high-tax states, like new jersey for example, this can be an especially nice tax break.\n\n5. capital gains exclusion: when you eventually sell your home, you can make up to $250,000 ($500,000 for couples) in profit before you have to pay income taxes on your gains.\n\nhere's a more detailed discussion of how buying a home can save you money on your taxes.\n\nbe generous when charities need it most\n\naccording to wallethub, 20% of all charitable donations occur during the last 48 hours of the year. and it would be fair to assume that many more donations happen in the weeks before the end of the year when everyone is in the giving spirit.\n\nthe point is that charitable organizations need money all year round, not just at the end of the year. for 2017, consider giving to charity steadily throughout the year. for example, if you donate to your local animal shelter like i do, consider handing them a donation check in, say, may. of course, they'll appreciate your donations whenever they come, but it could be an especially welcome gift if it comes at a time of limited cash flow.\n\nalso, wouldn't it be easier on your wallet to donate periodically throughout the year, as opposed to trying to cram your donations in at the last minute?\n\nthe skinny about freelance money: how to get comfortable with income, taxes and expenses\n\nhere's a thorough discussion on the rules and documentation requirements for charitable donations to make sure you get to deduct every dollar you donate.\n\nthe best tax break of all\n\nof all the available tax breaks, i tend to look at retirement-related tax breaks as the best of all. as i've written before, not only can saving for retirement boost your tax refund, but it can also help set you up for financial freedom later in life.\n\nif you contribute to a tax-deferred type of retirement account, such as a traditional ira or through a 401(k), 403(b), or 457 plan, your contributions may be tax-deductible. think of it this way – if you contribute $5,000 to a traditional ira and you're in the 25% tax bracket, we're talking about $1,250 in tax savings.\n\non top of this deduction, low- to moderate-income taxpayers may qualify for the saver's credit, which is literally free money just for contributing to a retirement account. this tax credit can be worth up to $1,000 for singles or $2,000 for couples, so it's worth looking into.\n\nthe best part is that you'll be doing your future self a favor. let's say that you contribute the $5,500 maximum to a traditional ira every year for 30 years. you'll end up contributing a total of $165,000, and will most likely save tens of thousands of dollars on your taxes along the way. based on the stock market's historical returns, your account could swell to more than $800,000 in those three decades -- quite a nest egg.\n\ntax-smart strategies for retirement savings\n\nby saving for retirement, you can get a nice tax break now and a retirement nest egg for later. that's why i say it's the best tax break of all.\n\ntry any of our foolish newsletter services free for 30 days. we fools may not all hold the same opinions, but we all believe that

editors\n\nusa today\n\ndemocrats take the house as new congress convenes\n\nthe 116th congress will convene thursday, including a new democratic majority in the house after female candidates spearheaded gains for the party during the 2018 midterms. the presumptive incoming house speaker, nancy pelosi, told usa today in an exclusive interview that president donald trump can expect a different world from his first two years in office. she and her democratic colleagues plan to confront trump on such issues as the deaths of migrant children and the protection of special counsel robert mueller's russia probe. and they will have subpoena power, giving them new leverage in the clashes.\n\ngovernment shutdown: fight for funding takes a new turn\n\nshortly after nancy pelosi returns as house speaker and democrats reclaim the house majority thursday, they will put their new political power to the test by moving to reopen the federal government. democratic leaders have scheduled two votes on a package of bills to end the shutdown and give congress more time to negotiate a deal with the white house over border funding. but the bills still must clear the gop-controlled senate, and majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, has said he won't call for a vote to end the standoff unless president donald trump backs it.\n\napp could change the way we react to earthquakes\n\nlos angeles officials will formally announce a new app for apple and android smartphones thursday that may give residents a few seconds to prepare for an earthquake. similar to an amber alert, shakealertla will give warnings when significant shaking starts nearby, ideally allowing users to get to a safe place. the u.s. geological survey has been developing the alert system for the west coast since 2006, shakealertla says. users will only receive alerts for earthquake and aftershocks over 5.0 magnitude, which are deemed capable of creating damage and affecting public safety.\n\nprefer to listen? check out the 5 things podcast below and subscribe for free on apple podcasts:\n\npga tour begins 2019 with a notable absence\n\nthe sentry tournament of champions begins thursday in hawaii, but tiger woods will not be participating after speculation he could start his 2019 campaign at kapalua. woods has not played the toc since 2005, but will likely begin 2019 at the farmers insurance open on jan. 24 at torrey pines. among the notable players in the field in hawaii are defending champion dustin johnson, 2018 pga player of the year brooks koepka, rory mcilroy, justin thomas and bryson dechambeau.\n\ndidn't get what you want over the holidays? well, you're in luck!\n\nthursday is expected to be the second biggest day for holiday returns which will mean shoppers may face crowds or issues when exchanging or bringing back unwanted gifts. in anticipation for the annual return-a-thon, — ups is expecting returns to hit 1.3 million — retailers also have launched their after-christmas sales. according to the national retail federation's annual december survey, 50 percent of consumers plan to take advantage of after-christmas sales in stores and 45 percent plan to do the same online. if you plan on returning gifts, experts recommend reading store policies and deadlines to avoid post-holiday-gift-return headaches.

'the martian' crew keeping the party down to earth\n\na smiling matt damon entered the party, globe statuette in hand. after wading through a sea of well-wishers, he clinked glasses with his martian director, ridley scott. how will damon commemorate his potato-eating protagonist in the film? maybe i'll get (scott) a potato soufflé or something, said damon. scott's plans after the (many) party stops celebrating his movie's best comedy win were earth-bound. after that, bed, he smiled.\n\n3. jennifer lawrence's smooch\n\nlawrence, best dramatic film actress winner for joy, planted a bright orange kiss on director david o. russell's cheek. i'm gonna keep this lipstick, because of the respect that we were given tonight, he told us on his way into the party. you never know what's going to happen this (awards) season, and it may be all i get. lawrence met up with russell inside the party after a quick-change – she swapped her bright red dior gown for a short black versace dress.\n\nthe 'instyle' party had:\n\n4. photogenic pairs\n\nif there is no photo proof, did you actually attend the globes? everyone was snapping shots inside the instyle bash, which offered stars colorful macarons, a bumping dance floor and a venue bathed in purple lights. vanessa hudgens and boyfriend austin butler waited in line for the photo booth, while today show co-hosts al roker and natalie morales took videos of their entrance into the party. meanwhile, sisters kylie jenner and kourtney kardashian took selfies on a fan's iphone – because she had a cute accent, according to kardashian.\n\nranked: ricky gervais' greatest (and groaniest) golden globe jokes\n\n5.party traffic\n\nthe many globes after-parties are all held inside the beverly hilton, within walking distance from one another, so naturally, the stars like to party hop. on our way to the instyle bash, we saw: duet partners selena gomez and charlie puth power-walking from party-to-party, globe-winner brie larson changing locales after switching shoes (she had on flat jellies) and married couple ian somerhalder and nikki reed holding hands and getting ready to head home.\n\nthe hbo party had:\n\n6. raves for ricky\n\nat the hbo bash, a big star magnet that takes over the hilton's pool area and an adjoining restaurant, gervais got a thumbs up from a guy who knows what it's like to host a big show – brooklyn nine-nine star andy samberg. i loved him. i always love ricky. i'm always going to root for the comedian, though, said samberg, who received critical praise for the job he did at the emmys in september.\n\nsamberg said gervais delivered his trademark, edgy comedy. that's what he does. he doesn't care. he goes for it. he's a very brave comic, said the actor, whose fox series recently moved to tuesday as part of a two-hour comedy block. i think he embodies what comedy is, really about where he'll say the things that chill the room, but then he wins them back with a really great punch line, which is impressive. he doesn't back off anything.\n\namerica ferrera, eva longoria throw the classiest shade at golden globes\n\nwhen a reporter mentioned the ooohs that followed some gervais jokes in the interview room, samberg said, i was saying that. he did a lot of stuff i wouldn't do. the cool thing about gervais is that he genuinely seems not to care. that's when a comedian gets dangerous.\n\n7. khaleesi...and ned stark\n\nat the game of thrones table, there was emilia clarke, who plays khaleesi (a dothraki queen). and at one thrones table, it looked like there was an apparition. could that be ned stark, whose first-season beheading was an early sign of thrones' shocking twists and turns? it wasn't ned, but it was the actor who played him, sean bean.\n\nwhen a reporter told bean he was disappointed that ned got killed so early in the series, the actor replied, me, too. but bean, one of the stars of globes-winning film, the martian, is keeping busy. he finished a run on tnt's legends and he said he plays a centurion in the young messiah, which follows jesus christ at a young age.\n\nricky gervais calls sean penn a snitch over 'el chapo'\n\n8. han solo\n\neven in a room full of stars, harrison ford was a focus of attention at hbo, with partygoers, photographers and even other actors aware of his presence...\n\n9. a happy oyelowo\n\ndenzel washington's lifetime achievement award presentation was a highlight of the evening for david oyelowo, who was nominated for his performance in hbo's nightingale. denzel is my hero. to see him honored is fantastic, said oyelowo, whose a united kingdom and queen of katwe, the latter with lupita nyong'o, are scheduled to hit theaters this year.\n\n10. an uncanny connection\n\nwalton goggins, a star of quentin tarantino's the hateful eight, and tony goldwyn, the president on abc's scandal, shared a bear hug near at the base of the stairs leading into the party. how did they know each other? he directed episodes of justified, said goggins. (although many fans know goldwyn from his acting work, he's often busy behind the scenes directing and producing.) goldwyn marveled at goggins' performance in the tarantino film: isn't he great?\n\nreview: impish gervais pokes fun at globes, and its stars\n\nthe weinstein/netflix party had:\n\n11. a moët vending machine\n\nthat's right, guests could literally deposit a (free) coin to get a (free) mini bottle of moët champagne. we were so enamored we took a video.\n\noh, and there was a laura mercier beauty bar, too. #treats!\n\n10 must-know moments from the golden globes\n\n12. a surge toward katy perry\n\nhalfway through the party katy perry showed up and joined orlando bloom in a corner booth. the party surged in their direction, causing extra security to flank their tables. the two later left with a carful of friends.\n\n13. ricky gervais hamming it up\n\nby the time the globes host joined the bash (around 9:15 p.m.), gervais was ready to relax. to prove it, the comedian hammed it up by cheekily laying atop a banquette (most interesting man in the world-style). nearby, jamie foxx arrived (mini champagne bottle in hand) and promptly took selfies with model jourdan dunn and harvey weinstein. did we mention we saw aziz ansari pulling out his beyonce single ladies moves? because it was epic.\n\n14. helen mirren getting her groove on\n\nlook no further than mirren's cocktail table for the best vibes. that's where morgan freeman was sitting, and when stevie wonder songs came on, the two stars, plus their friends, got up and started getting down. (it only got better when the dj slid into jade's don't walk away.)\n\nricky gervais & mel gibson are the miley cyrus & nicki minaj of the globes\n\n15. costume changes\n\nlike j-law, at the weinstein/netflix bash fashion gals kate bosworth and olivia palermo both changed before they arrived. after her long, sparkly red carpet look, bosworth opted for a second embellished dolce gabbana number (this time featuring trousers). i'm not very good at being at a party in a train. this is a little more party friendly, she told us.\n\nricky gervais zings 'unfaithful' ben affleck at golden globes\n\nthe amazon party had:\n\n16. cool movie news\n\ntransparent actors jeffrey tambor and bradley whitford, both emmy winners, were among the stars attending amazon's party in the beverly hilton's top-floor stardust ballroom, as the streaming service joined other networks and studios hosting post-globes bashes. whitford said he's looking forward to his upcoming film, get out, which also stars catherine keener. key & peele's jordan peele will direct what promises to be an intriguing combination: a horror film that deals with race. i think jordan is one of the most talented people on the planet, whitford said. i can't wait to work with him.\n\nthe universal/nbc/focus features party had:\n\n17. amy and her new man:\n\ntrainwreck star amy schumer held court at a center table with her new boyfriend ben hanisch and her sister kim caramele, along with judd apatow and america ferrara. but come 9 p.m., schumer had enough, she blew a kiss to ferrara across the table and headed for the exit, with kim helping out with her gown's train. as they exited, they passed eva longoria who was posing for pictures with friends of her own.\n\n18. lots of trophies\n\nthere were winners to be had at the party. christian slater clutched his golden globe as he happily hugged longoria and received back-slaps as he sailed through the party. kate winslet dazzled as cameras came to life with her entry. but no one was more appreciative then her steve jobs co-star michael fassbender. he immediately stepped in front of the flashes to bow down, hands upraised, repeatedly to winslet and her new golden globe trophy. the smiling fassbender raised his head up long enough to hug winslet and engage in goofy conversation.\n\n19. typical boyfriend-girlfriend convos\n\nfassbender might not have won a golden globe trophy, but that did not dampen the irish actor's mood. he partied in a private area with girlfriend alicia vikander, who had her parents in tow. fassbender was a picture-taking machine, happily accepting party-goers' requests to pose for selfies. finally, vikander had to lay down the law as she readied to exit the party. michael, come on, she said with a smile. fassbender took a final picture with fans, gave a smiling, gotta go! and exited the party behind vikander.\n\n20. the everlasting eddie redmayne\n\nthe danish girl went home empty-handed from the golden globes. but director tom hooper was happy to party with his stars vikander (along with boyfriend fassbender) and eddie redmayne, who flew in from the set of fantastic beasts and where to find them on sunday afternoon. the jet-lagged redmayne stayed as long as he could at the party before departing. he's got amazing stamina, said hooper.\n\n21. a swift j.lo sighting\n\nhow do you know a party is dying down quickly? when jennifer lopez does a 180-degree entrance. lopez entered hand-in-hand with boyfriend casper smart, causing a string of party-goers to follow the star couple. but as lopez eyed the increasingly-celebrity-free event, she suddenly stopped on a dime, causing a pile-up of followers behind her. she made a sudden turn right and marched straight for a side exit, a security guard lighting up the carpet ahead of her to prevent any stumbles. all told, lopez, who previously hit the instyle party, was at this bash for less than five minutes.\n\n22. a sweet sign off\n\nnine-year-old room star jacob tremblay stayed out past 11:15 p.m., but was wide-eyed as he took final snaps on the empty red carpet before departing. he posed with his parents in front of a golden globe sign to remember the night. tremblay than walked towards the valet line, arm linked with his mother's, starring up at the lights before getting into the family car.
ap\n\ntuscaloosa, ala. (ap) — alabama left tackle cam robinson doesn't think an offensive coordinator change a week ahead of the national championship game will bother the crimson tide.\n\nsteve sarkisian took over the top-ranked tide's offense monday when lane kiffin left a week earlier than expected for his new job as florida atlantic's coach. both kiffin and coach nick saban described the move as a mutual decision, but it left only a week for sarkisian to get the offense ready for the title game against clemson in tampa, florida.\n\nrobinson said the perception outside the program with an offensive coordinator change this close to the national title game might be the world is coming to an end.\n\nbut not here, he said. we just go out and practice and do exactly what we've been doing all year. it's just a new voice. that's it.\n\nsaban said sarkisian knows the offense inside and out, and he's banking on that making for an easy transition for the title game.\n\nsarkisian, a former usc and washington head coach, has been an offensive analyst with the team this season.\n\nthe guy has been with us the whole year, the whole football season, saban said. he knows the offense. he knows the players. he's worked on the game plans every week. he knows the system inside and out, knows the terminology.\n\ni don't have any failsafe. i just feel like i have to make decisions based on what's best for the players to have the best chance to be successful and we made the decision and we're not talking about it anymore. we're moving forward and we're looking forward and everybody is going to do everything they can to support the people that are here now to make it work.\n\nalabama quarterback jalen hurts had just 57 yards passing in a 24-7 semifinal victory over washington, while backup tailback bo scarbrough ran for 180 yards. saban clearly didn't like what he saw in some respects from that offensive performance.\n\nwe had 25 negative plays in the last game so what do you think i saw? he said. we had poor execution, a lot of poor fundamentals. didn't execute well. weren't very consistent.\n\nsaban said he doesn't want to change the offensive philosophy but has other players he wants to get involved in the offense.\n\n___\n\nmore ap college football: www.collegefootball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/ap_top25
ap\n\ndenver (ap) — nikola jokic considers himself a point guard who just so happens to be trapped in a center's 250-pound frame.\n\ni'm telling that to everybody, the denver nuggets standout said. but nobody believes in that except me.\n\nit's as good a description as any for the hard-to-label and even harder-to-stop play of the 7-footer nicknamed joker.\n\nhe doesn't exactly have the most athletic look or leap out of the gym, but he's elevated the western conference-leading nuggets to new heights this season. jokic is in line to become denver's first all-star since carmelo anthony in 2010-11 and is being mentioned in the mvp conversation.\n\njokic shrugs off all the attention. he's just an unassuming big man doing uncommon things on the court so often it's becoming common.\n\na 7-2 magic johnson, knicks coach david fizdale said as he over-inflated jokic's height in comparing him to the los angeles lakers hall of famer. he's as good of a passer as any guard in the league. he can shoot 3s. but his ball handling is something i admire.\n\njokic (pronounced yo-kitch) sees the floor with a point guard's vision, knocks down long-range jumpers with a shooting guard's poise and drives with a big man's mentality. he's earned the respect of san antonio coach gregg popovich, who's spent some time chatting with jokic. popovich appreciates the various levels to the game of the 23-year-old from serbia — enough to even rib him.\n\nhe's kind of pudgy, popovich cracked. he doesn't jump out of the gym. he doesn't run that fast, but he might be one of the smartest players in the league. and he's got skills and he knows how to use them and he enjoys the hell out of himself out there. he's been very important for them, obviously.\n\nat 24-11, the nuggets are tied for their best nba start in franchise history through 35 games with the 1976-77 squad. he's been a big reason why, averaging 18 points, 7.6 assists and 9.9 rebounds.\n\nhis recent play with three starters sidelined by injuries led tnt analyst charles barkley to anoint jokic as a front-runner in the mvp race. his co-hosts didn't exactly agree.\n\nwait, he's not impacting the game? barkley incredulously retorted.\n\nno arguments from the nuggets faithful. the fans serenaded jokic with a chorus of m-v-p after his third triple-double of the season — and 19th of his career — in a win over the knicks on tuesday. he took it in stride.\n\nwhatever they want to do, said jokic, a second-round pick in 2014 who signed a max contract over the summer worth around $147 million for five seasons. but maybe when we're finalists.\n\nreally, he's just a low-key player who in the offseason can be found back home in serbia hanging out with family, friends or his two race horses.\n\nask him about bella marguerite, the newest horse in his stable, and his eyes light up.\n\nshe's scared but calm when the race comes, he recently said. she's a completely different animal. she's fast.\n\nonce the ball goes up, he's a different breed of center.\n\nin some ways an anomaly, dallas mavericks coach rick carlisle said. he doesn't show super athletic ability. he plays the game close to the floor. but it's one of the great things about the nba game, guys like him that have the size and skill and know how to use leverage and angles and their vision and senses can be all-star-caliber players.\n\njokic grew up watching the likes of tim duncan, dirk nowitzki, boris diaw and shaquille o'neal. he's also been studying bill walton and hakeem olajuwon, to name a few.\n\nmixed a little bit of old and new guys, jokic said.\n\nit's hard to pinpoint his best game this season, but this one ranks up there: on oct. 20 against phoenix, when he joined wilt chamberlain as the only nba players to record a 30-point triple-double (35 points, 12 rebounds, 11 assists) while being perfect (11 for 11) from the field.\n\nhe raised his game even higher with starters gary harris, paul millsap and will barton out of the lineup (harris and millsap have recently returned).\n\nhe's always carried the same demeanor, the same swagger, guard monte morris said. nothing's really changed.\n\nthis is something the nuggets hope will change: jokic making the all-star game . not since anthony wore no. 15 in denver — jokic's number now — has a nuggets player suited up in the game.\n\nif he doesn't make it, the great thing about nikola is that it will sting, we all will be upset and hurt by it, but it doesn't get in the way of our team goals, coach michael malone said. he's truly a team player. he cares about the team first. that's why he's a unique young man.\n\nas for jokic's assertion he's really a point guard in a center's frame, malone didn't quite buy it.\n\nhe's just a great player, malone said, trapped in a great player's body.\n\n___\n\nassociated press freelancer raul dominguez in san antonio contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nmore ap nba: https://apnews.com/nba and https://twitter.com/ap_sports
washington – for the past year, federal law enforcement agencies have received tens of thousands of complaints of fraud tied to the coronavirus pandemic. more than 100 cases have been prosecuted, and authorities are expecting this number to rise as states continue to rollout vaccines.\n\nwe've been concerned about fraud schemes regarding the vaccine as soon as the vaccine went from an idea to reality. … the one thing that we've learned throughout this pandemic is that when there's money to be made, criminals will figure out how to do it, said fbi financial crimes section chief steven merrill.\n\nmerrill said he can't say how many complaints the fbi has received regarding vaccine-related fraud or how many have been elevated to criminal investigations. but he said officials have seen instances involving websites advertising fake vaccines.\n\nvaccine:how will i know when it's my turn to get vaccinated against covid-19?\n\nat least one fraud investigation has been made public in new york. the state's attorney general's office is investigating whether a health-care provider in orange county misrepresented itself to state officials to obtain vaccine doses and distributed them to members of the public who aren't on the state's priority list. parcare community health network said in a statement that it is cooperating with investigators.\n\nin late december, gov. andrew cuomo announced that health-care providers who fraudulently obtain vaccines could face up to $1 million in fines and loss of state license. cuomo also said this week that he plans to propose a bill that would impose criminal penalties to medical providers and other entities who sell or give vaccines to those who aren't yet eligible.\n\nfederal prosecutors in maryland also recently seized websites claiming to be biotechnology companies developing treatments for covid-19. authorities said the fake websites used logos of real companies to dupe victims into providing personal information.\n\nbad vendors: hundreds of millions of dollars goes to covid-19 contractors accused of prior fraud\n\nimproper ppp loans:thousands of ppp loans went to small businesses that should not have received them\n\nmerrill said authorities are on the lookout for medical providers asking patients to undergo unnecessary tests and procedures, bad actors seeking personal information from unsuspecting victims in order to fraudulently bill medicare, fraudsters asking people to pay out of pocket to obtain vaccines, and marketing representatives offering wholesale shipments of vaccines in exchange for fees.\n\nwe want to make sure that the public understands that the information they should be getting about the vaccine should not be coming from an advertisement or unsolicited information; it should be coming from an official government website, merrill said.\n\nmost vulnerable to scams are older people who may not be computer savvy and are more likely to have greater concerns about their health and ability to get vaccinated, merrill said.\n\neverybody is worried about putting this pandemic behind us and, as such, the emotion and the nervous energy that people have about this have caused many persons throughout the world to act more on emotion than logic. … i want to make sure that it's clear to the public to please consult with medical professionals before putting what you believe to be a vaccine or any other medicine in your body, merrill said.\n\ncoronavirus updates: 'premature' to change covid-19 vaccine dosing, fda says; new york reports first case of more contagious virus strain\n\nthe united states has more than 21 million confirmed coronavirus cases and over 357,000 deaths, according to john hopkins university data. so far, less than 4.6 million people have received a first dose of the vaccine even though more than 15.4 million have been distributed, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nthe fbi, the drug enforcement administration, the federal trade commission and other agencies have recently sent alerts warning of vaccine-related fraud.\n\nthe justice department has made prosecuting coronavirus-related frauds among its top priorities, charging individuals and companies for submitting fraudulent applications to obtain millions of dollars in government aids and loans for small businesses, hoarding and gouging prices of personal protective equipment, wire fraud and money laundering.\n\nlast month, a cameroon national was accused of selling nonexistent puppies and other animals online as companions for socially isolated victims. authorities said fodje bobga and his co-conspirators charged hundreds of dollars a puppy and claimed the pets would be shipped to victims' homes. they later claimed transportation had been delayed and the unsuspecting purchasers needed to pay extra fees.\n\ncontributing: associated press

is so much divisiveness in our nation…it still tells people that there is hope and we should still be optimistic about the american dream. and it's really not one off. there are so many of us that are walking into congress that really are showing this nation that we are capable of having the american dream realized.\n\nfor her ceremonial swearing-in photo, tlaib put her hand on her koran. she also

when san antonio spurs assistant coach becky hammon took over for ejected head coach gregg popovich last week, she became the first woman to coach an nba team in a regular-season game.\n\nhammon, who is usually reticent on the topic, acknowledged the significance.\n\nobviously, it's a big deal, hammon told reporters after the game dec. 30. it's a substantial moment.\n\nthere's an even bigger moment looming: the day an nba team hires a woman as its head coach.\n\nit's right in front of us. it's going to happen, basketball pioneer nancy lieberman, who was the first woman to coach a g league team, told usa today sports during an interview last year.\n\nshe's not the only believer. toronto raptors president masai ujiri, whose raptors have women in key positions throughout the basketball staff, and richard lapchick, author of the detailed racial and gender report cards for sports leagues, also said it's on the horizon.\n\n'blow to the heart':lakers' lebron james responds to jacob blake ruling\n\ndurant out:expected to miss a week to quarantine after covid-19 exposure\n\nbut how soon? a season? two years? five years? hammon interviewed for the indiana job after last season, but the pacers hired nate bjorkgren.\n\ni would not be surprised if somebody isn't hired for the next season, lapchick told usa today sports in july. but i would certainly think that within a season, for sure.\n\nnba commissioner adam silver said in 2017 that it is on him to ensure that it happens sooner rather than later.\n\nwhen asked what it will take for a team to hire a woman as head coach, popovich gave a typical popovich reply: i'm not the answer man, he said. that depends on people and organizations.\n\nit is a thoughtful response.\n\nthere's no difference between a woman who knows the game and a man who knows the game, popovich said. it's just another prejudice that probably has to be overcome just like a lot of other prejudices in the world become less and less as people pay attention to them.\n\nit's a process, and it doesn't happen quickly but i think the more women there are, obviously it becomes more commonplace and more the rule and it'll depend on organizations realizing there are women who can do this. every woman can't. every man can't.\n\nbut the point is, there's got to be enough to choose from and it's got to become pretty commonplace before i think somebody's going to pull the trigger.\n\nsix female assistant coaches in nba\n\nhammon is one of six female nba assistant coaches with cleveland's lindsay gottlieb, sacramento's lindsey harding, new orleans' teresa weatherspoon, dallas jenny boucek and memphis' sonia raman. los angeles clippers' natalie nakase is listed as player development assistant and is working with franchise's g league team this season. milwaukee's sidney dobner is a video and player development assistant.\n\nthat marks a decline over last season's number of women coaches. niele ivey and kara lawson left nba jobs for top jobs with women's teams. lawson was an assistant coach for the boston celtics, and ivey an assistant for the memphis grizzlies but both took over prominent women's college basketball programs – lawson at duke and ivey at notre dame.\n\nkaren stack umlauf was not retained as a chicago bulls assistant when billy donovan replaced jim boylen, and brittni donaldson moved from an assistant coach with the raptors to the franchise's g league team. it's a strong possibility donaldson returns to the raptors when the pandemic subsides.\n\nnone of the new head coaches this season hired a women's assistant coach, though new orleans' stan van gundy retained weatherspoon.\n\nnba president of league operations byron spruell noted the league in 2019 partnered with the national basketball coaches association to create a deeper and more inclusive pool of coaching candidates.\n\nalong with women, the league is looking at coaches who are people of color. in a league that is 74% black, according to lapchick's most recent study, there were seven black coaches at the start of the 2019-20 season. there are seven this season even though nate mcmillan and doc rivers were not retained. rivers ended up in philadelphia and ty lue took over for rivers with the clippers.\n\nthe league has avoided pushing teams to hire one candidate or another.\n\nthe answer is ultimately yes to should the teams be able to hire who they want, silver said on sept. 30. i don't see a way to operate a league where the league office, the commissioner is dictating to a team who they should or shouldn't hire.\n\nhaving said that, i know we can do better. … we're in discussions with all of those teams about making sure there's a diverse slate of candidates. we've looked at what might be an equivalent to a rooney type rule in the nba, and i'm not sure it makes sense. i'm open-minded if there are other ways to address it.\n\nthe same approach applies to female coaches.\n\nwe want it to happen organically, and when the right opportunity matches the right person, this will happen, spruell said. we just feel we're so well positioned. if it happens tomorrow or the next day or this season or a few seasons away, we're really close. but we're not putting a timetable on it.\n\n'when she speaks we are all ears'\n\njust six years ago, hammon was the only women's assistant, and just three seasons ago, hammon and boucek were the only two. but teams see the value of hiring smart basketball minds regardless of gender, including the growing number of women in front-office roles.\n\nit's something that it's sad we have to talk about it, phoenix suns coach monty williams told usa today sports. we're all coaches. the coaching position has no gender. i've been around ladies who have coached the game. i'm blown away at the concept that we even have to talk about what do we have to do to get them (a head-coaching gig). …\n\ni'm saddened and frustrated on one end because we have to talk about it. at the same time, i'm glad we are.\n\nwhen asked about the topic in july 2019 at the nba's las vegas summer league, hammon said, i've said it before, half the population has not been tapped for their basketball knowledge. it's an untapped resource, and the more people can see how it works, the better.\n\nnba players on a team with a woman's assistant said they would have no problem with a female head coach. san antonio guard demar derozan said, when she speaks we are all ears.\n\nacross social media, nba players, including steph curry, ja morant and andre drummond, took note of hammon coaching after popovich's ejection.\n\nbecky's in a spot now where she's in a position of power, spurs guard patty mills told usa today sports. she's able to direct guys on what to do and that all comes from work ethic and what she does behind the scenes and getting herself and our team ready for games. she is an nba coach who knows her (expletive) and gets it done.\n\nin a cutthroat business, teams hire coaches who can generate success.\n\nthe players will know if you know something or not, lieberman said. if you're not qualified, you're not going to be there.\n\nlieberman also comprehends the pressure the first female head coach will face. they're going to be asked the same questions over and over, she said. are you good enough? why did you get hired? how come there's not enough women in the nba? is there going to be jealousy? c'mon, are you kidding? yes, there's going to be jealousy.\n\nthese jobs are really important, and there's some amazing male coaches in the nba. it's important, yes, for equality and that next step to happen. but it's also incumbent on us to know that we're also competing against some very highly accomplished assistant coaches and nba coaches. you don't get jobs any longer in life (based) on resumes. you get them on relationships.\n\nthat's why lieberman said it's important for teams to hire more women's assistant coaches. a lot of these women have not built the relationships on a level that maybe our male counterparts have, she said.\n\nexperience can change that.\n\nher knowledge of the game, the ins-and-outs of the game, is the reason why she's in the position she is, spurs guard derrick white said. it's the reason why she will just keep growing and growing and eventually become a head coach.\n\ncontributing: mark medina
associated press\n\ntampa, fla. (ap) — south florida has fired coach orlando antigua 13 games into his third season at the american athletic conference school.\n\nathletic director mark harlan announced the move tuesday, saying assistant coach murry bartow will lead the bulls (6-7, 0-2) for the remainder of the season.\n\nantigua leaves with a 17-48 record at usf, which hired the former kentucky and memphis state assistant under john calipari in march 2014.\n\nthe bulls went 9-23 in antigua's first year and finished 8-25 last season. the dismissal, with more than two years left on antigua's contract, comes three days after a 70-56 home loss to houston dropped the team's record under him in conference play to 7-30.\n\nharlan said in a statement that the change was made following a thorough and deliberate review of the program. a search for a successor will begin immediately.\n\nbartow's first game as interim coach is saturday at smu.\n\nbartow has served stints as a head coach at alabama-birmingham and east tennessee state. he was 103-83 in six seasons at uab from 1996 to 2002 and 224-169 over 12 seasons at east tennessee state from 2003 to 2015.\n\n___\n\nmore ap college basketball: www.collegebasketball.ap.org and https://twitter.com/ap_top25 .
washington – nearly 40% of judges president donald trump appointed to federal appeals courts have a history of hostility toward lgbtq rights, according to a new report by the lgbt advocacy group lambda legal.\n\nthe report presents a sobering image for civil rights advocates of trump's lasting impact on the federal judiciary – one they say threatens to roll back progress made in advancing the rights of the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community.\n\nour analysis was ... about calling out the danger to the rule of law, the danger to the integrity and credibility of the judiciary to be putting forth nominees who fundamentally start from a perspective of lgbtq people as 'less than,' said sharon mcgowan, legal director for lambda legal.\n\ntrump will leave office having significantly altered the makeup of the federal judiciary, from lower courts to the supreme court – an accomplishment made possible by senate republicans and one that will create a major obstacle for president-elect joe biden.\n\nafter four years as president, trump has appointed three supreme court justices and 230 lower court judges to lifetime posts, many ny of whom are young, white and male jurists who will have decades to influence and shape federal law.\n\na whiter judiciary:trump's 87 picks to be federal judges are 92% white with just one black and one hispanic nominee\n\naccording to lambda legal's report, released tuesday, the trump administration has appointed 54 of the 177, about 30%, of actively serving federal appeals court judges.\n\nthis outpaced trump's recent predecessors, none of whom managed to place as many judicial appointees during their first four years in office. during the obama administration, for example, only 30 federal appeals court nominees were confirmed during his first four years in office, according to the report. previous administrations going back to president ronald reagan's managed to confirm between 30 and 42 nominees to the appeals court bench during the first four years.\n\ni think in many ways, trump's impact on the judiciary will be his most significant and lasting legacy because it will have a life far beyond the four years of the trump administration, mcgowan said.\n\nwhile the supreme court hears only about 100 to 150 cases annually, the 13 federal appeals courts around the country hear thousands of the most consequential cases every year that shape laws and affect the rights of millions of americans.\n\ntrump's legacy:biden's influence on federal judiciary may be limited despite liberals' talk of 'court-packing'\n\ncarrie severino, chief counsel at the conservative judicial crisis network, which has promoted and applauded trump's nominees, previously said the nomination process under the trump administration is not about meeting quotas.\n\n(trump) is looking for people with a principled judicial philosophy, severino said. the fundamental question is making sure we have judges who are going to be faithful to the constitution.\n\ntrump judges:trump's conservative judges begin takeover of federal appeals courts\n\nconversion therapy, misgendering and wedding vendor disputes\n\nthe report by lambda legal – which analyzed publicly available records on trump's nominees, including statements and writings they've done as private individuals – singled out several appeals court judges who, the authors say, have already issued rulings hostile to lgbtq rights.\n\nin 2019, judge james ho, whom trump nominated to the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit, wrote an opinion denying health care to a transgender woman who was seeking sex-reassignment surgery while in a texas prison. ho, who referred to the inmate using male pronouns, wrote that while it can be considered cruel and unusual punishment to deny essential medical care to a prisoner, there is much disagreement in the medical community about the necessity of sex-reassignment surgery.\n\nlater that year, judge david stras, whom trump nominated to the u.s. court of appeals for the 8th circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' first amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. the judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.\n\nlast year, judge kyle duncan, whom trump also nominated to the 5th circuit, wrote an opinion rejecting a transgender federal prisoner's request to be referred to in court papers using female pronouns in accordance with the inmate's gender identity. duncan wrote that doing so could raise delicate questions about judicial impartiality.\n\nalso last year, two trump-nominated judges to the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit voted to strike down local laws protecting lgbtq minors from conversion therapy, a practice of attempting to change a person's sexual orientation or gender identity. the american medical association and the american psychiatric association have discredited the practice.\n\nbut in the opinion, judge britt grant wrote that the ban on the controversial treatment infringes on therapists' first amendment rights and that the government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because society finds it offensive. judge barbara lagoa agreed with grant, resulting in a split 2-1 decision.\n\nin a candid speech in november to the conservative federalist society, supreme court justice samuel alito lamented society's hostility against traditional views on marriage.\n\nyou can't say that marriage is a union between one man and one woman, alito said. until very recently, that's what the vast majority of americans thought. now it's considered bigotry.\n\nthe speech was widely criticized by democrats and advocates, including mcgowan. lambda legal also opposed alito's nomination to the high court in 2006.\n\nmcgowan said she expects similar cases and rulings to make their way through the federal court system.\n\nin the past, she said, lambda legal has won cases before republican-appointed judges, but the difference during the trump administration is the appointment of judges whose records show deep hostility against lgbtq rights.\n\nwe can and should be able to expect fair and impartial justice from judges regardless of whether they were appointed by republicans or democrats. we did not oppose every single trump nominee. we did not paint them with the same brush, mcgowan said. but, she added, there should be a baseline below which we would never fall.\n\ncontributing: richard wolf
ap\n\nowings mills, md. (ap) — once considered a perennial contender, the baltimore ravens have gone two years without a winning season and reached the playoffs only once since 2012.\n\nafter going 5-12 last season, the ravens flirted with a postseason berth before dropping three of their last four games to finish 8-8.\n\nsomething's got to change if baltimore is to reclaim its position among the nfl's elite.\n\nthough coach john harbaugh conceded tuesday that the ravens desperately need to upgrade their roster — most notably at cornerback — he will stick with offensive coordinator marty mornhinweg, defensive coordinator dean pees and special teams coordinator jerry rosburg.\n\nmy heart, my gut and my head says this is the best way to go, harbaugh said.\n\nmornhinweg was promoted from quarterbacks coach to his current position in early october after harbaugh dismissed marc trestman. despite the shift, baltimore finished 17th in total offense and was ranked 28th in yards rushing.\n\njoe flacco threw for a career-high 4,317 yards and had 20 touchdown passes, but the ravens averaged 42 passes and 23 rushes per game — an imbalance harbaugh wants to see corrected in 2017.\n\nmarty believes in running the football, and i believe in running the football, harbaugh said. we have not run the football well enough or enough, really, for the last two years. that has to change, and i think it goes hand-in-hand with being good at it and doing it a lot more than we do it.\n\nterrance west led the team with 774 yards rushing and rookie kenneth dixon had 382. harbaugh expects both to be back next season, and hopes to add another couple of backs to the mix.\n\nharbaugh would also like to see flacco, the 2012 super bowl mvp, perform better in his 10th nfl season. his paycheck this season ranks third among nfl quarterbacks and restricted the ravens' movement within the salary cap.\n\nwe have a quarterback, and he's in that level of compensation, so we need to get him playing at that level, harbaugh said. we need to put a group and a scheme around him that puts him in that place.\n\nsome priorities for the ravens this offseason:\n\nfree agent shuffle: baltimore lists 12 unrestricted free agents, most notably nose tackle brandon williams, receiver kamar aiken, right tackle rick wagner and pro bowl fullback kyle juszczyk.\n\nthe ravens can't keep them all, especially because they're being squeezed by the salary cap and have many holes to fill.\n\neverything's on the table in terms of how we can improve, harbaugh said, and the financial part is a big piece of it.\n\ncornerbacks needed: baltimore's defense was ranked no. 1 through week 12. over the final four weeks, however, the ravens allowed an average of 28.5 points per game.\n\nthat shortcoming can be attributed in part because of the ankle injury that sidelined jimmy smith and left journeyman shareece wright and rookie tavon young as the starting cornerbacks.\n\nwe need to add more corners. there's no question about it, harbaugh said. if we can do that, that's going to dramatically impact our defense.\n\nhealthy flacco: coming off a knee injury that ended his 2015 season after 10 games, flacco didn't miss a start, but admittedly was not at his best.\n\nwhen you are only seven or eight months out of an injury, no matter what it is, there is going to be a growing process for it, flacco said. this offseason will definitely help with that.\n\nbounce-back year: the ravens have some decisions to make at tight end.\n\ndennis pitta led the ravens with 86 catches, a statistic that is noteworthy because he was returning from a second hip operation that sidelined him for the entire 2015 season.\n\ni'll be able to look back on this season and be proud of what i was able to accomplish, based on my circumstances coming in, pitta said. it's obvious that as a team, we fell short of a lot of our goals. but if i can take away anything, it will be that i was able to come back successfully and will be able to build on this moving forward.\n\npitta's contribution was necessary because the ravens were thin at the position, losing benjamin watson, crockett gillmore and maxx williams to injury. in addition, nick boyle was suspended for using performance-enhancing substances.\n\nif pitta, 31, is to return, it will be with a salary cut.\n\nclassy rookies: the ravens hope their 2017 class is as productive as the current class. ronnie stanley (drafted sixth overall) was solid at left tackle, dixon ran hard, young played decently on defense and special teams, and alex lewis was a fixture on the offensive line before sustaining an ankle injury in november.\n\ni feel like every single one of those guys is going to be a good player, harbaugh said, and a number of those guys have proven it already.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/ap
greenvile, s.c. – although she has dedicated her life's work to researching black history at clemson university, dr. rhondda thomas wants you to know she's not a historian. she's a storyteller.\n\neach story she discovers – whether it's infant katie, an enslaved girl who was listed on the deed of the plantation when it was sold to john c. calhoun's son in 1854, or jimmie gunn, a charlotte, north carolina-based musician who was invited to perform on clemson's all-white campus in the 1930s – is vital, the calhoun lemon professor of literature said.\n\nthomas tells these stories through call my name, a nonprofit research project (and now a book) that seeks to tell the public about the black people who helped clemson university and the land it sits on.\n\nwe strive to give every person that we identify a story ... because together, they create a beautiful mosaic of history that is painful. it has love, it has joy, it has horror. it has all of the human emotions that are associated with being on this planet, thomas said.\n\nfor months, thomas has been working to identify and tell the stories of the 604 people buried in unmarked graves at woodland cemetery, clemson's on-campus graveyard that sits under the shadow of memorial stadium.\n\nbut without remains – the red clay in which they are buried is acidic enough to dissolve bone – and without a lot of documentation, thomas is turning to the surrounding communities to help connect modern descendants and residents with the stories buried in the clay.\n\nthomas has formed a community outreach panel, which will begin work this month to connect the history, stories and research at woodland to communities in pendleton, clemson, central and seneca.\n\nthe panel's immediate goal is education, to shine a light on who is buried among the white faculty and alumni at woodland, which researchers believe include enslaved africans, sharecroppers, convict laborers and domestic workers who lived and worked in clemson up until the cemetery was formally dedicated in the 1920s, thomas said.\n\nwho were they? clemson university has found 604 unmarked graves on its south carolina campus\n\nwhile thomas doesn't know if they will be able to identify any of the people buried across the steep hills making up the cemetery, she knows many families in the area have ancestral ties to fort hill plantation and the many ways the land was used after it was sold.\n\nthose graves have been there for a long time. so we didn't discover them. they were recovered, thomas said. the university used ground-penetrating radar to determine the location of 604 graves, discoveries they announced in october.\n\nand now that the final resting places are known, the work to tell their stories begins.\n\nif (the public) believes they have family members that are buried on cemetery hill, please reach out to us. we want to talk to them, thomas said.\n\nwant to read more stories like this?:sign up for usa today's this is america newsletter\n\ntelling the complete history\n\nafter the nation's racial reckoning in the wake of george floyd's death in minneapolis in may, thomas said the importance of honoring black history has never been more important.\n\nhistory gives us an opportunity to learn about the past, and honor the past as we make decisions on how to live in the present and in the future. and because african americans were so integral to the development of our country, and at clemson university, it's a history that needs to be front and center, thomas said.\n\nsince floyd's death, clemson university trustees voted to remove two names of men known for racism, calhoun and benjamin tillman. calhoun was a slave owner and secessionist whose plantation became clemson university. benjamin pitchfork tillman was a governor and white supremacist whose name adorned clemson's most iconic building.\n\npresident jim clements established a task force on racial equity. clemson football players organized a black lives matter demonstration. hundreds of students have rallied together to demand more inclusive support for black students.\n\nbut even amid the activism and change of today, thomas said, the past can't be ignored. especially for black people, who are reminded of the legacy of racism and slavery in south carolina and beyond every time they look in the mirror, she said.\n\nit's very difficult for me to forget this history because it's written on my skin. i'm a descendant of enslaved people and slaveholders and slavers. and so every time i look in the mirror, i see that history. i can't leave it in the past, because it's written on my body.\n\nclemson university voted to tell the complete history of clemson in 2015, which includes the legacy of slavery and using convict laborers and sharecroppers to farm and build clemson's earliest campus buildings.\n\nthe work at woodland is just one part of telling that story, thomas said. the rest will come with activism, time and progress.\n\ni don't see the cemetery project as the game-changer. it's just something that we need to do.\n\nit's one of the many things that we need to do in order to fully embrace clemson's history, to connect with local african american communities, to sit down together and figure out how the university can be more supportive of the whole state as a land-grant institution.\n\nfollow zoe nicholson on twitter: @zoenicholson_
sally jacobs\n\npri\n\ngeorge keays is not a rogue kind of a man. a colorado real estate agent and grandfather of three, the 65-year-old practices yoga and meditates regularly. but the u.s. government, he says, has left him no choice but to break the law. if, that is, he intends to stay alive.\n\nkeays has stage 4 lung cancer. as his treatment options appeared to be dwindling this fall, he went to cuba for a vaccine treatment despite a federal law that prohibits americans from going there for health care. now, with president trump's recent tightening of the regulations governing travel to cuba, it has become much harder to travel there. but keays needs more of the vaccine. this spring, he's going back.\n\ni am not looking to break the law. but i am not looking to die, either, keays declared. people with stage 4 cancer, like me, should be allowed to try whatever they want to stay alive, whatever they think will work. the last thing they need is the government on your neck over some archaic regulation saying just take what is available here and die.\n\nkeays has abundant company. in the two years since relations between the u.s. and cuba were normalized under president barack obama, a growing number of lung cancer patients traveled to cuba for a vaccine called cimavax, and more recently, a newer vaccine, vaxira. these patients are an elusive group. none of those who went apparently provided their real reason for going to cuba when applying for a visa, nor did many of them declare to u.s. customs officials that they were bringing multiple vials of the vaccine into the u.s. on their return. few even tell their doctors they are taking the injections for fear they will refuse to treat them further.\n\ni can only see it as compromising him because now he has a patient on a drug that is not approved by the fda, said a patient in florida named larry, who asked that his last name not be used. larry has gone to cuba twice for the vaccine — both times without telling his doctor because, he might be afraid he would be sued, or he might stop treating me.\n\njust how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. in january, the roswell park comprehensive cancer center in buffalo, n.y., launched a clinical trial of cimavax with cuba's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccine. it is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the cuban revolution.\n\nroswell is now doing research to determine if they want to do a similar trial with vaxira. it will take years for either of the drugs to receive any final approval.\n\nfor many patients, including some who were not accepted into the roswell trial, travel to cuba has become a much-talked-about option. so popular has the practice become that patients on internet support groups routinely trade anecdotes and travel tips about their cuban journeys. until, that is, trump threw a wrench into the process.\n\nmajor changes for patients going to cuba\n\nthe change in regulations governing travel to cuba that went into effect in november altered one of the most popular categories of travel to cuba initiated by obama, known as people-to-people, which allowed travelers to go to cuba on their own. that's how many americans have been quietly going to the island for medical care, even though doing so is prohibited under the u.s. embargo against cuba. now, people in this category must travel with an organization and have a guide present.\n\namericans can continue to travel on their own to cuba for the purpose of professional research or to provide support for the cuban people. but given that travelers in those categories are required to maintain a full schedule of activities, it's likely that neither will be a good option for cancer patients.\n\nat the la pradera international health center in havana, where most american cancer patients go for treatment, dr. anabely estévez garcía felt the impact of the new regulations in her inbox as soon as trump announced back in june that the changes were in the works. american patients began canceling their plans in a flood.\n\nwe can not go at this time, a texas man emailed garcía on the day of trump's announcement. president trump changed everything today. it is not possible to go directly from here. keep us in touch.\n\na patient in new york on the brink of travel wrote that she had decided to wait a little longer. now, it will be harder to get there as our president has made it impossible to travel alone.\n\nnancy kelly, 71, a california patient who traveled to cuba for vaxira this past spring, emailed that she was worried about the new regulations, too. how would she replenish her vaccine supply when it ran out in october? she decided not to go herself but sent a friend to cuba to pick up more for her.\n\nit was important to get back to cuba before trump's restrictions went into effect, sighed kelly. with the new restrictions, i would need to go through a third country. the problem is that the vaccine has to be refrigerated, so, if you were on a long flight, that was going to be a problem.\n\nthe tighter regulations are only part of what is keeping patients from going. another factor is the state department advisory issued this past september warning american citizens not to go to cuba due to alleged assaults against american embassy staff. investigators have yet to determine exactly who or what was behind the assaults, and the staff in havana has been significantly reduced. for some travelers, it's all just too much.\n\nsince relations between the u.s. and cuba were normalized at the end of 2014, the number of patients going to the plush la pradera clinic at the city's edge had risen steadily. in 2016, 50 americans came for treatment. last year, the number of inquiries about the vaccines tripled over the previous year, while 47 patients had already made the journey to cuba in the first eight months of 2017, according to garcía. now, the numbers have plateaued.\n\nthere are many patients who are suitable for treatment but who do not come for political reasons, said garcía, seated in a treatment room at la pradera this fall. as a physician, i feel very bad because i believe our vaccine is a good treatment that can extend these people's lives.\n\nbecause their own doctors are often not involved, patients wanting to go to cuba must make arrangements themselves. first, they get in touch with la pradera either through email or one of a number of medical tourism agencies in the u.s. or in canada. they then send their medical records for evaluation by la pradera physicians who determine if they are eligible for one of the vaccines, and if so, which one.\n\nunder the obama-era regulations, accepted patients usually informed the airlines issuing their visas that they were going for educational purposes or under the general people-to-people category. questions were rarely asked and most flew directly to cuba.\n\npatients stay at the la pradera clinic, a resort-like facility with a swimming pool and fountains, for four days, during which they receive their first of several doses of the vaccine. each dose consists of four injections — two to the arms and two to the buttocks. one dose costs about $860, so the total cost of the trip, including airfare, lodging and a supply of the medication to take back home, can run well over $10,000.\n\nat p&g travel in ontario, long one of the more popular agencies among americans for booking travel to cuba, the numbers are both up and down. since trump announced in june that he would be reversing aspects of the obama administration's overtures to cuba, the number of americans booking travel directly from the u.s. to cuba through the agency has plummeted by 60%. instead, they're now going through third countries just like they used to do before obama's normalization of relations. since june, the number of bookings by americans going to the island from countries other than the u.s. has increased by 30%, according to tathiana gonzalez, the agency's cuba travel specialist.\n\nyou're either going to go or not go, said gonzalez. when you're given a month to live, you go. it's kind of basic.\n\nwhat they are going for is part of the new wave of immunotherapy treatment that works by triggering a patient's immune system to fight cancer. cimavax, for example, stimulates the immune system to make antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor, or egf, that cancer cells need to grow, effectively starving the cancer. vaxira is somewhat different; it triggers an immune response against a molecule specific to several cancers and is intended to ultimately block the cancer's growth. only patients who have already received chemotherapy are eligible for the vaccines.\n\ncubans research a lung cancer vaccine\n\nwhile cuba is often recognized for its pristine beaches and throbbing rumbas, it is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry. prompted by the country's high rate of lung cancer, researchers began work on a lung cancer vaccine back in the mid-1990s. in the most recent of several cuban trials, patients receiving cimavax lived about three to five months longer than those who did not. available to cubans for free since 2011, it has been given to more than 5,000 patients worldwide.\n\ncimavax is currently available in cuba, colombia, peru, bosnia-herzegovina and paraguay. vaxira, which one cuban clinical trial indicates can extend life by up to two months, is currently undergoing more testing in argentina. it is available in that country and in cuba.\n\nroswell scientists began collaborating with havana's center of molecular immunology, which developed the vaccines, in 2011, and scientists from both countries have worked in one another's laboratories frequently over the years. in the roswell trial, cimavax is being combined with a checkpoint inhibitor, which blocks proteins on cancer cells, called opdivo.\n\nwhile talk of cimavax has circulated in american medical circles for years, much less is known about vaxira. roswell researchers are currently doing preclinical studies of vaxira in animals to determine if the vaccine merits a possible human trial. dr. igor puzanov, director of the early phase clinical trials program at roswell, said that it could take up to a year before a decision can be made on whether to proceed.\n\nwe know what the vaccine is supposed to do, he said. it's just too early to say if it does it.\n\nmeanwhile, at the center of molecular immunology, scientists are now focused on taking cimavax to a next step. they are working to extend patients' survival rate by identifying markers in those who are responsive to the vaccine. patients with high concentrations of the egf protein, for example, have been shown to be more responsive to the vaccine than those who do not. camilo rodriguez, a clinical researcher at the center who has worked on cimavax for 15 years, says he believes that eventually, the vaccine might be used on a host of cancers.\n\nwe feel that the vaccine could be very effective against prostate cancer, for example, because those patients often have a high degree of egf and that is related to the spread of cancer, said rodriguez, seated in his laboratory. eventually, we feel this could be useful in all kinds of cancer affecting the head, neck, bladder and prostate.\n\namerican doctors are not so sure. while some are cautiously optimistic about cimavax and await the outcome of the roswell trial with interest, others complain that the vaccine has been oversold and is in sore need of further study. dr. robert doebele, associate professor of medical oncology at the university of colorado- denver and a senior editor of the american association for cancer research's journal clinical cancer research, recalls sitting in a meeting with a dozen other oncologists discussing the best way to market a drug. someone in the room called out, do whatever cimavax does!\n\nwe all let out a collective groan, said doebele, who is george keays' oncologist. it was hilarious. the fact is that i spend several hours a month answering questions from my patients about this. it's very prominent on the internet and patients are understandably desperate to learn about it. but the fact is that we just don't know if this works yet.\n\ndr. roy s. herbst, chief of medical oncology at yale university and a nationally recognized expert in the treatment of lung cancer, shares those reservations. herbst says that without seeing new stats, it's not that impressive. for the moment, he added, i am not too worried about people not being able to go to cuba.\n\nlike several other doctors of the patients interviewed for this story, doebele advised keays not to go to cuba for the vaccine. one reason for that is that keays is currently taking tagrisso, a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. doebele is concerned that if keays shows improvement while taking that and one of the cuban vaccines, it will be impossible to tell which medication was responsible. but doebele has other worries.\n\nmy biggest concern is safety because of the lack of oversight and regulation. i can't control what he does; i don't even know where he's getting it. was it even a legitimate clinic where he got it? said doebele. i thought i'd talked him out of it.\n\nbut he hadn't. keays did apply to participate in the roswell trial, as doebele suggested, but he was put on the waiting list. he became frustrated that he might wind up in the placebo group in the study, and so he decided to go right to the front of the line. cuba.\n\nkeays arrived at the la pradera clinic in october and was advised that the vaccine most suited to his cancer was vaxira. after consulting with his family doctor, boulder internist william l. blanchet, who was traveling with him, keays received his first dose.\n\ntwenty minutes after i received it, i felt a little tired, but that was it, said keays. the next day, i went for an hour run. i felt great.\n\nif keays was impressed by the professionalism of the doctors, blanchet was even more so.\n\non paper, this looks very promising, blanchet said of the vaccine. it resonates as being medically sound and potentially a major addition. it's too soon to recommend it to patients, but i would make them aware of it and let them make the decision. if i was diagnosed with stage 4 cancer, i would definitely go down and have this be part of my therapy.\n\none of the other patients at la pradera when keays was there was eduardo sanchez, of spain, a lean man with graying hair. diagnosed with advanced stage 4 lung cancer, sanchez said he, too, had exhausted most of the treatments available to him. like most american patients, he learned much of what he knew of the cuban vaccines on the internet.\n\nunfortunately, in spain, there is no information about the cimavax or the vaxira, he said. it's too early for me to say, but i am very hopeful.\n\nquestions on how to bring back the vaccine\n\nfor advanced stage cancer patients like sanchez and keays, going to cuba can be difficult in itself. the trip is tiring and can be daunting for those for whom the treatment may be viewed as something of a last resort. now, american patients face an even higher hurdle in the new and somewhat confusing regulations. the question many patients are wrestling with is how to get in and out of the country without getting caught, given the likelihood of greater scrutiny.\n\nover the past two years, it appears that no one has been apprehended. the u.s. food and drug administration's personal importation policy allows some unapproved medications to be brought into the country, provided there is not an adequate alternative available in the u.s. and the amount does not exceed a three-month supply. but spokesmen for both the fda and u.s. customs and border protection say there is no record of either of the cuban vaccines having been brought into the country or seized at the border.\n\njust how to bring the vaccine into the u.s. is a hot topic on the online health care social network, inspire, which supports a lung cancer group of about 53,000 members. judy ingels, 74, is one of them. diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2015, ingels went on tarceva and her tumor shrunk somewhat. after she saw a cnn report on cimavax at the end of 2016, she decided to go to cuba while she was relatively well and still able to do so. last spring, she and her family traveled from their home in santa rosa, calif., to havana, where she received her first treatment of the vaccine. all told, the trip cost about $16,000. that she was breaking the law did not trouble her in the slightest.\n\ni just didn't get hung up on it, said ingels. my husband said, 'when they ask what your purpose is, just don't mention anything about medicine.'\n\ningels had no trouble carrying an eight-month supply of cimavax back into the u.s. in a hand-held refrigerated lunch bag. when she told the transportation security administration agent in florida that she was carrying a vaccine, he opened her bag and poked around but asked no questions.\n\nin the months that followed, ingels's tumor shrunk perceptibly, a fact that she attributes to cimavax. now, however, her supply has run out and she wants more. presuming that she cannot travel with a guided group, given her purpose, she is considering hiring one of several professional mules who will fly to cuba to get the vaccine for a fee. two of them contacted by pri declined to be interviewed.\n\nwe're weighing the options, said ingels. we might travel ourselves through the bahamas. but i have also talked to an individual who has offered to do this.\n\nnancy kelly, who had a friend travel to cuba on her behalf, was considering a return trip. but when a scan last fall showed that her tumor is growing, she changed her plans — at least for the moment. the change in her circumstance has not dimmed the retired administrative judge's anger at the government's imposition of limitations on american patients' ability to seek the treatment they want.\n\ni think it's absolutely outrageous. what trump has done makes it so much more difficult to go, said kelly. the restrictions that do not permit doctors in different countries to corroborate to help save lives is absolutely terrible.\n\n\n\nkeays is running into a similar problem since a recent scan showed that a mass on his liver is growing. doebele, his oncologist, believes that means that neither the vaxira nor the tagrisso is working. doebele has suggested keays go off the vaxira, in part, so that he might qualify for other treatments, but keays continues to have faith. he's planning on returning to havana in the spring for more of the vaccine. keays intends to apply for a visa under the category of professional research arguing that he is a guinea pig for the vaxira vaccine. he has become, after all, something of an expert on the subject. over the past two years, he's tried a wide variety of treatments: two targeted therapies, multiple forms of radiation and a lot of meditation. he's been on vaxira now for two months.\n\nin between doctor's appointments, keays has been working on a letter to the chairman of the u.s. senate committee on foreign relations, hoping he might intervene on patients' behalf. he's getting other patients to write, too.\n\ni intend to do whatever i can to expose how these restrictions steal the hope, and possibly, the life, from patients suffering with terminal cancer, as well as other sicknesses that might benefit from cuba's advances in medicine, declared keays. the ignorance in this new policy is astounding.\n\nin the meantime, for patients disheartened by an american government and doctors who seem to offer them only discouragement regarding cuba, there is one source of potential support: travel agents like tathiana gonzalez in ontario.\n\nunaffected by the u.s. regulations, gonzalez routinely forwards dozens of american patients' medical records to la pradera, on their behalf, to see if they qualify for one of the vaccines. it's the only instance in which she gets involved in her clients' medical needs because, she says, the process is so stressful. she's the first to admit that she's no medical researcher, but she notices that some of the cancer patients that she's helped get to cuba have lived for years. like her clients, she waits anxiously for a response from the cuban doctors: are they accepted to go, or not?\n\nit's such an emotional roller coaster, exclaimed gonzalez. if they're not accepted, i cry because their cancer is so advanced. if they are accepted, i rejoice! i say, 'you're going! you are going to cuba!'\n\nthis story was reported with a

marco della cava\n\nusa today\n\nlooks like microsoft ceo satya nadella is, with apologies to the iconic '70s sitcom the jeffersons, movin' on up.\n\naccording to the los angeles times and other news reports, nadella has put his view-filled clyde hills, wash., home on the market for $3.5 million, nearly triple what the tech titan paid when he purchased the 4,000-square-foot home two decades back.\n\nthe four-bedroom, three-bathroom house, which was built in 1963, boasts floor-to-ceiling windows and a living room that offer panoramic views of mt. olympus, lake washington and downtown seattle. the property is being listed by tere foster of windermere real estate. the agency declined to client on the sale.\n\naccording to the realtor, the modernist home's clean lines and sleek steel anchor the free-flowing layout. views continue to the spacious main floor master suite. an open loft above the great room is a perfect spot for your library or office looking out to spectacular views. french doors open to emerald lawns and outdoor entertaining areas.\n\nas pricey as nadella's nearly half-acre property may be, there are 11 area houses that are more expensive on this realtor's site alone. the listings top out at $32.8 million for a four-bedroom, 11,500-square-foot lake-front home in bellevue. that of course still pales next to microsoft co-founder bill gates' extravagant 66,000-square-foot lake-front home in nearby medina, wash., which was built for $66 million and today is worth around $123 million.\n\nbut if they wanted to, the nadellas could spring for quite the showcase as their next home. since taking over as ceo in 2014, nadella - who joined microsoft in 1992 from sun microsystems - has added significantly to his wealth. in 2014, nadella earning $4 million in salary and bonus but also was granted $80 million in stock options. last year, his efforts to turn the one-time software king into a cloud- and mobile-first company earned him $18.3 million in salary, bonus and stock options.\n\nfollow usa todat tech reporter marco della cava on twitter @marcodellacava.
gregory korte\n\nusa today\n\nwashington — the day after a shooting spree in oregon last year, president obama said people who support gun control would just have to, for a while, be a single-issue voter if gun laws in america were ever going to change.\n\nthursday, obama said he'll follow that philosophy himself.\n\neven as i continue to take every action possible as president, i will also take every action i can as a citizen, he said in an op-ed for the new york times. i will not campaign for, vote for or support any candidate, even in my own party, who does not support common-sense gun reform. and if the 90% of americans who do support common-sense gun reforms join me, we will elect the leadership we deserve.\n\nobama explained his position in a televised forum on guns thursday night.\n\ni meant what i said, he told cnn's anderson cooper, saying the national rifle association has a stranglehold on congress in this debate.\n\nthe majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than what you see in washington. and the reason that washington doesn't work well in part is because the loudest, shrillest voices, the least compromising, the most powerful, or those with the most money have the most influence, obama said. and, you know, i'm going to throw my shoulders behind folks who want to actually solve problems instead of just, you know, getting a high score from an interest group.\n\nobama's pronouncement comes two days after white house press secretary josh earnest appeared to equivocate on that question, saying, i don't want to make a formal declaration here without having spoken to the president about it.\n\nobama to defend gun executive actions on cnn\n\nbut earnest also said it's unlikely that obama would ever have to choose between the gun issue and supporting a democrat. take, for example, sen. patrick toomey, r-pa., who co-sponsored a provision in 2013 that would have closed the so-called gun show loophole.\n\nthe president certainly gave sen. toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue. i think there are a lot of other things on which the president and sen. toomey disagree, so it's hard to imagine a scenario where the president is willing to campaign for sen. toomey, earnest said, i suspect that mr. toomey's democratic opponent, once he has one, will have at least as good of a record as sen. toomey does when it comes to gun safety and keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them, if not a better one.
dr. james n. pruden\n\nopinion contributor\n\nwhen i was young, i was told, as were many of you, that i had to be patient.\n\nit might come after a question like, are we there yet? or, while standing at the christmas tree waiting for some errant family member to get out of bed, it might have been, can i open my presents now?\n\nin that time of my life, i thought being patient just meant i had to sort of chill out. when i looked it up in the dictionary (truthfully, when i googled it) i found a bit more ominous definition: patience is the capacity to accept or tolerate delay, trouble or suffering without getting angry or upset.\n\ni contracted covid-19 in early march, at the beginning of the east coast experience. in fact, i was one of the very first admitted to my hospital for this condition.\n\ni say my hospital because i have worked at st. joseph's for nearly 40 years as an emergency physician, and have found it to be a wondrous experience.\n\nto say i was ravaged by this illness would be an understatement. of the 31 days i spent on the intensive care unit, 18 of them were spent on a ventilator. i lost 80 pounds, and could not even turn over in bed on my own. but more intense than the loss of weight (i needed to lose some) and the loss of strength was the never ending awareness that i could not get enough air.\n\nnew year, new america:all the things to leave behind in 2020\n\ni became the poster child for impatience when i had to lie flat for my second ct scan, which occurred just before my second intubation. lying flat made breathing so difficult that i remember screaming at the technicians to please, please hurry. it was the closest i have ever been to experiencing sheer terror.\n\nby the time i was being discharged for rehab, i could just about feed myself and brush my hair. fortunately, i am mostly bald headed so it did not take much effort to do that.\n\nwhat does this have to do with patience?\n\nwhen my fiancée, liz, and i made arrangements for an august wedding, we were active in our st. mark's church choir, we got pleasure in actually going to the movies and we just loved to dance.\n\nnow it was the middle of april, and i was oxygen dependent, i had no taste for food and i could barely stand with assistance, let alone dance.\n\nsomething to look forward to:good riddance to 2020. biden's win and the covid vaccine ensure 2021 will be better.\n\nalthough it has now stopped, for some still unexplained reason, flesh was peeling from my hands to the degree that my son christopher and i joked that i could use them in a zombie apocalypse movie.\n\nfor me, the guideposts for patience were embodied in the serenity prayer. you know …\n\ngod, give me grace to accept with serenity\n\nthe things that cannot be changed,\n\ncourage to change the things\n\nwhich should be changed,\n\nand the wisdom to distinguish\n\nthe one from the other\n\nthis was a chance for me to embody that prayer. the trick has always been defining that which i could change and that which i could not change.\n\nno one knew why the skin on my hands was flaking. perhaps it was a reaction to the 5,000 medications i had been given. the hope was that it would go away by itself, so i could listen to the beatles and let it be, or i could listen to the movie frozen'' and let it go, but i had to move on to something else.\n\nin order for me to learn to relearn to stand on my own, to walk, to lift things, the medical team would identify the specific deficit, and the physical therapists would drive me relentlessly to do it just 10 more times. i even gave them murderous nicknames, which only seemed to intensify their efforts. they were special.\n\nfront-line doctor:overworked doctors, nurses are getting vaccinated. here's why you should too.\n\nas for the oxygen dependence, i was having pain with each deep breath. i knew that pushing the envelope of pain was the way to overcome it, but i was finding that very hard.\n\nit ultimately took a significant turn for the better when liz and i were trying to dance and something terribly funny happened. suffice it to say that i was laughing so deeply i was forced to take deep breaths in spite of the pain.\n\nso as far as patience goes, i think one must strive to identify the things in our control and work hard to make them happen.\n\nmore important, one must accept the things that are beyond our control and let the fates do as they will. the hard part is knowing which is which.\n\nincidentally, liz and i danced for four hours at our wedding.\n\ndr. james n. pruden is an emergency medicine specialist at st. joseph's university medical center in paterson, new jersey. this column originally appeared in northjersey.com.
michael o'hanlon\n\nopinion columnist\n\nwhat should america's next president, democrat or republican, do about afghanistan? with an electorate tired of forever wars and a new pentagon strategy focusing on great-power rivalry with russia or china, the temptation for presidential candidates to promise a complete u.s. departure is palpable.\n\ninstead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the u.s. military mission in afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current u.s. deployment in iraq. that would allow the united states a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in afghanistan, as well as pakistan. the slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. that time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the afghan government and the taliban by the end of 2020.\n\nby the time america's next president is inaugurated on jan. 20, 2021, america's role in the afghanistan war will be approaching its 20th anniversary. afghans themselves will have been at war continuously at least twice as long, if one dates the beginning of the modern conflict to the soviet invasion there in 1979.\n\nwe may be exhausted with war, but that doesn't mean our part is over\n\namericans are understandably tired of this war. it has by any measure been a frustration, especially when measured against the more ambitious nation-building goals of the first obama term.\n\nhowever, the recent washington post story alleging that officials engaged in pentagon papers-like deception of the american public about the mission is badly misleading. whether it was the initial bush administration strategy on afghanistan, the mcchrystal review early in the obama years, or any of the subsequent obama/trump efforts to find an exit strategy in what became a virtual annual review process, almost everyone has been acutely aware of — and vocal about — the limits of the possible in this beleaguered and weak country.\n\nnonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. the afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. even more to the point for americans, the united states has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within afghan borders. the united states probably has the ability to do its part to sustain these modest, yet real, accomplishments at far lower cost in blood and treasure than before.\n\nthe bad news is that there is likely no near-term exit strategy; this reality should be faced head on. the good news is that, in strategic and military and budgetary terms, the cost of the mission is sustainable.\n\na future force of 5,000 u.s. troops in afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other nato military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 gis there. it would be 95% less than the 100,000 u.s. troops commanded there by gen. david petraeus and then gen. john allen at the peak of the american presence in 2010-11. this lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.\n\nthe advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. by laying out a plan designed to last for several years, washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter obama and trump years.\n\nthe number of u.s. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually. the size of the deployment could also be reduced further if the afghan military started to develop greater strength and battlefield momentum. but for planning purposes, 5,000 for 5 would be the core premise.\n\npeace process:u.s. presidential hopefuls owe afghan women their support\n\nthis idea for a smaller but enduring u.s. military presence in afghanistan will go against much of the preferred sentiment of the democratic base. but democrats do not have the luxury of sweepingly opposing long-term military missions while castigating president donald trump for ending them recklessly in the way he just nearly did, yet again, in syria.\n\nof course, trump administration policy could change dramatically before election day as well. absent a comprehensive peace deal with the taliban by next fall that also involves the afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor pakistan likely have in the idea — president trump will face a dilemma. he will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect america on the other.\n\nal-qaida remains present in afghanistan and just over the border in pakistan, where drones flying from bases in afghanistan can help keep a watch on things. the presence of the islamic state terrorist group in afghanistan has been growing, too. neither has provided the capability or bastion that extremists would need to strike the united states.\n\neven so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of america's and nato's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. thus, trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-qaida and isis.\n\nwe cannot fight without boots on the ground\n\nsome will say terrorism in and near afghanistan can be checked even without an american military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the taliban. perhaps any future al-qaida or isis presence on afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the indian ocean. or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in afghanistan.\n\nbut that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. few saw the isis caliphate coming in iraq and syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. and the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the hindu kush. standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.\n\nwith 5,000 american troops (and some additional civilians and contractors) in afghanistan, the united states could maintain two or three major airfields and hubs of operations for intelligence, air power and special forces/commandos — at bagram near kabul in the nation's center, near kandahar in the south, and perhaps around either khost or jalalabad in the east. it also could maintain a modest military advisory and training presence in kabul, to help the afghan army and police carry out the bulk of the fighting against extremists.\n\nit's time to leave afghanistan:take the deal, president trump; 18 years is enough\n\nthe annual cost of this presence would be perhaps $7 billion to $8 billion — not trivial, but only 1% of the defense budget. it would require several billion dollars more in annual assistance to the afghan government, to maintain its army and police and to pursue modest development goals, though other donors could be expected to provide most funds for the latter purposes.\n\ncommitting to such a presence for half a decade would also signal to pakistan and the taliban that the new u.s. president would not be expecting a hail mary peace deal as a viable near-term exit strategy. perhaps such a promise would even improve the seriousness with which one or both might then engage in peace talks.\n\nthe united states needs a policy that recognizes afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, u.s. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. that overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.\n\nmichael o'hanlon, a member of usa today's board of contributors, is a senior fellow at the brookings institution and author of beyond nato: a new security architecture for eastern europe. follow him on twitter: @michaeleohanlon
heidi m. przybyla\n\nusa today\n\nwashington – president trump plans to press republican congressional leaders this weekend at camp david to make a major infrastructure package their top legislative priority this year, as his administration readies a blueprint he'll tout in the state of the union address on january 30, according to two white house officials.\n\nthe white house will release a proposal in mid to late january that will call for a wholesale change in the way the u.s. approaches big infrastructure projects, according to the officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly because the plan is being finalized.\n\ntrump's pledge to renew the country's roads, bridges and airports was a major populist promise from his 2016 presidential campaign. but it was put on hold as gop congressional leaders pursued traditional republican agenda items in his first year in office, including tax cuts and failed attempts to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nat a presidential retreat in the maryland mountains this weekend, one official said trump will make clear that house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., should put infrastructure above other priorities including ryan's push to overhaul entitlement programs.\n\nsigning the tax bill late last year, trump challenged democrats to work with him on infrastructure in 2018. i really believe infrastructure can be bipartisan, trump said dec. 22. i actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road.\n\nyet trump's confidence that democrats – and republican fiscal conservatives – are willing to play ball on infrastructure may be overblown. the main pothole on the road to infrastructure improvements will be securing funding, which will be even more challenging after republicans pushed through a tax bill expected to add $1 trillion to the national debt over the next decade along party lines.\n\nthere's a desire among legislators in both parties to accomplish something significant in the area of infrastructure, said dave schnittger, a former deputy chief of staff to ex-house speaker john boehner, an ohio republican. but the idea of doing a large scale package begs the obvious question, which is 'how do you pay for it?'\n\nmore:trump signs tax and spending bills, challenges democrats to work with him on infrastructure next\n\nmore:trump order seeks to speed up infrastructure projects, but advocates say it will waste tax dollars\n\ntrump's plan would move the country away from a project-based system in which the federal government identifies infrastructure needs and gives money. the white house now plans to delegate that role to states and private investors, who would also provide the bulk of the funding.\n\nthe american society of civil engineers estimates that some $2 trillion is needed to upgrade the country's transit systems and address solid and hazardous waste, levees, ports, railways and schools.\n\nthe trump plan aims to generate $1 trillion for improvements, including a $200 billion federal funding commitment, according to the white house officials. the rest would be made up by state and local governments and private investors.\n\nthe federal dollars will go toward incentives for private investors, rural projects, and transformative projects such as high-speed rail or major tunnels, according to the officials. it will also include money for workforce development.\n\nthe plan to boost private sector participation would be a big change from the country's previous approach.\n\naccording to the nonprofit research group rand corporation, 97% of the funding for u.s. highways, bridges and roads comes from public sources. what's more, trump's own budget request for fiscal 2018 cut infrastructure spending overall by $55 billion.\n\nunlike with taxes, which passed with a simple majority, trump will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the senate to pass infrastructure legislation – which means he'll need at least nine democrats to sign on board. and many have said they are skeptical of placing so much responsibility for public works in the hands of private investors and localities.\n\nthey also may be wary of handing trump another major legislative win before the 2018 midterm elections. trump is pushing infrastructure to follow through on a major populist economic promise, especially with his tax bill being attacked as primarily benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers and his efforts to renegotiate trade deals like nafta still in flux.\n\na former manhattan real estate developer, trump considers infrastructure, more than taxes and health care, in his wheelhouse, and his team sees rebuilding the country as an easy political win.\n\npeople forget president trump is a builder, said former trump senior communications adviser jason miller. infrastructure is an important next step in investing in our country.\n\nmore:trump: infrastructure to be 'envy of the world'\n\nwhat's more, the need for major upgrades is critical. the american society of civil engineers gave all u.s. infrastructure – including transit, including air, rail, roads and bridges – a grade of d+ for 2017. the nation's state of disrepair has been demonstrated by recent events including a major power outage at atlanta's hartsfield airport, amtrak rail derailments causing deaths and a new york city subway system in a state of disrepair.\n\nmore:amtrak accidents hurt safety reputation, but railroad remains popular with congress, riders\n\nfunding challenges\n\nyet trump's own legislative wins may now work against him.\n\nthe new gop tax law just made it harder for states and localities to raise money because property and income tax deductions aren't worth as much as they were in 2017. democrats warn that trump also extinguished a major potential funding source for infrastructure – a tax on overseas corporate earnings once floated by trump economic advisers – that was instead used to finance lower corporate tax rates.\n\nthere is also resistance among rank-and-file republicans to add to the deficit, especially right after the house voted for $81 billion in hurricane disaster relief. congress also needs to focus on finding additional spending cuts for a two-year government spending deal that is mcconnell's top priority versus forking over more money the infrastructure project.\n\nhelping states fund projects\n\nthe white house insists it is working on ways to help states finance projects.\n\na dozen federal agencies have been coordinating on the blueprint with d.j. gribbin, a special assistant to the president, who is the white house's point person on this issue. gribbin previously worked in the private sector on infrastructure public-private partnerships and for koch industries, the company owned by the billionaire gop mega donors and brothers charles and david koch.\n\nthe white house is open to hearing from states on ways to raise funds, including if they want to advocate for levying internet taxes that could help fund critical projects, according to the officials.\n\ntrump's idea to create a dedicated fund for rural projects is aimed at building support from a gop conference that hails primarily from rural areas and would struggle more than urban areas to finance their share of the costs or attract private investors.\n\nthe history on infrastructure spending on the hill has generally been split on urban and rural lines, not so much party lines, said debra knopman, the author of a recent rand corporation report on infrastructure. if your focus is on amtrak and fixing the northeast corridor, knopman said, many rural lawmakers aren't going to be as interested.\n\ncritical needs\n\nat issue is how to incentivize private companies to invest in projects that may be in the interest of public safety and commerce but not necessarily profit-making ventures, such as upgrading the lead-laced water pipes in flint, mich.\n\naccording to knopman's report, the federal highway trust fund and many of the state funds for drinking water and wastewater treatment plants have not been operating on a sustainable basis for some time now, and communities with declining tax bases struggle to maintain their roads, bridges, and water systems and repay their debts to bond holders.\n\nthere's a question of how far you can go with bringing in private investment to, quote solve the problem, knopman continued. and when it comes to places like flint, she said, there's just no market there.
associated press\n\nbono and the guys in u2 are big football fans, as in soccer.\n\nso when they sang about sunday bloody sunday and new year's day, they had no intention of describing the end of the 2016 nfl season.\n\nyet, the firings of chip kelly and trent baalke in san francisco, mike mccoy in san diego, and the resignation of gary kubiak for health reasons in denver certainly rang true to those rock classics.\n\nusually, the axings take place the day after the regular season concludes. except, of course, for the teams in a rush to get into the personnel market extra early, which in '16 were the jaguars (gus bradley), rams (jeff fisher) and bills (rex ryan).\n\non sunday, while other franchises were scrambling to make the playoffs or improve their postseason standing, the coaching carousel spun wildly in california. with fisher already canned in los angeles, kelly and mccoy became unemployed within an hour of each other.\n\nboth moves were predictable, as was the release of baalke, whose success as a gm with the 49ers now, it's clear, was dependent on how jim harbaugh molded and improved the players baalke gave him. baalke won a power struggle with harbaugh, who headed to michigan. the niners became historically bad without him, and baalke's choice of kelly to work with such a weak roster looks worse than hiring caretaker jim tomsula after harbaugh left. at least tomsula went 5-11, three more victories than kelly managed.\n\nindeed, his only wins in a 2-14 record came against the rams, so maybe la owner stan kroenke will turn to kelly.\n\ndon't count on it.\n\ndespite my feelings for trent and chip, i felt the decision to change our football leadership was absolutely necessary, 49ers ceo jed york said in a statement. the performance of this team has not lived up to my expectations or those of our fans, and that is truly disappointing. we all expected to see this team progress and develop as the season went on, but unfortunately that did not happen. that is why now is the time to find a new direction for this team.\n\nthe new direction for the chargers looks like it will be north a bit to become a tenant of kroenke and the rams in the new inglewood, california palace that will open in a few years. mccoy's team lost its last five games and finished second for two straight seasons in the tough afc west. injuries tore it apart, too, but with the focus on whether the chargers would move to la, it was hard to judge what kind of job mccoy was doing.\n\napparently chargers chairman dean spanos wants a totally fresh start when the club abandons its long-time home.\n\nwhich means both of the new teams in los angeles, which was without the nfl since 1995 until the rams moved back last year, will be riding the coaching carousel.\n\nmore moves could be coming, too. is chuck pagano safe in indianapolis? might the saints do something with sean payton? what about bears coach john fox?\n\nsafe for another year are todd bowles and mike maccagnan, who the jets are bringing back. and cleveland coach hue jackson, despite a 1-15 record. and marvin lewis despite the meltdown in cincinnati.\n\nthe saddest news comes from denver. never was there a question about gary kubiak returning after leading the broncos to their super bowl win last february. but kubiak's health issues forced him to step aside, disappointing fans, players and john elway alike.\n\nwe love kube, we love how he treated us, said cornerback aqib talib. we pray he gets healthy.\n\ndenver won't have any trouble filling kubiak's spot. one of the hot candidates, for example, is atlanta offensive coordinator kyle shanahan, son of mike shanahan, who coached elway to two super bowl championships.\n\ngiven how well kubiak fit in the broncos' family, such a hire makes a lot of sense.\n\nthen again, sensibility isn't always a criteria in nfl coaching circles.\n\n___\n\nfor more nfl coverage: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/ap_nfl
