When I was young, I was told, as were many of you, that I had to be patient.
The three-dimensional effect of Dolby Atmos produces a more realistic audio environment that attentive moviegoers can't help but notice. While existing movie theaters have been slow to invest in the technology in the U.S., filmmakers are eager to utilize Dolby Atmos. Dolby says several dozen movies and TV series have been released for home consumption in the format — a number sure to multiply in the months to come. Video games, like Star Wars: Battlefront, have also begun to capitalize on the increased spatial freedom.
For advanced stage cancer patients like Sanchez and Keays, going to Cuba can be difficult in itself. The trip is tiring and can be daunting for those for whom the treatment may be viewed as something of a last resort. Now, American patients face an even higher hurdle in the new and somewhat confusing regulations. The question many patients are wrestling with is how to get in and out of the country without getting caught, given the likelihood of greater scrutiny.
Iowa had women as governor and senator, but the state elected women to the U.S. House for the first time. Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, both Democrats, beat out their incumbent opponents, both men.

The White House insists it is working on ways to help states finance projects.
Under the Constitution, he has the authority to conduct that proceeding as he sees fit, Gohmert argued. He may count elector votes certified by a state's executive, or he can prefer a competing slate of duly qualified electors. He may ignore all electors from a certain state. That is the power bestowed upon him by the Constitution.
Here are some of the past dramatic and controversial moments in Congress' counting of Electoral College votes:

It's something that it's sad we have to talk about it, Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams told USA TODAY Sports. We're all coaches. The coaching position has no gender. I've been around ladies who have coached the game. I'm blown away at the concept that we even have to talk about what do we have to do to get them (a head-coaching gig). …

But the American people have watched a lot of Law & Order, and they understand what really happened here. They need only look at the latest round of smoking-gun emails, which confirms Trump's role in the plot.
Memphis: The Shelby County Health Department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said Saturday. The health department started vaccinating first responders with the Moderna vaccine Dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson Joan Carr. Doug McGowen, chief operating officer for the City of Memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the Shelby County community, and it's going to take a while to get all of those individuals vaccinated. Some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. As of Saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department's two drive-thru centers had been filled. The health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass COVID-19 testing sites.
That measuring stick was important to both Jerry Jones and vice president Stephen Jones, the two said at training camp in July, as Garrett entered the final season of his five-year contract without an extension. The Joneses stated their roster was more talented than the 2018 club that went 10-6, then beat the Seahawks in the wild-card round. They wanted postseason production to reflect that belief.
Like Garcia, Ocasio-Cortez, a self-identified democratic socialist, built her campaign around community support that few establishment politicos saw coming. The 29-year-old, born in the Bronx, was working in a bar to support her family before she was elected in 2018, becoming the youngest woman in Congress.

We should follow that precedent. To wit, Congress should immediately appoint an Electoral Commission, with full investigatory and fact-finding authority, to conduct an emergency 10-day audit of the election returns in the disputed states. Once completed, individual states would evaluate the Commission's findings and could convene a special legislative session to certify a change in their vote, if needed.

Like several other doctors of the patients interviewed for this story, Doebele advised Keays not to go to Cuba for the vaccine. One reason for that is that Keays is currently taking Tagrisso, a standard therapy for non-small cell lung cancer. Doebele is concerned that if Keays shows improvement while taking that and one of the Cuban vaccines, it will be impossible to tell which medication was responsible. But Doebele has other worries.

The number of U.S. forces could decline even further if a peace deal eventually were struck — in which case it might even wind up near zero eventually.

Omaha: Restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. The Omaha World-Herald reports the Nebraska Restaurant Association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. The waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. This is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic, said Zoe Olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. Olson said the association's proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. The proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. But the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. When you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that's when you get increased harms, said Chris Wagner, executive director of Project Extra Mile, an Omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.
As a leader looking to do what is good and just, President Maduro has an opportunity to change his country's course with the release of Josh and Thamy on humanitarian grounds. This action would be a historic step in opening the channels of communication between our two countries. With this gesture of goodwill, the governments of Venezuela and the United States could move forward together towards a better future.

Even Garrett declined to entertain speculation, maintaining that he did not think about his future much and would not yet. The coach who always told his Cowboys players to focus on the moment — to have a good Wednesday, to ready for one good series, to think only about the immediate next opponent — said he thought not a whole lot about his future. Absolutely he wanted to continue coaching in the NFL and, if possible, with the Cowboys.

In the four games after returning from a foot injury that sidelined him for three contests, Darnold was 80 of 125 (64 percent) for 931 yards and six touchdowns with one INT. He showed clear improvement in his ability to see the field, read defenses, be smart with the football and wasn't as skittish behind an offensive line that struggled mightily early in the season.
I saw the passion in his eyes — 'I want this game.' That's why I think he's great, and I think that's what's going to make him great: He wants to compete. And he wants to compete on the biggest stage, and in the biggest moment. So I gave him that chance…. I don't know what would have happened after that, but in my mind, we should have made the change. I had my bad three days. I let it bother me for three days and then I said, 'look, you've got to move on. You're going to kill yourself over this, and it's too late. It's over.'
But if Pederson is returning, he said his priority is fixing Wentz, who will finish the season sitting for the last 4 1/2 games while rookie Jalen Hurts took over.

Fort Lauderdale: Health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths Saturday. Florida's Department of Health did not release numbers on New Year's Day. The state has also chosen not to report COVID-19 cases on two other holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Florida to 1,354,833. The agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported Friday and 9,752 reported Saturday. The state's death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. On New Year's Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. Also on Thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department's HealthyFla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in England has been detected in a Martin County man with no recent travel history. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, which along with Miami-Dade and Broward counties have comprised the state's hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.
We want it to happen organically, and when the right opportunity matches the right person, this will happen, Spruell said. We just feel we're so well positioned. If it happens tomorrow or the next day or this season or a few seasons away, we're really close. But we're not putting a timetable on it.

Patients stay at the La Pradera clinic, a resort-like facility with a swimming pool and fountains, for four days, during which they receive their first of several doses of the vaccine. Each dose consists of four injections — two to the arms and two to the buttocks. One dose costs about $860, so the total cost of the trip, including airfare, lodging and a supply of the medication to take back home, can run well over $10,000.
Unaffected by the U.S. regulations, Gonzalez routinely forwards dozens of American patients' medical records to La Pradera, on their behalf, to see if they qualify for one of the vaccines. It's the only instance in which she gets involved in her clients' medical needs because, she says, the process is so stressful. She's the first to admit that she's no medical researcher, but she notices that some of the cancer patients that she's helped get to Cuba have lived for years. Like her clients, she waits anxiously for a response from the Cuban doctors: Are they accepted to go, or not?
The United States needs a policy that recognizes Afghanistan for what it is — a significant, but not a top-tier, U.S. strategic interest — and builds a plan accordingly. That overall strategy should still seek peace, but in the meantime its military element should be modest, yet steady and stable.
Fitzgerald voted to support objections for both contested states.
Topeka: The state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in England, the director of the state Department of Health and Environment said last week. No cases of the new strain have been detected in Kansas. Cases have been confirmed in Colorado, Florida and California. Dr. Lee Norman said Kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of COVID-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. Norman told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes COVID-19, including a Utah strain and a Wisconsin strain. Viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. Mostly, they don't make much difference, Norman said. They're more alike than different, quite honestly. The state on Friday reported another 138 deaths from COVID-19 since Wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. Kansas has confirmed 227,745 COVID-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since Wednesday, the health department said.

This is why this scandal is so deeply damaging to President Trump. Long after the debate around impeachment is over, the lasting stink will still surround him. A majority of the country believes he's a criminal. People no longer hear the soundtrack from The Apprentice when they see him; they hear that dun, dun from a new series — Law & Order: DJT
Major changes for patients going to Cuba
What this means is that sounds are no longer two-dimensional, coming from one plane—left, right, or behind the viewer—but instead seem to come from all over the room. As many as 128 discrete audio tracks are isolated for theaters, requiring up to 64 speakers—a dealbreaker for even the most hardcore home audio enthusiasts. To bring Dolby Atmos home, the industry came up with upward-firing speakers, which allow audio to bounce off the ceiling.

Years before his Election Day party, while attorneys for Arizona and civil rights groups were battling over Senate Bill 1070 – the state's notorious show me your papers law – Garcia and other protesters stood outside the Phoenix courthouse under the brutal July sun blocking the intersection.

Trump also said the 2016 Democratic primary was rigged against Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and, as in 2020, he declared the 2016 general election race was rigged against him before it even took place. Even after winning the election and being sworn in as president, Trump baselessly insisted more than 3 million illegal votes were cast against him. A White House commission Trump created to investigate election fraud disbanded without finding any evidence to support the president's claims.

But the last segment dives into the 2015 World Series, and specifically Collins' decision to leave Matt Harvey in to pitch the ninth inning of the deciding Game 5. Collins intended to take Harvey out for closer Jeurys Familia, but Harvey argued his way back to the mound only to allow a walk and a double to the first two batters he faced. The Royals tied the game that inning and went on to win the Series with a 7-2 victory in 12 innings.

Iraq is a tough country under any circumstances, made more so after the 2003 U.S. invasion that upended the Middle East and cost so much in U.S. lives and treasure. But Iraq also created strange bedfellows. The U.S. troops worked alongside Iraqi and Iranian militia to destroy a common enemy, the Islamic State terrorism group. And even as Washington was confronting Iran over its nuclear program and malign behavior elsewhere, we maintained an uneasy coexistence in Iraq, where Tehran holds considerable sway.

The presumptive incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, told USA TODAY in an exclusive interview that President Donald Trump can expect a different world from his first two years in office. She and her Democratic colleagues plan to confront Trump on such issues as the deaths of migrant children and the protection of special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.

The highest rate of parity by Latino political representation is in Florida and New Mexico. New Mexico has the nation's highest percentage of the Latino population at 48.8%. In Florida, the state with the sixth-largest Latino population, Latinos represent 26.1% of the population, according to 2018 U.S. Census data. But the state's estimated 4.8 million Latinos in Florida have benefited from decades of political activism in Cuban, Puerto Rican, Venezuelan and other Hispanic communities largely in Miami that has resulted in an unusual number of Hispanic lawmakers holding local and statewide offices.

Columbia: Nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Administration announced Wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. Among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. The grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. The state had to turn down another several million dollars' worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. The volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. That delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, Frank Knapp, president of the state's Small Business Chamber of Commerce, told The Post and Courier. The monies were allocated by the Legislature in September to spend federal COVID-19 aid for South Carolina. The state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.

Still, that's just a fraction of the nation's 100 senators and 435 representatives.

In October, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar unveiled a proposal to require pharma companies to publish a drug's list price in TV ads that blanket the airwaves.

Anchorage: Health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies Pfizer and Moderna. That figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in December. Thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in Alaska. Starting Monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. That group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can't be done remotely or postponed. Almost 50 Alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last Monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. That group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the Daily News reports. Alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last Monday.

Boston: Gov. Charlie Baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill Friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in Massachusetts to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment. It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. Baker's office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of COVID-19 on the health care system, among other steps. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at UMass Lowell last week instead will open Monday after staffing shortages delayed the soft launch. While the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. Lowell General Hospital currently has 63 COVID-19 patients at its main campus.

Richmond: State Sen. Ben Chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, Senate Republicans said Friday. Chafin represented southwest Virginia and was from Russell County. A Republican, he was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state Senate in 2014. He was 60. Lawmakers from around the state mourned Chafin's death late Friday. I knew Ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in Moccasin Valley, working the land just as generations of his family had done before him, Gov. Ralph Northam said. He loved the outdoors, and he loved serving people even more. Senate Republicans said in a statement: He served to ensure that his region and community, and the people he loved, would never be forgotten. Chafin is the first Virginia lawmaker to die from the virus.

Since June, the number of bookings by Americans going to the island from countries other than the U.S. has increased by 30%, according to Tathiana Gonzalez, the agency's Cuba travel specialist.

I go up to north Mississippi, south Mississippi, and I go to these nursing schools, and I talk to these students. He said the country's nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. The bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. Judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. We put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don't lower the standards, he said.

U.S. News & World Report: 3.0/5 on Weight loss | 4.9/5 on Healthy
WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump spent much of the 2020 presidential campaign insisting that he could only lose if the election was rigged against him, and he has spent nearly every day since his defeat claiming his dire predictions of fraud had come to pass.
Wall, scheduled for surgery on his left heel Jan. 8, hasn't played in any of the past three games but the Wizards have won the last two.
Trump's pledge to renew the country's roads, bridges and airports was a major populist promise from his 2016 presidential campaign. But it was put on hold as GOP congressional leaders pursued traditional Republican agenda items in his first year in office, including tax cuts and failed attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Moon also said he wouldn't take a soft stance with the North and vowed to strengthen South Korea's military. I won't be weak-kneed or just focus on dialogue, as we did in the past, Moon said.
In our campaigns, no matter how hard fought they may be, no matter how close the election may turn out to be, those who lose accept the verdict and support those who win, Nixon said.

Instead, candidates should propose a path to downsize and then stabilize the U.S. military mission in Afghanistan so that it is roughly on the scale of the current U.S. deployment in Iraq. That would allow the United States a good chance of achieving its core counterterrorism goals in Afghanistan, as well as Pakistan. The slogan 5,000 troops for 5 years would be a reasonable distillation of the chief military elements of this approach. That time horizon would also give peace talks a realistic chance — unlike recent proposals that fancifully imagined a power-sharing accord between the Afghan government and the Taliban by the end of 2020.

Grafton: What was initially thought to be a major human error of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the Aurora Medical Center Grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. A pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be useless to those who received them. On Dec. 26, Aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. After further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. On Wednesday, Aurora notified Grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. The pharmacist was arrested Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were also investigating, police said. Jeff Bahr, president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, called the pharmacist a bad actor. According to Grafton police, the now-former pharmacist intentionally took the vials out of the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing it would render the vaccines useless and make people who received them believe they were vaccinated when they were not.

Washington: Curators Sam Vong and Shannon Perich at the National Museum of American History are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, WUSA-TV reports. As historians, what we really want to do is document what's going on before it kind of escapes from us, Vong said. The Smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that Americans' recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. All of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research, Perich said. The submissions can be mundane. What did it mean to sit in your home by yourself? asked Perich. The only way we're ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us. Or they can be extraordinary, like one of Vong's favorites so far from a former Bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. The submission period opened in December and runs through March.

Minneapolis: The state on Saturday reported 54 deaths from COVID-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. The new numbers bring the state's pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. A total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. The Department of Health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. In that period, the state reported one of the nation's lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. Gov. Tim Walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for New Year's celebrations.

Boise: Gov. Brad Little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. The Republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. The latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after November tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. For 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. Little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. Health and the economy are intertwined, Little said. Idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.

Keays has abundant company. In the two years since relations between the U.S. and Cuba were normalized under President Barack Obama, a growing number of lung cancer patients traveled to Cuba for a vaccine called Cimavax, and more recently, a newer vaccine, Vaxira. These patients are an elusive group. None of those who went apparently provided their real reason for going to Cuba when applying for a visa, nor did many of them declare to U.S. customs officials that they were bringing multiple vials of the vaccine into the U.S. on their return. Few even tell their doctors they are taking the injections for fear they will refuse to treat them further.
Little Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. There were 1,216 people in Arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. Arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. The Arkansas Department of Health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. Those case counts are down from Friday's record high, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on New Year's Day. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms.

Charleston: The state has reported a weekly record in the number of positive coronavirus cases entering the new year. West Virginia had at least 6,915 confirmed virus cases for the six-day period last week, excluding Sunday, according to health statistics. Officials have cautioned that figures could be skewed due to a lag in reporting cases over the Christmas holiday period. Sunday's cases won't be reported until Monday. Still, the state had its three highest daily figures last week since the start of the pandemic: at least 1,385 positive cases Tuesday, 1,618 Wednesday and 1,516 Thursday. Last week's cases marked the ninth weekly record in the past 13 weeks. The previous record of 6,871 positive cases was set two weeks ago. There also were a record 810 people hospitalized for the virus Friday. As of Saturday there were a record 27,418 active cases of the virus statewide, up 57% in the past month.

The New York activist and Democrat, 29, cruised to victory after upsetting established Democrat Rep. Joe Crowley in the primary race. She is already making waves. In November, she kicked off her first day of new-member orientation by participating in a climate change protest at Pelosi's office. Ocasio-Cortez, who voted for Pelosi as speaker Thursday, has said she will oppose a rules package, crafted by Democratic leaders. She opposes its new budget rules that she tweeted are a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare+other leg.
Columbus: As Gov. Mike DeWine applies pressure to get COVID-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. Vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. In some cases, vaccine hesitancy has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation, said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. On Wednesday, DeWine said he had grown impatient with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a moral imperative to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.

No. 1-ranked senior Chet Holmgren and several of his Minnesota high school state champion teammates beat Ypsi in Ann Arbor on Nov. 12 in the academy's first game. Then Duncanville (Texas), which has one of the nation's best sophomores, Ronald Holland, topped Ypsi on Nov. 28 in Texas. Ypsi has since beaten Ohio's ISA and Texas' Legacy School of Sport Sciences, each of which feature multiple Division I prospects.
While there understandably has been emotionally charged commentary regarding our motives and intentions, the speculation is not true and unfounded, Kroenke said. I am a Missouri native named after two St. Louis sports legends who I was fortunate enough to know on a personal level. This move isn't about whether I love St. Louis or Missouri. I do and always will. No matter what anyone says, that will never change.
He continued, Americans deserve the right to participate in free and fair elections, but many voters feel they were robbed of this opportunity in states where verified fraud and irregularities occurred on November 3rd. If given the opportunity to challenge electors from these states, I will certainly do so. President Trump has had our backs, and now is the time for us to have his as he rightfully pursues challenges to election fraud.

Also at stake are the costs of accommodations and other expenses. The International Olympic Committee has said it is willing to cover North Korea's costs if Pyongyang takes part in the Games, but some have questioned whether that would violate United Nations sanctions imposed on the North for its missile and nuclear tests.
HOUSTON – An ambitious project that encompasses far more than a football stadium won over NFL owners, who voted to approve the Rams' relocation to the Los Angeles area on Tuesday.
Montgomery: The state notched almost a third of its coronavirus cases in December, an alarming bulge that echoed the warnings of medical experts who said the state would see some dark days before the widespread availability of a vaccine to fight the pandemic. Alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases reported in December. The surge came after the Thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in January from the fallout of Christmas and New Year's gatherings. We are being overwhelmed right now, State Health Officer Scott Harris said. I believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad. The cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on Nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases Dec. 31. While there were some backlogged cases recorded in December, almost all of the reported cases were from December.

Those graves have been there for a long time. So we didn't discover them. They were recovered, Thomas said. The university used ground-penetrating radar to determine the location of 604 graves, discoveries they announced in October.
Of all the available tax breaks, I tend to look at retirement-related tax breaks as the best of all. As I've written before, not only can saving for retirement boost your tax refund, but it can also help set you up for financial freedom later in life.
The tighter regulations are only part of what is keeping patients from going. Another factor is the State Department advisory issued this past September warning American citizens not to go to Cuba due to alleged assaults against American Embassy staff. Investigators have yet to determine exactly who or what was behind the assaults, and the staff in Havana has been significantly reduced. For some travelers, it's all just too much.
We're excited to serve as a gathering place for you to discover and remember the women who changed American history and to support and honor the women of today who keep the fight alive.
Hawley was the first senator to announce he would back the effort on Jan. 6, ensuring both chambers would debate and be forced to vote on whether to overturn Biden's election win.
But he hadn't. Keays did apply to participate in the Roswell trial, as Doebele suggested, but he was put on the waiting list. He became frustrated that he might wind up in the placebo group in the study, and so he decided to go right to the front of the line. Cuba.
Cornerbacks Josh Norman and Bashaud Breeland and linebacker Ryan Kerrigan will be back, but the Redskins could have a cast around them and possibly even a new coordinator if Joe Barry takes the fall for breakdowns and blunders that cost them a playoff berth.

Julián Castro has always embraced his Mexican immigrant roots. He followed in Cisneros' footsteps to become mayor of San Antonio in 2009. But a recent poll by Telemundo Noticias showed he lagged in Latino voter support compared with other Democratic presidential hopefuls. The November poll showed Castro in a three-way tie for fourth place among Latino voters, with only 2% support, while Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are leading the candidates among those voters, with 26% and 18%, respectively.
With Dolby Atmos, during the mixing for a film or video game, engineers record and isolate each individual sound — from birds chirping to tires squealing — and convert them into an object. Each sound object is then assigned a particular location within the theater from which to emanate, using one or more speakers to establish the location.

The move has had teams working on new pit-stop dynamics over the winter break, as tire carriers and changers adjust to a different landscape. At least in the early weeks of the season, pit stops are expected to be slightly longer because of the change, but experience with the new setup probably will shrink the stopwatch eventually.
Dr. Roy S. Herbst, chief of medical oncology at Yale University and a nationally recognized expert in the treatment of lung cancer, shares those reservations. Herbst says that without seeing new stats, it's not that impressive. For the moment, he added, I am not too worried about people not being able to go to Cuba.
Georgia held two recounts of its presidential election results, both reaffirming Biden's win in the state. Wisconsin had one recount that confirmed Biden's victory there.
We believe, and I believe, that what will happen on Jan. 6 is an official discussion will take place in Washington whereby we re-challenge the states to actually make a determination based upon the current facts that have since been developed as opposed to decisions made over a month ago, he said.
Los Angeles officials will formally announce a new app for Apple and Android smartphones Thursday that may give residents a few seconds to prepare for an earthquake. Similar to an Amber Alert, ShakeAlertLA will give warnings when significant shaking starts nearby, ideally allowing users to get to a safe place. The U.S. Geological Survey has been developing the alert system for the West Coast since 2006, ShakeAlertLA says. Users will only receive alerts for earthquake and aftershocks over 5.0 magnitude, which are deemed capable of creating damage and affecting public safety.
Trenton: More than 70% of the state's supply of COVID-19 vaccine had not been used as of Thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. Of the 265,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered to New Jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by Thursday afternoon. Despite months of planning, state officials said Wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. Remember, you need health care workers to do this, Gov. Phil Murphy said at a briefing. I'm not qualified to deliver these vaccines. The slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 New Jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the rollout of the Moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before Christmas. Persichilli said 57% of the state's stockpile of Pfizer doses had been administered as of Wednesday, calling it one of the highest percentages that I've seen nationally.

Louisville: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. The previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Kentucky ranked No. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Boyle, Lawrence and Clinton counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Jefferson County, with 2,743 cases; Fayette County, with 1,170 cases; and Kenton County, with 702. Weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week's pace were in Oldham, Hardin and Jefferson counties. The share of Kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.

Stamford: The town has voted to overturn in its community Gov. Phil Scott's emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The select board of the town of about 800 people along the Massachusetts border voted 3-2 Tuesday to terminate the governor's restrictions. The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor's order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements violate the constitution in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. Scott hasn't enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, but that could change. Potvin said Friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of Vermont, but until it's cleared up, the governor's orders are still in effect.

Samberg said Gervais delivered his trademark, edgy comedy. That's what he does. He doesn't care. He goes for it. He's a very brave comic, said the actor, whose Fox series recently moved to Tuesday as part of a two-hour comedy block. I think he embodies what comedy is, really about where he'll say the things that chill the room, but then he wins them back with a really great punch line, which is impressive. He doesn't back off anything.

Bozeman: Montana PBS has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. The new schedule for the Learn at Home broadcast was set to launch Monday and continue through the end of the school year June 4, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. We know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a TV that receives our broadcast signal, Montana PBS Director of Education Nikki Vradenburg said. Chief Operator Paul Heitt-Rennie estimated most households have tuned into the Learn at Home program. He said Nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. Every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going, Vradenburg said.

We are not naive. We fully expect most if not all Democrats, and perhaps more than a few Republicans, to vote otherwise. But support of election integrity should not be a partisan issue. A fair and credible audit — conducted expeditiously and completed well before January 20 — would dramatically improve Americans' faith in our electoral process and would significantly enhance the legitimacy of whoever becomes our next president. We owe that to the people.
Jason Garrett's legacy with the Dallas Cowboys will always be that of someone who strived for greatness every day that he walked through the door, and as someone who instilled the virtues of enthusiasm, hard work and appreciation for the profession in all of the men who played with him and for him, Jones said in the statement. He is, and always will remain, a cherished member of the Dallas Cowboys family.
Unlike a few decades ago, retirees are leaving California, instead choosing other states in the Pacific West and Mountain West, Stoll added.
Keays has stage 4 lung cancer. As his treatment options appeared to be dwindling this fall, he went to Cuba for a vaccine treatment despite a federal law that prohibits Americans from going there for health care. Now, with President Trump's recent tightening of the regulations governing travel to Cuba, it has become much harder to travel there. But Keays needs more of the vaccine. This spring, he's going back.
Both moves were predictable, as was the release of Baalke, whose success as a GM with the 49ers now, it's clear, was dependent on how Jim Harbaugh molded and improved the players Baalke gave him. Baalke won a power struggle with Harbaugh, who headed to Michigan. The Niners became historically bad without him, and Baalke's choice of Kelly to work with such a weak roster looks worse than hiring caretaker Jim Tomsula after Harbaugh left. At least Tomsula went 5-11, three more victories than Kelly managed.

Later that year, Judge David Stras, whom Trump nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit, wrote an opinion backing wedding videographers' First Amendment rights to refuse to provide services at same-sex weddings. The judge wrote that the videographers have creative control over wedding videos and have the right to decline requests for services from clients who contradict their views that marriage is solely between a man and a woman.
We went into this election with the country deeply divided [and] deeply polarized. And we've seen in the last two months unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, Cruz alleged. He continued, I think we in Congress have an obligation to do something about that. We have an obligation to protect the integrity of the democratic system.
The advantages of this approach go well beyond the reduction in force numbers. By laying out a plan designed to last for several years, Washington would be avoiding the drama and the huge consumption of policy bandwidth associated with annual Afghanistan policy reviews that have typified the latter Obama and Trump years.

The philosophy of this diet is in the name. The Paleo diet encourages people to eat foods that would have been available to our Paleolithic ancestors. In case you need to brush up on your high school science, the Paleolithic era started 2.5 million years ago. Basically, with this diet you're looking at meals that could either be hunted or gathered — lean meats, fish, vegetables, nuts and seeds. And, because farming hadn't been developed yet in the Paleolithic era, Paleo dieters are expected to cut out foods that became popularized through farming like dairy products, legumes and grains, as well. Those who follow the Paleo diet believe that modern eating habits don't suit our prehistoric genetic makeup, so we should return to Stone Age-approved meals.

Donald Trump got caught red handed. He used taxpayer-funded military aid to bribe a foreign government to help his reelection; it's an open-and-shut case. Naturally, Trump's Republican political allies are very upset that he got caught. Like a Scooby-Doo villain, they think he would have gotten away with it if not for that meddlesome whistleblower.

He doesn't exactly have the most athletic look or leap out of the gym, but he's elevated the Western Conference-leading Nuggets to new heights this season. Jokic is in line to become Denver's first All-Star since Carmelo Anthony in 2010-11 and is being mentioned in the MVP conversation.
Denver: A day after Gov. Jared Polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. The governor cited improving statewide COVID-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including Denver and the entire Front Range, but his announcement Wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the Denver Post reports. It appears that if there's enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that's kind of frustrating, said Mark Johnson, executive director of Jefferson County Public Health. The announcement came a day after Colorado said it had confirmed the United States' first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. We don't believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with Christmas, New Year's or the new variant that is more infectious, Johnson said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo started having a tough 2020 only one day into the new year. He was forced to postpone his trip to Kyiv, Ukraine, this week to attend to the new crisis in Iraq. As fraught as Pompeo's visit to Kyiv was going to be, in the shadow of the impeachment battle, Iraq trumped Kyiv after the New Year's Eve attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

The majority of people in this country are a lot more sensible than what you see in Washington.

In other words, as long as you find full-time employment within three months or so of moving, you can still get the tax break. Distance test: According to the IRS' wording, Your new workplace must be at least 50 miles farther from your old home than your old job location was from your old home. If you had no previous workplace, your new job location must be at least 50 miles from your old home. While this is a bit technical, the point is that your move needs to be sufficiently far away from your old job location to justify the tax break.

Sioux Falls: A federal judge says a state court can't use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a Codington County trial. U.S. District Judge Charles B. Kornmann also criticized South Dakota's response to the pandemic, saying it has done little, if anything, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Kornmann ordered that unless the Codington County state court resolves Matthew Kurtenbach's May 2019 case by Jan. 15, Kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. South Dakota cannot 'take advantage' of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials, the judge wrote. Kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. At one point, Kornmann directly criticized Gov. Kristi Noem's actions during the pandemic. The Governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. She has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading, the judge wrote.

The Baltimore Sun reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are collaborating with the state's public health lab, as well as state laboratories in California and Delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. There have been at least two cases of the COVID-19 variant identified in the U.S., one in California and another in Colorado. A Maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in Maryland. The CDC has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. But it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.

Phoenix: Despite a surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Doug Ducey on Saturday rejected the state's top education official's call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. Given the severity of our state's situation and the virus's trajectory after the holiday period, schools need a two-week quarantine period for education leaders and local officials to use local health data to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities, Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said in a Twitter thread. Hoffman called for the two-week quarantine period for schools after the Department of Health Services on Saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known COVID-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. However, Ducey spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the governor will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. This is a local decision. The online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: Kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely. Many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.

Dallas: Coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly Saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. Texas reported 12,319 COVID-19 patients in hospitals Saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. But even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from Friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. Intensive care units in several parts of Texas were full or nearly full, with 626 ICU beds available statewide Saturday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 487 probable cases. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Texas came back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Augusta: Protesters gathered outside the Maine Statehouse on Saturday to criticize how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. WABI-TV reports the protest organized by the Swinging Gate Organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. There's this undercurrent of pent-up energy that's not doing well under this governor's rule, and it's important to harness that organic energy that's out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied, said event organizer Dick Campbell. More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced Sunday. One additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. Just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on Dec. 19 to 528 on Saturday.

Shortly after Nancy Pelosi returns as House speaker and Democrats reclaim the House majority Thursday, they will put their new political power to the test by moving to reopen the federal government. Democratic leaders have scheduled two votes on a package of bills to end the shutdown and give Congress more time to negotiate a deal with the White House over border funding. But the bills still must clear the GOP-controlled Senate, and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, has said he won't call for a vote to end the standoff unless President Donald Trump backs it.
Assistants were not formally notified about Garrett's future before Jones' statement to reporters, the person said. Even coaches whose contracts expired earlier last week continued to report to the Star on Friday after their contracts ended. Not until Saturday were they told by text message they no longer needed to come in. This was all part of a curious timeline that led to the team interviewing ex-NFL coaches Marvin Lewis and Mike McCarthy, per multiple reports, before officially announcing Garrett's exit Sunday during the third quarter of the wild-card game between the Eagles and Seahawks.
Some priorities for the Ravens this offseason:
The league has avoided pushing teams to hire one candidate or another.
I like Jim Schwartz. I love his defense, defensive end Brandon Graham said. I think sometimes because of injuries and certain things that happen, the defense that he runs, I feel like I'm always in position to make plays. Sometimes, it's tough. We don't have the personnel to do certain things, like McLeod going down. That's our general in the back that keeps everything together.
Depending on who you talk to, dieting is life-changing, terrible for you, optimistic, misguided, will keep you alive or put you in an early grave.
Davidson tweeted that he planned to object to electors from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – all states won by Biden – saying those states failed to uphold the equal protection principle of 'one person, one vote.' 
Mornhinweg was promoted from quarterbacks coach to his current position in early October after Harbaugh dismissed Marc Trestman. Despite the shift, Baltimore finished 17th in total offense and was ranked 28th in yards rushing.
In recent months, Latinos have been courted to run for congressional seats in Texas, Colorado and New Mexico. At the local level, Regina Romero was elected in early November as the first female mayor of Tucson, Arizona's second-largest city, making her the only Latina mayor in the 50 largest cities in the U.S. In 2018, Democrat Michelle Luján Grisham, a 12th-generation New Mexican, was elected as the first Latina Democratic governor of New Mexico. She replaced Susana Martinez, a Latina Republican.

Castro said he and his brother entered politics because they grew up watching Latinos raise their voices as activists and successfully run for office. In 1992, San Antonio-born Henry Bonilla was the first Hispanic Republican from Texas elected to Congress. And in 1981, Henry Cisneros became one of the first Latino mayors in the U.S. when he was elected by San Antonio voters. San Antonio had not had a Latino mayor since the 1800s, before Texas became a state. Later, Cisneros was appointed by former President Bill Clinton as U.S. secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
Those are both the worst rankings in Schwartz's five seasons with the Eagles. But injuries have ravaged all three position groups on defense during the season.

The four major bowls that are not semifinals each year essentially divvy up the best of the non-playoff teams, also creating some attractive matchups. And, of course, the remaining bowls — a staggering 33 in all this season — are still around to provide a smorgasbord of postseason games/television programming from mid-December to the first day of the new year.
Concerted action to curtail Iran's malign behavior, human rights abuses, unlawful detention of Americans and state sponsorship of terrorism remains very necessary. Had Trump stayed in the Iran deal and not only used the remaining sanctions in the U.S. toolbox but also built a coalition of diplomatic partners to challenge Iran to truly join the community of nations, we would be in a very different place today.

Wilmington: After health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, announced the state's decision during Gov. John Carney's weekly coronavirus press briefing Tuesday. Front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, U.S. Postal Service workers and grocery store workers. The group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. But these people likely won't start getting the vaccine until mid- to late January due to the limited supply of the vaccine. Please be patient with us. There's just not enough vaccine for everyone right now, Rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. People who work in Delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in Delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.

Jefferson City: The chairman of the Missouri Veterans Commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since September. Tim Noonan told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday that he was resigning, citing comments Gov. Mike Parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. A summary of the investigation was released earlier in December, but Noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the Post-Dispatch to release the full report. Officials inside Parson's administration and state Sen. Jill Schupp, a Democrat from Creve Coeur, had urged Noonan to release the full report, and he did so after Attorney General Eric Schmitt directed him to, Noonan said. That came after Parson on Wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. I'm not going to worry about everybody's personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman, Parson said. I'm just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that's my whole focus. Noonan said he resigned because of those comments.

New Haven: Some of the city's public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. Superintendent Iline Tracey announced on the district website Thursday that officials are preparing for a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model starting Jan. 19. The New Haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last March. Officials in New Haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in September as other districts in Connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. A plan to reopen New Haven's schools on Nov. 9 was shelved amid rising COVID-19 cases. Tracey said schools will open Jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district's schools. Two schools, Quinnipiac School and West Rock School, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, Tracey said.

Jones praised coaches like Urban Meyer and Baylor's Matt Rhule, also giving the not-so-convincing vote of confidence that Garrett will be coaching in the NFL next year.

Keays is running into a similar problem since a recent scan showed that a mass on his liver is growing. Doebele, his oncologist, believes that means that neither the Vaxira nor the Tagrisso is working. Doebele has suggested Keays go off the Vaxira, in part, so that he might qualify for other treatments, but Keays continues to have faith. He's planning on returning to Havana in the spring for more of the vaccine. Keays intends to apply for a visa under the category of professional research arguing that he is a guinea pig for the Vaxira vaccine. He has become, after all, something of an expert on the subject. Over the past two years, he's tried a wide variety of treatments: two targeted therapies, multiple forms of radiation and a lot of meditation. He's been on Vaxira now for two months.

Vice President Mike Pence officially declared Biden the winner at 3:41 a.m. EST on Jan. 7, after lawmakers reconvened to complete the process following the violence at the Capitol. Votes to object to state results proceeded for only two states, Arizona and Pennsylvania, while others lacked the support needed to come to a vote. The efforts were unsuccessful.
Knowing what I know about those states, Mullin reportedly said in an interview. There's no way I could sit there in good faith and allow the electoral votes to move forward.
Acid is the enemy of the Alkaline diet. The thought behind this diet is to cut out foods that cause your body to produce acid – including meat, wheat, refined sugar, processed foods, dairy, eggs, canned food, packaged snacks, caffeine and alcohol. You may be thinking: what else is there to eat? The Alkaline diet approves of most fruits and vegetables, nuts, legumes, soybeans and tofu. These are foods that are alkaline — in other words have a pH value of 7, which is neutral, or above. Foods with a pH value below 7 are acidic, and therefore a no-go. That said, there is no solid science to support that regulating the pH values of your food will change the overall pH balance of your body. It will do that naturally. However, in general, eating a lot of fruits and veggies and avoiding processed foods will make you lose weight.

Honolulu: Residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the U.S., health officials said. The Hawaii Department of Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It has not been detected in Hawaii. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the United Kingdom and South Africa and in the U.S. in Colorado, California and Florida. All we know is that we have not yet found it, State Laboratories Division Dr. Edward Desmond said. We're going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures. The vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. Health officials have said about 25,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. Local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in December to 65,250.

Grassroots groups and larger ones like the Latino Vote Project have launched massive voter-registration drives in recent election cycles.

Given the opportunity, I'd like the potential head coaches that come through here to have a chance to spend a little time with him just so they get a feel for Sam, Maccagnan said. I do think that's actually one of the attractive parts of our job is that we have some good, young players. Again, we still have things we need to do and improve upon, but we have a lot of salary cap space. We have our draft picks and the idea of potentially working with a young quarterback like Sam is an attractive thing.
Even so, their capacities could, and almost surely would, grow in the absence of America's and NATO's extensive capabilities in intelligence, air power, unmanned systems and special forces. Thus, Trump would be wisest to claim partial credit for a partial drawdown while maintaining enough capacity to check al-Qaida and ISIS.

Salt Lake City: Less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of COVID-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, Deseret News reports. The initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted, said Rich Lakin, immunization program director with the Utah Department of Health. We hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days. Utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson Tom Hudachko said Thursday. More than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state Thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. What's making the difference, Hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. In Davis County, a mass drive-thru clinic at the Legacy Events Center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. At long-term care facilities, CVS and Walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.

New York: The New York City Sheriff's Department shut down a series of illegal New Year's Eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced Friday. More than 300 people gathered Thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th Street in Queens, the department said on Twitter. Five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. Deputies also raided an illegal gathering on Prince Street in Soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. Four people were charged with multiple offenses. The patrons were not wearing masks in the venue's overcrowded sixth floor. Deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at Stars Hall in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. The organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.

Calumet: A judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in Michigan's Upper Peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's administration got a restraining order against Cafe Rosetta in Calumet, a small town in Houghton County. Since November, bars and restaurants in Michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kristi Painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. She ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. I did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … I observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled 'Legal Fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,'  Painter said in a court filing.

Providence: The first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot Saturday. Dr. Christian Arbelaez, an emergency room physician at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the Providence Journal reports. The moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-Thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after Christmas and New Year's Day. It's this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone? Arbelaez said. Do we have capacity? Do we have front-line workers well enough? Those are all the things that worry me. More than 20,500 people have received their first shots in Rhode Island, according to state health officials.

A future force of 5,000 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, aided by 2,000 to 3,000 other NATO military personnel, would contrast with the late-2019 figure of 13,000 GIs there. It would be 95% less than the 100,000 U.S. troops commanded there by Gen. David Petraeus and then Gen. John Allen at the peak of the American presence in 2010-11. This lower level could probably achieved by 2022, though the glide path could be slowed if conditions required.

While Cuba is often recognized for its pristine beaches and throbbing rumbas, it is also home to a burgeoning biotechnology industry.

In the most recent of several Cuban trials, patients receiving Cimavax lived about three to five months longer than those who did not. Available to Cubans for free since 2011, it has been given to more than 5,000 patients worldwide.

Baton Rouge: With the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don't begin until Monday and require a scheduled appointment. The Louisiana Department of Health said Friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 Moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. Still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which Neel described as a promising sign. With thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.

We can trace the popularity of this diet back to Kelly Clarkson's praise of The Plant Paradox Cookbook by Dr. Steve Gundry. She said this book helped her achieve her recent weight loss. Gundry has a long, science-fiction-esque explanation about why plants high in lectins (a kind of protein) like beans, legumes and whole grains are bad for you. An extraordinarily simplified version of his theory is that lectins in the plants cause confusion in the immune system and inflammation. An extraordinarily dramatized version of his theory is that plants are waging war against us so we don't eat them and we're too dumb to adjust our diets. It's true lectins can be toxic in some cases, but much of Gundry's research is based on inconsistent evidence.

Brian Kemp and Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey announced Wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to Phase 1A – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. Some Augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. The Richmond County Sheriff's Office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. Dr. Stephen Goggans, the director of the East Central Health District, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.

Perhaps the biggest fad that's riding its wave of popularity right into 2019 is the Ketogenic, or Keto, diet. Celebs like Kourtney Kardashian, Al Roker and Vinny Guadagnino (who affectionately went by the nickname Keto Guido on the new seasons of Jersey Shore) have popularized the diet. Ketogenic diets are low on carbs and high on fat, which puts the body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is a metabolic state that happens when your body doesn't have enough carbohydrates for your cells to burn for energy. So, instead, it burns fat. The Keto diet is very effective at slimming your waistline, but does cause huge changes to your body that aren't always positive. U.S. News & World Report says that changing the way your body is fueled from carbs to fat can lead to leg cramps, dehydration, brain fog, dizziness and more.

The collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. Some COVID-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. California started the new year Friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. The state Department of Public Health on Saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed COVID-19 cases. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of Saturday with COVID-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. The southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don't have any more beds for COVID-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.
Kennedy previously announced he would join his 11 Republican colleagues and object to certifying Biden's Electoral College victory.
Biden won the Electoral College vote, 306 to 232. Those numbers are unlikely to change in Wednesday's count, since both houses of Congress must agree to accept objections. Democrats, who control the House of Representatives, and Republican leaders who are against the challenge will not vote to accept.

Even some of the harshest critics of the Iran nuclear deal now understand that the perfect is, indeed, the enemy of the good; that in volatile international situations, solid, incremental progress trumps chaos. The Iran nuclear deal was meant to prevent Tehran from getting a nuclear weapon. Such a capability would project even greater Iranian power in the Middle East and deter the ability of Washington and its allies to build a lasting peace in the region.

Just how effective are the vaccines they're smuggling into the country in their small refrigerated lunch boxes is unclear. Neither of the vaccines prevents cancer; rather, they are a kind of immunotherapy that prompts the body's immune system to battle the disease in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. In January, the Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center in Buffalo, N.Y., launched a clinical trial of Cimavax with Cuba's Center of Molecular Immunology, which developed the vaccine. It is the first such joint venture between the two countries since the Cuban revolution.

Iran's nefarious activities in the region have increased, because terror is not an expensive undertaking and so is largely immune from economic sanctions. Indeed, the IRGC has happily returned to controlling the lucrative black market under Trump's sanctions. And Iran, after complying with the deal for nearly three years, now confronted with maximum pressure and no diplomatic track, has begun to unwind its compliance.

Des Moines: A federal judge has rejected an argument by Tyson Foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. Tyson was sued in August by the family of Isidro Fernandez, who worked at the company's plant in Waterloo, after he died April 26 from complications of COVID-19. More than 1,000 Tyson workers tested positive for the virus in May, and at least six died. The families of Fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. Tyson fired seven managers in December after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. The Fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at Tyson's request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including President Donald Trump, when it remained open in April. But last Monday, U.S. District Judge Linda Reade rejected the argument.

Portland: A health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The worker, an employee at Wallowa Memorial Hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late Thursday. The health authority said vaccines for COVID-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a COVID-19 vaccine, health officials said in a press release. An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen, or if they must go to the hospital. Health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines.

The Cowboys started the season hot with the first 3-0 open of Garrett's career. But games against the struggling Giants, Redskins and Dolphins weren't indicative of how the Cowboys would perform against playoff contenders.

But four times they dropped matches by 4 points or fewer.

Albuquerque: More than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. That's about half of the companies that applied, the Albuquerque Journal reports. The number (of applications) that we couldn't fund was very hard for us, said Marquita Russel, CEO of the New Mexico Finance Authority, the state agency that administered the program. The state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by New Mexico lawmakers. The program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. About $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state's four largest cities. Russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. In all, 6,530 applications were funded. Russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.

Despite the nation's ballooning Hispanic population, Latinos running and winning political offices across the U.S. are too often an anomaly. Even in Hispanic-majority districts, Latinos don't run or win elections at the rates of their white counterparts, various studies show. Now, candidates such as Garcia – and his supporters – are looking to change that.
For too long, we lost our way, Ortega says, standing with his longtime friend Alfredo Gutierrez, who served for 14 years in the Arizona Legislature and has protested with Garcia. Too many Latinos thought they had to act white to win. Now, they're seeing the power in our own identity.

Brooks led the effort in the House of Representatives to reject Biden's Electoral College victory. The GOP congressman said he wanted to reject the electoral votes certified by states such as Georgia and Pennsylvania that he claims had flawed election systems.
The new GOP tax law just made it harder for states and localities to raise money because property and income tax deductions aren't worth as much as they were in 2017. Democrats warn that Trump also extinguished a major potential funding source for infrastructure – a tax on overseas corporate earnings once floated by Trump economic advisers – that was instead used to finance lower corporate tax rates.
Trump went on to allege fraud in the 2018 midterm elections and to imply there was something nefarious about the late changing vote totals in tight races, though such changes are routine in close elections where projections cannot be made immediately.

A popular diet that spurred a New York Times bestselling book, Whole30 encourages people to eat foods with as few ingredients as possible, and all those ingredients should be substances you know and can pronounce. A head of broccoli? Go for it. A piece of candy made with things like glycerin, citric acid, potassium sorbate, red 40 and soy lecithin? Not so much. The program's website claims that if you completely avoid foods such as alcohol, anything with added sugar, legumes, dairy and more, for 30 days, you will eliminate cravings, restore a healthy metabolism, heal the digestive tract, reduce systemic inflammation, and discover how these foods are truly impacting how you look, how you feel, and your quality of life. This program also advocates not stepping on a scale, to make the diet more about health than weight loss.

The Trump administration would like to move forward on a pilot program to tie pricing for certain costly Medicare drugs to what other countries pay — which is often dramatically lower than what U.S. customers pay. But even before the regulation has been formally proposed, big pharma has launched an all-out assault. Considering that doctors, hospitals and patient groups have also come out against it, I would give it a practically zero chance of moving forward.

Vancouver: Quartz Mountain Distillers was surprised last week by a $14,060 fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. Owner Randy Kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in April. The family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the Columbian reports. All distillers that made hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic were facing the fine. The Department of Health & Human Services on Thursday announced it was directing the FDA not to enforce the fine after the FDA received heavy backlash on social media. Small businesses who stepped up to fight COVID-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so, the Department of Health & Human Services said on Twitter. Kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. If the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. I'd just have to lock the door and walk away, he said.

Raleigh: COVID-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with COVID-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state's hospitals. Two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. That's a difference of 793 people. On Friday, the last day for which data is available, the state's health department says 13.6% of COVID-19 tests came back positive. That brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least April. The average is seen as giving a better indication of COVID-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. Every day since Christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including Thursday's record-high 15.5%.

The point is that charitable organizations need money all year round, not just at the end of the year. For 2017, consider giving to charity steadily throughout the year. For example, if you donate to your local animal shelter like I do, consider handing them a donation check in, say, May. Of course, they'll appreciate your donations whenever they come, but it could be an especially welcome gift if it comes at a time of limited cash flow.

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — Germany's football president is against enlarging the World Cup.
Concord: The state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run COVID-19 vaccination sites when it moves to Phase 2. Perry Plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. He told WMUR-TV the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. We expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we're ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the State of New Hampshire as quickly as possible, Plummer said. The first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. The second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. As of Friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.

Cheyenne: Bars and restaurants across the state will be allowed to return to normal operating hours beginning next Saturday as COVID-19 hospitalizations decline in the state. Gov. Mark Gordon made the announcement last Saturday, praising businesses for adapting to health orders and thanking the people of Wyoming who recognized the strain on their hospitals and health care workers and acted accordingly, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. These have not been easy times for anyone, he said. We are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state's schools and businesses to continue to remain open. The updated health orders allow bars and restaurants to resume on-site consumption from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., and they allow gyms to increase the number of participants in group fitness classes from 10 to 25. Counties can still opt out of the requirements if local conditions move to safer levels in accordance with White House metrics.

But that latter argument ignores history, as well as the geographic suppleness of global extremist movements in general. Few saw the ISIS caliphate coming in Iraq and Syria before 2014 but then, all of a sudden, it was there. And the former argument shows a poor appreciation of how counterterrorism intelligence is developed — usually by cooperation with partners on the ground — as well as an unrealistic appreciation for the geographic remoteness or ruggedness of the Hindu Kush. Standoff counterterrorism is generally an oxymoron.

Las Vegas: Community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state's diverse communities and reach out in Spanish and other languages as Nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. Erika Marquez, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas public health professor and vice chair of the Nevada Minority Health & Equity Coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. We had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time, Marquez told the Las Vegas Sun. Nevada is a diverse state with a 29% Latino population that includes native Spanish speakers. Nevada also has a fast-growing group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than English at home, according to data shared by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Marquez's coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Thai.

Oklahoma City: The state has reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. Oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus Friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said Saturday. The Oklahoma State Department of Health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. There were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in Oklahoma on New Year's Day, according to the department. The state's record was set last Monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in Oklahoma hospitals. Over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Some will say terrorism in and near Afghanistan can be checked even without an American military presence on the ground, even if our departure leads to all-out civil war and/or a victory by the Taliban. Perhaps any future al-Qaida or ISIS presence on Afghan soil could be handled with long-range strikes or occasional commando raids that emanated from ships in the Indian Ocean. Or perhaps we could be confident that such groups have no substantial future interest in basing themselves in Afghanistan.

The national championship game is a prime-time affair, which provides a ratings boost, but there are plenty of other viewing options on a Monday night. And since many people have to work the next morning, the lack of a competitive game can be a real drain on the numbers.
It's more than just a stadium, Goodell said. It's a project, an entertainment complex, that we believe will be responsive to the kind of things that we need to be successful with our fans in the Los Angeles market.
For hoops fans, there's nothing like the Saturday semifinals, with back-to-back games a mere half-hour apart, matching the four best teams in the land. The national championship game, played two nights later in the same venue, often comes across as a letdown.

American doctors are not so sure. While some are cautiously optimistic about Cimavax and await the outcome of the Roswell trial with interest, others complain that the vaccine has been oversold and is in sore need of further study. Dr. Robert Doebele, associate professor of medical oncology at the University of Colorado- Denver and a senior editor of the American Association for Cancer Research's journal Clinical Cancer Research, recalls sitting in a meeting with a dozen other oncologists discussing the best way to market a drug.

Indianapolis: Anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among Hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state's top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. Many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by COVID-19 itself, Jennifer Sullivan, secretary of the state's Family and Social Services Administration, said during Gov. Eric Holcomb's weekly briefing Wednesday on the state's coronavirus response. That includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. Cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. As a way to help, Sullivan encouraged Hoosiers to use the state-run BeWellIndiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. Since April, more than 25,000 Hoosiers have completed those assessments. For more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, Sullivan said.
Gervais lost his shock and awe
Ellen DeGeneres won the Globes' Carol Burnett Award for excellence in television, and although she had her own acceptance speech, she was overshadowed by Saturday Night Live star Kate McKinnon's introduction. McKinnon was funny (listing all the clothes she wore doing her DeGeneres impressions) and deeply moving as she recalled how DeGeneres boosted her confidence as a young gay woman. She risked her entire life and her entire career to tell the truth, McKinnon said. That mix of hilarity and heart is exactly the kind of thing an awards-show host needs. Maybe McKinnon will step up next year.

The Trump administration has also proposed allowing Medicare to restrict what drugs would be covered by health plans that negotiate prices on behalf of the 45 million seniors who participate in the Medicare Part D program. The tactic, commonly used in the private sector and in other countries, is to avoid the use of very expensive medications when there are cheaper versions that are therapeutically equivalent. Despite the drug industry's impressive ability to kill measures like this, I would give it an 80 percent chance of becoming law in a watered-down form.
Collins talked about his decision in the show, saying that he still believes it was the wrong one but he has moved on:
Fort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is prioritizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to those who speak Dakota and Lakota languages. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KXMB-TV the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. It's something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. We don't have it in black and white; we tell stories. That's why it's so important, Faith said. The Standing Rock reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in North Dakota. Faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. Front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the Fort Yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. In addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. Tribal Health Director Margaret Gates said the Lakota and Dakota speakers are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.
The Eagles' dream has already been messed up.
If you defend the legal process instead of making the point that he attacks and belittles the very law enforcement officials who caught him, you're leaving voters behind. If you find yourself explaining the lack of prosecution after the Mueller report, hush money and Individual 1 by citing the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel guidance rather than explaining that Trump essentially has immunity, you're falling into his trap.

Chicago: The state's public health department reported 29 COVID-19-related deaths Saturday, the smallest one-day total in Illinois since mid-November. Not only was the total, included in a news release from the Illinois Department of Public Health, lower than any single day since Nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. The latest numbers bring the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. The health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. But the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. The cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on New Year's Day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.

What they are going for is part of the new wave of immunotherapy treatment that works by triggering a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Cimavax, for example, stimulates the immune system to make antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor, or EGF, that cancer cells need to grow, effectively starving the cancer. Vaxira is somewhat different; it triggers an immune response against a molecule specific to several cancers and is intended to ultimately block the cancer's growth. Only patients who have already received chemotherapy are eligible for the vaccines.

Just how to bring the vaccine into the U.S. is a hot topic on the online health care social network, Inspire, which supports a lung cancer group of about 53,000 members. Judy Ingels, 74, is one of them. Diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer in 2015, Ingels went on Tarceva and her tumor shrunk somewhat. After she saw a CNN report on Cimavax at the end of 2016, she decided to go to Cuba while she was relatively well and still able to do so. Last spring, she and her family traveled from their home in Santa Rosa, Calif., to Havana, where she received her first treatment of the vaccine. All told, the trip cost about $16,000.

The president certainly gave Sen. Toomey credit for what he had previously done on this issue. I think there are a lot of other things on which the President and Sen.

Toomey does when it comes to gun safety and keeping guns out of the hands of those who shouldn't have them, if not a better one.
Nonetheless, the mission has not been an abject failure. The Afghan government continues to hold all major and midsize cities as of this writing. Even more to the point for Americans, the United States has not again been attacked by a group that plotted or organized its aggression from within Afghan borders.

You want to be able to handle yourself well at those critical moments and we've done a good job in that in the past, Garrett said. Sometimes this year we have not done a good enough job.

Fleischmann voted to support objections for both contested states.
Overwhelmingly the constituents in this district, and myself, believe that there was an extensive amount of fraud in this election that essentially disenfranchised us, as Trump supporters and as Texas voters here, the freshman congressman and former White House doctor said.
But in the end, Biden and Harris will be inaugurated as the next president and vice president at noon on Jan. 20.

Facebook says:It's cracking down on deepfakes, manipulated media
Unlike with taxes, which passed with a simple majority, Trump will need to reach a 60-vote threshold in the Senate to pass infrastructure legislation – which means he'll need at least nine Democrats to sign on board. And many have said they are skeptical of placing so much responsibility for public works in the hands of private investors and localities.
Higgins announced he would object to the certification of the Electoral College votes, writing in a statement that I will take every legal and Constitutionally-available action to ensure a righteous outcome. That includes objecting to the electoral slates from disputed states.

Josh first flew to Venezuela last year to marry his fiancée, Thamara Caleno Holt, a young Venezuelan woman whom he fell in love with after months of constant correspondence. Just days after their marriage, the newlyweds were detained on spurious charges — for allegedly possessing weapons and engaging in espionage.

Each story she discovers – whether it's infant Katie, an enslaved girl who was listed on the deed of the plantation when it was sold to John C. Calhoun's son in 1854, or Jimmie Gunn, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based musician who was invited to perform on Clemson's all-white campus in the 1930s – is vital, the Calhoun Lemon professor of literature said.
Philadelphia: Scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south Philadelphia stomping grounds for a New Year's celebration of Mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd Street in South Philadelphia on Friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. Some wore masks, but many did not. Mayor Jim Kenney announced in July that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. Some Mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. City spokeswoman Lauren Cox said there were no major issues Friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic. She urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.
For every instance of Georgia failing to follow its own state law in verifying signatures, of Pennsylvania accepting mail ballots after the legal deadline set by its state legislature, or folks from outside Nevada casting a ballot in that state — the value of every Missourians' vote is diminished. That's not right. And we cannot simply look the other way.

Since Floyd's death, Clemson University trustees voted to remove two names of men known for racism, Calhoun and Benjamin Tillman.

Benjamin Pitchfork Tillman was a governor and white supremacist whose name adorned Clemson's most iconic building.
Yet, the firings of Chip Kelly and Trent Baalke in San Francisco, Mike McCoy in San Diego, and the resignation of Gary Kubiak for health reasons in Denver certainly rang true to those rock classics.
With a clean slate, Lewis hopes that Teryl Austin can provide the same kind of boost that Zimmer's reboot did when the Bengals became a perennial top-eight defense in the league from 2009-13.

To say I was ravaged by this illness would be an understatement. Of the 31 days I spent on the intensive care unit, 18 of them were spent on a ventilator. I lost 80 pounds, and could not even turn over in bed on my own. But more intense than the loss of weight (I needed to lose some) and the loss of strength was the never ending awareness that I could not get enough air.
Of course, Trump administration policy could change dramatically before Election Day as well. Absent a comprehensive peace deal with the Taliban by next fall that also involves the Afghan government — an extreme long shot, given the lukewarm interest that the Taliban as well as their sometimes-sponsor Pakistan likely have in the idea — President Trump will face a dilemma. He will have to choose between his original campaign promise to end forever wars and leave Afghanistan, on the one hand, or his promise to defeat global terrorism and protect America on the other.

The Mediterranean diet advocates heart-healthy foods that are typically eaten in the Mediterranean. The diet guides people to eat plenty of plants and foods that are low on bad cholesterol, such as legumes, nuts, wheat, fruits and veggies. For example, in this diet, you replace butter with healthy fats like olive oil, salt with herbs and spices, and red meat with fish and poultry. Plus, it totally encourages a glass of red wine every now and then. In essence, you're not avoiding fats and carbs, you're just choosing the healthier versions.
