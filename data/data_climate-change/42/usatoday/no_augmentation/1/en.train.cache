provo: the state's number of drug overdose suicides has potentially been underreported by 33%, according to a new study. published in the journal suicide and life-threatening behavior, the study came to the conclusion after looking at 2,665 overdose deaths from 2012 to 2015 in utah, the provo daily herald reports. paul nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. if you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, nestadt said. state health officials say roughly 630 utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000. according to the study, that rate could be significantly higher.

hancock county: a huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a new orleans spacecraft factory on wednesday to a barge that will float it up the mississippi river for testing. the recently completed core stage of nasa's space launch system, which dwarfed the hundreds of nasa and boeing employees, was to be taken to the stennis space center in hancock county, about 50 miles northeast of new orleans. space launch system rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of nasa's artemis program. the core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant carnival float from the michoud assembly center in eastern new orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. it will undergo tests at stennis ahead of the first artemis launch, planned for 2021, said tony castilleja, a systems engineer with the boeing space team. the sls core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage nasa has assembled since the apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the moon. it will be used for artemis i, a test-flight without a crew. artemis ii is to send up a crewed spacecraft. the third mission, artemis iii, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to mars.

the second factor is that this isn't exactly a fair market. among traditional equities, like the stock market, an investor has the opportunity to buy, sell, and even bet against an equity. money can be made if an equity moves up or down. with nearly all cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin, buying or selling is the only option. there is no way to make money if a cryptocurrency goes down, which naturally tends to incentivize buying. this probably won't last forever, but it's played a key role in pushing prices higher.

wilmington:a record number of vehicles crossed the delaware memorial bridge from new jersey into the first state last year. in 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the delaware river and bay authority. put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. that is twice the earth's circumference, with a road trip from delaware to myrtle beach, s.c. to spare. the bridge also had a record for a month in august, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the august 2003 record by 27,000. officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. all those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. for passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from new jersey into delaware.

i'm certainly not calling for last-place finishers jon gruden (4-12) and matt patricia (6-10) to get axed after one year with the raiders and lions, respectively — although it was reasonable to expect some quick, parcells-like magic from coach chucky, given that 10-year, $100 million contract. both coaches need more time with their rebuilding jobs. but their cases, in comparison, makes the cardinals' handling of wilks that much more tragic.

after a week of soul searching, discussions with our black, brown, and white peers, and consultations with our families, we, the undersigned nominees in this category have come to the conclusion that it's in the best interest of our genre for us to decline our nominations. we respectfully ask that our names be removed from final round ballots. we are deeply grateful to the recording academy and its voting members for the honor we've received, but we can't in good conscience benefit from a process that has – both this year and historically – so overlooked women, performers of color, and most especially black performers. unfortunately, this year's slate of all white nominees, only one of whom is female, is not an aberration for children's music. in the past 10 years, only about 6% of nominated acts have been black led or co-led, another 8% or so have been non-black poc-led, and around 30% have been female-led. these numbers would be disappointing in any category, but – in a genre whose performers are uniquely tasked with modeling fairness, kindness, and inclusion; in a country where more than half of all children are non-white; and after a year of national reckoning around race and gender – the numbers are unacceptable. we take full responsibility for putting ourselves in the position we're in. we chose to submit and distribute our albums to voters, even as we were aware of this category's past history of exclusion.

it's now time to forget about dwayne rudd's helmet toss and bottlegate, about johnny manziel's swan and josh gordon's missteps, about a coach or gm being fired hours after the season finale almost every year. it's time to burn that jersey bearing the names of the 30 browns starting quarterbacks since 1999.

5. rams rb todd gurley made the most of his 18 touches saturday, gaining 111 yards. but he wasn't involved enough. l.a. was 9-0 this season when he had at least 20 combined carries and receptions. when he didn't, the rams were just 2-5. the falcons clearly tried to put saturday night's game on the right arm of rams qb jared goff rather than let gurley beat them. the strategy worked as goff's playoff inexperience was evident at times.
as talented as alabama is, this was probably the sixth-best team out of saban's nine years. it's clearly behind 2011, 2009 and 2012 and probably behind 2010, the underachiever that lost three games but had perhaps saban's most talented roster. you can even make an argument alabama was better in 2013 when it was on the verge of going 12-0 and likely playing for a national title until auburn's kick six miracle.

they're going to challenge receivers and not give up easy stuff, and that comes from (saban's) time with belichick, where he learned a lot of sophisticated defensive coverage and concepts, brown said. it's not what saban calls country zones, where you just drop to a spot and watch the quarterback's eyes.
parker said the other thing that struck him about kelleher was that he eschewed typical ceo speak when discussing southwest's success. rather than brag about southwest's plentiful profits and strong stock market performance, he always focused on the airline's people.

1. jaguars — trevor lawrence, qb, clemson: we've already reached nitpicking season in the first week of january. yes, lawrence was outplayed by justin fields in the college football playoff semifinal that ended the clemson star's decorated collegiate career. and the jaguars should — and will — comb over all of their options, including fields, at this spot. but this shouldn't be a difficult decision. lawrence is every bit the singular quarterback and franchise-changing prospect he has been billed as for years. any drama about this selection in the coming months is likely to be merely for show.
diaz (19-11 mma, 14-9 ufc) hasn't fought since losing one helluva rematch with conor mcgregor at ufc 202, which was forever ago – nearly 17 months at this point. last year, diaz was offered to fight tony ferguson – which he initially accepted only to change his mind – and, depending on who you believe, tyron woodley for a shot at the welterweight title.

trenton: all 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, trenton officials said thursday. the announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the delaware river and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of ewing, hamilton, hopewell and lawrence. pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and trenton water works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to david smith, the water works chief engineer. residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, democratic mayor reed gusciora said. that's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. about 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

the housing market in southeastern idaho is booming, with home prices soaring. nowhere is this more true than in lava hot springs, where houses are being bought up before they're even listed, sometimes for well above asking price. second homes are a hot commodity here. there aren't many houses to begin with, and because of the town's layout, it's hard to build new ones. plus, most of the people moving into town really only want vacation homes. one local real estate agent said 8 out of 10 people who ask her about buying a home in this tourist town are looking for second homes. and most of those people are also looking to rent out their homes when they're not around to recoup some of the costs of the mortgage.

some subscribe to the theory that the government we should want is a divided government, one where the excesses of one party can all be checked by the other. but that's a theory, if you subscribe to it, for a time when we are not in the throes of the largest national crisis in a century. that may be a theory for when we are not at war. a theory for a time americans shouldn't have to wonder whether government inaction means they won't have enough money to eat, or keep their homes, if they are unemployed.

killingly: the killingly board of education voted to bring back a controversial native american-themed athletic mascot. the board decided to reinstate the redmen mascot at a meeting wednesday, the norwich bulletin reported. in october, the same board approved the new red hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at killingly high school. several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. it featured the profile of a native american man wearing a headdress. newly elected republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. the board, with a republican majority, held a public meeting on dec. 11 where it voted to remove the red hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. more than a dozen people, including students and native american representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. they also sought some other compromise, the bulletin reported. at the wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray native americans in a negative stereotype.

miami also signed 14 players in the early period. those recruits thought they'd be playing for mark richt, but he retired (at age 58) rather than continue trying to rebuild the hurricanes program. his former defensive coordinator, manny diaz, is taking over, so at least there's that bit of continuity.

montpelier: the number of fatalities on vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. vermont state police and the vermont agency of transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the times argus reported. but state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. lt. tara thomas, commander of safety programs for the vermont state police, said the reduction was unexplainable. thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. we wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. that's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. we're averaging just way too many each month, she said. the 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. the figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.

3. pitt's triplets: steelers qb ben roethlisberger, wr antonio brown and rb le'veon bell showed just how dangerous they could be in their first-ever playoff game together. big ben found brown for 50- and 62-yard td passes in the first quarter of sunday's wild-card win over the miami dolphins. bell, making his postseason debut and playing for a new contract, took over from there, adding two scores on the ground along with 174 yards from scrimmage. the trio was even more dominant in the october blowout of the chiefs, with roethlisberger passing for 300 yards and five touchdowns (2 to brown) while bell racked up 178 yards from scrimmage. however it must be noted that big ben has been ordinary, at best, on the road in 2016 (9 tds, 8 ints, 59.4% completion rate, 78.4 rating) and must now also cope with a foot injury suffered against miami.

consistently putting three players onto the court at 6-foot-2 or smaller, along with the 6-foot-4 banks and the lone big man in ayton, hillcrest isn't a team that wows its opposition in size, but it has ridden its grit-and-grind philosophy to a 10-2 record on the year — the most recent game also coming at mustang madness, a 72-60 loss to an advanced prep international team it beat earlier in the season.

in addition, democratic control of the senate likely includes democrats chairing committees instead of republicans, although a 50-50 split may result in equal party representation in the membership of committees. this matters in the college-athlete context because wicker has been leading the commerce committee, and his version of a bill was referred to that committee. the bill from booker and blumenthal was crafted in a fashion that resulted in it being referred to the judiciary committee, a panel on which both of them serve.

augusta: a group of republican lawmakers plans to travel to the statehouse on tuesday to call on their colleagues to get back to work, accusing democratic leaders of dragging their feet. legislative leaders countered that the work already is underway and that the appropriations committee is meeting tuesday. republicans protested in the summer and fall when the legislature failed to reach a consensus for reconvening during the pandemic. the current plan is for the bulk of committees to convene in a few weeks. republican rep. shelley rudnicki, of fairfield, said her group will gather in the house chamber to make a point. we are a co-equal branch of government, and the governor is making decisions without any input from the legislature. it's time for us to get to work, said rudnicki, who accused the governor of unprecedented and draconian actions while the legislature was sidelined. republicans decried some of democratic gov. janet mills' executive orders imposed because of covid-19, but the legislature failed to reconvene when republicans and democrats couldn't agree on the scope of work to be conducted. rudnicki acknowledged tuesday's action is a symbolic gesture since both chambers are controlled by democrats.

omaha: despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the u.s. army corps of engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive missouri river flooding. the corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from gavins point dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. the corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. until a seasonal decrease that began in november, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. areas along the missouri river and its tributaries in parts of nebraska, kansas, iowa and missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. john remus, chief of the corps' missouri river management, told the omaha world-herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the national weather service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in january and february. the corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, remus told the associated press on wednesday. once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, remus said, limiting its capacity.

jackson: foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in grand teton national park. park officials closed a large area of the teton range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. grand teton spokeswoman denise germann said another attempt could take place in late january or early february. mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. the national park service has contracted oregon-based baker aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the jackson hole news & guide reported. wintry weather kept baker from making it to the area, germann said. park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.

spring hill:general motors and united auto workers local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective feb. 3. the decision resolves a dispute between gm in spring hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, chairman mike herron told the daily herald on thursday. under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in october, gm agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. none of the temporary workers in spring hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. the deal between gm and local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. the company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. on monday, gm announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 uaw-represented plants across the country. ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. at gm's flint assembly in michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.

just as the new tax laws limit the mortgage interest deduction, so, too, do they limit the extent to which you can deduct property taxes. in fact, going forward, your total salt (state and local tax) deduction maxes out at $10,000, whereas prior to 2018, it was unlimited. if you're thinking of buying a home in a low- or no-income tax state, and you don't expect your property tax bill to be particularly high, then the $10,000 cap won't impact you. but if you're buying a home in, say, new jersey, which boasts the highest property taxes in the nation, you may come to find that a portion of your property tax bill is non-deductible.

if you artificially put in rules like no shifting, players aren't going to try to hit the ball the other way. they don't have to because you can't shift. they're just going to reach back for more and everybody is going to pull the ball. i think the best way is when players make adjustments. one thing we need to do better as an industry is make people understand just how much we love our game and enjoy our game, and not just pick apart the things we don't like in our game. i don't think we always do that really well.

town: a man from illinois drove through wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. tommy mecher, an electrician apprentice from chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. i only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, mecher said. i put it on the roof in lemont, illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to bessemer, michigan. snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. there's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. but mecher purchased the 1990 polaris indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in bessemer last friday. mecher said it took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 chevy malibu, using an old blue ford tractor with a bucket. he modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. he secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

bismarck: officials say high winds caused a power outage that led to a produced water and oil spill in dunn county. the state department of environmental quality was notified monday of sunday's spill at a salt water disposal facility operated by hunt oil co., about 8 miles northwest of halliday. officials said the equipment failure caused by the power outage led to multiple tanks overflowing. initial estimates indicated about 27,720 gallons of produced water and 15,540 gallons of crude oil overflowed the tanks. most of the spill was contained on site, but winds blew some of the material onto pastureland. produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas development. it is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals.

mcelroy says alabama could have had similarly potent offenses in the past, but saban wasn't ready to completely change his philosophy. even a year ago against clemson in the college football playoff semifinal, the tide's preferred style with jalen hurts was to grind away and let the defense asphyxiate opponents. but now saban has empowered the (quarterback) position, according to mcelroy. and it's mostly because of tagovailoa.

the sole questions were whether a wide receiver, even one as dynamic as smith, had a chance against the overwhelming power of statistics. alabama doesn't have the only explosive offense in college football. offenses everywhere have exploded. while that does increase numbers for receivers, it causes potential exponential growth in a passing quarterback's output.

yet, despite all of this, dozens of republican members of congress have indicated that on jan. 6 they plan to challenge the electoral votes from some states president-elect biden won, something that has only occurred in both chambers twice in more than 120 years. in both historical cases, bipartisan majorities in congress voted to reject the challenge. and we know that they will do the same this year.
once we started playing defense, minnesota coach tom thibodeau said. i thought the last five minutes of the second quarter we got going. we got some stops. i thought (anthony tolliver) gave us a big lift. he hit a couple big 3s and that gave us the energy, gave us a lift, and the defense, i thought, in the second half was very good.

chapel hill: the university of north carolina board of governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. dth media corp., which publishes the daily tar heel student newspaper on the unc-chapel hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the board of governors and the state chapter of the sons of confederate veterans, news outlets reported on wednesday. the deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. unc-chapel hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. superior court judge allen baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. baddour approved an agreement on nov. 27 in which the scv agreed to take ownership of the silent sam statue and build a center to preserve it. the statue stood for more than a century on the chapel hill campus before protesters took it down in august 2018. the university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. in addition, unc-chapel hill paid the scv about $75,000 not to display confederate flags or similar banners on any unc system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.

this is the simplest of the smart home accessories. the amazon smart plug ($24.99) or the wemo switch smart plug ($34.99). you plug this into wall power and then put your pre-existing products (lamps, tv, radio, you name it) into the smart plug. from there, you can use an app, or voice assistant like alexa, to command the product to be turned on and off. amazon suggests using it with a coffee pot to start it in the morning from bed, but our coffee pot needs a filter, coffee, fresh water and a button that requires a physical turn on to get it going. but hey, no dispute about the lamp, right?

boise: u.s. officials have released a new plan involving methods to deal with a microscopic pest in southeastern idaho that threatens the state's billion-dollar industry that supplies a third of the nation's potatoes. the u.s. department of agriculture late last week released the final rule that takes effect at the end of january. it sets out years­long criteria for killing off the pests and reopening quarantined fields to production. the new rule follows a 2018 court decision in a lawsuit filed by potato farmers that found the u.s. government illegally quarantined some idaho potato fields infested with the pale cyst nematode first discovered in 2006. farmers with quarantined fields aren't allowed to sell potatoes grown in them. nematodes feed on potato roots and can reduce crop production by 80%. when the pests were first discovered, canada, mexico and korea would not accept idaho potatoes, and japan banned all u.s. potatoes. the countries ultimately lifted their bans, the latest coming late in 2017 when japan opened its market again.

chicago: o'hare and midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. the cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in illinois. the boxes are located just past the airports' transportation security administration checkpoints, the chicago tribune reported. although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, chicago police department spokeswoman maggie huynh said. the boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. the boxes are owned by the department of aviation and serviced by the police. police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, huynh said. illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.

st. george: more than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern utah, federal officials said. the proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. the bureau of land management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, the spectrum newspaper reported wednesday. blm is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, venhuizen said. details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. the draft is the first step in the year-long national environmental policy act, officials said. the utah division of transportation and washington county proposed building the northern corridor that would pass through the red cliffs national conservation area, officials said. a definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. after the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. a decision is expected by 2021.

new orleans: john white, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as louisiana's education superintendent. he told state board of elementary and secondary education members in a letter that he will leave the job march 11. he did not state his reasons. the board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. white can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. his tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and gov. john bel edwards. and the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of white. although he didn't discuss his future, the advocate reported in april that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, propel america, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. white has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state board of elementary and secondary education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.

seattle: mayor jenny durkan said seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. durkan included those directives in a green new deal executive order wednesday. neither the new keyarena now under construction at seattle center nor the massive seattle aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, durkan said. that's because the projects are underway, she said. both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. the $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, durkan's office said. there's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. last year, the council passed a green new deal resolution that said seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

this might seem obvious, but so many of us have become so good at putting off making positive change in our lives, and accepting a less positive version of reality, that it really bears mentioning. you know all of the things that make you feel angry, frustrated, and negative when it comes to your work world, and the truth is that some of those things aren't in our immediate power to change (if only we were able to choose our bosses…). that said, there are certainly things at work that bother us that we can change, and these are the things you should focus your energy and effort on. we suggest you start small. decorate your workspace so that it's more cheerful. try improving your communication and relationship with at least one colleague each week. take regular breaks during the day (but don't overdo it!) in an effort to combat burnout. you'll soon start seeing a wave of positive work-related feelings wash over you. then take on larger things, like those work responsibilities that you consistently dread or your interactions with your boss. remember — every positive step you make involving work, no matter how small, will help keep the weekend effect at bay.

seattle: king county is starting 2021 with plans to buy as many as a dozen hotels to permanently house hundreds of homeless people and provide them with services. we have every reason to believe that homelessness will get a lot worse after this pandemic unless we take bold action, said leo flor, director of the king county department of community and human services. the initiative is called health through housing, king5 reports. it uses revenue from a 0.1% sales tax increase to develop a network of apartment-like shelters, with the goal of getting people out of tents, off sidewalks and into safe, clean homes. the county hopes to eventually house 45%, or 2,000 people, of its chronically homeless population of 4,500. the goal for 2021 is to create housing units for 1,500 people countywide, in former hotels and nursing homes throughout the county. flor said hotel owners are already approaching the county and offering their properties, which are struggling to fill rooms during the pandemic.

while how the game plays out is always difficult to predict — half of the six title games have been decided by less than a touchdown and the other three by at least 17 points — the matchup will undoubtedly create a bump in the playoff's television ratings by drawing in viewers tired of seeing the same teams from the same geographic area meet for the championship.

boston: a group of families in the state is fighting a recent court ruling that found au pairs should be treated as employees entitled to minimum wage. an organization called au pair families of massachusetts is planning to lobby for legislation in the statehouse on wednesday, the boston globe reports. a federal court ruled dec. 2 that au pairs in massachusetts were entitled to earn state minimum wage and overtime, which could raise host families' costs by as much as $333 per week. many host parents agree au pairs should have additional protections but argue the new changes will make the program less accessible in a state that has some of the nation's highest child care costs. the au pair program, overseen by the u.s. state department, was launched as a cultural exchange program in which young people live with families in other countries while helping with child care and some housework. host families paid at least $197 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work before the ruling.

providence: legislative leaders said wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. a provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. democratic gov. gina raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. democratic house speaker nicholas mattiello and senate president dominick ruggerio said wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. however, they still took issue with how the department of business regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. the legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

as always, much of the focus will be on finding a franchise quarterback. with the no. 1 overall pick in the draft, the browns, who made a short-term investment in robert griffin iii , will have an opportunity to land a player that has almost taken on mythical proportions. cleveland has gone through 26 starters in 18 years and will continue to sputter and spin without an offensive leader.

southwest took its first look at cvg a decade ago, harvey said. that's about the time delta began a decade-long downsizing of some 600 flights at cvg, mostly due to the atlanta-based carrier's decision to focus on other markets after its merger with northwest airlines. but delta still had a strong enough grip on greater cincinnati to make cvg one of the nation's most expensive airports. the high fares still forced small and mid-sized company managers and vacationers to look mostly to dayton for cheaper flights.

while these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. the law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. this undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.

19. the saints earned a rematch with the vikings, who beat new orleans 29-19 in a week 1 contest that wasn't as close as the score indicates. but so much has changed. saints star rookie rb alvin kamara was stuck at the time behind since-traded rb adrian peterson. and minnesota's starting backfield in the opener was qb sam bradford and rb dalvin cook. the prologue really won't provide much insight for a preview to the divisional round.

moreover, nurmagomedov already has etched out an undeniable legacy. if he can add a few more layers to that, he honestly doesn't have much reason to keep going. if nurmagomedov can get through what many believe to be his biggest obstacle in tony ferguson at ufc 249 in april, then there really aren't many true challenges left for the eagle. another win after that would bring his career record to 30-0, and if that fight is a massive one, like his long-desired georges st-pierre superfight – or perhaps a conor mcgregor rematch – he pretty much will have done it all.

cable took nearly as much heat for his inability to develop an offensive line capable of properly protecting wilson and establishing the power run game carroll desired. cable was given resources in the draft and occasionally in free agency, but the line never had the consistency for seattle's offense to perform at its best.

chicago: the state will stop collecting fines against drivers who are ticketed after cameras catch them violating red lights, comptroller susana mendoza said monday. she said poor and minority motorists appear to be most affected by the $100 tickets, which can double if not timely paid. she also noted a federal investigation of relationships between some communities and a red light vendor. the new policy starts feb. 6. this system is clearly broken, mendoza said. i am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers. a 2012 state law allows local governments to use the comptroller's office to collect debts. unpaid traffic tickets, for example, can be deducted from tax refunds. mendoza said communities can hire private debt collectors instead.

honolulu: improvements in programs to address hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. state homeless coordinator scott morishige informed lawmakers tuesday that new york now holds the top position, the honolulu star-advertiser reported. morishige presented the data to the hawaii homelessness summit for both houses of the state legislature. the summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. placements of homeless people into permanent housing in hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. the state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. after trending upward from 2013 to 2016, hawaii's official point in time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. the decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, morishige said. there has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.

harrisburg: along with once again being able to dine indoors, pennsylvanians were able to go to the gym or watch a movie at a theater starting monday, under an easing of restrictions by gov. tom wolf. the updated state guidance is the next step in the state's relaxation of the closures wolf put in place in december to combat the spread of the coronavirus. our mitigation efforts over the past several weeks are working, and i thank everyone who abided by the restrictions put in place to protect us, wolf said. every time we make a small decision to avoid risk – or take steps to make our actions a little bit less risky – we are helping to stop the spread of covid-19 and save lives. but just because a business or church can open doesn't mean it will. wolf has encouraged pennsylvanians to stay home as much as possible and continues to urge vulnerable residents, such as those over 65 or with preexisting medical conditions, to remain home as much as possible. and while much of the focus has been on the restaurant industry, museums, aquariums and wedding reception venues are among the other businesses allowed to reopen.

the tex wash bridge was built in 1967, as the i-10 slowly grew across the country, crossing the dry, dusty desert between the coachella valley and the arizona-california state line. dozens of short bridges were built in that stretch, but the tex wash was wide and delta-like, so it demanded a longer, stronger bridge. instead, construction crews narrowed the wash, then built a short bridge with a shallow foundation. they also re-shaped the wash into a curve, which directed the full force of floods against the eastern base of the bridge.

sure, there are things at work that bring out negative feeling and emotions, we all have them, but the key is to try not to let them take over your thoughts completely. try making a list of things that you feel positive about regarding your current work situation, and set your focus there. it can contain things that are large (like one of your primary work responsibilities) or relatively small (maybe you like the fact that your desk is by a window with a nice view?). some people find that just being appreciative that they even have a job in a tough job market helps them through stressful times. the list itself doesn't have to be particularly long, the only criteria is that it contains items that elicit positive feeling and emotions. once you have your list, make sure to turn to it whenever your thoughts about work start to turn negative, and hopefully you'll start seeing a shift in how the idea of work makes you feel.

how about instead of misrepresenting their fares, we get all of the airlines on the same page. ask them, or require them, to quote ticket prices that include all of these essential items: a boarding pass printout, a seat reservation, a checked bag, basic amenities and the ability to change a ticket for a reasonable price. if you want to uncheck a box that removes these extras, fine. the cost of your flight will fall. but don't quote a bare fare and leave passengers with the impression they're getting a deal.

bismarck: the state's efforts to make its legislative session safer during the coronavirus pandemic should also make it easier for citizens to observe the proceedings and participate in government, leaders and longtime observers say. legislative leaders have spent more than $2.6 million in federal covid-19 relief money to beef up livestreaming and remote technology to allow people to watch committee meetings and floor sessions in real time. the public will be able to give remote testimony and not have to worry about driving to bismarck in the middle of winter. they will be able to follow certain issues that they're interested in from the committee room to the chamber, and if it passes and goes to the next chamber, they'll know everything that's said, everything that's done, said republican senate majority leader rich wardner, who spearheaded the upgrades. house and senate floor sessions have been livestreamed, archived and indexed online since 2013, the bismarck tribune reports. but much of the action, including hearings on bills, takes place in committee meetings, north dakota newspaper association attorney jack mcdonald said.

raleigh: state education officials recently estimated educators can't account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the covid-19 pandemic. lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students' learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms. david stegall, the north carolina department of public instruction's deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers last month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state's 1.5 million k-12 public school students are unknown. this happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class. if a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in north carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them.
