True one-flesh union, the foundation of conjugal marriage, was thought illusory. What mattered was emotional union and partners' use of their bodies to induce desirable sensations and feelings. Of course, two men or two women (or throuples or even larger sexual ensembles) could do that. But the logic didn't stay with marriage. If the body is mere plumbing, then sex matters less than identity.

Columbus fans have to start thinking about the 2016 draft. The Ryan Johansen fallout is extensive to the point that trading him seems like the best solution for all parties.

Springfield: The Central Illinois Foodbank plans to use an anonymous donor's $500,000 gift to expand its reach during a time of growing need amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, its leader says. Outside of grants, the donation is the single largest gift in the food bank's 38-year history, and the gift's timing is impeccable, said Pam Molitoris, its executive director. She said the donation will be used to address the growing need for food assistance throughout the group's 21-county service area as the pandemic's economic impact continues into 2021. The timing is impeccable as we think of gearing up for possibly an extended period of time of high need, Molitoris said. This gives us that motivation and that inspiration that we can get it done. The food bank distributes over 10 million pounds of food annually to more than 160 food pantries, soup kitchens, residential programs and after-school programs in its region. Since March, the group has provided food at 85 drive-thru distribution events in underserved urban and rural areas. The food bank has increased its distribution by nearly 2 million pounds, a 25% increase since the same time last year.

I hate federal commissions. I have always hated federal commissions. Federal commissions are Washington's way of managing scandals. They work like placebos for political fevers, convincing voters that answers and change are on the way. That is why it is so difficult for me to utter these words: We need a federal election commission. Not the one proposed by some Senate Republicans. And not like past placebo commissions. An honest-to-God, no-holds-barred federal commission to look into the 2020 presidential election.

Island Beach State Park: Officials hoped they would collect 200 discarded Christmas trees to bolster dunes at the park but have received 10 times that amount. State Department of Environmental Protection officials, who operate the park, said they collected some 2,000 Christmas trees Saturday during a drop-off event. DEP officials say the trees help catch sand and support the dunes, which provide protection to the island during storms. The dunes also provide habitat for about 400 plant species and numerous types of birds. The island is made up of nearly 1,900 acres of dunes and beaches and remains one of the few remaining undeveloped barrier island beaches in the northeastern United States, according to state officials.

Town: A man from Illinois drove through Wisconsin last week with a snowmobile strapped to the roof of his car, creating a bit of a stir. Tommy Mecher, an electrician apprentice from Chicago, said he could not afford to get a trailer and pay for the extra gas to tow his snowmobile up north. I only burned $10 more in gas on a 430-mile trip, Mecher said. I put it on the roof in Lemont, Illinois, where the snowmobile was and drove it up to Bessemer, Michigan. Snowmobiling can be an expensive pastime. There's the expensive machine, helmet and cold-weather clothing, the cost to travel to a spot with enough snow and the expenses of a weekend of roaring across groomed trails. But Mecher purchased the 1990 Polaris Indy 500 snowmobile a few weeks ago, made a few minor repairs to get it running and left for his father's house in Bessemer last Friday. Mecher said It took about an hour to load the snowmobile on the roof of his 2005 Chevy Malibu, using an old blue Ford tractor with a bucket. He modified the end of the snowmobile to keep the machine's track from caving in the roof or breaking the rear window. Mecher made a support rack of boards to shift the snowmobile's weight to the sides of the roof, away from the middle. He secured his sled with several straps that he looped through the open rear doors before tightening them and closing the doors.

Jackson: Foul weather has postponed plans to kill nonnative mountain goats in Grand Teton National Park. Park officials closed a large area of the Teton Range to the public this week so that hunters could shoot goats by helicopter without endangering people on the ground. Park officials now say snow and poor visibility are postponing those plans. Grand Teton spokeswoman Denise Germann said another attempt could take place in late January or early February. Mountain goats aren't native to the park and biologists worry the 100 or more goats could spread disease to native bighorn sheep. The National Park Service has contracted Oregon-based Baker Aircraft to shoot goats with nonlead shotgun or rifle rounds, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reported. Wintry weather kept Baker from making it to the area, Germann said. Park officials also plan to use volunteer hunters on the ground.

COST CUTTING: Indy needs to get younger on defense and could save some cash in the process.

Jones and Robinson battled injuries all season and have not lived up to the billing. Jackson was suspended for the final four games for violating the league's performance-enhancing substance policy.

Penalties were a constant issue in the kicking game, including one that wiped out a touchdown, and the Lions allowed one punt-return score (and nearly another) against the Jets.

The Lions did execute a nice fake field goal for a touchdown in Week 17, but they also let Seahawks punter Michael Dickson run for a first down out of his own end zone.

We thought that this year – after recent national events, all the hard work of the Family Music Forward racial justice collective to bring attention to issues of diversity, equity and inclusion in our genre, and changes within the Academy itself designed to reduce bias – we might see a different outcome. We didn't, and the results are frankly an embarrassment for the field of children's music. We know that there are proposed changes already being discussed for this category – due, at least in part, to the vocal efforts of Family Music Forward in bringing attention to this year's results. If there's a role for us to play in helping to create positive change in this category going forward, we'd like to be a part of that work. But we also recognize that changes going forward can't alter the outcome of this or past years' nominations. We know that declining our nominations runs the risk of centering ourselves even further in this conversation. We're prepared for that criticism if it means helping to bring attention to the problem. And, in order to make sure this story is told in a well-rounded way and not purely through a white lens, we commit to including black and brown leadership from our genre in any future press interviews that may arise from our nominations, or our declining of them.

In fact, with a handful of exceptions, the only information the public has had about House ethics cases during the past seven years has come from OCE reports. The rules as currently written require that once OCE has referred a matter to Ethics for further review — since OCE has no ability to rule on violations or issue punishments — the Ethics Committee has to publicly release the report even if it has made no decision on guilt or innocence. The most common action by Ethics is to release the report and declare that they are still looking onto the matter ... and no conclusion is ever announced. The new rules proposal raised questions about how much of the OCE work would still be public.

NEED FOR SPEED: Four outside linebackers could become unrestricted free agents — Erik Walden, Trent Cole, Akeem Ayers and Chris Carter — and 35-year-old Robert Mathis is retiring. Walden led the team with 11 sacks and at age 31 could be too expensive to re-sign. Mathis was second with five. The rest of the team had 17. So finding a young, dominant pass rusher must be a top priority.

Gettleman was clear that he believes Manning can still play to some extent, insisting that the two-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback who turns 38 on Thursday can still make all the throws. It's also pretty clear the Giants are weighing their options, as is Manning, considering the $23.3 million he is scheduled to make in the final year of his contract, the possibility that the team may look to restructure the deal to create salary cap space and the prospects that Gettleman brought up sustained success - which speaks to more than just a one-year commitment at the quarterback position.

For comparison, consider two All-America defensive tackles from different eras. Back in 2009, Terrence Cody anchored the Alabama line – and we do mean anchored; he weighed in somewhere in the neighborhood of 360 pounds, and they called him Mount Cody. This season, Quinnen Williams won the Outland Trophy as the nation's best interior lineman. He weighs 295, and he's just the latest in an ever-shrinking line. The shrinkage is similar at linebacker; where Rolando McClain played at 255 or 260 pounds at 'Bama, the current models resemble the safeties of a decade back.

19. The Saints earned a rematch with the Vikings, who beat New Orleans 29-19 in a Week 1 contest that wasn't as close as the score indicates. But so much has changed. Saints star rookie RB Alvin Kamara was stuck at the time behind since-traded RB Adrian Peterson. And Minnesota's starting backfield in the opener was QB Sam Bradford and RB Dalvin Cook. The prologue really won't provide much insight for a preview to the divisional round.
For Biden, this is not about ruling the minority party. He demonstrated in the primary and general election campaigns that he clearly understands our divided nation. His role as president might be most closely akin to President Abraham Lincoln's: healing deep wounds, listening to and including the voices of rivals — as he did on the political left in reaching out to Sen. Bernie Sanders and his supporters. Should the Democrats control the Senate, Biden's instinct to be magnanimous and inclusive would not only help defeat the pandemic, it also would slowly bring a more constructive tone to our politics.

Dr. Jay Greenspan, the chair of the pediatrics department at Nemours, hopes to apply the clinic model of medicine to all children in Delaware.
When you look at this young franchise quarterback that we have (in Josh Rosen), the nucleus of talent that we have and the silver lining here is that we're going to (have) the first overall pick (in next year's NFL draft), not just in the first round but every round, and then we're first in the claims order when players are waived, Bidwill said. So that's going to give us a great opportunity. Plus, we have a lot of cap space, so this is the type of opportunity that I think is very, very attractive to coaching candidates.

Courts are likely to recognize that Congress has a more substantive role, particularly when rivaling sets of electors are presented or there is clear evidence of fraud. However, the validity of such electoral votes should be left largely to the courts in challenges in the given states. That is why the current challenge is unwarranted. There is no serious basis to challenge the validity of the electoral votes certified by the states.
— Memphis at Miami, Saturday: This will be Dwyane Wade's final time facing the Grizzlies, who have gone 3-10 in Miami against his Heat.
With fewer hits through the right side of the infield, it's led to many left-handed hitters focusing on hitting homers to right field to combat defensive shifts. Votto noted how players like Bryce Harper, Cody Bellinger, Max Muncy and Anthony Rizzo can hit a ball with a 112-mph exit velocity and it's a routine out because of the second baseman in shallow right field.

Portland: The state with the largest fishing industry for lobster likely experienced a drop in catch last year, but the dip in harvest was probably not as dramatic as initially feared. Patrick Keliher, commissioner of the Maine Department of Marine Resources, told Maine Public that initial reports showed a harvest of about 100 million pounds of lobster. That would be a drop of nearly 20 million pounds from last year, but still a much higher number than the industry was used to in the 1990s and 2000. The season initially looked like it could produce a substantial drop in catch, but Maine's lobstermen finished strong, Keliher said. The price for Maine lobster was also strong, he said. It's possible for the state's lobster catch to be slowed by lobsters shedding their shells late in the year. The biggest surge in catch happens after many lobsters lose their old shells and reach legal harvesting size.

This has long been in the works, and it's not quite as dramatic as it sounds. The gist of the rule is that a team can attempt two forward passes as long as both originate from behind the line of scrimmage, as opposed to the NFL rule that requires the first pass to travel backwards. This change is, in part, intended to open the door for more trick plays out of the shotgun.

If the twin pandemics of COVID-19 and structural racism experienced in 2020 have shown us anything, it is that there must be a radical shift in how we interact with those around us, and that should force us to rethink how we invest in and educate all students. It has exposed not only past education inequities but the danger of prolonged future disinvestment. While leadership by Congress and the president are needed to move the Racial Equity Stimulus package, your leadership is needed, Secretary Cardona, to target education investments to ensure that we liberate learning for all students and flatten the curve of structural racism so damaging to student learning in America.

Columbus: The newly elected state Senate president will be sworn into office from his home Monday after contracting COVID-19 over the holidays. Senate President Matt Huffman experienced mild symptoms before the new year and is doing well, spokesperson John Fortney said. Huffman, a Republican from Lima, joins a list of more than a dozen Ohio lawmakers who have tested positive for the coronavirus since the pandemic began in March. Huffman was chosen to succeed former Senate President Larry Obhof for the 134th General Assembly following a session filled with pandemic-related hurdles, a federal bribery scheme and infighting within the majority party. Fortney said Huffman will return to the Statehouse after following CDC quarantine guidelines and Senate policy. The Ohio Statehouse has become the scene of a partisan divide over mask-wearing in recent months, with Republicans continuing to push down Democrats' motions to require all Statehouse staff to wear masks while in session and committees.

Smith thinks it's the latter, and what that means is a fight under circumstances favorable to Jones, like a headliner on four weeks' notice at UFC 235. The short notice is the logical conclusion Smith sees to a favorable outcome with the Nevada State Athletic Commission, which called Jones before the commission to discuss an adverse drug test prompting the move of UFC 232 from Nevada to California.

I respond to it by saying, you have to take the best player available, Gettleman said. If you are reaching, you're going to get into trouble.

All of those coaches Alabama brings in as analysts or consultants or whatever? Their chief value might be how Saban picks their brains.

I think you have to in this day and age of football, Smart said. There are so many run-pass option plays, so many plays to trick the defense that people are going to put better numbers up.

Phoenix: The National Weather Service said there were seven confirmed tornadoes in Maricopa and Pinal counties last year, the most in nearly five decades. Meteorologists said last year's total is second only to the 10 confirmed tornadoes that hit the Phoenix metro area in 1972. They said all of the 2019 tornadoes were considered weak, ranking as either F0 or F1 in intensity. But in June 1972, an F2 tornado damaged about 200 homes in Paradise Valley and caused extensive damage to canals and power lines in Scottsdale and east Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix has data on tornadoes going back to 1950. Meteorologists said there were five confirmed tornadoes in the metro Phoenix area in both 1992 and 1993 with four tornadoes in 1971. Tornadoes are considered a rare event because the Phoenix area generally doesn't get the wind shear and unstable air mass needed to whip up the twisters.

An investigation by the U.S. Labor Department found that Intermountain Concrete Polishing paid employees straight-time rates for all the hours they worked, including workweeks that exceeded 40 hours, the Idaho Statesman reports. The company also failed to record or compensate employees for travel time when they worked several hours away from their homes, officials said. The Meridian-based floor polishing company must pay $47,676 to four employees for violating overtime and record-keeping requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal officials said.

San Diego: Homeless people facing a ticket or arrest by San Diego police could have the infractions cleared if they agree to stay for 30 days in one of the city's shelters, according to a report. The program could help stabilize lives and get people connected with services, while also allowing officers to enforce laws on the street, San Diego police Capt. Scott Wahl told the Union-Tribune. The San Diego Police Department launched a neighborhood policing division in 2019 that includes outreach teams and officers who enforce quality-of-life laws that often involve homeless people. Last summer, police began offering shelter beds in lieu of citations to homeless people who had been contacted for encroachment, illegal lodging, littering or other minor infractions. But while about 300 people took the offer, many left the shelter within a day or two, Wahl said.

Topeka: Psychiatrists are so hard to come by in some rural parts of the state that doctors from outside its borders now commonly treat patients through video conference. Kansas, like the rest of the U.S., is seeing an increase in patients seeking mental health treatment. The state can't find enough doctors, nurses and therapists to treat them, and providers say the problem is worse in the state's least-populated rural areas. The Kansas News Service reports the High Plains Mental Health Center in northwestern Kansas has long struggled to attract psychiatrists for patients in its 20-county coverage area. Executive Director Walt Hill stopped even trying because it typically took him more than a year to fill a position. Attracting psychiatric nurses is hard, too. So Hill turned to providers who conference in from Kansas City, Missouri; Texas; and Oklahoma.

Omaha: Despite more than doubling releases from its reservoir system, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers still doesn't expect to eliminate all the leftover water from last year's near-record runoff that led to massive Missouri River flooding. The Corps had been discharging about twice the usual winter amount from Gavins Point Dam – the southernmost in the six-dam system. The Corps said it was raising the discharge this month to 30,000 cubic feet per second, an increase of more than 11%. Until a seasonal decrease that began in November, the amount being released had been 80,000 cubic feet per second for months, also more than twice the average. Areas along the Missouri River and its tributaries in parts of Nebraska, Kansas, Iowa and Missouri were ravaged by floodwaters in the early spring. Heavy rains later in the year reflooded many areas that had been left unprotected because of levee failures. John Remus, chief of the Corps' Missouri River management, told the Omaha World-Herald the reservoir system needs to make as much space as possible in light of the National Weather Service forecast for warmer than normal weather and higher than normal runoff in January and February. The Corps normally doesn't release more during the winter because of the potential for ice jams and dams upriver, Remus told the Associated Press on Wednesday. Once the river freezes over it essentially becomes a pipe, Remus said, limiting its capacity.

Salt Lake City: Republican Spencer Cox called for unity amid hateful rhetoric in national political discourse after being sworn in Monday as Utah's first new governor in more than a decade. Cox denounced misinformation and division that he said have further taken hold throughout the pandemic. As he stood in front of red rock in southwestern Utah, Cox referred to a group of anti-mask protestors who lined a road to the ceremony calling for an end to the state's coronavirus restrictions. We are more divided than at any time in our lifetimes as the news is filled with civil unrest and protests, including one right outside this venue here today, Cox said. We are facing a crisis of empathy, a scourge of contempt. Very little feels 'united' about the United States today. The new governor said that it's not too late and called on the state's residents to join together. Cox is succeeding Republican Gov. Gary Herbert, who chose not to run for reelection after more than a decade in office. Cox, who became Herbert's lieutenant governor in 2013, won the gubernatorial election in November.
Hillary suggests she isn't hurting anybody with her deceptions. That might very well be true, but they are incredibly tone deaf and disrespectful when you consider the cultural context we find ourselves navigating in the here and now. She can romanticize what it means to be from a different culture. She can learn the language and give her children more ethnic-sounding names. But neither she nor her children will have to confront the other side of being nonwhite or nonnative in America. They will never be profiled or stereotyped because of their accents or physical attributes. They will not be taunted with racial tropes or have their potential handicapped by ignorance and intolerance.
Any (future) project that includes children might work well as these interactions seem to bring out her natural warmth, Gutin says. This could be a turnaround year if she increases her public presence and invites media in to discuss her concerns.
On first-and-goal from the Jaguars 1, coach Sean McDermott and offensive coordinator Rick Dennison elected to call a run-pass option instead of asking quarterback Tyrod Taylor to either run it in himself or hand it off to running back LeSean McCoy against one of the most vulnerable run defenses in the playoffs.

States with widest gaps between rich, poor
A targeted, multi-year $1-2 trillion Education Stabilization Program is a vital part of a larger Racial Equity Stimulus Package proposed by one of us, John Jackson, and other civil rights leaders. This education-focused stimulus would allow for the critical racial equity investments needed from birth and throughout the public preK-12 education system. It would serve as a stabilization fund for states whose education budgets are challenged by COVID-19-caused revenue shortfalls, while also requiring a maintenance of effort by states. It would also include investments to enable the expansion of community schools, address student mental health and socio-emotional needs, support states moving toward tuition-free community college, and make significant investments in Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other institutions that serve minorities and lead the nation in graduating students of color.

Honolulu: Improvements in programs to address Hawaii's homeless population have allowed the state to fall from first to second in the national ranking of per capita homelessness, officials said. State homeless coordinator Scott Morishige informed lawmakers Tuesday that New York now holds the top position, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. Morishige presented the data to the Hawaii Homelessness Summit for both houses of the state Legislature. The summit is designed to help lawmakers evaluate the success of programs funded by the Legislature and consider other solutions to homelessness. Placements of homeless people into permanent housing in Hawaii increased in 2018 from nearly 4,000 to more than 7,000. The state appears to have exceeded 7,000 placements again in 2019, he said. After trending upward from 2013 to 2016, Hawaii's official Point in Time count of homeless people showed a decrease over the past four years. The decrease corresponds with similar increases in housing placements over the same period and is reflected in other surveys related to homelessness, Morishige said. There has also been a nearly 40% reduction in homeless families with minor children since 2016.

Surely, Krzyzewski will remain involved with his coaching staff during his recuperation.

I think the philosophy here is the more information that the NFL can get on players, the more accurate they can be in evaluation, Saban said.

What's causing the dramatic drop-off is somewhat of a mystery. Experts believe the decline is spurred by a confluence of unfortunate factors, including late rainy-season storms across California last March, the effects of the state's yearslong drought and the seemingly relentless onslaught of wildfires that have burned acres upon acres of habitat and at times choked the air with toxic smoke.
Stern understood how to navigate difficult times.

It was another critical moment in Stern's career, and he helped break down misconceptions and falsehoods.
The XFL is trying to revive the kickoff, but also keep it safe, by mandating that blockers line up 5 yards across from each other. So instead of running downfield to cover a kickoff, the kickoff coverage unit will line up on the opposing 35-yard line. The kickoff return team will line up on the 30. Once the ball is caught or on the ground for three seconds, the two sides will be allowed to engage. The league hopes this will eliminate some of the high-speed collisions that have resulted from the running start in the NFL.

Des Moines: As Iowans on food stamps are set to receive increased benefits under a new stimulus package signed into law Dec. 27, those seeking to use their electronic benefit transfer cards to order groceries online are seeing their options grow. Aldi, in partnership with the delivery service Instacart, on Dec. 17 became the latest grocery chain to offer the service to Iowa participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, more commonly known as food stamps. The chain joined two large retailers, Amazon and Walmart. During the pandemic, more retailers in Iowa have joined other states in a pilot program to allow for grocery delivery and curbside pickup to participants in SNAP, an option long unavailable for them. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend limiting visits to grocery stores and using online services when possible. Food Bank of Iowa president and CEO Michelle Book said that in addition to helping people remain safely at home during the pandemic, broadening options for ordering groceries online using EBT payments will help those who lack transportation and would have to spend considerable time on a bus to travel to a supermarket.

Jared Polis, wrote in an email to The Denver Post that a seventh round of grants was recently distributed. Conversations are underway with the philanthropic community and the Legislature about the best way to sustain support for Coloradans for the recovery phase of the pandemic in a more permanent infrastructure, so this will likely be our last round, she said. The fund was started in March with $2.8 million. At the time, the governor said the money would be spent on medical supplies, volunteer services, nursing home and homeless shelter staffing, cleaning supplies, and helping struggling workers, families and small businesses to help weather the storm of coronavirus.

He wrote in a social media post that Iran may accelerate making a nuclear weapon now, even if it didn't plan on doing it before, a reference to Tehran's insistence it is interested in nuclear activities for civilian purposes only, something Washington does not believe and is also one of the reasons Trump withdrew from the landmark 2015 nuclear accord negotiated by former President Barack Obama. The agreement saw Iran agree to limit its enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of sanctions on its lucrative oil industry.
While many cities and states are also trying to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases to slow global warming, these more concrete efforts are aimed at mitigating the actual impacts of climate change, which many elected officials say is politically easier to tackle.

Montgomery: A recycling center that employs adults with intellectual disabilities should have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to its workers, federal labor officials said. The U.S. Department of Labor recently announced that employees were rightfully owed $540,000. Montgomery Arc and two of its partners – Hanan Center and McInnis Recycling Center – will now pay $541,597 in back wages to 80 employees, federal officials said. The deal is part of a settlement between the organizations and the federal agency, The Columbus Ledger-Enquirer reports. The organizations were supposed to provide services to the employees in exchange for paying them less than minimum wage, the newspaper reports. But the agency found that it failed to provide services required by federal guidelines.

A meeting Sunday with Eagles defensive coordinator Jim Schwartz is possible, considering ESPN reported Wednesday that the Giants, as had been expected, reached out for permission to speak with him.

The Warriors ruled out Thompson for the season for the second consecutive year after he injured his right Achilles tendon in an offseason pickup game. Although the Warriors have been impressed with rookie James Wiseman for his defense and outside shooting, they recognize the No. 2 overall pick will still face learning curves. Although Stephen Curry remains one of the best shooters, he has less space to operate than when he had more All-Star teammates. Andrew Wiggins (37.5% and Kelly Oubre (27.4%) have been undependable on offense and the Warriors once again rank 26th in defensive rating (114.66).

Little Rock: The number of hospitalized patients with the coronavirus remained at a record level Sunday as Arkansas continued to grapple with a surge in virus cases. There were 1,234 people hospitalized with the virus Sunday, up from Saturday's record level of 1,216 hospitalizations, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. The state also saw 2,033 more cases of the virus and 20 more deaths, Hutchinson said. New cases lead to increased hospitalizations, which affect anyone needing treatment in a hospital, not just those with COVID-19, he said. Over the past two weeks, there were 1,056 new cases per 100,000 people in Arkansas, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University. That ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins. One in every 162 people in Arkansas tested positive for the virus in the past week.

Speaking to caucusgoers at a hotel Sunday in Grinnell, Iowa, Biden argued that the killing of Soleimani turned the Iranian military leader into a hero. He pointed to the thousands of mourners packing the streets of Iran.
Last June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions made this bad situation worse. Overruling board precedent, he announced that, henceforth, anyone fleeing domestic violence (or, for that matter anyone fleeing gang violence) will generally be unable to prove either social distinction or particularity and therefore should be denied asylum. Although a federal court has blocked that decision for now, the Supreme Court will likely determine its ultimate fate.

That way, the public at large can analyze and contribute to the review of this evidence.

That's about the time Delta began a decade-long downsizing of some 600 flights at CVG, mostly due to the Atlanta-based carrier's decision to focus on other markets after its merger with Northwest Airlines. But Delta still had a strong enough grip on Greater Cincinnati to make CVG one of the nation's most expensive airports. The high fares still forced small and mid-sized company managers and vacationers to look mostly to Dayton for cheaper flights.
Sherburn: A rural veterinarian who has taken in dozens of miniature horses since they were seized because of maltreatment says she wants to be paid for caring for them for a year and a half. Shirley Kittleson says the bill for their care has topped $325,000. Kittleson filed a lawsuit last month against the Humane Society and Watonwan County for nonpayment. Kittleson was asked to care for the herd of 72 after the Animal Humane Society and Watonwan County sheriff seized the horses from a farm in Odin in June 2018. The farm's owner, Michael Johnson, was convicted of two counts of animal neglect. Watonwan County told Kittleson soon after she sent them a couple of monthly bills that the horses were the responsibility of the Humane Society. Kittleson said she could find new homes for the horses, but the Humane Society won't release the herd, according to the Star Tribune.

Killingly: The Killingly Board of Education voted to bring back a controversial Native American-themed athletic mascot. The board decided to reinstate the Redmen mascot at a meeting Wednesday, the Norwich Bulletin reported. In October, the same board approved the new Red Hawks mascot after it was overwhelmingly approved by students at Killingly High School. Several students, faculty members and local tribal representatives have criticized the original mascot as inappropriate, racist and stereotypical. It featured the profile of a Native American man wearing a headdress. Newly elected Republican members of the education board made a campaign promise to reverse the change. The board, with a Republican majority, held a public meeting on Dec. 11 where it voted to remove the Red Hawks mascot but tied on whether to return to the original mascot. More than a dozen people, including students and Native American representatives, spoke out against the decision to keep original mascot at the meeting. They also sought some other compromise, the Bulletin reported. At the Wednesday meeting, the board also voted to appoint a subcommittee that would update the high school logo so it doesn't portray Native Americans in a negative stereotype.

Though Alabama's trouble converting field goals over the years receives a disproportionate amount of attention, the Crimson Tide are largely excellent on special teams because the depth of talent allows for Saban to employ several former five-star recruits — some of whom are a year away from being front-line players — on coverage teams.

Meanwhile, over the same span, Alabama has scored 12 special teams touchdowns.

(Players) didn't have an appetite on the basis of the suggestion that was made to them, no, Fehr said. The question is, if there would ever be an opportunity for a more wide-ranging discussion that would sweep in the kinds of things people would bring up in bargaining, obviously I would talk to the players about it. Now, that's hard to do, it's hard to reach a resolution without a deadline, when you have that kind of situation. But I would not be personally averse to considering it.''

3. Pitt's triplets: Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger, WR Antonio Brown and RB Le'Veon Bell showed just how dangerous they could be in their first-ever playoff game together. Big Ben found Brown for 50- and 62-yard TD passes in the first quarter of Sunday's wild-card win over the Miami Dolphins. Bell, making his postseason debut and playing for a new contract, took over from there, adding two scores on the ground along with 174 yards from scrimmage. The trio was even more dominant in the October blowout of the Chiefs, with Roethlisberger passing for 300 yards and five touchdowns (2 to Brown) while Bell racked up 178 yards from scrimmage. However it must be noted that Big Ben has been ordinary, at best, on the road in 2016 (9 TDs, 8 INTs, 59.4% completion rate, 78.4 rating) and must now also cope with a foot injury suffered against Miami.

Not since 1991 and Desmond Howard has a wide receiver won the Heisman Trophy, but Smith seems poised to join that elite group. Smith, the top target of fellow finalists Mac Jones, leads the nation in receptions, receiving yards, and touchdown receptions.

That was a base hit automatic not three, four years ago, not even that long ago, Votto said. I would guess, of course, they're always trying to hit the ball hard, but I think we have a tendency — I can speak from my experience — to try to chase hitting the ball with some height. A ground ball off the bat, even top-spin hard line drives are bad right now. If they change the rules, fine. That means the left-handed hitters will be better equipped for the next era. I wouldn't be surprised if you saw a guy hit .370 or something crazy like that even with the strikeouts.
2. Hill's thrills: A middling Kansas City attack has been augmented lately by rookie WR Tyreek Hill, who's scored a touchdown of at least 68 yards each of the past four weeks. He is a threat through the air, on jet sweeps, and especially on special teams, where he's scored three times on returns. Pittsburgh must respect Hill's elite speed, and that will only open up the field for all-pro TE Travis Kelce, WR Jeremy Maclin and the running game, which is augmented by QB Alex Smith's ability to operate outside the pocket.

The mice that received the one-time treatment with the gene editor when they were 14 days old fared better than those treated at 3 days old. The gene editor was delivered by a virus modified to be harmless, though it can cause liver problems in mice.
Tim and I drove to Charlotte and were in the room when the doctor came in to tell him he had cancer, Kathy Miller said. They didn't know what it was, so they sent him to Mayo Clinic where they diagnosed him but had never treated it because there were only 50 known cases in world.
As the top Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, I will be in the House Chamber receiving and reporting on the election certifications from the states. And let me assure you — no matter what chaos some Republicans are trying to create, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in as the next President and Vice President of the United States on Jan. 20.
Cyberattacks on the power grid have been of particular concern in recent years. Researchers with the U.S. Department of Energy consider such attacks a serious threat.
The kitchen remodel is a placeholder for all sorts of things: retirement, college for your kids, funding a new business, or anything else which requires years of preparation and discipline. I've seen parents blow their kids college funds at the last second on a not-so-sure thing disguised as a sure thing. I've sadly witnessed pre-retirees saunter away from the pre-retiree moniker, back into the working folks grouping, because they stopped doing the dance that got them to the precipice of retirement.
This most recent effort by the city attorney does nothing more than validate that in my mind, LeBar said.
That's what we are trying to avoid, reaching a point that the state's budget and the 4 million people of the state can't support this benefit because we let the debts grow too long, Harbin said.
Several of these features are offered exclusively to Prime members, making the $120/year (or $12.99/month) investment well worth it. For instance, Prime members can get Prime Samples, a.k.a. sample-size cosmetics, snacks, pet food, and more that range from $2-$4 per item. Plus, when you purchase one of their Sample Boxes, which range from $4.99-$19.99, you earn credits that can be applied to a full-size purchase.

That's when I first visited Austin. In February of that year, I learned that Indiana state health officials were alarmed about tests showing 26 confirmed and four preliminary positive cases of HIV. Most had been caused by shooting up Opana, an opioid painkiller. Before that, the county had never had more than a handful of cases.
I did stay on for a few years, but I got involved in some incidents where I was almost hurt… she said. I realized that I would leave him an orphan and that maybe my heart wasn't in it anymore.

The second-year center scored twice, including the winner with 66 seconds left in the third period, as the Vancouver Canucks defeated the Carolina Hurricanes 3-2 on Wednesday night.
Let's be clear what is happening here: We have a bunch of ambitious politicians who think there's a quick way to tap into the president's populist base without doing any real, long-term damage, Sasse said in his post. But they're wrong – and this issue is bigger than anyone's personal ambitions. Adults don't point a loaded gun at the heart of legitimate self-government.
Lehr lives in a new home in Buckeye, near where Democrats have traditionally done well, but where turnout is relatively light. Unimpressed with her choices, she didn't vote in the presidential race in 2016, but chose Sinema over Republican Martha McSally in 2018.
This was not good engineering, said Abolhassan Astaneh-Asl, a UC Berkeley engineering professor, who visited the Tex Wash Bridge site in December. In good engineering, you work with nature, you don't fight against it.
When the playing field is not level because of realities like Russian state-sponsored doping, it hurts both athletes and the communities we come from. Clean athletes are role models for Rhode Island youth, but our accomplishments are overlooked when the podium is unattainable due to widespread doping.
We can't lose our heads. We can't start rioting. We have to be calculated. We have to continue to keep our foot on the gas, said Matthews, who played with the Bucks last season when they staged the walkout. The flame is already lit. It just has to continue to keep burning and burning the right way. Not where anything can be sidetracked; not where we're damaging anything so that all the media attention can go to look at what is happening over here. Look at the facts and let's address the issues head on.

Tallahassee: State health officials say there were nearly 3,400 hepatitis A cases in 2019. According to statistics through Saturday, there were 3,395 cases – including 63 new cases reported the prior week. To underscore the outbreak, the Panama City News Herald reports the state totaled 1,175 reported cases of hepatitis A in the five previous years combined – with 548 of those cases in 2018, according to state Department of Health data. Hepatitis A can cause liver damage and is spread through such things as fecal matter. That can include transmission by people not properly washing their hands after going to the bathroom and contaminating food or drinks. Health officials urge people to get vaccinated against the disease. As of Saturday, Pasco County had the most cases in the state in 2019, with 414.

NFL DECISIONS: Wilkins, Ferrell and Bryant are not the only underclassmen considering whether to stay or go. All ACC tackle Mitch Hyatt, receiver Deon Cain, safety Van Smith and linebacker Kendall Joseph are all weighing their options. Most all in the postgame interviews said they were heading home for a few days to talk over their futures with their families before choosing. Wilkins, who has graduated, is a junior who asked to be honored with seniors on Clemson's senior day against Citadel on Nov. 18.

While the Nets relished in their reversal of fortunes, the Memphis malaise continued. The Grizzlies have lost four in a row, 11 of their last 14 and the frustration led to a locker room fracas after Wednesday's loss to the Detroit Pistons.
This is all good, Dr. Matt Demczko tells her mother, Thelma. Really good.
We have regular and accessible yoga classes, but also functional strength where students can progressively build strength by adding load with resistance bands and weights, she said. This incorporates strength, balance and mobility.
Let's then claim our faith unabashedly. Let's live out our calling, so that people will know we are Christians because of our love for others. Let's cry out for justice like John the Baptist and the prophets once cried out in the wilderness. Let's call upon both the newly-elected and incumbents in office alike and remind them that our faith compels us to advocate for the poor and marginalized, those who are impacted by climate change, and those who endure harassment and discrimination just to earn a paycheck.
On YouTube, we made a big, early bet on 360-degree video because it is the first type of video that actually gives you a better experience on mobile than you can have on desktop or on your TV, said Kyncl. And since we know mobile video is exploding, formats that lend themselves to mobile storytelling will grow along with them.
When you have a week like we did, that's one of the biggest things — maybe you get comfortable or stop doing something you did because you think, 'Oh, we're good,'  Jacobson said. We talk about it, and the coaches bring it to our attention if they feel something is a little different, and we do a pretty good job of self-monitoring as well.
While Thelma sees Grace developing more than John David did as an infant, it's still unclear how much time her daughter has.
In the rain on the road with the season in the balance, the two Pittsburgh Steelers reserves did more than just serve as placeholders for injured starter DeAngelo Williams. They proved they can make it in the unforgiving crucible of the playoffs.

Hughes and Diaz influenced MSU's recruiting as much as the defense. In filling each vacancy, Mullen undoubtedly will focus on recruiting as much as football philosophy. It will also be the sixth defensive coordinator change in Mullen's eight seasons at Mississippi State.
Images from the scene at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad revealed extensive damage, showing a burned and charred reception area, smashed windows and vandalized rooms left behind by supporters and members of the Iranian-trained Hashed al-Shaabi military network, also known as the Popular Mobilization Forces.

Don't misunderstand. Saban does not always appear to enjoy the changes. Back in 2012, when uptempo offenses employed by Ole Miss and Auburn were causing all sorts of trouble to his defenses, Saban famously asked: Is this what we want football to be? – and he clearly did not want football to be that.
Muschamp also hired Dan Werner as quarterbacks coach. Werner was co-offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at Ole Miss for five seasons before moving on as an offensive analyst at Alabama this past season and will finish his duties with the Crimson Tide at the national title game Monday night before coming over to the Gamecocks.
If the Raiders are going to survive losing Carr, they'll have to do it with a grinding running game, smart and safe play from the backup quarterbacks and a defense still finding its way.

The challenge isn't just confined to the winter, of course. Chilly offices have long been the bane of women who complain air conditioning is cranked up in the summer to appease their male, suit-wearing counterparts.

There are no more Games of the Century, regular-season matchups with ridiculously high stakes. But four playoff spots have kept more teams involved in the championship race deeper into November. Eight spots keeps even more teams involved, but eventually there will be an Auburn-Alabama game or Michigan-Ohio State game or maybe a conference title game that will feature two highly ranked teams playing for seeding.
Most of our students come from the local community and plan to return to teach in local K-12 schools after graduation, Schall said.
Yet there were striking differences, as well, in both the strikes and the coverage.
I never really felt we were finished, the Toy Story 4 star says of the cancellation, which came despite solid ratings. When we got (to Fox), the writers seemed like they got new ideas and it was really quite exciting. It was like a new show.
Still, it's the external changes – the stuff we all see – that's the most jarring for those who played earlier in the dynasty. Tagovailoa throwing the football all over the field to all those talented wide receivers seems like Saban throwing caution to the wind.
In the affordability category, the ratio of the median home value to the median income was given full weight. Cities where the median home value is closer to the median household income were rewarded. Cost of living, as determined by the average cost of goods and services in an area relative to the nation as a whole, was given a full weight. Property taxes are largely levied at the local level, and cities where residents pay more property taxes as a percentage of their home value were penalized. Property taxes were given a one-quarter weighting.

But a McConnell Senate that is pledged to a Biden failure, or even the protracted give-and-take of a one-for-you, two-for-me negotiation, would slow us down when what we need are urgency and unity to pull ourselves out of a ditch. Pandemics don't come under control easily — and a competent and capable Biden administration is just the start.
Jones says she incorporated the letter in her stand-up routine, telling the audience  'Wheel of Fortune' got me. And I'ma show Pat how to play that game. I'm not gonna spend no money on vowels, 'cause I'm not 'bout to spend $250 on a 'E.' That's not worth it.
Don't tell me that change is not possible, he said. Now we've got a brilliant, beautiful, principled, competent person, and people looked beyond color, beyond gender and they picked the very best Delaware has to offer.
Mack thanked his offensive line, like any smart running back should. But they were more than empty words of praise. On the second drive, with the Colts already leading 7-0, Mack took a handoff from Luck on a counter play with two pulling linemen leading the way. Rookie Quenton Nelson shoved All-Pro lineman Jadeveon Clowney back and opened a hole for Mack. Five yards up the field, Ryan Kelly steamrolled an overmatched defensive back.

The Browns (10-5) would clinch their first playoff berth since 2002 if they defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers (12-3) in the regular-season finale Sunday at FirstEnergy Stadium, but in the starting quarterback's mind, the postseason has already arrived.
Meanwhile, the Great Recession of 2007-09 set back the early careers of the millennials who were supposed to comprise a new crop of first-time buyers, leading many to delay marriage and children.

East Machias: Atlantic salmon laid a record number of eggs in the East Machias River last year, according to a conservation group that tracks the species' status in the wild. The fish are considered endangered in the U.S. by the federal government, and they only appear in a handful of Maine rivers. The Downeast Salmon Federation said the high number of eggs shows that efforts to bring them back in Maine's river systems are working. Biologists counted 61 of the nests the fish build for spawning in the East Machias River. The Downeast Salmon Federation's executive director, Dwayne Shaw, said that's six times the number counted in the river since the federation started tracking the fish's egg nesting patterns two decades ago. The federation counted only 10 of the nests in 2018, the Bangor Daily News reports. That was about an average number. The nests carry about 4,000 eggs each.
But the sport's greatest coach won his greatest championship on Monday because he did it without one of his best teams, against one of his most capable opponents and in a style that required Alabama to adapt and contort and do the very things that just a couple years ago Saban decried as the earmarks of an inferior brand of football.

Tori is another STEM toy that I found fun and not too complicated, and I love that it combines crafty DIY with interactive play. Each of Tori's kits include a craft project that lets kids exercise their artistic side, and once assembled, these gizmos are used to play games that teach basic STEM concepts. The way it works is really pretty cool: A special magnet is placed inside your child's DIY creation, and once it's paired with the Tori game board, can be used to play a variety of games. I love that Tori combines art and tech into just-right-for-kids games.

Rapid City: One of the state's largest hospital systems announced Monday that it is planning to increase testing for the coronavirus, as the state saw a drop in new cases but a high positivity rate of testing. Monument Health, the largest health care provider in western South Dakota, plans to test more people who do not have symptoms of COVID-19, including running mass testing events. Hospital administrators said the availability of testing supplies has improved in recent weeks. The state Department of Health reported 111 new coronavirus infections and no new deaths Monday after the New Year's holiday weekend, for the lowest daily tally in three months. But the positivity rate of RT-PCR tests, which detect the virus's genetic material, topped 16%. Emily Leech, Monument Health's director of laboratory services, said a community's test positivity rate should ideally be below 5%. We're doing everything we can to increase testing in our communities, she said in a statement. Monument said its volume of testing in December was about half the rate in November, when the state saw a surge of cases.

Alaska and Virgin America provide reciprocal benefits. The latest in domestic airline mergers, Alaska and Virgin America have tied the knot, becoming the fifth largest airline in the country.

One of the most valuable changes is that Virgin America fliers can now earn miles based upon distance flown rather than dollars spent when flying Alaska flights (Alaska still awards miles based upon distance flown for its fliers). In the new year, Virgin America fliers will be asked to create Alaska Mileage Plan accounts as a next step toward creating a combined mileage program where 1.3 Mileage Plan miles will be equivalent to one Virgin America Elevate point or vice versa.

Or to pressure Iran into returning to the negotiating table to reach a new deal more favorable to Washington?

When it comes to the issue of when police pursuits are appropriate, and for how long and at what level of risk, our moral obligation is to limit that potential for a bad outcome, Flynn said. And if that means limiting our officers' willingness to be brave on the public behalf, sometimes we have to do that.

Mogensen: Not really. I've spent a lot of time in North America. I'm always fascinated by how efficient the U.S. market is. In many ways, North America was late into the ancillary revenue business model in charging for the extras. But today, even what we would call the legacy carriers – American, United, etc. – have become extremely efficient in selling and finding the extra charges.

I can give you an example. We recently added Bristol in south England as a destination. It's a great destination in itself. It has a lot of great attractions. It has close proximity to Cardiff and Swansea and Wales. But there are no direct flights from Bristol to the U.S.
Only Johnson remains, as the Nets decided to cut costs after at one point owning the largest payroll in league history. But they haven't been competitive now and have little hope of a quick fix in the future, as their first-round pick next season goes to Boston as part of the payment from the deal that brought Pierce and Garnett in 2013.

They will need a balanced offense, with Gordon's running complementing the passing of Philip Rivers, and a defense that can solve the speed and moves of Baltimore's Lamar Jackson. Since Jackson replaced an injured Joe Flacco at quarterback, the Ravens are 6-1. Jackson and fellow rookie Gus Edwards give them a formidable running game to go with the No. 1-ranked defense in yards.
Trump said in October 2018 that he thought Nunes deserved the award, though he mistakenly first referred to it as the Medal of Honor. Trump said Nunes had earned it for defending him through the allegations that his campaign had colluded with the Kremlin.
You wake up and open an app that tells you how to leverage the city's various transit options to get to your appointment. Maybe it's a walk to a bicycle, which you pedal to a bus.

MSU finished the season strong in the Belk Bowl, though. It created two turnovers in the first three possessions of the game, holding North Carolina State to 28 points. MSU entered the season finale having allowed its last three opponents to post at least 31 points.
Given the chance to commit to saying Manning would be the Giants quarterback in 2019, Gettleman refused to offer any substantial clarity either way.
Tristan was recommended by a mutual friend. I was interested in his business and he was interested in me. I listened to him and I was immediately impacted by what he said because the product that he has is something that is close to me. It's grooming. It's haircuts. It's the barbershop in the hood. The barber is somebody who has always been important in all communities but especially the black community. I was just happy to see someone represent that.

Soon after news of the arms sales broke, Russia's deputy foreign minister declared that his country won't be cowed. Russia has already demonstrated, notably in 2015, that it can parry U­krainian military advances by sending additional personnel and weaponry. And because Russia shares a 1,200 mile-long border with Ukraine, Moscow will always be able to do so much faster and more easily than Washington can. Thus, arming Ukraine will likely escalate the conflict.
The executive branch is mistaken if it looks to the Supreme Court to provide a quick fix for their litigation problems, says Peter Margulies, a professor specializing in national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. The Supreme Court isn't designed to be a quick fix.

As voters get closer to actually voting, it seems that Trump's more outlandish and impossible ideas will lose some luster, and Christie wants to be the alternative, Hale said. Christie has played the adult in the room before in a number of his early New Jersey budget speeches. It is a great strategy for him to try and replicate on the presidential stage.

Democratic chairmen of the eight South Jersey counties also fired off a statement last month, demanding an immediate refund of every dime he raised from Democrats since he sold out in December.
Another scheduling move paid off for ESPN and the CFP this season. The Orange Bowl was originally set to be played in the early afternoon of Dec. 31, but was instead pushed back to Friday night. The Michigan-Florida State game, won 33-32 by the Seminoles , drew 11.7 million viewers, making it the second-most watched non-playoff game this season behind Michigan-Ohio State.
The Lions tied for 11th in the NFL with 43 sacks, but their pass rush was non-existent for long stretches of games, especially from the defensive line. Romeo Okwara had a team-high 7.5 sacks, but many were of the coverage variety, and Ziggy Ansah once again had trouble staying on the field, though he was effective when healthy. Collectively, the group made too few splash plays early in the season, and the Lions' 102.7 passer rating allowed – third highest in the NFL – was partly a function of a lack of pressure up front.
Salem: The state's correctional facility for girls and young women had among the highest rates of sexual victimization in 2018, according to a federal report. In the report, 42 girls and young women at Albany's Oak Creek Youth Correctional Facility were surveyed; 14.3% reported being sexually victimized in 2018. That's more than twice the national average of 7.1%, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Oregon Public Broadcasting says the report does not distinguish sexual abuse reports in individual facilities made against staff versus those made against other youth. Other Oregon facilities above the national average include St. Mary's Home for Boys in Beaverton at 11.1% and the Rogue Valley Youth Correctional Facility in Grants Pass at 10.3%. All other Oregon juvenile facilities fell below the national average. The National Survey of Youth in Custody conducted the report.

Broderick said pay parity would come by the end of this year.
In Arizona, Julie Rodriguez, deputy aviation director for the Phoenix Aviation Department, said this week that the security level at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is always high.
Misczak said local governments often find success when they tie climate-resiliency efforts to impacts on local businesses. And he said that while the federal government can provide leadership, it's usually a series of seemingly small decisions made at the local level that can truly make a difference: Can homes be built in floodplains? How tough is the building code? Are local emergency services designed to operate in an actual emergency? Are emergency generators sitting in basements that could get flooded, or installed atop parking garages, where they'll be better protected?
The embassy attack in Baghdad – a confrontational move that prompted Trump to dispatch hundreds of additional U.S. troops to the region – immediately captured Washington's attention and revived memories of the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. That standoff lasted 444 days and helped doom then-President Jimmy Carter's bid for re-election. As in 1979, the protesters in Baghdad this week shouted Death to America! and smashed their way into the diplomatic compound, setting fire to a reception area as U.S. combat helicopters swooped over the complex.

St. George: More than 16,000 public comments have been submitted for a proposal on whether to allow a highway to be built through a protected Mojave desert tortoise habitat in southern Utah, federal officials said. The proposed four-lane road has drawn criticism from conservationists because the corridor would run through land set aside to protect the tortoise. The Bureau of Land Management opened the public comment period last month and will now go through all of the comments before releasing the draft environmental impact statement, The Spectrum newspaper reported Wednesday. BLM is not permitted to say where the people submitting comments were from, but there was a mix of people who submitted comments locally and nationally, Venhuizen said. Details on the nature of the comments were not disclosed. The draft is the first step in the year-long National Environmental Policy Act, officials said. The Utah Division of Transportation and Washington County proposed building the Northern Corridor that would pass through the Red Cliffs National Conservation Area, officials said. A definite route for the road has not yet been determined, but the draft statement would take alternatives into consideration, officials said. After the department releases the draft environmental impact statement, a new 90-day public comment period will open, officials said. A decision is expected by 2021.

But the coach was unrelenting in his assessment of the wide receivers, noting that there were too many dropped passes and far too few big plays from a unit built around veterans Mike Wallace and Jeremy Maclin and featuring 2015 draft pick Breshad Perriman, who is thus far a first-round bust. Baltimore ranked 29th in net yards passing per game (189.4).

Most important, the Buckeyes have been the defining figure in the Big Ten, the only true rival to the SEC. In essence, while Clemson has recently challenged Alabama's place atop college football, Ohio State has long been Alabama's mirror image — the Crimson Tide dominated the Southeast while the Buckeyes owned the Midwest.
According to the official records compiled by the NCAA, Ohio State ranks first in career winning percentage (73.1%) and Alabama second (72.9%) among programs with at least 25 years of FBS experience. The Buckeyes rank second (929) and the Crimson Tide third (928) in career victories, while the two programs have combined to claim 25 national championships, some of dubious distinction.

Dover: The state's poultry processing plants and health officials say they are well-prepared for a winter surge of coronavirus cases. Dr. Rick Pescatore, the Delaware Division of Public Health's chief physician, said the implementation of best practices is mostly complete. DPH cultivated a close relationship with the plants as they rolled out coronavirus testing for employees in late spring. We've been able to strengthen our relationships with the poultry companies and others, and so we've been able to empower them throughout the year to take this on, Pescatore said. Poultry workers also fall into the category of critical infrastructure personnel. Pescatore said they would be some of the first to receive the coronavirus vaccine. But vaccination will most likely be on a volunteer basis and not required as a condition of employment.

The Colts, as a team, averaged 5.7 yards per carry on Saturday, going for 200 yards. Mack rushed for his 148 yards and a touchdown on 24 carries for a 6.2 average.

Regardless of how the recent tax changes end up impacting you, a homeowner's housing costs should never exceed 30% of take-home pay.

For better protection, however, I'd recommend that that 30% mark include maintenance, as well.

Fayetteville: The Washington County jail has temporarily suspended its work-release program to free up more bed space in the facility, which has been hindered by overcrowding. Washington County Sheriff Tim Helder said the move will open up 24 beds, with some detainees being released if eligible and others moved into the jail's general population. The sheriff told the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette that a recent increase in the number of sex offenders housed at the county jail prompted the decision because sex offenders must be housed separately from other detainees. The county jail has 710 beds, but because of legal requirements to separate certain detainees, it's considered full when the facility is 80% full, or at 568 detainees, the sheriff's office said. On Monday, the number of detainees reached 792, authorities said.

The market-linked CD blends the potential upside of stock market returns with the stability of a certificate of deposit. These are somewhat unusual savings vehicles created by banks, hamstrung with offering low savings rates, to lure savers looking for more upside. As with a standard CD, consumers deposit their money in a market-linked CD with the understanding the cash cannot be accessed for some time without paying an early withdrawal fee. Both market-linked CDs and traditional CDs promise the saver will at least get their original principal back. Both market-linked and traditional CDs are guaranteed by the FDIC.
Many people seeking information or guidance from the SSA are also not briefed on basics of how their benefits are calculated.

Rumors have swirled for decades about the identity of the man killed in Chicago and buried in Crown Hill Cemetery. Efforts allegedly made by Dillinger to alter his appearance – including plastic surgery and burning off his fingerprints with acid – have led some historians and Dillinger enthusiasts to believe the body belonged to a doppelganger. Earlier this year, the FBI took the rare step of issuing a statement regarding the case, acknowledging the common myth that there was a Dillinger lookalike killed that night, but such claims have been advanced with only circumstantial evidence.

Marvin Jones had one big game, a seven-catch, 117-yard, two-touchdown day against the Seahawks, before a knee injury ended his season in November. Jones couldn't rekindle his deep connection with Stafford, and most everyone in the Lions' receiving corps struggled to win one-on-one matchups downfield. The Lions had arguably the worst group of tight ends in the NFL from a pass-catching perspective, though Levine Toilolo made some big grabs late in the season, Michael Roberts had a couple touchdowns and Toilolo and Luke Willson played a hand in the run game's success.

Norfolk is a small city of just under 25,000 in northeastern Nebraska. A relatively safe city, Norfolk's violent crime rate of 148 incidents per 100,000 residents is less than half the national rate of 383 per 100,000. Though the typical household in Norfolk earns just $45,401 a year, about $10,000 less than the typical American household, a dollar goes a long way in Norfolk. Goods and services in and around the area are about 14.5 percent less expensive than they are nationwide on average.

A year ago around this time, Detroit fired coach Jim Caldwell after back-to-back 9-7 campaigns. Quinn said then he felt the team was capable of more, but the Lions struggled from the start in 2018 under new coach Matt Patricia.

Still, higher oil prices may get dormant oil drillers in the U.S. back to work, and that would create a ceiling to how high oil prices can go, keeping them from soaring to the $3.34 a gallon that was the national average in 2014, DeHaan says.

What might matter and might not: Steelers QB Roethlisberger needed a walking boot after hurting his right foot against Miami. If he's fine next week, it will be fun to watch him, WR Antonio Brown and RB Le'Veon Bell take on Marcus Peters, Eric Berry and the rest of Kansas City's formidable defense. On the other side of the ball, Steelers LB James Harrison and Co. should be able to handle Chiefs QB Alex Smith, but the question is how Pittsburgh's defense and special teams will corral rookie speedster Tyreek Hill.

In fairness, I loaded more applications than PC makers have optimized for with the first-year spec, like Quicken, NordVPN and PhotoShop.

The west coast of Ireland is home to miles of wild and forbidding landscape, and the warmest most hospitable people in the world. An Irish hug along with a dose of Irish wit (in a cozy pub with a pint in hand) would do us all a world of good when this is over. – Katie Kelly Bell, USA TODAY travel contributor The mountains: I'm not really a skier, but I can't think of a better balm for 2020 than mountain air and a bloody mary (or two). Any mountains will do, but Crested Butte, Colorado, has a special place in my heart. It still feels a bit like an old ski bum town, not overly haughty, and there's a Waffle Cabin. Enough said. – Annah Aschbrenner, USA TODAY 2020 elections editor

People tend to see Georgia as made up of Atlanta and Not Atlanta, with a lot of Democratic (Black) voters in urban Atlanta and heavily Republican (white) voters in the rural rest of the state — and when people hear rural, they almost always think white. But that's just not what Georgia is like. A third of rural Georgians are people of color and one in four voters outside the Atlanta metro area are Black. In fact, most of the 20 majority-Black counties in Georgia are in rural areas — including Washington County, where I grew up.

In discussing the economic crisis on the island, some of the women on the march told me that because they don't own the debt, so they won't pay for it. To them, the austerity measures imposed by both the Puerto Rico state government and the U.S. government-created bodies to address the economic crisis — just like the closing of more than 400 schools and the increased precariousness of health services — are a further act of mistreatment and marginalization, a continuation of the violence against women and other vulnerable groups on the island.

Helena: New Gov. Greg Gianforte has signaled he won't continue a statewide mask mandate in place since July, though he said he plans to wear a mask himself and get vaccinated against COVID-19. If Gianforte, a Republican, reverses former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock's mask order, Montana will be just the second state after Mississippi to lift its mandate. Thirty-eight states now have statewide mandates. I trust Montanans with their health and the health of their loved ones, Gianforte said in a recent interview with Kaiser Health News. The state has a role in clearly communicating the risks of who is most vulnerable, what the potential consequences are, but then I do trust Montanans to make the right decisions for themselves and their family. Gianforte has said he plans to announce his COVID-19 policy for the state the week he assumes office, according to the Associated Press. He was sworn in Monday, becoming the state's first Republican governor in 16 years. Montana is the only state where control of the governor's office is changing parties as a result of November's election. And among the 11 governors being sworn in this month, Gianforte will be the only one new to managing his state's response to the pandemic.

The Raiders went 3-3 against AFC West rivals, but won all six games against the rest of the conference.

We're still going to the playoffs; we just didn't earn a bye. One more tidbit: Since the playoff field was expanded to 12 teams, a No. 5 seed has never represented the AFC in the Super Bowl.

What do I think about the game currently? I'm fond of it, Votto said. I'm fond of it because I think it's a better version of athletes than the ones when I came up. I'm not going to poo-poo on the generation before me. I feel really grateful to have come up after the steroid era. I got to bridge the last few players of the steroid era and then the kind of middle era where I felt like there was a lot of older guys kind of lingering, longer-tenured guys and now what I feel like is this newer generation where truly these are the best athletes I've ever seen in a Major League uniforms.

Banged-up and usually beaten, the Heat start a six-game trip in Phoenix on Tuesday night. The good news is that the first three games on this swing are against teams that are like the Heat, well below the .500 mark. The bad news is that Miami hasn't beaten anybody on the road in more than a month, and seems to have a different lineup every night.

Amazon and Google are in a land grab, says Jason Johnson, the founder of August Home, which makes a popular smart lock that works with Alexa, Google and Apple's Siri. It's a race to get Alexa or the Google Assistant into every home. Because once you start with one, you're unlikely to switch.
The Bears are 9-23 in two seasons under John Fox, and they just posted their lowest win total in a non-strike year since the 1973 team went 3-11.
Nearly 30 years ago, most of the public didn't have a clear understanding of AIDS and HIV. A diagnosis was perceived by many as a death sentence. Stern's initial reaction upon learning Johnson's condition was standard at the time. He thought Johnson was going to die.
Here are five takeaways on the issues Gettleman addressed:
Elway deserves only so much credit for publicly stating the obvious during a news conference, then pledging to do better. Being responsible sounds good, but apparently it doesn't mean being accountable to the point where it costs you your job without ample time to get it right — or wrong.
IndyCar driver Graham Rahal applauded Alonso's desire, and noted his participation will only help IMSA's profile.
Brouwer's eighth goal came on a 20-foot wrist shot from the left circle, after he got the puck from Joel Edmundson in front of the Blues' bench during a line change and beat Gibson to the stick side.

There's more, but you get the point. We're dealing with deep rooted, often intertwined problems. And while electing a president who conveys civility and good old-fashioned American decency can make a huge difference, we can also be part of the change ourselves. To begin, we can acknowledge our own shortcomings, stop blaming others for our problems and simply resolve to do better by others. As Edison said, we must find a way.
Then again, the Bears have no logical long-term replacement on the roster. That's an issue they need to address, whether they keep Cutler or bring in another veteran.

Before Sunday, Perdue had not explicitly stated his position on the upcoming certification of the Electoral College result.

Growing up, we were victims of decades of voter suppression. The legacy of the Jim Crow laws that disenfranchised my grandparents' generation did not fade quickly. In many ways, it was passed on down to my own generation. In small towns especially, there was even a fear of what would happen to you if you did vote. We were conditioned to believe that our votes did not matter and that nothing would ever change. Between the fear and the feeling of hopelessness in voting, many Black rural Georgians didn't vote.
President Trump used the phrase global warming in his Thursday tweet, a term that's fallen out of style among scientists and environmentalists because it doesn't reflect the many changes expected as carbon pollution alters the climate: more intense rainfall, increasing drought, rising sea levels, and other changes that vary from region to region.

That claim is expected from Bryan Castor and Scott Meyn, a driver and passenger who were injured when their vehicle was smashed by the tumbling bridge. Meyn escaped with a fractured sternum, but Castor was pinned in the crushed vehicle, surrounded by rushing water, with busted knee caps and broken ribs. He likely would have died, if not for an award-winning rescue by local police and firefighters.
Trump has pledged to renegotiate what he sees as bad trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, and go after countries he believes have rigged the global trade system to their advantage. But many private economists argue that trade deficits are largely caused not by flawed trade agreements or cheating by particular countries but by a bigger economic force — Americans spend more than they produce, and imports have to fill in the gap.

Not that this vision is either guaranteed or without potentially damaging potholes. Hurdles aren't likely to be technological but municipal. Civic and business leaders will have to agree on costly infrastructure projects that allow sensor-driven vehicles to recognize each other, not to mention pedestrians. There is also the matter of working out insurance issues so that accidents involving driverless transportation and humans can be resolved. And perhaps the biggest conflicting interest will be jobs.

It all adds up to a backdrop where Americans' shopping habits, dating preferences, driving habits and even medical issues are broadly available.

8. Panthers — Trey Lance, QB, North Dakota State: Teddy Bridgewater's viability as Carolina's starter took a significant hit when Matt Rhule left the team's outlook at quarterback open after benching the veteran in the season finale against the Saints. The 6-3, 224-pound Lance would change the face of the offense with his deep-throwing prowess and ability to burn teams on designed runs and scrambles. Given that Lance has started just 17 games at the Football Championship Subdivision level, Bridgewater could stay on as a starter and mentor until it's time to hand over the reins to the Panthers' attack.

Wilmington:A record number of vehicles crossed the Delaware Memorial Bridge from New Jersey into the First State last year. In 2019, 18,288,314 vehicles drove through the southbound toll plaza, cruising past the 2016 record of 17.8 million, according to the Delaware River and Bay Authority. Put another way – if you lined up every one of those cars (assuming each is an average of 14.75 feet) it would stretch more than 51,000 miles. That is twice the Earth's circumference, with a road trip from Delaware to Myrtle Beach, S.C. to spare. The bridge also had a record for a month in August, handling more than 1.8 million vehicles, surpassing the August 2003 record by 27,000. Officials said the record traffic volume could be associated with an improving economy and stable gasoline prices in addition to favorable beach weather. All those vehicles means a good chunk of change in toll revenue. Last year, the net total was an estimated $132.8 million, up roughly $27 million from the previous year. For passenger vehicles, the one-way fare is $5. Tolls are paid by vehicles traveling from New Jersey into Delaware.

In an effort to change that this season, Clemson has focused its film study heavily on the teams it felt were best able to bother Alabama up front. Specifically, Mississippi State and Georgia — the only two teams on the Crimson Tide's schedule that recorded multiple sacks.
The police actions surrounding this shooting are under investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice for possible criminal charges, and by the city's Inspector General for possible disciplinary action, Emanuel spokesman Adam Collins said of the attorneys' allegations.

The answer is pretty clear: marketing. It's simply a way to give a title fight a little more promotional juice. If one belt on the poster is good, two must be even better.
Donald Kraybill, a professor at Elizabethtown College and a leading expert in the Amish culture, says many in the community have started to accept modern health care, including genetic testing.
There's a real squeeze going on, not just as a left-handed hitter, but I'll speak for left-handed hitters, at the plate, Joey Votto told MLB Network Radio on Sirius XM. The combination of a lot of defenders on the right side of the field and the way a hitter is being pitched now is basically all built into either strikeout or weak contact on the right side of the field. I fell victim to that. Even when I would pop a ball hard and hit it to the right-field grass, it was one-hop to the second baseman or a line drive to the shortstop or second baseman. I felt like no matter what I was doing it was an out.
There are an estimated 1 million feral camels in Australia, and the population is growing at a rate of 8% a year, PestSmart Connect, which provides information about invasive vertebrate pests in Australia, according to its website.
Karri Ramo holds the keys. If the Flames want to be a contender, their goaltending is going to have to be much better. Their 90.9 save percentage at five-on-five is the worst in the NHL. Ramo has been much better since early December. (JH)
Yeah, I mean I don't see it the way it's perceived, McCarthy said. So I enjoy our relationship and 'it's great that everybody got to see some good clips' is my answer.
But it wasn't enough to change him as a player, except for giving him a taste of the highest form of pressure in golf. One area where Moore has failed to perform is in the majors. He has only two top 10s in the 35 majors he has played (four as an amateur). There was a tie for 10th at Bethpage Black in the 2009 U.S. Open, and a tie for ninth at Medinah in the 2006 PGA Championship.
While you probably won't be able to catch a glimpse of the basketball court (or your favorite characters engaging in a pre-fireworks game of one-on-one), if you are a lucky SoCal resident, The Desert Sun reports you can at least get into the Happiest Place on Earth with a big discount. Three-day tickets are going for $199 — under $67 a day — and you can use them anytime between now and May 21.
Only the Packers among the wild cards don't seem fearsome, mainly because their offense has frozen. Yet they play the perceived weakest of the division champions, so no one is counting out Aaron Rodgers and company. Also the Redskins (9-7) didn't beat a team that finished with a winning record.
Snoqualmie, Washington, is one of the safest places in the country, with just 15 violent crimes for every 100,000 city residents in 2017. The town's property crime rate of 1,077 incidents per 100,000 residents is also less than half the national rate.

James says kids are going to have to deal with conversations about race in the future, so it's something that should be discussed and talked about.

There was no political activity, almost no advocacy, observes Gutin. Mrs. Trump has been a ceremonial first lady. This probably sits well with half the country; the other half looks at the fact that she is not utilizing the White House podium to voice concerns or push an initiative.
It certainly was against Alabama last season, as Clemson basically played to a draw or better in every other area. In fact, at the time Saban called for the onside kick, it seemed like a rather desperate play to keep the ball out of Watson's hands — and it worked.
People talk about closing the achievement gap, but it's more closing the opportunity gap, Perez says. It's important that we come back to the original purpose of dual language, which is to serve the marginalized population.
Green and Curry have developed an important tandem that Kerr has described as fire and ice because of their complementary personalities and skills. Durant and Curry were always the Warriors' most talented scorers. Curry and Thompson were always the most talented outside shooters. But Green and Curry were always the most important pair because they shared playmaking responsibilities while Curry provided unmatched shooting and Green provided expert defense.
ARLINGTON, Texas — Roughly 90 minutes before kickoff back on Sept. 19, word began filtering through Bryant-Denny Stadium that Alabama was going to make a quarterback change. Cooper Bateman was in and Jake Coker, the assumed starter who had yet to fully win the confidence of Alabama's coaching staff, was out for a game against Ole Miss that would become the crossroads of the Crimson Tide's season.
Animosity between Iran and the U.S. stretches back more than half a century to at least 1953, when the CIA helped oust Iran's democratically elected leader, Mohammad Mosaddegh, who wanted to retain control over Iran's oil reserves, and installed as his replacement the pro-western Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.

I have four favorites on a DVD in my car, all right? Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, The Eagles and Elton John. Now, for all you young'ns - see, one good things about my age is we grew up in a pop culture that no one else will ever have the opportunity to live through, from Elvis Presley all the way through hard rock, Motown, all the way through, soft rock, all that. So I lived all that, so I enjoy all that. And even though my son is 31 years old, he plays guitar. He plays all the stuff (from) when I was going to college. So that's just proof in the pudding to me that they don't make them like they used to.

But those promises cannot be trusted, not with the NFL's sorry track record. Not when this is a recurring topic of conversation every offseason, only for nothing to actually change. Not when Urban Meyer could be as hot a commodity as Bieniemy or Robert Saleh or Pep Hamilton.

Del Rio took over a three-win team after the 2015 season and won seven games his first year before guiding the Raiders on a breakthrough season with 12 wins.

St. Louis: A memorial to soldiers downtown has been damaged by vandalism, including a spray-painted message of No war. The vandalism was discovered Sunday morning. It wasn't immediately clear if it was in response to the airstrike that killed a top Iranian official, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an attack that's drastically raised tensions between Tehran and Washington. About 150 people marched through downtown St. Louis on Saturday in opposition to further military action against Iran. The Missouri Historical Society's director of marketing and communications, Leigh Walters, said it is sad that anyone would deface a memorial to those who have made the supreme sacrifice for their country. The memorial opened in 1938 to honor World War I soldiers and reopened in 2018 after a two-year, $30 million renovation.

According to Bourdon, here's how it came about: When your father got his HH bond in 1996, they were only available in exchange for other bonds. If the bond(s) exchanged had deferred interest, that interest got included in the face amount of the HH bond. Because that interest was rolled into the HH bond and not paid to your father, federal income tax on that deferred interest was postponed.

In many cases, analysts said, these candidates may feel they have little chance of attracting the kinds of iconoclastic, anti-establishment voters that go for Trump. At this point, they're probably better off scraping voters from the other non-Trumps, said Scott Huffmon, a political scientist at Winthrop University in Rock Hill, S.C.
On punts, there's a similarly significant change: If a punt travels into the end zone, it will be placed at the 35-yard line. If it sails out of bounds between the end zone and the 35, it will also be placed at the 35-yard line. So there won't be any so-called coffin corner punts in the XFL. And the hope, generally, is that this rule will encourage coaches to more frequently go for it on fourth downs near midfield.

Meteorologists said a storm of this size is extremely rare – predicted to fall in this spot less than once every 1,000 years. However, the Tex Wash carries runoff from the Chuckwalla Mountains to the south, so any major storm on the northern half of the mountain range would send water flowing towards the bridge. A similar storm in a different spot still could flood the washes near Desert Center.

While these were the early effects of redefinition, the more profound consequences will be to marriage itself. Law shapes culture; culture shapes beliefs; beliefs shape action. The law now effectively teaches that mothers and fathers are replaceable, that marriage is simply about consenting adult relationships, of whatever formation the parties happen to prefer. This undermines the truth that children deserve a mother and a father — one of each.
Following one-on-one interviews with all 93 of his players and a brainstorming session with Swarbrick, Kelly gave his program a facelift.

Because Trump is an elected official who has just lost an election, he and his supporters would claim that any criminal prosecution was politically motivated, Cotter said. Leaving aside the political difficulties of such a situation, the ability to ever seat a jury that was not infected with Trump's false claims of a political motivation for the charges would be a serious obstacle to conviction. Not insurmountable in my opinion, but significant.

Marquette: The state's Upper Peninsula turned into a COVID-19 hot spot during the latest surge as nearly 1,400 children got sick from the virus, overall infections tripled, and deaths spiked even more – all while many infected Yoopers went to work, church and weddings when they were symptomatic, ignored social distancing and refused to cooperate with contact tracers, according to new data obtained through open records requests. In the past two and a half months alone, more than 13,500 people in the U.P. contracted the novel coronavirus, a threefold increase since the pandemic began in March, the data shows. The death toll during this second wave was even starker: 337 dead in 10 weeks, compared to 46 deaths in the previous seven months. Children were especially hard-hit: 1,388 schoolchildren got COVID-19 in the second wave, compared to 149 in the previous seven months. This harrowing U.P. snapshot is based on new, demographical data obtained by Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation's Documenting COVID-19 project in collaboration with the Detroit Free Press.

When Stern became NBA commissioner in 1984, the Lakers were in the midst of their Showtime Era in which they won five championships out of eight Finals appearances with Johnson. The Lakers won eight of their 16 NBA championships during Stern's tenure. Yet during various labor deals, Stern often advocated for revenue sharing and spending restrictions to help small-market teams.
Congratulations on your nomination to be U.S. education secretary, Miguel Cardona. You are poised to take this position at a critical point in American history. As you know well, for generations we have lived through a system of separate and unequal education. COVID-19 has greatly exacerbated the learning loss disparities experienced by children of color. Now, with Congress failing to deliver to schools, educators, students and parents the much needed learning and PPE resources, and states cutting their 2021 budgets, things are primed to get a lot worse.
Democrats said the rule change was unconstitutional.
But for all Alabama's talent — and make no mistake, Alabama had the edge at basically every position on the field — the quarterback still had to deliver. And Coker, a fifth-year senior, has never been better in a more meaningful spot.
The winning is constant. But how the Tide does it has been a matter of constant updates. As former Alabama assistant coach Mel Tucker puts it: Alabama – or more specifically, its coach – is like, well, an iPhone.
I can tell you over the three years, the work we've been doing, the partnerships we've made in this space, people can see these guys aren't in it for a PR stunt, Boldin continued. We're in it to see our country change for the better … These communities have welcomed us. We've worked with a lot of grass-roots organizations, and they've been able to see our hearts, as well as us seeing theirs. We didn't know what to expect going into it. But I'm proud of the relationships we've built over the last three years.

But the second might have been an even bigger play in Alabama's 45-40 victory: After Clemson had pulled within 31-27 on a field goal with 7:47 remaining, Kenyan Drake took the ensuing kickoff from the 5-yard line, angled to his left at the 20 and shuffled away from a tackle as he sped toward the far sideline, then escaped the grasp of kicker Greg Huegel near midfield as he broke free for a touchdown.
McConnell isn't the only Republican to disagree with the call to challenge the election result, which left the GOP with more House seats and a solid chance of maintaining hold of the Senate.
I commend them on the fact they take their time, they think things through, they don't make emotional decisions, they don't make in-season decisions, Licht said. I think when you have eight wins in two years, three home wins in two years, I think they've been patient enough. It does take time, but I think while you're building a good football team, you can compete.
With the challenge to the certification of election votes, some Republican members of Congress are calling to delay the proceedings for 10 days and impanel a commission to audit the results. There is precedent for such a commission. Just not good precedent. Indeed, citing the Electoral Commission of 1877 as a model of good constitutional process is like citing the Titanic as a model of good maritime navigation. The commission was an utter disaster.

Nancy certainly agrees with that, and she pushed that, Nadler said.
While any program would want to build around the 7-foot Ayton, it's the guards for the school in its first season against a national schedule that have bolstered the defense — its bread and butter.
No company is allowed to gain an unfair advantage by exploiting human beings for the sake of corporate profits, Buscaino said in a statement.
I'm tired of hearing about the minimum wage. I really am. I don't think there's a mother or a father sitting around the kitchen table tonight in America saying, 'You know, honey, if our son or daughter could just make a higher minimum wage, my God, all of our dreams would be realized,'  he said.
Attorney General Loretta Lynch said gun sellers would no longer be able to hide behind the exception to claim they're not a dealer simply because they sell at gun shows.
I would say last year when we were playing good football, even though we had struggles within the team and struggles would be, you know, everything else was going haywire around us, DT Akiem Hicks says, but we were able to pull together and keep fighting. And there was no quit, and you saw that this year when we got into last minutes of the game and still fighting and coming up with those wins. You could tell that guys have that fight in them.
Indeed, to say Taboo starts slowly would be unfair to slow things: It barely starts at all. It's mostly all portent — scene after scene of somber looks, eerie music and cloudy skies, occasionally interrupted by a profane outburst or a lustful look. Perhaps more and better is coming, but in this era of abundance, it's hard to imagine anyone but the most devoted fans of Hardy, Knight or FX having the patience to wait for it.

The Tar Heels are bigger, deeper and more talented than the undersized Panthers. Their leading scorer is 6-foot-8 senior Cameron Johnson, who spent three years at Pitt before heading to North Carolina as a graduate transfer in 2017. Cameron Johnson, who is from the Pittsburgh suburbs, is likely to receive a hostile welcome from Pitt's raucous Oakland Zoo student section. In a way, it's tangible and audible proof of the inroads the Panthers are making off the court.
No one knows what will happen, he said. No one can predict the future. I know you guys (the media) like to. You like to think that you know everything, but we'll see.
Or maybe not so little. The Steelers are still playing thanks in part to contributions from two players who heard head coach Mike Tomlin repeat his next man up mantra ad nauseam all season and took it to heart. Sure, there was a lot of chaos in the final seconds. That was new. The Steelers finding a way to win in January was not, no matter who is on the field.
President Ted Phillips apparently sees the same things.
The James announcement came shortly after a group of fans known as The Bachelor Diversity Campaign asked ABC and producer Warner Bros. to diversify the franchise.

Wilkins, the 6-4, 315-pound senior, went a long way to calming any locker room concerns about the switch when he took Lawrence to breakfast the week of Bryant's demotion. Wilkins downplays the meeting — I was going to eat breakfast anyway, he said — but Lawrence believes it gave him instant credibility to lead a veteran-stocked club.

Mulvaney, however, suggested the end of the shutdown is not near, telling NBC: I think this is going to drag on a lot longer.
And then those schools should have no ability whatsoever to limit a student's movement — just as they do not with a music or engineering or business major (early decision agreements are the closest corollary, but those are, in many ways gentleman's agreements and don't extend past initial enrollment, anyway). There's no reason it should be any different for students who happen to play sports — other than making things easier on coaches and more palatable for fans who supposedly would hate for college sports to have the equivalent of free agency.

T.J. Lang was the Lions' best offensive lineman when he was on the field, but he played just six games because of injuries. Kenny Wiggins, Lang's replacement, had some rough moments early, especially against Tom Johnson and the Vikings, but he settled down late in the season and made some key blocks in the run game. Rookie Frank Ragnow played all but one snap at left guard. He was inconsistent and got abused by All-Pro Aaron Donald, but he had enough good moments as a run blocker to think he can be a really good interior lineman one day.

In a sweltering barn in Shenandoah, I met a young man who wanted to know how agriculture in the Midwest could help lead the fight against climate change.

Harrisburg: Along with once again being able to dine indoors, Pennsylvanians were able to go to the gym or watch a movie at a theater starting Monday, under an easing of restrictions by Gov. Tom Wolf. The updated state guidance is the next step in the state's relaxation of the closures Wolf put in place in December to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Our mitigation efforts over the past several weeks are working, and I thank everyone who abided by the restrictions put in place to protect us, Wolf said. Every time we make a small decision to avoid risk – or take steps to make our actions a little bit less risky – we are helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 and save lives. But just because a business or church can open doesn't mean it will. Wolf has encouraged Pennsylvanians to stay home as much as possible and continues to urge vulnerable residents, such as those over 65 or with preexisting medical conditions, to remain home as much as possible. And while much of the focus has been on the restaurant industry, museums, aquariums and wedding reception venues are among the other businesses allowed to reopen.

Moreover, Nurmagomedov already has etched out an undeniable legacy. If he can add a few more layers to that, he honestly doesn't have much reason to keep going. If Nurmagomedov can get through what many believe to be his biggest obstacle in Tony Ferguson at UFC 249 in April, then there really aren't many true challenges left for The Eagle. Another win after that would bring his career record to 30-0, and if that fight is a massive one, like his long-desired Georges St-Pierre superfight – or perhaps a Conor McGregor rematch – he pretty much will have done it all.

Montgomery: A judge on Tuesday set a final hearing in a lawsuit over control of the Alabama Democratic Party. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin scheduled the hearing for Jan. 30. The hearing could signal that a resolution is on the way in the legal dispute over who is party chair. Longtime state party leader Nancy Worley had filed the lawsuit to block state Rep. Chris England from taking control as party chair. A revamped governing board of the party elected England as chair this fall, but Worley and her supporters maintained his election was illegitimate. The ongoing feud has pitted longtime party leaders, such as Worley and Joe Reed, against an upstart faction. The Democratic National Committee supports England and recognizes him as state chair. Barry Ragsdale, an attorney representing the defendants in Worley's suit, said last month that England is functioning as party chair.

While it was the Cowboys when Seattle committed to its offensive identity, when it fully took hold depends on whom you ask.

It probably was the start, the advent of maybe the spread in general, Saban said. But it's developed so much through the years that there's not even a lot of similarities left in how you have to defend, what you have to do, and the kind of patterns that people run, what they do from it, the multiples that they have. The rules have changed relative to RPOs (run-pass options), blocking downfield on passes behind the line of scrimmage. I think those things have really made a huge impact on how people play offense, so it's created a lot of adjustments and adaptability on defense.

James has never appeared on The Bachelorette, the usual gateway to Bachelor-hood, but he's a good friend of previous Bachelorette contestant Tyler Cameron, and was supposed to appear on Clare Crawley's delayed season that ended Dec. 22; the pandemic thwarted those plans but paved the way for his casting in the new Bachelor season.
The change should give the NFL's college advisory committee more information and allow it to provide better feedback when underclassmen request evaluations.
2. Mack vs. Clowney: In 2014, the Texans made Jadaveon Clowney the No. 1 overall pick. But maybe they should have taken Khalil Mack instead. While Clowney has finally emerged this year after two injury-plagued seasons, Mack has already developed into one of the NFL's best pass rushers and is a leading candidate to win defensive player of the year. With questions on offense for both teams, this is a chance for both pass rushers to have big days – and their teams are certainly counting on it. Clowney could capitalize with Penn out.
OTTAWA, Ontario (AP) — Mark Stone scored 4:22 into overtime to lift Ottawa past Boston.

He'd never beaten Nishikori in three previous matches, and he had to save break points in the first game and again in the third. After that, he went on a roll.
Hard to explain, executive vice president of football operations Mike Tannenbaum said. It's hard to play balanced football when you're being outscored by 40-plus points in the first quarter. It puts pressure on your offensive tackles. It puts pressure on your defensive secondary. There are a lot of things when you get off to these bad starts that hurt.

By contrast, in the Iraq invasion in 2003, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld signaled a disrespect that may have sown the seeds of today's resentment toward the American presence: First, in planning the invasion, Rumsfeld dismissed information on the locations of cultural sites offered by delegations of archaeologists and other experts that had been passed up the chain of command to his office. In the aftermath, former Iraqi National Museum Director Donny George was unable to persuade American troops to protect the museum because they had no orders to do so. Yet, while the unguarded National Museum and Archives were looted of priceless treasures and irreplaceable documents, the oil ministry was protected by dozens of tanks — sending an unmistakable message about U.S. priorities.

Kevin, if anything, this is the time to hear other people out, to understand why they might have been offended and I don't see any meaningful outreach to the LGBT community, not that I know of, Lemon said in the passionate segment.

Being an ally does.
This year, Smith was able to win the Heisman Trophy, overcoming passing prodigies like his teammate, Jones, as well as Florida's Kyle Trask. Trevor Lawrence of Clemson didn't have quite those eye-popping numbers, although he had the double impetus of career achievement (including a College Football Playoff championship as a freshman) and the endorsement of NFL draft analysts as the best available pro prospect. Ohio State's Justin Fields was done in by Ohio State's short season and his own inconsistent play at times, although his performance against Clemson in the Sugar Bowl would have impressed voters had ballots not been submitted a week earlier.
As an offensive player, you don't get the opportunity to really get to know a lot of the defensive guys, Redmill said. But Victor was an exception. He always wanted to make friends and he made it easy for you to like him.

1. Home cooking? As intimidating as Arrowhead can be, the Chiefs have lost their past four home playoff games and haven't won in front of their faithful fans in postseason since the 1993 season. But it's hard to believe they won't have a significant advantage. A Pittsburgh offense that tends to be far less effective on the road anyway will also have to overcome the ear-splitting din, and a change of venue can only help after the Steelers dismantled the Chiefs 43-14 at Heinz Field in Week 4. However an ice storm headed for the region — it has already forced the NFL to move the game from Sunday afternoon to Sunday night — could wreak havoc.

The new XPS 13 2-in-1 is competitively priced, starting at just $999 and shipping later this month. If you don't need the flippy hinges Dell's included in this version, the standard ultrabook XPS 13 will continue to be sold alongside the 2-in-1.

The main thing I like about it probably won't apply to everyone: While the brand claims, rails, shelves, and telescoping rods can be set up in minutes with no cutting, using simple household tools, I'm a little ashamed to say I hired someone to install it. Before installing anything heavy like this closet (which weighs 62 pounds once assembled), you need to hammer and nail directly into a stud behind the drywall (this can be achieved using a studfinder, which TBH sounds like a dating app I would 10/10 sign up for). If you don't have studs behind your drywall that you can hook your furniture into, you'll need to insert separate anchors to avoid having your drywall ripped out of your wall.
Baltimore: Students in central Maryland will continue to attend school virtually at a time about half of the students in the nation will be able to go back to their school buildings. The Baltimore Sun reports there is no clear idea of when those Maryland students might get back to in-person classes. Few students in suburban Maryland counties have been back inside a school during the pandemic. Experts say the reasons include politics, union opposition, and the failure of federal and state leaders to set clear guidelines as the pandemic began. Meanwhile, a contingent of some parents are furious that schools aren't open. And they say they've sent emails and letters and held protests with no success. Maryland's governor and state superintendent have advocated for schools to reopen. But they have stopped short of ordering schools to open because they say that it is up to local school boards and superintendents.

If you artificially put in rules like no shifting, players aren't going to try to hit the ball the other way. They don't have to because you can't shift. They're just going to reach back for more and everybody is going to pull the ball. I think the best way is when players make adjustments. One thing we need to do better as an industry is make people understand just how much we love our game and enjoy our game, and not just pick apart the things we don't like in our game. I don't think we always do that really well.

Salem: An anti-mask rally is planned for Saturday outside the WinCo Foods store in south Salem after an employee allegedly denied service to a customer who refused to wear a mask. WinCo stores, like many businesses, have adopted a policy requiring customers and employees to wear masks inside the store. Their policy allows for some medical exemptions. It is unclear whether a video of the incident – titled Senior Citizen Denied Food at WinCo Grocery Store for Not Bowing to the Mask Police – is connected to a string of videos showing people entering businesses in Oregon and refusing to put on masks while filming employees. The video was posted on YouTube and Parler, a microblogging website favored by conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists and those fleeing what they claim is censorship on other social media sites. The rally, set to take place outside the store at 1 p.m. Saturday, comes in the wake of a string of right-wing protests that have resulted in violence, arrests and property damage in Salem.

Charleston: The state has announced its initial slate of events for the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote. The yearlong commemoration will start Wednesday with a reception ahead of the governor's state of the state address, Secretary of State Mac Warner's office said. Women will wear early 1900s-style clothing at the event. Other events throughout the year include a documentary showing, a lecture series, a gala, a women's suffrage march at Marshall University and more. Events are being posted online on Warner's website and through a social media account. Warner is leading a coordinating committee to plan events for the 100th anniversary of women's suffrage.

The immutability test makes perfect sense. If you will be persecuted only because of an innocuous characteristic that you can easily change, then you don't need asylum. But if that characteristic cannot be changed, you have no other practical way to protect yourself.

Sure, there are things at work that bring out negative feeling and emotions, we all have them, but the key is to try not to let them take over your thoughts completely. Try making a list of things that you feel positive about regarding your current work situation, and set your focus there. It can contain things that are large (like one of your primary work responsibilities) or relatively small (maybe you like the fact that your desk is by a window with a nice view?). Some people find that just being appreciative that they even have a job in a tough job market helps them through stressful times. The list itself doesn't have to be particularly long, the only criteria is that it contains items that elicit positive feeling and emotions. Once you have your list, make sure to turn to it whenever your thoughts about work start to turn negative, and hopefully you'll start seeing a shift in how the idea of work makes you feel.

1. Jaguars — Trevor Lawrence, QB, Clemson: We've already reached nitpicking season in the first week of January. Yes, Lawrence was outplayed by Justin Fields in the College Football Playoff semifinal that ended the Clemson star's decorated collegiate career. And the Jaguars should — and will — comb over all of their options, including Fields, at this spot. But this shouldn't be a difficult decision. Lawrence is every bit the singular quarterback and franchise-changing prospect he has been billed as for years. Any drama about this selection in the coming months is likely to be merely for show.

Since the November election, attention has been rightfully paid to the role of Black voters — and Black organizers — in flipping Georgia for President-elect Joe Biden. This attention is warranted, and long overdue, but often overlooked is the role of rural Black voters in particular.

Rural Black voters played a central role in helping Biden win Georgia, and now have the chance to decide which party controls the U.S. Senate.

Walker's Bevel wants slice of trimmer market
While it's certain to appeal to kids just based on the design and colors alone, the newest iteration of the myFirst Camera, myFirst Camera 3 features both a front and back lens in case your kid is all about that #selfie life (and whose isn't?). Like others in the line, it spits out black-and-white prints of whatever photos your child snaps in just 10 seconds. But perhaps the most amazing feature of the myFirst Camera 3 is that it saves the snapshots to a memory card so that parents can print out high-quality, color versions of the photos on their home photo printer. There are no pixelated photos here: The shots that your budding shutterbug takes print beautifully in larger sizes. It's the Polaroid camera for the modern generation.
Twelve of the 15 out-of-state counties that have provided the most new residents to Maricopa County in recent years are locations where Democrats have dominated elections or voter registration.
I would pay off my mortgage along with my family's bills and then buy a big piece of land and have a massive car collection, Knight said. The centerpiece of that car collection: A 1971 tuxedo black Challenger 440 big block.
There's a logic here. If we can't see the point of our sexual embodiment where it matters most — in marriage — we'll question whether it matters at all. Hence the push to see gender as fluid and existing along a spectrum of nonbinary options.
Revis, once considered the top cornerback in the game, is not a lock to return to the Jets because he's scheduled to count $15.3 million against the salary cap next season. If he takes a pay cut, a change in positions with the Jets could be in the game plan.

No one's asking playoff officials to make a knee-jerk decision.
The difference lies in the design, Astaneh said. Unlike the collapsed bridge, the Ragsdale Bridge's foundation is anchored by underground piles and protected by diagonal walls, which funnel flood waters inward to prevent erosion. The bridge was built before the wash was narrowed, so that it is nearly three times longer than the Tex Wash Bridge. Flash floods can pass beneath without being compressed into a channel.
As I walk through the hospitals, I don't change myself, mohawk, earrings, tattoos. Like the kids say, I keep it 100, Johnson said. To watch how people look at me…When I walk into a room, I'm everything in their eyes but a surgeon... And that's not only from my colleagues. That's from people who look like us. That's what hurts me.
Still, his feet might have been happier if his receivers found more open space down the field. Which means asking him to fit passes into impossibly tight spaces isn't fair.

At first it wasn't easy. I quickly realized that although some foods were low in calories, they were high in points. I spent the first week pretty much starving until I figured out what foods I needed to eat that were low in points and would fill me up. Eventually, I started eating much more than I used to each day – and I actually started losing weight.
In terms of the toughness factor, that needs to be our identity, Gard said.
Of course it will mean a change, mainly because it is one and not the other in charge, she said.
Theo Riddick caught 61 passes, second most on the team, but his snaps would have been better going to Johnson, too. Riddick no longer strikes fear in opposing defenses as he averaged just 6.3 yards a catch. Zach Zenner was the Lions' second most effective back. He did an admirable job closing out a December win against the Arizona Cardinals, had 123 yards from scrimmage in Week 17 against the Packers and earned himself a roster spot somewhere in the NFL next year.

MLB OFFSEASON: Best free agents still on the market
That's how long it's been since the Browns maintained a level of respectability they cemented Sunday by completing an 11-5 regular season. There have been years of futility since 1999, 10 general managers (counting Davis in a dual role), 10 full-time head coaches and two more interim coaches. Now comes the hope of competency and professionalism and sound, calm judgments from the triumvirate of Kevin Stefanski, General Manager Andrew Berry and Chief Strategy Officer Paul DePodesta.
What I remember distinctly is she looked at me and said, 'No, you don't understand who I am.' ... I was a little bit taken back, John Buatti testified. For me it was the safety of my children, not who she was or why that would matter.
The Colts did not score after taking a 21-0 lead into halftime, but the Texans were never able to completely slow down Mack. After Houston missed an opportunity to cut into the Colts' 21-7 lead with 4:09 left, Mack picked up a first down on a third-and-2 play by the nose of the football. He then broke runs of 15 and 26 yards before the Colts went into victory formation.
Fox helped restore some of the professionalism that was missing under former GM Phil Emery and coach Marc Trestman. But Fox's conservative approach and some questionable decisions during games were sore spots.
As much as we have to find that connection again, everyone else has to figure out their spacing and where they should be when we're doing whatever it is, Green said about reuniting with Curry. Those are all things that will come with time. But in the meantime, we just got to keep improving.

One of the most notable examples: Stern supported Lakers star Magic Johnson after he announced he was HIV-positive on Nov. 7, 1991. Not only did Stern stand near Johnson's side during his press conference. Stern also paved the way for Johnson's return in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game, the 1992 Olympics, the 1992-93 season and the 1995-96 season. Because of Stern's support, Johnson tweeted that we were able to change the world.

Once we started playing defense, Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. I thought the last five minutes of the second quarter we got going. We got some stops. I thought (Anthony Tolliver) gave us a big lift. He hit a couple big 3s and that gave us the energy, gave us a lift, and the defense, I thought, in the second half was very good.

For example, Ripple's coin, known as the XRP, may serve as an intermediary that'll allow transactions to settle faster. Ripple is a blockchain company that's focused on partnering with big banks and financial institutions. Imagine that a customer in Japan wants to make a payment to a business in the U.K. If this payment were routed through Ripple's blockchain, it could take the payment in Japanese yen, convert that payment into XRP coins, then convert those coins into British pounds. All of this could theoretically be done instantly, or at the very least considerably faster than traditional banks (and hopefully for a lower cost).

Many hotels now freely allow food deliveries from outside the hotel. In fact, in less expensive hotels, there are often restaurant delivery brochures in guest rooms. Of course, the dirty secret that the more expensive hotels don't want to 'fess up to is that outside delivery is typically far cheaper than the room service they have on offer. But hotels discourage it for other reasons besides lost revenue.

The sole questions were whether a wide receiver, even one as dynamic as Smith, had a chance against the overwhelming power of statistics. Alabama doesn't have the only explosive offense in college football. Offenses everywhere have exploded. While that does increase numbers for receivers, it causes potential exponential growth in a passing quarterback's output.

Wellesley: A college employee who posted a controversial Facebook post about Iran bombing the U.S. was suspended Wednesday. Babson College's director of sustainability, Asheen Phansey, faced disciplinarian actions for a post he made on social media on Tuesday that suggested Iran list 52 American cultural sites that Iran could bomb, the Boston Herald reported. President Donald Trump posted on Twitter on Jan 4. that the U.S. has targeted 52 Iranian sites in reference to rising tensions between the countries. In the now-deleted post, Phansey wrote, In retaliation, Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? Kardashian residence? In a statement Wednesday, the former employee said, I regret my bad attempt at humor. As an American, born and raised, I was trying to juxtapose our 'cultural sites' with ancient Iranian churches and mosques. I am completely opposed to violence and would never advocate it by anyone. I am sorry that my sloppy humor was read as a threat.

One would think so, Fehr said. One would think so. Look, if you have a CBA expiring in a year, does the NHL not plan for the season or seasons after the CBA expires? Of course they do. It doesn't mean you don't change things, it doesn't mean you can't have issues. … It is always conceivable that you can do a long-term international program which would sweep in all kinds of events if even if you don't have a CBA extension, even if that means that there are some uncertainties.''

Galveston: Remains found on a tiny South Pacific island where a bloody World War II battle happened have been identified as those of a missing Marine from Galveston, a federal agency said Wednesday. In a statement, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency announced that the remains of 1st Lt. Justin G. Mills of Galveston, Texas, had been identified. The remains were found in 2015 on the island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll of the Gilbert Islands. The remains were turned over to the DPAA laboratory for genetic identification. Mills had been missing since the November 1943 Battle for Tarawa, which left about 1,000 U.S. Marines and sailors dead and more than 2,000 more wounded from fighting that stretched over four days. The DPAA said Mills died on the battle's first day. Mills is to be buried April 29 at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia.

Under the false guise of economic profitability, the film homogenized the term Asian, supplanting sub-Asian diversity with a myopically fair-skinned, wealthy, British-accented version.

I don't think there would be buy-in in those communities for policies of the widespread use of police chases if people knew that which you reveal in these data, he added. Which is that most folks are not going to be arrested. When they are arresting people, it's seldom for violent crimes. That suggests that police should be thinking through wholesale changes to the way they conduct chases and frankly whether they're conducting them at all in many instances.

Second-year linebacker Jarrad Davis is a bit of a lightning rod. He's a physical force who had some big moments and really nice games (against the Packers and Cardinals late in the season), but he also missed 17 tackles on the year, according to Pro Football Focus, and was front and center on some key mistakes. Davis had a costly offside penalty against the Bills and got beat in coverage for a back-breaking first down by Ezekiel Elliott, albeit that one on a tough play. He did emerge as a pass rusher (six sacks), and Eli Harold contributed as an edge rusher in limited snaps.

Some of the efforts are small, like Denver's decision to create a list of air-conditioned facilities where residents can take refuge during heat waves. Others are more ambitious: In Alaska, officials are preparing to relocate several native villages in danger of being washed away by seas that no longer freeze solid for months at a time. Many more fall into the middle, like the decision by Florida Keys officials to raise up portions of their low-lying roads to serve as flood barriers, or efforts by Austin, Texas, to reduce water consumption in anticipation of droughts in.

Cheer lures viewers in with the traditional hallmarks of a sports story: A group of scrappy underdogs, a rousing coach and stunning displays of physical prowess.

Murphy wanted to get the whole story out about Operation Commando Riot, aimed at a high-value Taliban target. The U.S. military called in an airstrike on its own security guards. Dozens of children were killed. U.S. military officials publicly claimed it was a success. But, as Murphy's reporting found, some troops were never warned of Azizabad's civilian population, and the special operation commanders who did know unleashed devastating force from the air anyway.

A stimulus moves us away from the scarce resources frame that too often dominates when confronting the need to invest in children. The bipartisan Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which created the Troubled Assets Relief Program, a $700 billion fund to purchase toxic assets from banks, didn't force banks or their CEOs to compete for needed resources to stabilize their operations. Instead, it provided them with well-calculated, targeted resources needed to do the job. Likewise, we are at a moment when the public education system, its students and educators are in dire need of resources to stabilize operations and eliminate the toxicity of racial disparities.
After a dozen Republican senators declared last week that they intend to object to the certification of the Electoral College result, many of their Democratic and Republican colleagues have strongly condemned their plan, saying they risk losing voter's faith in the process over unfounded allegations of widespread fraud.
This team, I really wanted to do the best I could do for this team, probably as much as any team I've ever coached, Saban said. We didn't always play pretty in this game. It probably wasn't one of our best games when it just comes to flat execution. But when it comes to competing and making plays when we needed to make them, it was probably as good as it gets.
Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., the third-ranking House Republican, circulated a note among her Republican colleagues Sunday morning calling efforts to overturn the election and prevent the certification of Electoral College results directly at odds with the Constitution's clear text and our core beliefs as Republicans, according to a source familiar with the memo not authorized to speak on the record. NBC News had first reported the memo.

The Titans stormed back from a 21-3 halftime deficit and rode star performances from quarterback Marcus Mariota (205 yards and two touchdowns passing, 46 yards rushing, one monster block late) and running back Derrick Henry (23 carries, 156 yards, one touchdown). They benefited from the second-quarter loss of Kansas City tight end Travis Kelce, but there was nothing through 30 minutes to suggest they could even make this a game.

Austin: The Texas Capitol, shuttered to the public since the coronavirus pandemic took root in March, reopened Monday with protocols in place aimed at minimizing the risk for new infections. At this time, a mask worn over the nose and mouth is required at all times inside the building, said an online message from the State Preservation Board, the agency that operates the buildings in the Capitol complex in the heart of Austin. The state will also provide no-cost coronavirus testing for anyone who wants it before they enter the building. Also, capacity will be limited, and social distancing is required. Only one of the four public entrances will be open. Before the building was officially reopened, a large tent was erected outside the entrance on the Capitol's north side to administer tests. Only a few visitors stopped by during the first hour of operation. The reopening comes just eight days before the start of the 2021 legislative session.

Flagstaff: All students in the Flagstaff school district will be provided with iPads under a loan program that starts this week with middle and high school students and continues with elementary school students at the start of the next school year. Flagstaff Unified School District voters in 2018 approved a bond measure to provide $10.6 million to pay for the tablets, cases and other accessories. The district won't require students to use the iPads, but officials say opting out could affect the potential of classroom learning, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Students and their parents have been asked to sign a new loan agreement, to review an existing agreement on responsible use of technology and to pay a nonrefundable $25 annual device protection plan fee. Scholarships for the fee are available for families in need.

Just as the new tax laws limit the mortgage interest deduction, so, too, do they limit the extent to which you can deduct property taxes. In fact, going forward, your total SALT (state and local tax) deduction maxes out at $10,000, whereas prior to 2018, it was unlimited. If you're thinking of buying a home in a low- or no-income tax state, and you don't expect your property tax bill to be particularly high, then the $10,000 cap won't impact you. But if you're buying a home in, say, New Jersey, which boasts the highest property taxes in the nation, you may come to find that a portion of your property tax bill is non-deductible.

Trenton: The state Attorney General's Office has convened a grand jury that is investigating state-run veterans homes – where 202 people have died from COVID-19 – for possible criminal charges. A subpoena and letter dated Oct. 23 from the office's Medicaid Fraud Control Unit demand that a records custodian from the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus supply a litany of documents to investigators and possibly appear before a state grand jury to give testimony. It is not known whether the grand jury is focusing exclusively on the veterans homes in Paramus, Menlo Park and Vineland or is also looking at other nursing homes statewide with high numbers of deaths, as Attorney General Gurbir Grewal announced he would do last spring. Peter Aseltine, a spokesman for the Attorney General's Office, said Monday that he would not offer any specifics on the investigation. The Paramus and Menlo Park facilities have seen a combined 191 residents and two caregivers die from COVID-19 since the pandemic began in March – among the highest COVID-19 death tolls at nursing homes across the nation.

Of course, if you're not planning to itemize on your tax return, there's no need to worry about the mortgage interest deduction, or any deduction, for that matter.

But if your intent is to itemize, then be aware of the aforementioned limit.

Returns on market-linked CDs rise or fall based on the performance of a benchmark, such as a broad market index like the Standard & Poor's 500. Some market-linked CDs offer a minimum return, others don't. Traditional CDs, on the other hand, promise a set interest rate. Market-linked CDs can be an option for investors who are risk-adverse, don't need current liquidity and want higher returns offered by CDs.

But, this year, the NHL changed the voting rules for the All-Star Game, giving league officials the power to decide the bulk of the roster. Fans were allowed to vote for division captains, and picked John Scott, Jaromir Jagr, Alex Ovechkin and Patrick Kane, but all the other players were chosen by the NHL. That's actually a good thing. Fan voting isn't always fair, and plenty of deserving players are consistently left off the list (like the Capitals' Nicklas Backstrom). This year, there's at least more parity in the selection.

Perhaps the fear is that domestic violence is too endemic, that allowing asylum would open the floodgates. We need not worry, for a woman or girl fleeing domestic violence has multiple legal burdens that minimize the numbers: She must prove that her fear is both genuine and well-founded, that the harm she fears is severe, that her government is unable or unwilling to protect her, that no place anywhere in her country would be safe, and — even if gender is added to the list — that the persecution will be inflicted because of her gender. These are all high bars, and proof requires meticulous, persuasive documentation. Canada has recognized domestic violence asylum claims since the 1990s, and no floodgates have opened.

Eggs shouldn't be allowed to freeze in their shells; if that happens, throw away any cracked eggs. Keep the un-cracked ones frozen, and move them to the refrigerator before use. These can be hard cooked successfully, but other uses may be limited.

ESPN said the TV-only audiences were up 23% for the early game and 3% for the late game, and both games set streaming records. Both games, like last season, were blowouts, making it difficult to reach the marks set in the playoff's first year.
The way that he took it head on, the way he presented the game to America, he didn't hide behind anything, Thomas said in 2014. This is our league. This is who we are.

We just need to put those pieces together and we'll be OK. Everybody needs to make some sacrifices. I did that and I feel good.
It has been suggested the quarterfinals could replace conference championship games. Good luck with that. First off, the Southeastern Conference has made it clear it has no desire to get rid of an event that is worth about $75 million to the league. Still, if an expanded playoff has automatic bids for conference champions, those title games become far more interesting and valuable to media companies holding their broadcast rights.

Not since The Voice arrived in 2011 has a new reality competition captured the nation's attention. At last, Fox might have found a variation on the formula that will shock and delight you even more. Ten celebrities – described as athletes, Emmy and Grammy winners – clad in elaborate costumes sing their hearts out and both viewers and the celebrity judges – Robin Thicke, Jenny McCarthy, Ken Jeong and Nicole Scherzinger – try to guess who they are. Each week the losing singer, decided by the in-studio audience and the judges, leaves the show and takes off their mask. It's such bizarre and brilliant fun that you may not even care who the celebrities are. Or, you might wish that your favorite voices lose quickly so you can see who's hiding secret talents. – Kelly Lawler

Fort Smith: The director of the Crawford-Sebastian Community Development Council says up to $200,000 may have been stolen from the organization that provides financial assistance, housing and food to the needy. The Times Record reports that CSCBC director Marc Baker said improper invoices had been submitted for vendors that had already been paid. The newspaper said Baker last week reported anywhere from $30,000 to $200,000 of duplicate invoices since July. Fort Smith police spokesman Aric Mitchell said an investigation into Baker's allegation would likely begin Monday. Baker said he contacted the FBI because the funds include money from two federal grants, but he was referred to Fort Smith police. The agency's website says it provides services such as housing, food, utility payment assistance and dental programs to low-income residents in about a dozen western Arkansas counties.

Nashville: The city's once-thriving party scene – a hefty chunk of its economic base – took yet another direct hit in the Christmas morning bombing that tore up blocks in the center of downtown. In the hours after the attack, tourism and marketing officials rushed to cancel a new ad campaign, already delayed as coronavirus cases surged, aimed at luring out-of-town visitors. Now the question of when tourists will be welcomed back is weighing heavy on minds and pocketbooks across town. We're predicting January and February tourism to be virtually nonexistent, said Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. CEO Butch Spyridon. The only thing I know is it will be bad. Many honky-tonks, bars and restaurants that managed to limp through the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns are now unsure when they can safely reopen. Honky-tonk owner Steve Smith said he's so frustrated that he's losing sleep and called on Mayor John Cooper to reinstate regular hours. The city is in the third phase of its COVID-19 reopening strategy, and bars and restaurants must have last call at 10 p.m. Downtown business owners have argued for months that it's safer to allow them to operate as much as possible with social distancing measures so people aren't having parties at homes or other places where they're in closer proximity.

First, blockchain technology is decentralized. In simple terms, this just means there isn't a data center where all transaction data is stored. Instead, data from this digital ledger is stored on hard drives and servers all over the globe. The reason this is done is twofold: 1.) it ensures that no one person or company will have central authority over a virtual currency, and 2.) it acts as a safeguard against cyberattacks, such that criminals aren't able to gain control of a cryptocurrency and exploit its holders.

Chicago: O'Hare and Midway international airports have added boxes where travelers can dispose of recreational marijuana before they board their flights. The cannabis amnesty boxes, as they're called, were installed at each airport last week, just as legal marijuana sales began in Illinois. The boxes are located just past the airports' Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, the Chicago Tribune reported. Although police aren't targeting travelers with cannabis, and it's not illegal to have it at the airport, possessing is still illegal under federal law, and air space is regulated by the federal government, Chicago Police Department spokeswoman Maggie Huynh said. The boxes give people an opportunity to ensure that they're not breaking federal law and won't run into an issue when they land at their destination, she said. The boxes are owned by the Department of Aviation and serviced by the police. Police officers will regularly empty the boxes, file a report for the items inside and dispose of any surrendered marijuana like they would narcotics, Huynh said. Illinois residents can legally possess up to 30 grams of marijuana, or about an ounce, in Illinois and out-of-state residents can have half that.

He refused to take a second look at Colin Kaepernick — who was attractive enough of an option for Elway before he sparked the protest movement in the NFL, but not afterward.

Hartford: The leader of Connecticut's largest teachers union is urging school superintendents statewide to switch all classes to remote learning until at least the middle of this month, citing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. Jeff Leake, president of the Connecticut Education Association, said many students and educators were to return to classrooms Monday, before potential virus surges from the holiday season are over. He said many school districts already have moved to strictly distance learning through mid-January. While no one is more eager to return to the classroom than Connecticut's dedicated teachers, detecting and stopping the spread of COVID-19 must be the top priority, Leake said in a statement Sunday evening. He also called on the state to mandate more coronavirus testing and said a new survey by his union and the American Federation of Teachers shows that schools are not the safest places for children or educators amid a pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont and state education officials have been allowing local school officials to decide whether to switch to all-remote learning but have been advocating for schools to be kept open, saying it's better for students.
The sources of stress and fatigue are complex. Many teachers have had to switch back and forth between in-person and online learning, often with only a few days' notice.

The government takes into consideration the fluctuating costs of operating a car when it sets the standard mileage rate each year. The rate is one of two methods for an owner to account for how much was spent on using a car for business; the second is to deduct the actual expenses for the car. An owner opting for actual expenses must calculate the percentage of miles the car is driven for business reasons, and apply that percentage to expenses like lease payments, fuel, maintenance, repairs and insurance. An owner can also deduct depreciation.

Augusta: A group of Republican lawmakers plans to travel to the Statehouse on Tuesday to call on their colleagues to get back to work, accusing Democratic leaders of dragging their feet. Legislative leaders countered that the work already is underway and that the appropriations committee is meeting Tuesday. Republicans protested in the summer and fall when the Legislature failed to reach a consensus for reconvening during the pandemic. The current plan is for the bulk of committees to convene in a few weeks. Republican Rep. Shelley Rudnicki, of Fairfield, said her group will gather in the House Chamber to make a point. We are a co-equal branch of government, and the governor is making decisions without any input from the Legislature. It's time for us to get to work, said Rudnicki, who accused the governor of unprecedented and draconian actions while the Legislature was sidelined. Republicans decried some of Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' executive orders imposed because of COVID-19, but the Legislature failed to reconvene when Republicans and Democrats couldn't agree on the scope of work to be conducted. Rudnicki acknowledged Tuesday's action is a symbolic gesture since both chambers are controlled by Democrats.

Like I told Andrei after the fight, I was like, 'Dude, it was an honor,' Harris said. I used to literally watch him fight before I started fighting. I got started pretty late fighting, so I was watching him, ordering his pay-per-views, like there's no way in hell I'd fight that dude. And there I am in the cage with him. It was kind of surreal, but then I had to snap out of it.

Before digital cameras appeared in the mid-1990s, generations of photographers like myself invested talent, time and resources creating billions of images on various-size roll and sheet film, he explained. I invented the FilmToaster as the ultimate accessory bridging 20th-century film and 21st-century digital. Because analog technology including film and equipment declines and fades with age, transferring film images into a digital format is no longer a choice — it is an inevitable necessity.

Social media has become a significant part of the sporting landscape. But few, if any, professional sports match the level of interaction and personal access provided by MMA.
Why does this matter for baby boomers? Because it will affect how much of their benefit they'll receive, based on how early you retire. For instance, someone born in 1954 would have turned 62 in 2016, thus eligible for Social Security at a reduced level. Since their full retirement age is 66, they would receive 75% of their full benefit if they retired at age 62.

At the beginning of 2019, investigative reporters at UC Berkeley's Graduate School of Journalism got their hands on a list that showed an eye-popping number of current or former law enforcement officers, and applicants, who had been convicted of a crime.

LEADERSHIP STABILITY: Don't look for significant change in Clemson's coaching staff as it looks like the Tigers will head into spring camp with its three prime coordinators — Brent Venables on defense, Tony Elliott and Jeff Scott on offense — in place. Each member of the trio was mentioned as potential candidates as coaching jobs came open, but ultimately stayed put. Venables will get to coach his son, linebacker Jake, next fall. Elliott and Scott both believe they've got more to learn as coordinators before taking a head coaching job.
My stint started in 2000 – I began at USA TODAY earlier, covering entertainment – when we spent a lot of time talking about the big three tech companies: AOL, Yahoo and Microsoft. AOL had just shocked the world by buying Time Warner for $165 billion. (You know how well that turned out. But I digress.)
To the surprise of no one, Hannity immediately started making threats, saying bombers were on the way to the region and sounding like a schoolyard bully, gloating about how Mullahs better hide in their bunkers and refinery workers might want to change jobs pretty quick.

Spring Hill:General Motors and United Auto Workers Local 1853 have agreed to convert 157 local temporary workers to permanent status effective Feb. 3. The decision resolves a dispute between GM in Spring Hill and the union over the hiring of new temporary workers, Chairman Mike Herron told The Daily Herald on Thursday. Under the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in October, GM agreed to convert temporary workers with three years of continual service to permanent status. None of the temporary workers in Spring Hill had three consecutive years of service because of layoffs in 2017 and 2018, creating a short-lived problem. The deal between GM and Local 1853 allows the plant to begin bringing in new temporary workers. The company has started taking applications, seeking 154 employees for those positions. On Monday, GM announced it was making 930 temporary workers permanent at 30 of its 52 UAW-represented plants across the country. Ford also moved 592 temps to full-time status. At GM's Flint Assembly in Michigan, 250 were told at a meeting by the local union president of their new status.
He's carried the ball 689 times during the span — by far the most of any quarterback in the league — and has run for more TDs (48) than any QB in league history. Rivera sounded like the team will be veering away from the read option which the Panthers ran so effectively early in Newton's career in order to prevent further wear and tear on his body.
You've got to give credit where credit is due. President Donald Trump is sparking the biggest reexamination of the nuts and bolts of our democracy since the Constitutional Convention in 1787. How many of us had contemplated the ins and outs of the Vacancies Act or the proper scope of presidential power during a national emergency before Trump came along? Unfortunately, all this is missing some of the dignity of the original discussion, and we've ended up with a sort of tabloid version of The Federalist Papers in which those of us concerned about American institutions don't so much engage in learned debate as in frantically attempting to head off the next pending scandal.

Maybe we could just finance the entire project, and invest the $50,000 we saved, you think. Which technically is not a bad idea, if your investment returns outpace your loan interest.

Not only would you have a $50,000 kitchen, but your original $50,000 would now be worth $95,609, and you would have only paid a total of $60,718 for the remodeling project and interest.

Southwest Airlines carries more passengers domestically than any other airline, accounting for 25% of all U.S. passengers. It created the model for low-fare airlines — popular because of its impeccable customer service, no reserved seating, and a resistance to charging baggage and change fees as competitors nickle-and-dime fliers. Those are big reasons Southwest is the only discount carrier that has the cachet to lower fares across the board at an airport, aviation experts have told The Cincinnati Enquirer.

Seattle: King County is starting 2021 with plans to buy as many as a dozen hotels to permanently house hundreds of homeless people and provide them with services. We have every reason to believe that homelessness will get a lot worse after this pandemic unless we take bold action, said Leo Flor, director of the King County Department of Community and Human Services. The initiative is called Health Through Housing, KING5 reports. It uses revenue from a 0.1% sales tax increase to develop a network of apartment-like shelters, with the goal of getting people out of tents, off sidewalks and into safe, clean homes. The county hopes to eventually house 45%, or 2,000 people, of its chronically homeless population of 4,500. The goal for 2021 is to create housing units for 1,500 people countywide, in former hotels and nursing homes throughout the county. Flor said hotel owners are already approaching the county and offering their properties, which are struggling to fill rooms during the pandemic.

Washington: More than 2,000 faith leaders and religious activists are calling on members of Congress to honor the result of November's election and avoid a delayed and drawn out objection this week when President-elect Joe Biden's win is set to be certified. Signatories to the statement released Monday include many prominent religious liberals, such as Barbara Williams-Skinner, co-convener of the National African American Clergy Network, and the Rev. Mariann Budde, bishop of Washington's Episcopal diocese. Also signing on are a handful of evangelicals who have criticized President Donald Trump despite his overwhelming popularity among white evangelical voters, including World Vision president emeritus Rich Stearns. As faithful citizens, we are praying for a peaceful, smooth, and dignified transfer of power, said the statement, whose signatories were shared with the Associated Press ahead of their release. A delayed and drawn out objection on January 6th would not overturn the will of the American people and change the outcome of the election, it said.
All the injuries forced McCarthy and defensive coordinator Dom Capers to scramble. Burnett and Hyde, who already have key roles on defense for their versatility, assumed different responsibilities.

Waterloo: A business lobbying group is trying to halt the city's new ordinance that is supposed to help convicted felons find work. The Iowa Association of Business and Industry filed a petition for injunctive relief against the city in Black Hawk District Court on Friday, arguing cities don't have the authority to pass laws like Waterloo's. The ban the box ordinance prevents companies from including a question on applications about whether prospective employees have been convicted of crimes. But in its petition, the ABI points to a 2017 Iowa law that bans cities and counties from passing some business-related ordinances. The local governments can't preempt federal or state rules about business practices like benefits and hiring practices. The Legislature passed the law because some county officials – including those in Polk County – wanted to raise the minimum wage.

New Orleans: John White, who helped strengthen the role of charter schools, backed a taxpayer-funded tuition voucher program for private schools and oversaw overhauls of the state's school accountability efforts, said he is stepping down as Louisiana's education superintendent. He told state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education members in a letter that he will leave the job March 11. He did not state his reasons. The board said a search for his replacement would begin immediately and the process will be discussed at an upcoming meeting. White can point to numerous improvements made during his eight years as education chief, including improved graduation rates and better performance on college preparation tests. His tenure was also marked by a rocky relationship with teacher unions and Gov. John Bel Edwards. And the state continues to lag others in nationwide education rankings. Still, his departure comes as his job seemed secure, following the election last year of a slate of state education board members who were backed by the state's business lobby, which was supportive of White. Although he didn't discuss his future, The Advocate reported in April that he had quietly co-founded a national nonprofit group, Propel America, aimed at connecting low-income high school graduates with solid jobs. White has been education superintendent since 2012 but he had been working on a month-to-month basis since 2016. Although he had the support of a majority of the 11-member state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education, he lacked the two-thirds majority needed to get a new contract.

We need to do a better job of going into each week, looking at the opponent, and saying, how are we going to beat this team? They have a great run defense and a poor pass defense, maybe we throw it 45 times. And vice versa, Quinn said. We want someone that thinks that way. That thinks that, hey, I have an offense, but my offense is adaptable.
Before you know it, we're down 14-0, Texans coach Bill O'Brien said. We missed a third down – our first third-down of the game – then they got the ball back, went up 14-0. That just changes your whole offensive game plan. You're almost in somewhat of a two-minute mode at that point in time, because you've got to play catch-up. Give the Colts credit all the way around. They did a better job than we did, obviously.

Because 4K is so yesterday, right? There still isn't much 4K programming available, but virtually all sets sold today have upgraded from standard high-definition to 4K Ultra High-Definition. Manufacturers are looking to the next trend to reinvigorate TV sales, which market researcher the NPD Group says are flat, with double the resolution of a current 4K set, at sky-high prices. A $15,000 85-inch 8K set from Samsung is currently available. LG, Sony, Vizio, TCL and HiSense are also expected to have 8K models on display at CES for 2019 release. But don't worry, these products (with lower pricing) are not expected to go mass market until 2020. Perhaps by that time, viewers can find 4K programming at their fingertips.

Things contract when they freeze, so this can cause some instruments to go out of tune. More seriously, damage can be done when an instrument shrinks as a result of the cold air. If your instrument is made of real wood, the cold air can cause cracking, which is very expensive to repair. Sometimes they are broken beyond repair, according to The Real School of Music. If an instrument is left in a freezing car for a long period, try to make it warm up gradually.

Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Board of Governors violated the state's open meetings laws by secretly negotiating and approving a deal to dispose of a Confederate monument from the campus of the system's flagship school, according to a lawsuit filed by a student newspaper. DTH Media Corp., which publishes The Daily Tar Heel student newspaper on the UNC-Chapel Hill campus, wants a court to void two agreements between the Board of Governors and the state chapter of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, news outlets reported on Wednesday. The deal has been denounced by students and faculty members as paying money to support white nationalism. UNC-Chapel Hill lost a $1.5 million research grant because of it. Superior Court Judge Allen Baddour said last month that he is reconsidering his approval of the deal. Baddour approved an agreement on Nov. 27 in which the SCV agreed to take ownership of the Silent Sam statue and build a center to preserve it. The statue stood for more than a century on the Chapel Hill campus before protesters took it down in August 2018. The university agreed to put $2.5 million into a trust to help defray the costs of the new center. In addition, UNC-Chapel Hill paid the SCV about $75,000 not to display Confederate flags or similar banners on any UNC system campus during any meetings or demonstrations for five years.
What's so offensive about Hillary's charade is her complete ignorance about what life is like for immigrants and people of color in this country.

It's thus not entirely surprising one of their best-selling items is a closet system. I mean, as we prepare for the apocalypse, we need all the storage we can get to stock up on canned goods.

New Jersey legislators took a strong first step by empowering voters to raise the minimum wage in 2013, said Rob Duffey, spokesman for the advocacy group New Jersey Working Families. But the simple fact is that an hourly wage of $8.38 won't even cover the basics in New Jersey, much less sustain a family.
16. While we're on the Smith topic, Jaguars QB Blake Bortles passed for 87 yards and rushed for 88 in Sunday's win over Buffalo. Maybe Jacksonville should deal for Smith and convert Bortles, who's averaged 6.3 yards per run during his four-year career, into a change-of-pace option behind Leonard Fournette. Or maybe Jacksonville should go full triple option with Bortles on the trigger. Yet given their own QB dissatisfaction, perhaps the Bills could make a play for Smith first.

How about instead of misrepresenting their fares, we get all of the airlines on the same page. Ask them, or require them, to quote ticket prices that include all of these essential items: a boarding pass printout, a seat reservation, a checked bag, basic amenities and the ability to change a ticket for a reasonable price. If you want to uncheck a box that removes these extras, fine. The cost of your flight will fall. But don't quote a bare fare and leave passengers with the impression they're getting a deal.

Miles City is the least expensive place to live in Montana. The city has the lowest property taxes at just $1,480 per year, as well as the least expensive median monthly housing cost at $655. Though Miles City's $47,383 median household income is one of the lower such figures in Montana, a relatively small share of residents are impoverished. The area's poverty rate of 13.5 percent is one of the lowest in the state, and well below Montana's statewide poverty rate of 14.9 percent.

Greenbelt: Residents, civic associations and local governments in counties that would be crossed by a proposed high-speed, magnetic levitation train linking Baltimore and Washington say they are weighing options to fight the plan. The Washington Post reports the city of Greenbelt is among those opposing the so-called maglev project. Last month, the city issued a request for services to attorneys and law firms willing to take on the fight. Other options being weighed to oppose the $10 billion plan include lobbying lawmakers and organizing protests, the newspaper reports. Critics say the train would offer little benefit to communities it will pass through because it would only stop in Washington, Baltimore and the Baltimore/Washington International Airport. Opponents are worried about construction impacts. But supporters say it will ease traffic congestion, create jobs and boost economic development.

But the moves and stunts required to be competitive at a national level are startlingly dangerous, and the number of injuries caught on film in just one school year is horrifying. While Coach Aldama appears a maternal figure to these kids, she also pushes them to risk their bodies for her goal, demanding they train while injured: It's pain for glory. It's disturbing to watch and prompts questions about just how many rules and regulations govern the sport and how many more there should be.

PLAYER TO WATCH: Dillon Brooks, Oregon. The junior missed the first three games of the season due to offseason foot surgery and took a few games to get back into the groove. He's sure in one now. Brooks was named the NCAA and conference player of the week after averaging 25.5 points, 6.0 rebounds and 3.5 assists in victories over previously-unbeaten No. 4 UCLA and No. 25 USC. He also hit the game-winning 3-pointer against the Bruins.
Nevin Lawson remains an underappreciated No. 2 cornerback. He doesn't have an interception in his career and was flagged 11 times this season, but he shut down Adam Thielen in early November and slid seamlessly inside to the slot cornerback spot when the Lions were juggling personnel in their secondary. Backup cornerbacks DeShawn Shead and Teez Tabor both had rough seasons, with Tabor getting benched for much of the year and Shead misplaying a Hail Mary against the Vikings. Undrafted rookie Michael Ford played well in his first couple games off practice squad, but was exposed the more he was on the field.
Quality of life for residents is boosted by lower than average crime, poverty, and unemployment rates.

Goods and services are about 4 percent less expensive than they are nationwide on average.

Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., and Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, D-Ohio, joined to challenge Ohio's presidential electors. In both cases, these challenges were rejected by both the House and the Senate. In the case of the 2005 challenge, which is the closest we've come to the situation we're facing Wednesday, the challenge was rejected 267-31 in the House and 74-1 in the Senate.

I am all about technology that makes parenting easier, which is why I am obsessed with Winnie. The online platform is the first website that enables parents to find licensed daycares and preschools in their area.

They're among at least 53 black people killed in police pursuits in New Jersey since 1999, according to federal data that depends on departments to file crash forms and thus might under-count the deaths. King's death isn't listed in the data as being related to a police pursuit, though police accused a man of causing his death while fleeing from cops.
McClendon showed his adaptability in the Outback Bowl when South Carolina fell behind 19-3 and had little success against Michigan's defense, which ranks third in the country.

Montpelier: The Legislature is getting ready to kick off the 2021 session with almost all of the pomp and circumstance occurring remotely. Even as late as Monday, some of the moving parts of the Wednesday opening of the 2021 session were still developing. Once lawmakers are sworn in and settle into their jobs, the primary focus of this session is expected to be the state's continued response to the coronavirus pandemic. We are trying to make it a normal first day of session, except that we are on Zoom, said Democratic state Rep. Jill Krowinski, the presumptive incoming speaker of the House. All of the same traditions will be happening. The House will be governing remotely for at least all of January and February, she said. The Senate will also be meeting remotely, but Lt. Gov.-elect Molly Gray will be sworn into office Thursday in the Senate chamber. Gray said she would then preside over her first session from the podium in the Senate chamber while senators will be attending remotely. Republican Gov. Phil Scott will be sworn in for his third term Thursday, after which he is scheduled to give his inaugural address.

Lincoln: A state lawmaker concerned about prison overcrowding plans to propose building a new 300-bed work release facility in Omaha. State Sen. Steve Lathrop tells the Omaha World-Herald he'll introduce a bill calling on the state to begin planning a new community corrections facility. Building the new facility could cost more than $40 million, but Lathrop's bill would only require the state to plan for the new work release facility. Nebraska's prisons currently hold 2,006 more inmates than their design capacity of 3,535 inmates, putting the prison system at 157% of its design capacity. Lathrop says the state is facing a prison overcrowding crisis and needs to address the issue. A consultant recommended expanding Omaha's community corrections prison in 2014, but the project was never done. Lathrop says work-release facilities can help better prepare inmates to return to society.

Long before she shattered box-office records with 2017's Wonder Woman, director Patty Jenkins gave us the brutal yet deeply human Monster (2004), starring Charlize Theron as serial killer Aileen Wuornos. The filmmaker returns to her disquieting true-crime roots with the '60s-set Night, which reunites her with Wonder Woman heartthrob Chris Pine, who plays a disgraced journalist whose life becomes intertwined with that of Fauna Hodel (India Eisley), a young woman seeking answers about her apparently mixed-race background and wealthy grandfather (Jefferson Mays), a prime suspect in the infamous Black Dahlia murder. Pine is charismatic as always, but it's Eisley's mesmerizing performance that gives this chilling mystery its beating heart. – Ryan

Among the most significant changes is a shootout-style overtime procedure, with teams getting up to five one-play possessions from the 5-yard line worth two points each. The teams will alternate plays until one team is mathematically eliminated.

Topeka: Topeka Presbyterian Manor began giving the COVID-19 vaccine to residents and staff Saturday, as part of a watershed moment in nursing homes' fight against the coronavirus that has ravaged their communities. As part of a partnership with CVS, the retirement community began administering the first round of vaccinations Thursday to at-risk residents in health care and assisted living, as well as essential health care workers. There's no doubt the senior population has been hit hard by the virus, along with the health care workers who've treated them, Heather Pilkinton, executive director at Topeka Presbyterian Manor, said in a release. We couldn't be happier to know there's finally a bit of light at the end of such a difficult year. As part of the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, CVS is administering the Pfizer version of the COVID-19 vaccine to Kansas' retirement homes and communities. Nursing homes first began distributing shots Dec. 28. All of those receiving vaccines in the next few days will need to receive a second dose 21 days after their first inoculation.

The giant trade pact between the United States, Mexico, and Canada — ultimately a renegotiated NAFTA — is expected to come up for a vote in the Senate soon (unless there are any impeachment-related setbacks). But environmental advocacy organizations who have condemned the deal's failure to consider climate change are raising alarm about moving forward without binding standards on Mexico to regulate pollution.

Full disclosure: My Heisman vote went to Smith, as we voters can now reveal. He seemed easily the most deserving, and would have seemed so whether he played in Tuscaloosa or Tucson. The greatest argument, for me, wasn't statistical. The fact that he elevated his game to another level after Jaylen Waddle's injury, to the point that Alabama's entire offense didn't miss a beat, was even more striking.

We consider ourselves knowledgeable and informed, yet surveys repeatedly show vast ignorance about things that matter. Only about one-third of Americans, for example, can name all three branches of government. Another study found that more Americans could identify Michael Jackson as the composer of 'Beat It' and 'Billie Jean' than could identify the Bill of Rights as a body of amendments to the U.S. Constitution.

Remember, too, it was only a year ago that Saban infamously chewed out then-offensive coordinator Brian Daboll on the sideline during the Sugar Bowl semifinal against Clemson. With the Tide comfortably ahead 24-6 early in the fourth quarter — and the Tigers doing nothing offensively — Saban wanted his team to run the ball, and the clock.

They began the night with all of 76 yards rushing on the season — about 1,460 yards less than the two guys they were replacing. Yet Todman and Toussaint kept finding room and taking some of the pressure off quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who had trouble facing an occasional downpour and a Cincinnati pass rush that rarely let him get comfortable.

So Trump's effort to interfere with the Electoral College count is going to fail — this time. Nonetheless, this tawdry episode is dangerous because it provides a blueprint for the next time. And there will be a next time because it's now clear that under the system of counting Electoral College votes, a party that controls both chambers of Congress can install its candidate as president regardless of the election results if its members have the political will to do so.

Sloppy play in Big Apple. The euphoria over the Rangers' good start has now been erased by the team's gross inconsistency for the past several weeks. They are 6-11-2 in their past 19 games and the team's veteran defensive corps has looked leaky to ordinary. The Rangers' Corsi rating (47.4%) ranks near the bottom of the league. This may be the first major test for first-year GM Jeff Gorton. Will he make a trade to change the look? (KA)
Before it did that, its funded ratio, a pension plan's assets divided by its liabilities, was less than 52%.

When disputes concerning a presidential election arise, under Federal law, it is the people's representatives who review the evidence and resolve disputes through a democratic process, he wrote. As a student of history who loves the Constitution and reveres its Framers, I do not believe that the Founders of our country intended to invest the Vice President with unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted during the Joint Session of Congress, and no Vice President in American history has ever asserted such authority.

From celery fields to college graduate at age 58
Hancock County: A huge component of a new rocket system was wheeled slowly from a New Orleans spacecraft factory on Wednesday to a barge that will float it up the Mississippi River for testing. The recently completed core stage of NASA's Space Launch System, which dwarfed the hundreds of NASA and Boeing employees, was to be taken to the Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, about 50 miles northeast of New Orleans. Space Launch System rockets are expected to take astronauts to the moon as part of NASA's Artemis program. The core stage – which measures 212 feet from end to end and more than 27 feet in diameter – was transported like a giant Carnival float from the Michoud Assembly Center in eastern New Orleans to the barge as workers took pictures. It will undergo tests at Stennis ahead of the first Artemis launch, planned for 2021, said Tony Castilleja, a systems engineer with the Boeing Space Team. The SLS core stage, with four huge engines, is the largest rocket stage NASA has assembled since the Apollo stages that first powered crewed missions to the Moon. It will be used for Artemis I, a test-flight without a crew. Artemis II is to send up a crewed spacecraft. The third mission, Artemis III, would put a man and woman on the south pole of the moon, with an eye toward a continued presence that would lead to a trip to Mars.

You might have noticed that you don't require the same types or levels of protection as before. Auto insurance is an obvious example, now that more people are working or studying at home. That has meant fewer cars are on the road, with a sharp reduction in vehicle accidents and better insurance deals.
So, it's a combination of many things. But I don't like to think (of it as) a marketing scheme as such because it is something that we consistently try to offer – these kind of low fares. I can't promise you that you will find such fares on every single flight. Clearly there's a difference between high and low season, week of the day, time to departure, etc. But overall, if you are willing to shop around a little bit – be a little bit flexible – book in advance, you should be able to get these super-low fares.

GAME OF THE WEEK: Utah (10-3, 1-0 Pac-12) at No. 17 Arizona (13-2, 2-0), Thursday. The Wildcats have been short-handed all season, yet keep finding ways to win. Arizona has played all season without Allonzo Trier (unspecified) and Ray Smith (knee), and point guard Parker Jackson-Cartwright missed six games. Jackson-Cartwright returned last week for wins over California and Stanford, giving Arizona another scoring option. The Utes have bounced back from a loss to San Francisco at the Diamondhead Classic, playing one of their best games of the season the last time out, a 16-point victory over Colorado.

Denver: Wildlife officials have discovered evidence of wolves living in northwestern Colorado after hunters reported a suspected pack and residents found a scavenged elk carcass. The Colorado Parks and Wildlife Department announced the discoveries Wednesday, suggesting a pack of gray wolves might be residing in the state, The Denver Post reported. The news was first reported Tuesday by the Craig Press. The hunters provided a video shot in October of two wolves shown near the Wyoming and Utah borders, officials said. It was the first time in a few years multiple wolves were seen traveling together in Colorado, officials said. The announcement comes days after state election officials placed a measure to reintroduce wolves on this year's ballot, officials said. The ballot will ask voters whether to require state wildlife commissioners to reintroduce gray wolves by the end of 2023 on public land in western Colorado, officials said. State wildlife officials have studied the possibility of reintroducing wolves in Colorado and decided to oppose such efforts, officials said. Local leaders in 23 counties have also opposed reintroduction.

Boston used to be more protected from storms and high tides by the tidal flats that surrounded the city, but those areas have either been developed on or dredged away to deepen the harbor.

Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election are far more serious. Based on their public statements, at least a dozen senators and at least 140 House members will vote to reject Electoral College votes from various swing states.

All the election results have been certified, all the legal challenges resolved and all the Electoral College votes cast, certified by the governors and sent to the Archivist of the United States — just as the statute requires. Trump's grossly inappropriate and probably criminal last-minute attempt to get the Georgia Secretary of state to find 11,780 votes and recalculate the election results wouldn't change these facts even if it were successful.

There's nothing wrong with pivoting during the course of a plan, when presented with new information or opportunity. But getting distracted at the denouement, simply because the finish line is in sight and the excitement overwhelms you to the point of straying, must be avoided at all cost. You can make sure you don't fall victim to this all too common disaster by consistently reminding yourself of your significant goals throughout the accumulation phase, so that the imagery in your head beats back the mutiny which often arrives near the end of the operation.

Institutional investors have kept to the sidelines because either their company won't allow them to invest in cryptocurrencies, or they're simply too volatile to merit an investment. Retail investors tend to be more reliant on their emotions relative to institutional investors, leading to moves that tend to overshoot to the upside, and downside.

Times like this unite us and bring out the best in people, New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Many Americans still haven't built up an emergency fund, and the COVID-19 outbreak with widespread job losses didn't help. But there could be a special need to accumulate a cash cushion now because you probably can't count on your annual income-tax refund arriving with as much predictability as in the past.
In 2018, turnout in Maricopa and Pima was 3 percentage points higher than the rest of the state. It has meant a growing share of voters — 77% in 2016 and 2018 — came from areas that are more urban and racially diverse.
Overall global attitudes toward the United States remain largely favorable, although there are large differences across the 33 nations surveyed for that part of the study. Three Central and Eastern European nations – Poland (79 %), Lithuania (70%) and Hungary (66%) – had the most favorable opinion of the United States.
Years of success later, each of the doctors realized that their personal achievement was not enough. I remember sitting in my office one day… and I looked on my wall and I saw all the degrees, my masters, my medical school degree, Simeon said. I was trying to figure out why I was not as happy as I should be…. It was because I needed to share something with someone else, to push someone not to achieve my goals, but even do better to go beyond what I had done.
PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz. — Stubbornness and stupidity often go hand in hand, and what results is rarely good.
Finally, men will be able to change their babies diapers in a public restroom — at least in New York — thanks to a law that went into effect on New Year's Day.
He has done a great job and he definitely has not failed, Manning added. I feel that we as players, we failed him by not playing to the level that we could.
At even strength, Oates moved Ovechkin to right wing, a change that once it took hold led to him winning his third Hart Trophy as NHL MVP in 2013. And even though new coach Barry Trotz moved Ovechkin back to his more comfortable left wing, two seasons on the right side helped reinvent him as a scorer.
Trump hasn't had better luck at the high court with his asylum ban. After a federal judge blocked his effort to cut off asylum for migrants who enter the country illegally – and before the case went to an appeals court – the Supreme Court narrowly refused, 5-4, to step in. Both of Trump's high court nominees joined two other conservative justices in dissent.
COLUMN:Attorney General Barr wrong about role of prosecutors. Tough-on-crime stance stunts progress
A win on Thursday night in Washington will tie Columbus with the 1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins of Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr for the longest streak in league history. The team's surprising success and the streak have given long-suffering Blue Jackets fans much to cheer about lately. Just don't ask Torts about it.
Sanders is one of several high-profile lawmakers, including Democratic Sens. Sherrod Brown, of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris, of California, and Elizabeth Warren, of Massachusetts, who have launched public pressure campaigns to reform the industry.

He was the sweetest thing, Kathy Miller said. Honestly, he taught us how to live. He never complained, ever. Never asked why he was the one with cancer. He was kind to everybody. He saw everyone as equal and he always saw the good in every person he met.

Weight Watchers is all about eating in moderation, and that can be a challenge when most recipes call for making family-sized portions of food. This mini muffin pan can help with that, giving you the ability to cook food in pre-portioned sizes.
This might seem obvious, but so many of us have become so good at putting off making positive change in our lives, and accepting a less positive version of reality, that it really bears mentioning. You know all of the things that make you feel angry, frustrated, and negative when it comes to your work world, and the truth is that some of those things aren't in our immediate power to change (if only we were able to choose our bosses…). That said, there are certainly things at work that bother us that we can change, and these are the things you should focus your energy and effort on. We suggest you start small. Decorate your workspace so that it's more cheerful. Try improving your communication and relationship with at least one colleague each week. Take regular breaks during the day (but don't overdo it!) in an effort to combat burnout. You'll soon start seeing a wave of positive work-related feelings wash over you. Then take on larger things, like those work responsibilities that you consistently dread or your interactions with your boss. Remember — every positive step you make involving work, no matter how small, will help keep the weekend effect at bay.
This has had tragic consequences, especially for children.
He would rather win 7-0 – but if necessary, 55-45 is fine. Saban has evolved. And Alabama is not just different. It's better.
The cast – including director Peter Farrelly – spoke about the chemistry between the film's two main characters.
I watched the tournament — my wife had taped it — and I was double-checking to make sure it happened, Pampling said. It's daunting to look down at your phone and see that you've got 300 text messages. But man, it's good.

Raphael Warnock beat Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Jon Ossoff bested Republican Sen. David Perdue in Georgia's two runoff elections.
If the strategy proves successful, it could lead to even more efforts by the Trump administration to seek Supreme Court bailouts of lower court rulings. One prime target: The Justice Department is seeking to quash a lawsuit that alleges the president has benefited illegally from his family business, including at the Trump International Hotel just blocks from the White House.
In his second NFL season, Golladay emerged as a borderline No. 1 receiver. He led the Lions with 70 catches and 1,063 yards, and he made too many spectacular plays to count. Golladay is so big and physical he can overpower most defensive backs, but he still disappeared for stretches of the season. In the Lions' first three games after the bye, he had just six catches. And he didn't score a touchdown after Thanksgiving, when the Lions' receiving corps was decimated by injury.
I believe in myself, he said. I believe in my ability. I think the experience that I gained this year and the developmental part of that, I think that's going to grow and continue to grow. I just want to continue to become the player that I envision myself being.

A: Amazon and Netflix are battling tooth and nail to become the dominant streaming video service, but the real winner is you. Both of these services are excellent, they both offer a rich archive of mainstream movies and television series, and they are both producing top-notch original programs at a breakneck pace. No matter what your taste, you can probably find a series to binge-watch on either platform. They both have drawbacks, of course: Amazon doesn't play on Apple TV, for example, and Netflix has been slow to offer recent movies. If you're planning to stay in this winter, there's no harm in subscribing to both. Click here to learn about five exciting new Netflix series in 2017.
The Washington state chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights advocacy group, said more than 60 Iranians and Iranian Americans were detained and questioned at the Peace Arch Border Crossing in Blaine on the border with Canada over the weekend.
She has successfully presided over major events in the White House that are traditionally the purview of FLOTUS — the Easter Egg Roll and Christmas — that are always highly anticipated, McBride says. She has also shown that she is comfortable on the world stage, traveling with the president on his foreign trips. Perhaps we will see her do some of this on her own as well.
As college offenses have become more spread out, Saban and Smart and Georgia defensive coordinator Mel Tucker, who worked for Saban at LSU and Alabama, have adjusted. When facing offenses that line up with three or more wide receivers, the defense shifts to four-man fronts and usually five defensive backs. And with so many teams playing offense up-tempo these days, a key is having versatile players who can be cross-trained at multiple positions. The personnel does not have to change if the defense changes.
With rising tensions between the U.S. and Iran this week, some students are fretting that the first step in getting financial aid for college is also the first step in getting drafted.

I think we just put a lot of emphasis on (special teams), Scott said. Last year it wasn't as much. The biggest thing was we want people on there who actually want to be on there and make plays. That was the biggest thing to figure out who wants to be on there and make an impact. It's about want-to, wanting to do your job.
Fox helped orchestrate quick turnarounds while leading Carolina and Denver to a combined six division titles and seven playoff appearances in 13 years before he took over Chicago in January 2015. But his time with the Bears was forgettable.

18. The loss of Saints LG Andrus Peat, who was carted off the field Sunday with what was described as a shin injury, could be huge. He's a major component to a Saints offensive line that struggled to run the ball without him Sunday. New Orleans also relies on Peat's mass (6-7, 316) to give shortish QB Drew Brees plenty of room to see and throw through passing lanes.
That's a larger disparity between black and white than any other state.
But were these methods safe enough?
HRAs have been legal under the health care law only if employers offered insurance that met the law's requirements and provided the HRAs as one alternative that employees could choose. But owners who were exempt under the law because they had fewer than 50 staffers couldn't simply give workers stipends or other non-taxed pay to defray the cost of individual policies.
CHIEFS: Running back Spencer Ware. Charcandrick West became the primary back after Jamaal Charles went down for the season, but Ware had a better average (5.6) and more TDs (six). He'll probably get fewer touches against the Texans, but should make the most of them. Look for Ware to get the ball in short-yardage and goal-line situations.
Before being left off the 2016 list, Crosby has missed five straight All-Star game appearances and only played in one, in 2007. To be fair to Crosby, a lot of it has been out of his hands. Here's a good run down of his injuries from Puck Daddy:

Hilo: The Big Island geothermal power station that was knocked offline by a volcanic eruption hopes to produce lower-cost electricity under a new agreement with a state utility, company officials said. Puna Geothermal Venture and Hawaiian Electric Light Co. are seeking approval of an amended power purchase agreement submitted last week to the state Public Utilities Commission. Hawaiian Electric said Puna Geothermal agreed to sell electricity from its restored and enlarged facility, the state's only geothermal power plant, at a reduced price that would save a typical residential customer $7.50 to $13 a month. Puna Geothermal is working to resume normal operations after the Kilauea volcano eruption that began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes in lower Puna. Lava destroyed the company's substation and covered geothermal wells, while cutting off road access.
The fate of the Senate – and the nation – will be decided by Georgia voters, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., wrote in an opinion piece posted on the Fox News website. If Democratic Senate candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff are elected on January 5th, the Democrats' impending socialist assault on our nation will make President Obama's first two years in office look moderate by comparison.

Donald Trump literally took the bully pulpit away from Chris Christie when he entered the race, said Hale, an associate professor of political science at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. As tough as Governor Christie is, no one can out-bully The Donald. Christie is trying to be the bully with a brain, giving GOP primary voters the indignation and anger towards Democrats and Obama but also ideas that could actually happen.

A bird, the Kangaroo Island glossy black cockatoo, is also close to extinction and will need an immediate assessment when it's safe to do so.

Indiana was without star guard Victor Oladipo in that game, its fifth loss in a row and fourth with Oladipo sidelined by a knee injury. When the Bucks and Pacers meet again, Oladipo will be on the court and on Saturday night proved how much of a difference he makes. Oladipo put up a team-high 23 points to go with nine assists, six rebounds and five steals in just 24 minutes as the Pacers stomped the Chicago Bulls, 125-86, at Bankers Life Fieldhouse.

11. It's time for the Titans to move on from RB DeMarco Murray, whose knee injury has cost him the past two games. This isn't so much a dig at the veteran as much as an endorsement of Henry, whose wrecking-ball style was on full display Saturday.

Patterson, of Macon, ran his first marathon, the local Cherry Blossom Road Race, in 2002. He began entering more races and hasn't stopped. In fewer than two decades, Patterson says, he's completed 83 marathons in all 50 states. He estimates the total distance he's run during road races exceeds 10,000 miles. I do get a lot of accolades for how old I am, Patterson told WMAZ-TV. And I do brag about how fast I can run. He's showing no signs of slowing down. Patterson ran a 3-hour, 52-minute marathon in Seattle last fall. In April, he qualified for the Boston Marathon. He's signed up for 12 marathons this year and hopes to add his first race overseas in China. His first marathon of the new year will be closer to home, at nearby Robins Air Force Base on Jan. 18.

New Jersey Devils still start with 'D'. Jacques Lemaire left, Scott Stevens and Marty Brodeur retired, and Lou Lamoriello jumped to the Toronto Maple Leafs, and yet the Devils' success is still about defense and goaltending. No one expected the Devils to be contending for a playoff spot, and yet they are doing it with a defensive style and stellar goaltending that is giving up 2.28 goals per game. Cory Schneider (.928 save percentage) should be in the Vezina hunt. (KA)
MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Through 17 minutes, the Minnesota Timberwolves watched the Orlando Magic shoot 76.4 percent and open a 19-point lead. Returning home after a trip was looking like another letdown for Minnesota.
This time last year we were blissfully unaware of what was bubbling underneath the surface of the thoughts in Christian churches and in the mindset of many Americans. We hoped it wasn't true, and even though there were signs over the last decade, the last four years has shown that what we had hoped were merely isolated thoughts of bigotry, racism and elitism were actually more pervasive than we thought.

It used to be that you could deduct interest on your mortgage for loans valued at up to $1 million. But as a result of the new tax changes, that limit has been lowered to $750,000. If you're an average earner looking to buy a modest home, you should be able to deduct your mortgage interest in full. But if you're looking at pricier homes, or live in an expensive area of the country where home prices are inflated, you may want to be more cognizant of that cap.
It is not the first time OCE has provided information to the public that the Ethics Committee could not or would not release. In 2010, then-congressman Nathan Deal, R-Ga., resigned while the Ethics Committee was reviewing allegations that he had used his congressional office to pressure state officials in Georgia on a vehicle policy that would help his family's auto-salvage business. His resignation meant that the Ethics Committee lost jurisdiction over him, but OCE decided to issue the report anyway, saying it had a right to release to the report on its own. Under the new rules, it would have lost that right.

Baltimore: A 24-year-old chimpanzee at the Maryland Zoo has given birth to a girl. The zoo welcomed the 2-pound new addition on Dec. 29, officials announced in a statement on Wednesday. The first-time mother, Raven, and the newborn chimp have spent their first week together bonding in a quiet off-exhibit area, according to the statement. The baby chimp will go on display for the public following the short period of bonding. Raven was the second chimpanzee to give birth at the zoo outside of Baltimore in 2019. Bunny, gave birth to Lola in July. There are now 14 chimps in its care, and officials said the births have been important as reproduction of the species at zoos nationwide has slowed in recent years. Officials haven't decided on a name, a spokeswoman for the Maryland Zoo told The Washington Post. Sometimes the animal's care team chooses a name and other times there's a contest that involves the public, she added.

Santa Fe: More than 230,000 residents have signed up since the state launched its vaccination registration website two weeks ago, state health officials said Monday. The New Mexico Department of Health said the site has been updated to allow people to complete a comprehensive profile that includes personal medical conditions, employment information and other data. Officials said the site was created to help manage distribution once more vaccines become available. Those who register will be notified when they become eligible and shots are available in their area. Health Secretary Dr. Tracie Collins has said the state is working on plans for distribution to groups beyond the initial waves of front-line health care workers and staff and residents at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. Our highest priorities remain the same: ensuring that vaccine goes to those who are most exposed to infected people or infectious materials, and preventing vaccine from going to waste, Collins said in a statement issued Monday. The state also plans to launch a call center to provide additional support for those who wish to register or ask questions about the process.
While some states have been more successful overcoming the obstacles to vaccinate their residents with available doses, other states – such as Kansas, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana and Virginia – seem to be falling behind.

The answer to this is, it depends. Most cryptocurrencies aren't as anonymous as you'd think. Sure, you don't have to supply your Social Security number or bank account to begin trading or investing in cryptocurrencies, but any transaction you make is still going to be recorded in the underlying digital ledger.

Sioux Falls: A company has awarded holiday bonuses its 120 employees likely won't forget. Myrl & Roy's Paving gave its workers $10 million in bonuses ranging from $5,000 to $400,000 depending on length of employment and job duties. One of the owners, Sue Unzelman, says they wanted to thank the employees for their hard work and loyalty. It's something we really wanted to do, reward their loyalty, their stick-to-it-ness, she says. I can't tell you how happy I was to see the reactions, the tears in the room. Unzelman and her siblings are selling the second-generation company to L.G. Everist, a rock mining company with pits and quarries in the region. Myrl & Roy's Paving began over five decades ago after Myrl Unzelman and Roy Schultz left their jobs in a road construction business and bought a $500 dump truck, a rake and a shovel.

Christie gains in N.H. and Trump notices
Baton Rouge: The state has unveiled the list of 107 pharmacies that will begin offering the coronavirus vaccine this week to people ages 70 and older. With demand certain to outstrip limited supplies and interest running so high, the state website crashed within minutes of the information's release Monday. The Louisiana Department of Health quickly reworked the website to get the list back online. Hoping to avoid long lines seen in other states with people awaiting vaccination, the agency stressed that appointments for the immunizations are required. Still, people started showing up at their local pharmacies and inundating them with phone calls days ahead of the expanded eligibility, seeking vaccines for themselves or elderly family. Gov. John Bel Edwards' administration called for patience. Patients who arrive without an appointment will not be vaccinated. Do not arrive at a location without an appointment, the health department said as it announced the list. An estimated 640,000 people in Louisiana are newly eligible for the shot this week, but only about 10,000 doses of the Moderna vaccine were initially shipped to the state's pharmacies for this cohort, leaving each pharmacy with no more than about 100 doses available to their customers.

There are only four problems with those requirements: The board has no convincing legal authority to impose them. No one really understands what they mean. They are nearly impossible to prove. And they make no policy sense: why should the U.S. decision whether to grant asylum to someone depend on whether her home society thinks of the particular class as a group, or on whether the home society can tell which other individuals belong to that group?

Big Sky: Gallatin National Forest officials are warning backcountry enthusiasts to take extra care after three snowmobilers escaped injury in a weekend avalanche near Big Sky. Forest forecaster Alex Marienthal said in a Sunday advisory that the snowmobilers were caught Saturday in a 1,500-foot-wide, 4-to-6-foot-deep slide on Buck Ridge. Marienthal says similar avalanches have broken naturally on sugary and weak layers hidden deep inside snowpack in recent days. More can be expected. Backcountry visitors are urged to avoid slopes that are wind-loaded with snow and to avoid steep slopes that may hide persistent weak layers of snow. Two snowmobilers were killed in a Jan. 1 avalanche near Lake Dinah, northwest of Seeley Lake. The West Central Montana Avalanche Center had issued an avalanche warning for the area after more than a foot of heavy, wet snow had fallen overnight.

While you'll glimpse many castles along the Rhine, several are particularly notable. Marksburg Castle, the best-looking of the bunch, stands bold and white, and is restored to look like most Rhine castles once did, with their slate stonework covered with stucco to look as if they were made from a richer stone. Perched above the pleasant town of St. Goar, the mighty ruins of Rheinfels Castle, which ruled the river for more than 500 years, still exude a hint of menace. Near Bingen, Rheinstein Castle has a medieval-as-can-be, 13th-century exterior with a 19th-century duke's hunting palace inside.

New York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that he won't receive the coronavirus vaccine until the general public – including Black, Hispanic and poor New Yorkers in his age group – is able to receive it. Cuomo made the pledge during recorded remarks to the congregation at Abyssinian Baptist Church. Race or income will not determine who lives and who dies, he said. I move around a lot and come into contact with many people, and I would feel much safer if I took the vaccine, but I will not take the vaccine until the vaccine is available for my group in Black, Hispanic and poor communities around the state. Cuomo is considered an essential, public-facing worker and would be eligible to receive the vaccine in the second phase of distribution, along with high-risk, elderly members of the general public. Subsequent phases will prioritize high-risk and low-risk members of the general public. Cuomo noted that the pandemic has exposed racial disparities in the health care system, both in the availability of testing and in the rates of infection and fatalities. Black people have died at double the rate of whites and Hispanics at one and a half times the rate, he said.

Dover: Authorities who launched a two-day sting in response to a rash of shootings in the capital city say they seized guns and drugs. The operation targeted Dover's Capitol Park neighborhood, where there were four shootings in the last two weeks of the year, Delaware State Police spokeswoman Master Cpl. Melissa Jaffe said.

That's good news for both business and leisure fliers in Greater Cincinnati. For years, competing airlines shied away from coming to CVG because of Delta's dominance. But Delta has cut nearly 600 flights at its once-thriving CVG hub in the past decade, mostly due to the airline's 2008 merger with Northwest Airlines.

The revelations about the abuse of workers in the port trucking industry should outrage every American, Sen.

Sioux Falls:Police are investigating after an injured man was dropped off at a hospital in a plastic tub. The 18-year-old Sioux Falls man was dropped off at an emergency room Tuesday afternoon, police spokesman Sam Clemens said. The driver left after dropping the man off at the hospital. The victim suffered life-threatening injuries, including skull injuries. Clemens did not know how the man was injured. Police were able to identify the man who dropped off the victim at the hospital through the victim's family members, along with other people who might be involved, he said. We have a lot more questions than answers, Clemens said. The investigation is ongoing, the Argus Leader reported
Omaha: Officials who are leading the state's pandemic response said Monday that they expect a large increase in coronavirus vaccinations over the next two weeks after a slowdown over the holidays. Nebraska has given 36,360 vaccinations so far out of the 94,697 doses in its possession, according to new data on the state's tracking portal. Most who have received initial doses at this point are front-line health care workers who were given first priority. Nebraska began vaccinating people Dec. 15 but saw sharp drops in daily doses administered Dec. 25 and the two following days. The numbers rose to roughly 3,000 per day afterward but dropped again to 1,579 on Jan. 1, according to the data. Certainly we would like to see more vaccines go out more quickly, but if you look at relative to what's going on in the rest of the country and the holidays and everything, we expect we'll see a pickup in the pace of vaccines, Gov. Pete Ricketts said at a news conference. Ricketts said the slowdown was compounded by health care workers who took time off for the holidays and weren't available to get vaccinated.

Vancouver Canucks should sell, now. They're six points out of a playoff spot with four teams to jump. The prudent move for general manager Jim Benning is to realize this team isn't close to contending and that it needs a wave of new, young talent. Radim Vrbata and Brandon Prust are the only major unrestricted free agents next season, but Benning should sweeten deals with veteran players whose deals don't expire until 2017-18. (JH)

In practice, though, it's all scratching at the surface. The trauma benefit has been used by some teachers, Weingarten said, but not as much as she had hoped, which she attributes to stigma against recognizing mental health problems and a lack of awareness that the resource exists.
Linebacker Vontaze Burfict's no-holds-barred style of play got him another three-game suspension, an in-game ejection, and a series of injuries, limiting him to 10 games. He finished with only 1½ sacks. In 2016, he missed five games because of suspension and injury. He's not going to change his style of play, which means the defense is never sure how much it can count on him week to week.

But this leads, as now-Judge Guido Calabresi pointed out many years ago, to the accumulation of statutes that grow obsolete but which remain on the books because there's not sufficient political energy to get rid of them. Various tools have been suggested, and sometimes implemented, to do something about this, from sunset provisions to judicial doctrines such as desuetude. Generally speaking, however, once they're on the books, we're stuck with them.

Harris didn't get to put Arlovski away like he wanted, but he did get to score a win over a former UFC champion. The win rounded out a perfect 2018 in the cage for Harris, who'd knocked out Daniel Spitz back in June. As a bonus, current 0-3 stretch aside, Arlovski is still a presence in the UFC's official heavyweight rankings – meaning that Harris could be making his own appearance there soon.
A Congress narrowly in Democratic hands would not be promising for a legislative onslaught of long-term and controversial changes. But that's not what's most important right now. A Democratic Senate and House would allow President-elect Joe Biden to tell the public, We have your backs. We will protect you during this chaos. As countries around the world have shown, when that compact is made and kept, the public is much more able and willing to follow basic public health recommendations.

In the latest attacks that the Trump administration blames on Iran or its proxies, oil facilities in Saudi Arabia were hit by a missile-and-drone strike in September, temporarily halving the kingdom's oil production. Iran also shot down a U.S. surveillance drone in the Strait of Hormuz, a key passageway for oil, and laid mines targeting oil tankers. At the time, Trump pulled back from retaliating for the attacks. Oil prices surged more than 4% Friday on concerns Iran may respond to Soleimani's killing by disrupting global supplies.

Georgia coach Kirby Smart spent eight years as defensive coordinator for Alabama coach Nick Saban. Alabama's defenses have ranked in the top-20 nationally in yards per play every season since '08. The Tide has been ranked in the top-10 in six of those seasons. Defense has been the backbone of four national championship teams, and both the third-ranked Bulldogs and fourth-ranked Tide bring top-10 defenses into the College Football Playoff national championship game on Monday.
The menu is huge. All the checks and adjustments are huge, said Temple coach Geoff Collins, who spent a season working for Saban at Alabama before becoming a defensive coordinator at Mississippi State and Florida. But what they'll apply to each game they won't pull from the entire playbook.

Williston: A proposed gas plant could help reduce wasteful flaring in the northern region of the Bakken oil patch. Outrigger Energy of Denver wants to build a plant in Williams County west of Williston capable of processing up to 450 million cubic feet of gas per day. Crude oil prices surpassing $50 per barrel have attracted the company to oil drilling in the Bakken, according to CEO Dave Keanini. The company also plans to build a 70-mile gathering pipeline that starts in eastern Williams County and ends at the processing plant, according to the Bismarck Tribune. It has entered into an agreement with XTO Energy to transport gas from the producer's wells. The Outrigger processing plant is the sixth facility of its kind in the works in North Dakota. Officials hope the investments will significantly curb the amount of excess gas that is flared in the state.

And Graham Glasgow (nine penalties) seemed more comfortable in his first full season at center. The Lions were a better run-blocking unit overall this year, but the line's issues in pass protection were part of the reason Stafford couldn't take many shots downfield.

4. A disappointing offense has been the focal point of the 2017 Falcons. But their emergent defense might be the difference between this season's playoff run and last year's failure, when the D wore out in the face of the Patriots' ball-control Super Bowl blitzkrieg. Since then, Atlanta has added DT Dontari Poe and first-round OLB Takk McKinley to a talented, athletic bunch that mostly lacked depth and experience. And don't forget, DE Adrian Clayborn and No. 1 CB Desmond Trufant were on IR during Super Bowl LI. In their last six games, the Falcons have limited some of the league's best offenses (Rams, Panthers, Saints twice) to an average of 16.3 points and 319.2 yards.

Indianapolis:Family members of Hoosier bank robber John Dillinger have dropped their lawsuit seeking rights to open his grave at Crown Hill Cemetery. The lawsuit, filed in August by Dillinger nephew Michael C. Thompson, was initially dismissed without prejudice by Marion County Superior Court Judge Timothy Oakes on Dec. 4, but Thompson was granted an extension of time to file an amended complaint. That deadline would have been Jan. 15. But on Tuesday, a motion to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit was submitted to the court on Thompson's behalf. It has been granted, effectively putting the issue to rest. Since the lawsuit was dismissed without prejudice, the family could revisit the issue in court. It's unknown what Thompson's plans are moving forward or how this affects the status of the proposed documentary. Attempts to reach the Thompson family and their attorney, Andrea Simmons, were unsuccessful. Crown Hill Cemetery objected to plans to exhume Dillinger's body, citing a duty to ensure the safety and integrity of the grounds and those buried there. In a written statement sent to IndyStar, cemetery management said they were pleased the matter has been resolved. Dillinger, born in Indianapolis in 1903, gained notoriety after a string of bank robberies in 1933 and several high-profile escapes from police custody. His name became legend when FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover labeled him Public Enemy No. 1, but his life of crime came to an end when police and federal agents ambushed him outside Chicago's Biograph Theater on July 22, 1934.

In the biblical apocalypse there are false prophets claiming the voice of God. Similarly, today there are those who claim the same while simultaneously trying to put the lid back on what others have revealed to be the truth — that is, that Christ favored the poor and the marginalized over the mighty.

The church is cooperating with authorities, the mayor said. At least 44 cases have been traced to the church, authorities said. Genesis said in a statement that it is encouraging anyone who attended the services to get tested, whether symptomatic or not, and helping those who need to quarantine to prevent further transmission. Services are now being held online. We are deeply saddened to learn that people within Genesis tested positive for COVID-19 and we are doing all we can to make sure this does not spread any further, the statement said. Under state guidelines, houses of worship are limited to 25% of capacity. The church said it took proper precautions, including preregistration to attend and requring masks and social distancing.

CalTrans spent $8 million to build a replacement bridge, which restored the interstate to normal when it opened on Sept. 24. Astaneh claims the new bridge suffers from many of the same flaws as its predecessor, and is only slightly less susceptible to flash flood. Reconstruction did not change the configuration of the narrow channel and the curved wash, so runoff will still bottleneck at the bridge. Underground piles were added to the foundations of the new bridge, but there is still no retaining wall protecting the earth from erosion. Instead, CalTrans contractors buried the edge of the wash under even more boulders, which could wash away again, Astaneh said.

Bismarck: Officials say high winds caused a power outage that led to a produced water and oil spill in Dunn County. The state Department of Environmental Quality was notified Monday of Sunday's spill at a salt water disposal facility operated by Hunt Oil Co., about 8 miles northwest of Halliday. Officials said the equipment failure caused by the power outage led to multiple tanks overflowing. Initial estimates indicated about 27,720 gallons of produced water and 15,540 gallons of crude oil overflowed the tanks. Most of the spill was contained on site, but winds blew some of the material onto pastureland. Produced water is a byproduct of oil and gas development. It is a mixture of saltwater and oil that can contain drilling chemicals.

Dalton and the offense were best when Hue Jackson was the coordinator in 2015 — Dalton led the AFC in passer rating. Jackson went to Cleveland, and the offense became less creative and less productive under Ken Zampese, who was fired after an 0-2 start this season. Replacement Bill Lazor was confined by Zampese's system, but got more out of it. Still, the Bengals finished last in the NFL in offense for only the second time in club history. They need a coordinator who can redesign and rejuvenate the offense.
He's ready to make the move, said Reid, who cited Bieniemy's people, organizational and tactical skills. But it's got to be a fit for an owner. Somebody has to have … that picture in their mind that Eric Bieniemy can go lead their organization and they're comfortable with that.
Denver: The state is starting off 2020 with plenty of snow in the mountains. Mountain snow moisture statewide is 122% of the usual amount for this time of year, according to the Natural Resources Conservation Service. High-country snow moisture is up 30% compared to this time last year. All areas measured by the federal agency have above-average snow moisture. Early-season snows boosted snowpack in the northern part of the state. Snow has fallen in southern ranges more recently, evenly boosting snowpack levels statewide, the Denver Post reports. Light mountain snow is forecast in northern Colorado in the days ahead. Much of Colorado's mountain snow moisture accumulates in late winter and early spring.
Baddeley once was Australia's brightest young star. He was an 18-year-old amateur who took down Greg Norman and Colin Montgomerie to win the Australian Open in 1999, and he won his national open the following year as a pro. He won three times on the PGA Tour, including at Riviera in 2011. But his swing got out of whack and he couldn't figure out how to fix it until hooking up with Scott Hamilton in the summer of 2015.

And when we do see coverage for women equal that for men, the audiences that follow are breathtaking. Witness the 26.7 million who watched the World Cup final this summer, or the audience for Serena Williams vs. Venus Williams in the U.S. Open, twice what any men's match received. So let's put that tired old argument, blaming women's sports itself for not being more popular, to rest.

14. Either Travis Kelce is the Chiefs' MVP, or the team simply lacks sufficient playmakers beyond the Pro Bowl tight end, RB Kareem Hunt and WR Tyreek Hill. Kansas City was up 14-3 when Kelce (4 catches, 66 yards, TD) left Saturday's game right before halftime and took a 21-3 edge seven plays after he was concussed. But with Hunt largely bottled up by the Titans, and Hill — he has plenty of work to do to become a polished receiver — dropping balls right and left, Kansas City couldn't score in the second half, when it managed just 21 offensive snaps and 61 yards.

Narrowing the wash: First, the Tex Wash Bridge was built over a wide flood plain, shaped like a river delta rather than a stream. Construction crews could have spanned the entire flood plain, which had been done with another bridge in the past, but instead narrowed the wash by filling it with dirt, then built a shorter bridge. This design made construction cheaper, but it also forced storm runoff into a channel, creating a bottleneck that increased pressure on the bridge in the same way that a spray nozzle boosts the power of a garden hose.

Oklahoma City: The state has set a new record for COVID-19 deaths in a week, as health officials on Sunday reported more than 8,000 new cases of the disease caused by the novel coronavirus over two days. Oklahoma had 170 deaths from COVID-19 over the prior seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The previous one-week record of 168 deaths was set in early December. State health officials recorded 5,002 new cases of the virus Saturday and another 3,015 on Sunday, as well as 20 additional deaths. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven't been tested, and some who get sick don't show symptoms. There were more than 36,000 active cases of the virus in Oklahoma and 1,910 people hospitalized with it Sunday, according to the State Department of Health. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Oklahoma has come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Macungie: Mack Trucks plans to lay off 305 employees at its assembly plant north of Philadelphia, the company said Wednesday. Mack blamed the layoffs at its Lower Macungue Township plant on a downturn in the heavy-duty truck market. They will take effect at the end of February, The (Allentown) Morning Call reported. The cuts represent about 13% of the plant's payroll. We regret having to take this action, but we operate in a cyclical market, and after two years of extremely high volumes, we have to adapt to reduced market demand, said Mack spokesman Christopher Heffner. Employees, most of whom belong to the auto workers union, were informed of the news Wednesday. The cuts were expected after Mack said last month that it would need to slow production to cope with reduced demand. Mack expects the North American truck market to be down nearly 30% this year.

Las Vegas: Instruction resumes Monday in Las Vegas-area schools, but most students won't be in classrooms. Nearly all the more than 330 campuses in the sprawling Clark County School District will return to the distance-learning programs adopted last March due to the coronavirus pandemic. The district is among the largest in the U.S., with more than 300,000 students, and a Las Vegas Review-Journal report found that most of the other nine have restored at least some in-person instruction. Clark County school trustees are approaching a decision Jan. 14 about whether to adopt a phased-transition timetable for reopening Las Vegas-area campuses, even with COVID-19 case numbers continuing to surge.

5. Bengals — Penei Sewell, OT, Oregon: Whether chalked up to shoddy protection or merely a stroke of bad luck, Joe Burrow's torn anterior cruciate ligament in Week 11 affirmed that Cincinnati's current setup along the offensive line is untenable for its franchise centerpiece. If Sewell is still available at this point, the 2019 Outland Trophy winner would be a no-brainer for the Bengals, as he would afford Burrow some much needed peace of mind upon the quarterback's return.

But behind these headlines, the dysfunction in U.S. policy reflects trend lines that have been clear since Trump took office. First, the killing of Soleimani is emblematic of Trump's tendency to come up with solutions to problems America didn't necessarily have. He did this by withdrawing from the Paris climate accord; recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel; withdrawing U.S. forces from Syria; and exiting a flawed but still highly functional Iran nuclear accord — arguably the reason we are now in this crisis with Iran.

Tallahassee: The state posted nearly 10,400 new coronavirus infections, and the state's death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic ticked upward by nearly 100, the Florida Health Department reported Sunday. Since the outbreak began, the state has recorded more than 1.3 million of its 21 million residents infected with the disease. In all, 21,987 have died. As of Sunday morning, 6,956 people were hospitalized because of COVID-19. The new numbers come after a record surge in new cases. On New Year's Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. On Saturday, health officials reported a two-day total 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus and 217 new deaths.

I wasn't surprised at all by the game he had tonight, Saban said. He's pretty much done a good job all year long in terms of whatever we've asked him to do.

Providence: Legislative leaders said Wednesday they're working to undo a change to how medical marijuana dispensaries are regulated, to address a lawsuit by the governor. A provision in the state budget approved last year gave lawmakers the right to veto regulations imposed on the industry. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo sued, arguing the new law violates the state constitution's separation of powers clause because it gives lawmakers unchecked control over executive rulemaking authority. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello and Senate President Dominick Ruggerio said Wednesday they're filing legislation to repeal the language that required lawmakers to approve rules and regulations relating to the expansion of licenses for medical marijuana dispensaries. However, they still took issue with how the Department of Business Regulation proposed regulations for dispensaries, with Mattiello calling it blatant overreach by the executive branch. The legislation not only removes the controversial provision, but also imposes limits on regulators. Among them, regulators would be barred from limiting dispensaries based on geographical zones and from preventing any center from growing its own supply of medical marijuana or limiting the number of plants. Lawmakers authorized six new medical marijuana dispensaries last year, for a total of nine.

INDIANAPOLIS (AP) — The Indianapolis Colts played catch-up all season.
Boise: U.S. officials have released a new plan involving methods to deal with a microscopic pest in southeastern Idaho that threatens the state's billion-dollar industry that supplies a third of the nation's potatoes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture late last week released the final rule that takes effect at the end of January. It sets out years­long criteria for killing off the pests and reopening quarantined fields to production. The new rule follows a 2018 court decision in a lawsuit filed by potato farmers that found the U.S. government illegally quarantined some Idaho potato fields infested with the pale cyst nematode first discovered in 2006. Farmers with quarantined fields aren't allowed to sell potatoes grown in them. Nematodes feed on potato roots and can reduce crop production by 80%. When the pests were first discovered, Canada, Mexico and Korea would not accept Idaho potatoes, and Japan banned all U.S. potatoes. The countries ultimately lifted their bans, the latest coming late in 2017 when Japan opened its market again.

2. Jets — Zach Wilson, QB, BYU: For some time, the Jets' choice here will be depicted as a consolation prize for a franchise that squandered its inside track on landing Lawrence. Yet there are several options poised to amount to far more than that in the long run. Bypassing one of the top quarterbacks to stick with Sam Darnold for another year seems like a tough sell, especially given that Wilson and Justin Fields likely would be seen as deserving No. 1 picks in a different year. For now, a slight edge goes to Wilson, a dynamic downfield thrower who frequently makes dazzling completions look easy.

Los Angeles: The pandemic is getting worse in Los Angeles as the coronavirus spreads rapidly within households and Californians let their guard down, according to Mayor Eric Garcetti, who said Sunday that the nation's most populous county is recording a new COVID-19 case every six seconds. Garcetti said on the CBS program Face the Nation that he's concerned news of a vaccine rollout has made everybody so hopeful that they feel they can relax their behavior. We cannot. We cannot let up, the mayor said. This is a virus that preys off of our weakness, preys off of our exhaustion. Overall, Los Angeles County is seeing high compliance of mask-wearing and people abiding by stay-home orders, Garcetti said. Despite that, the state is reporting enormous numbers of new cases, including more than 12,400 in Los Angeles County on Sunday. This is the fastest acceleration of new cases than at any other time during the pandemic, the LA County Department of Public Health said in a weekend statement. The county, which has a fourth of the state's population of nearly 40 million, has seen 40% of its virus deaths.

Jefferson City: Republican Gov. Mike Parson's campaign said it raised about $540,000 in recent months, outpacing the $445,000 brought in by Democratic challenger Nicole Galloway. Those numbers are dwarfed by fundraising by independent political action committees, which rose in power after voters put limits on political donations directly to candidates in 2016. There are no limits on donations to PACs, which can work to bolster a candidate but cannot coordinate with the official campaign. A PAC backing Parson raised close to $1 million in the latest reporting period, which covers October through December. Uniting Missouri PAC Chairman John Hancock said the committee has more than $5 million on hand to spend helping Parson in the gubernatorial race. A pro-Galloway PAC has not yet reported recent fundraising. The general election is Nov. 3.

I feel like we've done a lot of good things, but I'm the first one to tell you this is a pass/fail league, and the results aren't there.
Fitzgerald caught five passes and took the overall NFL lead with 107 catches in perhaps his final game for the Cardinals (7-8-1). He couldn't enjoy the first half of the game after Johnson left the field on a cart, but Fitzgerald and his teammates all loosened up when Johnson returned to the sideline in the second half, putting weight on his leg.

Third: Look at that list and see if there is anything on it that could be done while waiting for that light at the end of the tunnel. Have you wanted to learn to paint with watercolors? Finish home projects that you just never seemed to have time for in the past? Learn to play the guitar? Get into better physical shape? Learn how to meditate and reduce stress? Work on eating a healthier diet (including trying out all those recipes that you collected over the years)? Learn something totally new (like the geology of the southwestern U.S. — my goal of 2020)? Investigate your family's history? Relearn to crochet (like my younger sister)? Or new ways of woodworking?

3. Austin Meadows, OF: Meadows' compact left-handed stroke causes the ball to jump off his bat. He hits for power (12 home runs in 308 at-bats) and covers ground well in center field. With good patience and consistent contact at the plate, the 21-year-old has the tools to be an impact player. He'll open at Class AAA.
Montgomery: State medical groups are sponsoring a video contest to explain why it's important to wear a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Alabama Department of Public Health, the Alabama Hospital Association and the Medical Association of the State of Alabama are sponsoring the Mask Up Alabama video contest. A Health Department news release says the contest is for Alabamians of all ages to share why they feel it is important to wear a mask. The videos should be 30 seconds or less and need to highlight basic information related to mask-wearing and COVID-19. The deadline for submissions is noon Jan. 11. There is no fee to enter the contest, and the full rules can be found on the Health Department website. A statewide panel of judges will pick the top 10, and then the five winners will be chosen through a public online voting process. The first-place winner will receive $600, and the second- and third-place winners will receive $400 and $200 respectively. Two other honorable mention videos will be posted online along with the winners' videos for use by media outlets and on social media.
Harrison adds: We had to roll with the punches as everybody else had, but it was definitely the right choice. And it was the right time. Tayshia Adams took over as Bachelorette after Crawley's quick engagement, and later got engaged herself.

Police pursuits have been something that law enforcement struggled with for a long time — you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't, said Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose. But you take into consideration, an officer that follows the guidelines, and the officers that do the job, it's the behavior of the person that they're pursuing that's creating that type of environment.

And look at his work, reflected by the quarterback. Manning threw a career-high 35 TD passes this season, and had the highest passer rating (93.6) of his career.

Just how much are they getting? Well, what you get out of Social Security largely depends on what you paid into it.

(The self-employed have to pay both the employer and employee portions, forking over the entire 12.4% on their own.)

Green can also become the cure for the Warriors' defensive shortcomings and inconsistent intensity. The Warriors already have lauded Green for giving Wiseman pointers and leading a players' only film session that entailed a detailed breakdown on how to set proper screens. Kerr observed that Green set the tone in a recent scrimmage with his energy, his emotion and his trash talking. It seems inevitable that Green will hold any teammate accountable for lacking effort and will help any teammate that simply needs to learn.

It's not hyperbole to say the midseason acquisition of Damon Harrison changed the trajectory of not just the defensive line but the Lions' defense as a whole. Harrison made 50 tackles in 10 games in Detroit, had 3.5 sacks and helped transform the Lions from one of the NFL's worst run-stopping units (139.3 yards per game allowed before he arrived) to one of its best (92.5 ypg allowed after).
Try not watching this one through your fingers. Andy Samberg and his Lonely Island cohorts produce this cringe-worthy coming-of-age comedy, set in middle school and featuring actual middle-schoolers. The catch? The show's adult creators, Anna Konkle and Maya Erskine, star as seventh-grade versions of themselves, awkwardly cursing out bullies in the schoolyard and swooning over crushes in homeroom. While the joke seems one-note at best (and creepy at worst) the premise works because of Konkle and Erskine's commitment to their painfully relatable characters. And although the jokes are decidedly not family-friendly, their believable friendship as braceface besties gives PEN15 a sweet center. – Ryan

Aidy Bryant finally gets a chance to step outside her Saturday Night Live personas with this series, adapted by writer and fat-acceptance activist Lindy West from her memoir. Shrill tells the story of Annie (Bryant) a young woman and aspiring journalist trying to sort through her messy love life and career in Portland, Oregon. She also happens to be plus size, and isn't consumed with trying to change that. Fat women in pop culture are rarely allowed to be happy with their bodies (unless they're villains), so the mere concept of the show is radical and novel enough. But it avoids being a public service announcement in sitcom form; instead, it's as sweet and chill as Portland itself. – Lawler

Seattle: Mayor Jenny Durkan said Seattle will no longer use fossil fuels like natural gas to heat, cool and cook in new and substantially altered city-owned buildings and will come up with a plan by 2021 to transition all city-owned buildings to clean electric systems over time. Durkan included those directives in a Green New Deal executive order Wednesday. Neither the new KeyArena now under construction at Seattle Center nor the massive Seattle Aquarium expansion pavilion planned for construction starting next year will be covered by the city's new fossil-fuel ban, however, Durkan said. That's because the projects are underway, she said. Both city-owned structures will use a lot of energy. The $930 million new arena and 50,000-square-foot aquarium pavilion will initially be allowed to include some fossil-fuel infrastructure, though both will be included in the city's longer-term electrification plans, Durkan's office said. There's no deadline yet for all city buildings to be fossil-fuel free. Last year, the council passed a Green New Deal resolution that said Seattle would seek to eliminate climate pollutants in the city by 2030.

Spagnuolo interviewed for the job when the Giants were looking to replace Tom Coughlin, and lost out when they went with McAdoo. From a leadership perspective and the ease with which he can handle the media, Spagnuolo may have been a better fit long-term two years ago than McAdoo proved to be. It's hard to see this current hiring cycle ending with Spagnuolo as head coach of the Giants, however. He deserves an interview, and I would not rule out a return to Big Blue in some form. But you can't put all the failings of 2017 on McAdoo and general manager Jerry Reese without including the coaching staff and other key decision-makers in the front office - vice president of player evaluation Marc Ross has already been dismissed - as part of what went wrong.

Jackson: An operation to kill the mountain goats that have invaded Grand Teton National Park and threaten the existence of the park's struggling bighorn sheep herd began Sunday, officials say. A large swath of the high Tetons, including the north and west slopes of the iconic Cathedral Group, will be closed to the public as aerial gunners contracted by the park spend up to a week locating and shooting at the approximately 100 goats, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. We're trying to be efficient and effective – so doing this as fast as possible in the most efficient way – and we believe that the aerial operations does that, park spokeswoman Denise Germann said. She had no prediction about how many animals would be targeted but said it's possible that at least one more week of aerial shooting will occur, depending on how this operation goes.

We've already sanctioned Iran up to the eyeballs, she said. We can kill some of their proxies here or there. But the next level is to attack Iran itself, and if we do that, then it's off to the races.

Norfolk: More than 1,400 long-term care facilities in the state are expected to receive doses of the coronavirus vaccine in the coming weeks. The Virginian-Pilot reports CVS and Walgreens will administer the vast majority of the doses. The pharmacy chains are partnering with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take vaccines directly to the facilities so residents don't have to travel. Virginia is putting front-line health care workers and long-term care residents in the top-tier priority group for immunizations. The state has received 388,000 vaccine doses collectively from Pfizer and Moderna. State health officials said nearly 65,000 vaccinations had been administered before New Year's Day. But that number is believed to be low because of lags in reporting. No one has received the complete two-shot series because injections must be spaced three or four weeks apart, depending on the brand. Long-term care facilities are also rushing to get consent forms signed by residents or the individuals who make decisions for them.

While how the game plays out is always difficult to predict — half of the six title games have been decided by less than a touchdown and the other three by at least 17 points — the matchup will undoubtedly create a bump in the playoff's television ratings by drawing in viewers tired of seeing the same teams from the same geographic area meet for the championship.

O'Fallon: A 32-year-old assistant prosecutor in the Kansas City area has died from the coronavirus. Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney Jean Peters Baker said on Twitter that JoEllen Engelbart died Saturday. Engelbart is among 5,562 Missourians who have died from COVID-19. The state passed the 400,000 mark in confirmed cases over the weekend and added another 1,196 cases Monday, bringing the total to 402,957. The state reported no new deaths Monday. Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services spokeswoman Lisa Cox said Monday's numbers may have been affected by limited reporting from counties due to the New Year's holiday. While many hospitals across Missouri remain dangerously crowded with COVID-19 patients, the numbers have stabilized enough in recent weeks that St. Louis County on Monday allowed indoor dining to start again, albeit with restrictions.

That provision has drawn criticism from some, including Republican County Councilman Tim Fitch.

We must indeed do things better, as Edison said, and we must find a way to do them together. If you're trying to get somewhere, it's best to keep your eyes on the road ahead, not the rearview mirror. Accordingly, as we begin a new and perhaps perilous decade, I think we should acknowledge some problems that have become all too apparent and need addressing.
Trump himself has said very little about the U.S. action, only tweeting Friday that Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation! and that Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!
At the same time, some 90% of players acquired don't pan out. Imagine being one of the few that do, scrapping your way to the major leagues and into the game's marquee event, only to have the results potentially tilted by a different form of cheating.
— In dire need of a frontline forward. The Predators rank 18th in goals per game and aren't getting enough production from their forwards. They lack enough game-breakers to back down defenses. Entering Jan. 6, only two forwards (Mike Ribeiro and Craig Smith) ranked in the top 100 in points per 60 minutes at even strength among forwards with at least 400 minutes. They have two forwards in double digits in goals, James Neal (15) and Filip Forsberg (10). In a down year, Johansen is tied for second on the Predators with 26 points. His puck luck (six goals on 88 shots) should improve as he's a career 11% goal scorer. Johansen would've led the Predators in goals and points the past two years.

He wasn't as effective as a runner either, averaging a career-low 4 yards per carry while playing behind an injury-riddled offensive line.

It is hard to imagine what interest the court or the attorney general has in preventing this case from being decided on the merits.

The U.S. cannot singlehandedly eradicate all violence against women and girls — even here at home. But we can at least avoid being an accomplice. When women and girls arrive at our shores asking only that they not be beaten, raped or murdered, delivering them to their tormentors is not an option. Congress should restore the original meaning of particular social group, and it should recognize that gender, like race and religion, belongs in the list of specifically protected grounds.

Punter Sam Martin was solid in the second half of the season as the Lions did a good job controlling field position. He netted just 39.2 yards per punt, but he landed 32 of his 74 punts inside the 20-yard line. Matt Prater made better than 85 percent of his field goals for the fourth straight season. Prater wasn't as good from distance this year (8 of 12 on 40-plus-yarders) as he was in seasons past, and he missed a potential game-winner against the Buffalo Bills, but he's still more reliable than most kickers around the league.

Atlanta aggravated assault victims were 87 percent black, and 94 percent of the people arrested for assault were black.

When the housing recovery began in 2012 following the late 2000s crash, the trend was decidedly in the other direction. The share of new homes with less than 2,400 square feet was tumbling after reaching 60% in 2009. Many of the first-time buyers who drove sales during the housing bubble left the market after their risky subprime mortgages imploded and they lost their homes to foreclosure.
Cincinnati: The future of the city's only abortion clinic is in question after the state health director said the facility doesn't have enough backup doctors lined up. Because the clinic doesn't have an agreement with a nearby, private hospital to transfer patients in case of an emergency – an agreement required by state law –Planned Parenthood Southwest Ohio Region has operated the clinic under an exception known as a variance. Ohio Health Director Amy Acton recently rescinded that variance. To receive a variance, a clinic must provide a list of doctors willing to treat patients in case of emergencies. The clinic in Cincinnati informed the state in December it no longer had four backup doctors listed and requested 30 days to find a replacement physician. Acton then rescinded the clinic's variance and notified the clinic its license was in jeopardy of being revoked. The clinic, which remains open, is expected to request a hearing on the issue. It indicated it was seeking another physician. Kersha Deibel, president and chief executive officer of the Planned Parenthood region, told The Columbus Dispatch that we follow the law and are actively working to identify a new provider.

This requires I place a mat under each pair of shoes, which isn't particularly convenient or easy on the eyes.

We knew President Obama was going to announce a series of gun-related executive measures. But we didn't know how emotional it would be. How did we get here? he asked Tuesday. How did we get to the place where people think expanded background checks is an excuse to take away people's guns? Addressing an audience of families of gun-violence victims, gun owners and gun-control advocates, Obama recited a litany of mass shootings during his presidency before he paused and choked up at the mention of 20 first-graders shot and killed in 2012 at Sandy Hook Elementary. First-graders, he said, as tears ran down his cheeks. Every time I hear about those kids, it makes me mad. In the other corner: GOP candidates quickly denounced the plan. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Fox News, This president is obsessed with undermining the Constitution in general, but the Second Amendment in particular.

Las Vegas:Lincoln County authorities have announced that a reward is being offered for information surrounding the starvation and death of a herd of cattle. The Lincoln County sheriff's office announced the $10,000 reward Monday after the herd of six were locked into a corral in rural south Nevada, officials said. Authorities believe at least one person intentionally isolated the herd in a coral where all but one cow starved to death. The herd was in the Tule Spring area about 30 miles north of Mesquite when weather made travel to the area difficult, Sheriff Kerry Lee said. The rancher who owns the cattle last saw them alive the first week of December before the weather cleared and he returned to his cattle, authorities said. The area is a popular location for hunters, authorities said. Anyone with information or trail camera footage of vehicles in the area is asked to contact the Lincoln County sheriff's office.
19. Washington — Christian Darrisaw, OT, Virginia Tech: Should Ron Rivera look to stay the course with Alex Smith at quarterback, the most reasonable route for Washington to buoy its offense might be bringing on a stalwart tackle.
The Tex Wash Bridge was built in 1967, as the I-10 slowly grew across the country, crossing the dry, dusty desert between the Coachella Valley and the Arizona-California state line. Dozens of short bridges were built in that stretch, but the Tex Wash was wide and delta-like, so it demanded a longer, stronger bridge. Instead, construction crews narrowed the wash, then built a short bridge with a shallow foundation. They also re-shaped the wash into a curve, which directed the full force of floods against the eastern base of the bridge.

6. Atlanta QB Matt Ryan is INT-free in his past four playoff games, his last pick coming in the 2012 NFC Championship Game loss to the 49ers. However Ryan's last game with more than two TD passes was last year's NFC Championship Game, an 18-game drought. Though Atlanta's defense seems to have turned a corner, this team no longer looks capable of keeping pace in a shootout.
California voters approved a ban on bilingual education in public schools in 1998. Known as Proposition 227, the policy barred many children of Latino immigrants and Latino immigrant children from bilingual education, says Ramon Martinez, an assistant professor at Stanford University's Graduate School of Education in California.

If you believe in what we're doing right now, we all will do more and we're going to have better success next year, the coach added. Once we get to a point where it's a critical time, we're going to get over the hump next time. The culture of (not) having losing seasons is just a year away. Guys believe that.

I think back to 1955 when Disneyland opened. It was chaotic, and a lot of things didn't go right, D'Amaro says. But Walt did what he needed to do and reinvented the business. I can't help but think where we are now and the chaos of the moment. We are going to come out of the pandemic stronger – holding on to our legacy but pushing ourselves into new territories.
Greta Thunberg had two wishes for her 18th birthday on Sunday.

When he visits schools, we don't dress like this, he said, pointing to his suit. We keep it 100, jogging suits. We want to show them we're not different than you. The first question we ask is: What do we look like? And we get everything from rappers to party promoters. But then they see the book and the white coats, and it's 'O-h-h-h-h.' We're tired of that narrative. We're tired of the stereotypes. If we don't believe it, how in the hell we going to get everybody else to believe it?

She added that in each state, Democratic senators, through their five-minute speeches, will display the key Republican officials in the state that certified results or pushed back on Trump's claims of fraud.
That omission is not surprising. U.S. asylum laws, like those of most other western countries, track the language of an international refugee convention that was adopted in 1951. Gender-related violence was simply not on the public radar at that time.
Just being around these guys, this atmosphere, I knew I wanted to be around these talks just so that it kind of changes my mentality of where I came from, Alualu said.

Belichick can get away with it because he has won five Super Bowls coaching the Patriots, and is a favorite for another this season with a Hall of Fame quarterback in Tom Brady. So it comes across as authoritative when Belichick famously says, We're on to Cincinnati, like he did a few years ago.
Dragic said he is sure that the Suns are going to figure it out despite a recent 5-20 stretch. After two 2 ½-year stints in Phoenix, Dragic said the 2010 Western Conference finals run remains his favorite memory over being All-NBA third team two seasons ago.

It's disappointing, but we really finished the season on a high note, said Fitzgerald, who moved ahead of Pittsburgh's Antonio Brown and New England's Julian Edelman with his last catch.
17. Still, let's give Bortles and Jags coach Doug Marrone due credit. Gutsy call by Marrone going for the TD on fourth-and-goal at the end of the third quarter with the game tied 3-3. But Bortles hit TE Ben Koyack in the back of the end zone with his best throw of the day on the game's decisive play.

For 2018, the F-150 gets more power, more torque, more gears and more mpg to better compete with a crop of new trucks on its way — trucks that have undoubtedly benchmarked the impressive F-150. Despite not accelerating as fast as the 6.2-liter-powered Chevrolet or GMC trucks in our previous testing, the F-150 still takes the crown for drivability.

Hancock and the CFP can spin it all they want — and they're trying, reminding everyone there were blowouts in most of the games. Not that that's ever stopped America from watching football before. The Rose Bowl was not exactly what you'd call close when USC and Illinois played in 2008, and plenty of people still watched that.
The Ricoh Theta S, released in late 2015, won the CES 2016 Innovation award, and the new 360fly company showed a new model at the show, a compact spherical camera in the shape of a little ball, that expands the category by shooting 360 video in 4K resolution.
In the economy category, we gave median household income full weighting. The unemployment rate was also given a full weight.

Disappointing season for us overall, on the whole. All of us kind of had high expectations going into this year, Quinn said. My position as the general manager here, I'm accountable, I'm responsible. I put this team together, and I feel like we have a good team. We didn't win as much as we should have this year.
Stanford: The Cardinal is one of just four teams in Division I that has started all freshmen and sophomores this season. Through the first 12 games, they accounted for 82 percent of Stanford's scoring and 79 percent of its rebounding.

The attacks were Iran's response to the U.S.-ordered airstrike that killed its top military leader, Qasem Soleimani, late last week. The Defense Department said the strike was a preventive action to stop imminent plans to attack U.S. personnel in the region.
But why change now? And besides, the first part of practice is open to the media and it's easy enough to see who's practicing and who isn't.

The takeaway: Market pros are 100 percent right when they say timing the market requires two correct decisions: when to get out and when to get back in.
The prosecution would then have to show proof that Trump went beyond that and that it created a reasonable belief in Raffensperger's mind that he was being extorted or forced to break the law, he said.
We're hopeful that our statement today can be a small part of helping to heal some of the pain and anger amongst our peers, and that it will help bring us closer as a community. We don't pretend to have the answers, but we want to be part of the solution.

All the earthquakes struck at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles), according to the USGS. Earthquakes at magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage. The temblors also all were very shallow, which causes more ground shaking and potential damage, particularly in places without strict building codes.
The busy season culminated a year that held nine of the top 15 busiest days during the 16 years since Congress federalized screening under the TSA. The figures are slightly lower than airline statistics, which also projected a record for the holiday season, because screening isn't always required for connecting flights.
I think people get caught up in the flashy stuff, but his footwork is incredible, West said. I think that's the one thing that kind of gets lost in it. If you're a basketball person you understand that footwork is sort of the foundation. I don't think we've seen the type of footwork he has. He gets his feet set on every single shot, he's never out of range.

It would be a shame for people to go on the way they have in the past. People come from different backgrounds and they can provide the right thing for a company instead of 10 people from the same perspective trying to solve a problem. I'd like to push (tech) more in the community I am from. It's the new thing for the hustlers in the hood.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, also a 2020 contender, used the word assassination to refer to Soleimani's killing in a statement. But another 2020 Democrat, former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, called that characterization outrageous.

And Trump's former hawkish national security adviser John Bolton tweeted his congratulations to all involved in eliminating Iran's top general. Bolton said that he hoped this is the first step to regime change in Tehran.
So here are all the goals I'm willing to put on paper for the new year: I will try to be easier on myself for not being perfect, for putting off cleaning the kitchen or wearing sweatpants during the work day. I will keep my distance as long as I have to, wear a mask and stay home. I'll talk to my friends and family. I'll play with my dog.

Best Washington Capitals team ever? It's too soon to know. The 2009-10 Capitals won the President's Trophy, and the 1997-98 team reached the Stanley Cup final. But this team appears to be set up better for a long playoff run than the 2009-10 Capitals. Under coach Barry Trotz, they play a Chicago Blackhawks-like balanced style that wins in the postseason. It helps that goalie Braden Holtby is playing like Carey Price did last season. (Kevin Allen)

Astaneh gave The Desert Sun exclusive access to his preliminary findings.
First of all they have a lot of good players and they have a really good coaching staff. That combination is tough, Texans coach Bill O'Brien said.
Of course, there was no tackling at practice, but the intensity level was much higher.
That indecision has been a lifeline for several presidential hopefuls in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, despite a shrinking debate stage that has limited some candidates' exposure.
The final weekend of the NFL regular season brings plenty of playoff implications. The New York Jets can clinch with a win over the Buffalo Bills — and former coach Rex Ryan. A Jets loss opens the door to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who must beat Cleveland. The Houston Texans clinch the AFC South division with a win or tie over Jacksonville, or a loss or tie by Indianapolis, or ... it gets complicated. Other teams need wins to lock in first-round byes or home playoff games.

It would have been impossible for anyone to know that Alabama's trajectory from there to here, a 38-0 victory against Michigan State in the College Football Playoff semifinals, would have happened not in spite of its quarterback play but largely because of it.
Sen.-elect Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, has also indicated he may object to some votes.
Campaign finance reform and transparency are part of the solution, she said. Another part is good mentors who invest in the pipeline for elected officials.

Spagnuolo met with Mara, general manager Dave Gettleman and assistant general manager Kevin Abrams Wednesday. Abrams' presence speaks to his increased role moving forward. Tisch will meet with the candidates later in the process.
While his execution Friday will go down in Ohio State and playoff history, Fields' performance won't complicate one of the most predictable events of the NFL offseason: Lawrence going first overall to the Jacksonville Jaguars in this spring's draft.
We're big boys. We can take it like men and move on, Del Rio said. We'll be ready to roll. We have a good group of men. We'll shift into playoff mode.
The 2018 election was transformative for me, not just because of Stacey Abrams' campaign, but because I saw the impact of modern-day voter suppression up close. I went to vote in Mechanicsville, but they only had five voting machines, and one of them broke. We waited three hours to cast our ballots. I knew this was wrong. I wanted to make sure no one in my community — at a time when so many of us finally felt engaged in the system – would be discouraged to come out and vote. I got together with a few other former NFL players, including Warrick Dunn, Adalius Thomas and Alge Crumpler. We served pizzas and water to people waiting to vote. We were doing anything we could to convince them to stay in line. I just remember thinking, I can't let these people go home without voting.

Iranian authorities offered similar figures for the earthquakes on state television. All the information could change as scientists examine the data.
Lawrence has been pegged for the top of the draft since late in his freshman season and cemented in that place since Burrow was taken by the Cincinnati Bengals last April, to the point where Jacksonville's duel with the New York Jets for the worst record in the NFL provided one of the most interesting subplots to the 2020 season.

Iran now presents Donald Trump with the first real-time crisis of his presidency, illustrated in stark terms Tuesday when Iran launched ballistic missiles at two Iraqi bases hosting U.S. and Iraqi troops. And not surprisingly, he is handling it in a way that embodies all the worst elements of his management of national security issues. Unfortunately, Trump also seems to have abandoned one of the more positive aspects of his approach to foreign policy: a reluctance to get into new and unwinnable conflicts in the Middle East.

I think it's a solemn responsibility to accept these electoral college votes that have been certified by governors, secretaries of states all across the country, said Capito. I just think this is an ill-fated journey.

Provo: The state's number of drug overdose suicides has potentially been underreported by 33%, according to a new study. Published in the journal Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior, the study came to the conclusion after looking at 2,665 overdose deaths from 2012 to 2015 in Utah, the Provo Daily Herald reports. Paul Nestadt, one of the paper's authors, says the nation's opioid epidemic has clouded suicide classification across the nation. If you work in mental health, it is pretty clear there is a lot of overlap in the symptoms of someone who is using opiates and someone who may be suicidal, Nestadt said. State health officials say roughly 630 Utahns die from suicide and about 4,570 attempt suicide every year. Utah's suicide rate is above the national average, causing the deaths of 22.7 per 100,000 people in 2017, compared to a national rate of 14 people per 100,000. According to the study, that rate could be significantly higher.

My three levels of shelves house at least 50 sweatshirts (it's cold in Canada, okay?!), and my hanger racks keep at least 20 button-downs and trousers crease-free. I also use the racks to hang items I'd normally pile in a heap somewhere, like purses, scarves, bras, and belts.

Bismarck: The state's efforts to make its legislative session safer during the coronavirus pandemic should also make it easier for citizens to observe the proceedings and participate in government, leaders and longtime observers say. Legislative leaders have spent more than $2.6 million in federal COVID-19 relief money to beef up livestreaming and remote technology to allow people to watch committee meetings and floor sessions in real time. The public will be able to give remote testimony and not have to worry about driving to Bismarck in the middle of winter. They will be able to follow certain issues that they're interested in from the committee room to the chamber, and if it passes and goes to the next chamber, they'll know everything that's said, everything that's done, said Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner, who spearheaded the upgrades. House and Senate floor sessions have been livestreamed, archived and indexed online since 2013, The Bismarck Tribune reports.

Financial penalties are imposed not only for felony and misdemeanor offenses, but also for minor traffic and municipal code violations. In 43 states, defendants are charged for public defender-related fees, causing many to waive this critical constitutional right. And in most states, fines and fees are even assessed against youth for minor infractions such as skipping school — leaving parents, guardians and, in some cases, the youth themselves with added financial burdens and the threat of incarceration.
Lieu and Rice said their joint request to the FBI centered on provisions of two federal election fraud statutes and one Georgia law, which they say Trump may have breached during his call Saturday with Raffensperger and the secretary of state's general counsel.

After handing play-calling duties to associate head coach Tom Clements at the start of the season, McCarthy took the responsibilities back in Week 14 against Dallas. There was a promising win against the Cowboys, but results since then were mixed — until the convincing victory over Washington.
I mean I watch Ronald Acuña, and he's probably one of the guys that I would watch the most. He's such a fabulous athlete to watch. And I don't know how many of those — if any of those — I got to see when I first came up. For me, if you stand next to these guys or you get to go to a ballpark and sit in a first section and really watch an Acuña fly around the bases or watch a (Mike) Trout at-bat, and then see them run on the field and see how big these men are and how young and healthy they are, it's really such a treat. I'm proud and honored to be on the field competing with these guys because there are just so many fantastic athletes right now, so I think the sport is in a great place.

Proving election law violations are very difficult. If President Trump believes there are actually additional legitimate votes which need to be counted, then he is certainly within his rights to urge state officials to find them and count them, Kelly said. It's a waste of time, and it's inappropriate to use the criminal justice system to settle political scores.

There's less flexibility and ability to pivot when you enshrine something into the constitution.

The bottom line is we cannot facilitate change and remedy years of divestment without an infusion of stimulus resources.

I didn't like Patricia's timeout usage at the end of the first half in losses to the Seahawks and Bears, and the fact that coordinators Marciano and Jim Bob Cooter were let go speaks both to the job they did and to Patricia's ability to put together a staff. Patricia gets some leeway as a first-time head coach, but he better learn quickly from his mistakes because he'll be on the hot seat in 2019.

The external signs of crisis mismanagement are already apparent. The president's threats against Iran have inflamed an Iranian public already at fever pitch against the United States. His promise — twice — to attack Iran's cultural sites should it respond violently against the United States was not only a provocation, it was also a potential war crime.

The only other major verification process in place is known as proof of stake. Instead of having people use tons of resources trying to solve complex equations to verify transactions, the proof of stake model chooses who gets to verify the next block of transactions based on their ownership in a virtual currency. In essence, the more you own, the better chance you have of getting to verify transactions. With proof of stake, there is no competition among your peers and no excessive energy usage while solving complex equations, which can make it much more cost-effective.

We have treated 17 patients to date, he said in an email. Twelve have been discharged, four are still hospitalized and one died of complications unrelated to COVID or Seraph treatment. In general, it only takes one treatment, which lasts four to six hours, to begin seeing results, Rifkin said, with patients beginning to see improvement in the first 48 hours after treatment. The filter works in a manner similar to dialysis, which removes blood from a patient, filters it and reintroduces the cleansed blood to the patient's bloodstream. A dialysis filter has pores to remove waste and water from the body in a patient with kidney failure, Rifkin said. The Seraph filter, in contrast, has coated beads that bind various particles.

It also undercuts any reasonable justification for marital norms. After all, if marriage is about romantic connection, why require monogamy? There's nothing magical about the number two, as defenders of polyamory point out. If marriage isn't a conjugal union uniting a man and a woman as one flesh, why should it involve or imply sexual exclusivity? If it isn't a comprehensive union inherently ordered to childbearing and rearing, why should it be pledged to permanence?

Good question. Seeing someone you beat cash that $1 million prize has got to make you think twice about some of your career moves. Then again, let's not forget that when a lot of us heard about this plan back before the tournament started, we weren't overwhelmed with confidence that this moment would ever actually come.
I think the teams that win consistently, play and prepare consistently every week, he said. They improve and they have a good toughness about the way that they approach their way to win. I think the teams that don't, beat themselves with bad football, penalties, turnovers, mistakes and just fundamentals that aren't up to par. So, I think we had a season that was a mix of both. I think we had some good weeks and we had some bad weeks, and the truth is, that's what our season was.
While Bevell was able to develop Russell Wilson into a top quarterback and create an offense good enough to win a Super Bowl, he was never able to escape the shadow of the play call made at the conclusion of the Super Bowl against New England. Rather than a run from the 1-yard line in the final minute, Bevell called for a pass that was intercepted by Malcolm Butler and cost Seattle its chance at a second straight title.

Anchorage: Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, according to federal climate officials.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in its U.S. Climate report said Alaska had a statewide average temperature of 32.2 degrees, 6.2 degrees above the long-term average. It also surpassed the previous record statewide average temperature of 31.9 set in 2016, the agency said. Four of the last six years in Alaska have been record warm years, NOAA said. Ten cities experienced their warmest years ever, including Anchorage, Fairbanks, Utqiagvik, Kotzebue, King Salmon, Bethel, Northway, McGrath, Kodiak and Cold Bay. Alaska set the record despite a December that featured temperatures closer to average, NOAA said. NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information compiled the annual summary. Among the other highlights was rainfall in other states. The contiguous 48 states experienced the second-wettest year on record with 34.78 inches, just 0.18 inches less than the total for the wettest year set in 1973.

Raleigh: State education officials recently estimated educators can't account for about 10,000 to 15,000 public school students this school year amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Lawmakers and educators worry more students are falling through cracks in the system than is presently known, as the coronavirus pandemic upends students' learning plans and keeps some out of virtual or physical classrooms. David Stegall, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction's deputy superintendent of innovation, told lawmakers last month that a survey the state conducted of some districts concluded that the whereabouts of about 0.7% to 1% of the state's 1.5 million K-12 public school students are unknown. This happens when a school has lost contact with a student, often because the student dropped out without alerting the school or moved elsewhere without the parent notifying the school or responding to repeated requests to get their kid back in class. If a student misses at least 10 consecutive days of school in North Carolina, they are typically unenrolled, and the school works to account for them.

Madison: The Legislature kicked off its two-year session Monday with an inauguration unlike any before it, with Assembly Democrats skipping the event because they thought the COVID-19 precautions were inadequate.

Chicago: The state will stop collecting fines against drivers who are ticketed after cameras catch them violating red lights, Comptroller Susana Mendoza said Monday. She said poor and minority motorists appear to be most affected by the $100 tickets, which can double if not timely paid. She also noted a federal investigation of relationships between some communities and a red light vendor. The new policy starts Feb. 6. This system is clearly broken, Mendoza said. I am exercising the moral authority to prevent state resources being used to assist a shady process that victimizes taxpayers. A 2012 state law allows local governments to use the comptroller's office to collect debts. Unpaid traffic tickets, for example, can be deducted from tax refunds. Mendoza said communities can hire private debt collectors instead.

Detroit: A statue of the robot featured in the 1987, Detroit-set film RoboCop is nearing completion ahead of its debut at a science museum. Organizers of the Kickstarter campaign website who crowdfunded Robocop for the city posted some photos last week with an update of the statue with a note that its final form is coming later this winter at the Michigan Science Center, The Detroit News reports. Organizers wrote in the update that the statue is 11 feet tall with his head on and that his stainless steel base weighs half a ton. He is big, he is clean, he is bronze, he is perfect, they wrote. It has been almost a decade since the idea came about. A Twitter user, who tagged then-Mayor Dave Bing in a tweet, noted that Philadelphia has a statue of another movie icon, Rocky Balboa, and that RoboCop would be a GREAT ambassador for Detroit. The campaign that launched in 2012 raised $67,436 from more than 2,700 backers worldwide. Since then, Giorgio Gikas, one of Detroit's premier sculptor conservators, has been creating the work.

Columbia: The superintendent of the state's public schools said Monday that she had tested positive for the coronavirus and was experiencing mild symptoms but would continue to do her work from home. Cases of the virus have rocketed to record highs in South Carolina recently, and the news of Superintendent Molly Spearman's positive test came the same day the state's 780,000 public school students returned to classes following the holiday break. In a tweet, Spearman said she learned Sunday that she had tested positive for the virus Dec. 31 and is fortunate to have only mild symptoms. Spearman said she had already been quarantining after her husband and son tested positive earlier last week. While isolating, Spearman said, I plan to continue to work from home and meet virtually as so many others in the education community have done this school year. Just before Christmas, Gov.

He was plagued by the drops that hurt him as a rookie and only topped the 100-yard mark twice all season while finishing with career lows with 48 catches for 680 yards.

Nunes really wants to defend that 145 title for her legacy, but once that happens, the UFC could finally decide to pull the plug.

Even with Whiteside's numbers looking good — averages of 17.3 points and 14.3 rebounds per game — he's far from a lock for the All-Star team, in part because there's no true center designation in the roster-choosing process.

Boston: A group of families in the state is fighting a recent court ruling that found au pairs should be treated as employees entitled to minimum wage. An organization called Au Pair Families of Massachusetts is planning to lobby for legislation in the Statehouse on Wednesday, the Boston Globe reports. A federal court ruled Dec. 2 that au pairs in Massachusetts were entitled to earn state minimum wage and overtime, which could raise host families' costs by as much as $333 per week. Many host parents agree au pairs should have additional protections but argue the new changes will make the program less accessible in a state that has some of the nation's highest child care costs. The au pair program, overseen by the U.S. State Department, was launched as a cultural exchange program in which young people live with families in other countries while helping with child care and some housework. Host families paid at least $197 a week for a maximum of 45 hours of work before the ruling.

As talented as Alabama is, this was probably the sixth-best team out of Saban's nine years.

You can even make an argument Alabama was better in 2013 when it was on the verge of going 12-0 and likely playing for a national title until Auburn's Kick Six miracle.

We've had some this year called where I was like I don't know if that's targeting; some that weren't called. I think it's a good rule, the game needs it – maybe it just needs time, only been in place for a few years. Needs time to develop. - Clemson tight end Garrett Williams

4. Falcons — Justin Fields, QB, Ohio State: As Atlanta looks to hire a new coach and general manager, the true measuring stick for the extent of the team's rebuild will be the steps it takes toward replacing Matt Ryan and Julio Jones.

2. Look, it's completely fair to believe Spagnuolo was just as responsible in the struggles that the Giants had en route to their pitiful 3-13 campaign as McAdoo, or anybody else. This is his defense, and with Spagnuolo as DC, it's been feast or famine. A lot of that has to do with personnel, and injuries, and maybe he's lost his way at times trying to make up for being short-handed. But there is no escaping the results, and the Giants believed they were set up to be an outstanding defense this season. They were not, and although the offensive ineptitude certainly contributed to leaving the defense on the field, resulting in the belief that defensive players had to overcompensate, Spagnuolo's unit was not exactly inspiring.

Montpelier: The number of fatalities on Vermont roadways went down by about 30% in 2019, according to state figures. Vermont State Police and the Vermont Agency of Transportation released figures that show the tentative number of deaths on the state's roads in 2019 was 47, down from 69 in 2018, the Times Argus reported. But state officials are not sure what to attribute the decrease in road fatalities. Lt. Tara Thomas, commander of safety programs for the Vermont State Police, said the reduction was unexplainable. Thomas said that 47 deaths are still too many for state police. We wish we knew what the formula was to keep the numbers down. 47 is still too many for the state police. That's 47 families that don't have a loved one with them, so in our eyes, it's still high. We're averaging just way too many each month, she said. The 47 deaths resulted from 44 crashes last year. The figure is tentative because if someone dies as a result of injuries from a 2019 crash within the first 30 days of 2020, that person's death would be added to the list of fatalities from 2019. Vermont also had no fatal crashes reported in the state on any of the holidays last year.

As noted, digital currencies are what investors are buying. In nearly all instances, buying a cryptocurrency won't give an investor any ownership in the underlying blockchain technology. This happens to be one of the biggest differences between cryptocurrencies and traditional investments, like stocks. If you buy stock in a publicly traded company, you own a fractional percentage of that business. That's not the case with nearly all cryptocurrencies.

The freshness debate aside, there's also the very important matter of what it tastes like when it arrives. Olmsted says it might be made just as fresh but it is practically guaranteed to take longer to reach you, meaning it is far more likely to be cold. And in most cases your entire meal is served at once versus one course at a time, exacerbating this problem.
For schools that are remote, getting a substitute set up for online learning poses its own set of logistical challenges – getting a Zoom, transferring it over, making sure the substitute is comfortable navigating online learning software.

PRYOR COMMITMENT: Terrelle Pryor's transition from quarterback to 1,000-yard wide receiver was one of the league's best stories this season. An unrestricted free agent, Pryor wants to return and the Browns would like to have him back — at the right price. Pryor has told agents Drew and Jason Rosenhaus to get a deal done with Cleveland.
It was a year of disappointment for travelers as the COVID-19 pandemic swept the world.

Five kids who are braver and stronger and wiser than their old man is, and a loving group of people who have put (up) with me being away months and months and months at a time.

The NFL, many owners included, made a big show of championing diversity and racial equality after the horrific death of George Floyd. They promised to do better, and be more aware of the privilege that has allowed white coaches to advance while Black and brown coaches with more experience – and, frankly in some cases, more talent – remain stymied.

Peers like Doug Baldwin, Kelvin Beachum, Demario Davis, Chris Long, Devin McCourty, Josh McCown, Rodney McLeod, Josh Norman, Torrey Smith and Benjamin Watson agreed and began looking for ways to make an impact. They believed NFL owners could actually help further their reach.

In short, no. Like previous objections, there is virtually no chance that any objections lodged will succeed.
Unlike that meeting, this one wasn't held in front of the TV cameras. Like that one, there were no signs of progress made when it was over. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer accused the president and the GOP of using the shutdown as a hostage for border money.
But there was no rubber stamp here. This wasn't like tweaking instant replay.
The Fisk board of trustees selected Sims to serve as interim president in September because of his extensive experience as a business executive. At the height of his professional career at Cargill Inc., Sims said, he managed an $8 billion branch of the company with 5,000 employees.
The main focus and priority for me is Formula 1 and winning the third world championship, he said. But to race in some iconic events and not disturb Formula 1 is also in the plan. Doing this race is the first step in the endurance championship, learning how these races are and how much I (might) enjoy them. After the 24 Hours in Daytona, I will have a better understanding.
The Browns did show some improvement in the final weeks, and never stopped fighting, a credit to Jackson and his staff. But that didn't come close to washing away the ugliness of 14 straight losses, the 31st-ranked scoring offense, 30th-ranked scoring defense, giving up a team record 66 sacks and 35 touchdown passes.
There are access issues to mental health services, Bintliff said.
A few hours after McCoy met with the media, the Chargers fired much of their offensive staff, including coordinator Frank Reich.

28. Lions (29): You'd think an engineer like Matt Patricia would navigate his learning curve a little more gracefully. Hard to see where Detroit is headed.
Jonathon Knight of Port St. John, Fla., said he would start out practical but then make his dream come true.
The engineering is in the background, so the front end is really easy to use, with just a swipe or a poke of the finger, says Peter Krapp, professor of film & media studies at the University of California, Irvine. That's the success of the iPhone and why it's has been so colonizing over the last decade.
Truth is, of course, Cousins has changed quite a bit over the course of this season. He went from a turnover-prone, second-guessing player to a guy who is considered one of the Redskins' strengths as the NFC East champions (9-7) head into their wild-card game against the visiting Green Bay Packers (10-6) on Sunday.
And he's not exactly inheriting an easy job in Miami.
Los Angeles Kings primed for deep run. Very little not to like with this roster. Possession game is elite again, Drew Doughty is in the Norris Trophy discussion and Jonathan Quick's even-strength/adjusted save percentages are a career-best. Scary to think they're only 15th in scoring. (JH)

None of that is true, not a whit, Sterling said of an accusation that pieces of voting machines were removed and replaced. This is all obviously, easily, provably false. Yet the president persists and, by doing so, undermines Georgians' faith in the election system, especially Republican Georgians in this case, which is important because we have a big election coming up tomorrow, and everybody deserves to have their vote counted if they want it to be.

She fell 0.09 off the lead due to the incident, but accelerated in the bottom section to take the win, 0.19 seconds ahead of Wendy Holdener of Switzerland. Frida Hansdotter of Sweden came 0.31 behind in third.
The rinse-and-repeat cycle of change began last week when owner Terry Pegula fired Rex Ryan a week short of completing his second full season. Ryan became the fall guy after his big bluster and vows to build a bully fell well short of expectations, particularly on defense, which was supposed to be his specialty.
Cornerback Prince Amukamara said there were plenty of hugs for Fox when he met with the team Monday.
When I'm looking at Arizona, I'm looking at the metro areas … and how much untapped surge potential is there, she said. They have not tapped into anywhere near the potential of the Latino population.

The Packers are coming off their most impressive offensive outburst in a while after beating the Washington Redskins 35-18 in an NFC wild-card game on Sunday.

But don't tell Mayfield any of it. Winning is the only option on his radar, and he believes he thrives in high-pressure situations.
At this rate, there will be a point where Miami starts thinking more about the future than the present. Plenty of trade talk in the next few weeks will involve the Heat, who have a ton of salary-cap space to use this summer and will undoubtedly hear from contending teams looking to add a player or two for the looming playoff runs.
She began her career in politics as an intern and then a case worker for Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., when he was a congressman.

After my co-author Kimberly Foxx, state's attorney for Cook County, Illinois, made a motion to overturn dozens of convictions tainted by coerced police interrogations, the local police union lambasted her as someone harboring anti-police sentiment.
An 'unforced error' by the president
The Apocalypse has been thrown around Christian circles for millennia, and while there were a few Christian voices that have been loud over the course of 2020 speaking out for justice, fighting for the poor and marginalized, and standing alongside those who have been disproportionately impacted by racism and a justice system that criminalizes their own existence, many Christians failed to speak out, or even speak up, at all during this new apocalypse. The discourse seemed to be coming from a few vocal Christians who chose to not fight for the marginalized, but to uplift an administration that contradicts what Jesus taught us about how to treat others.
A class-action lawsuit filed Thursday, however, described the actions by HealthPlus as wholly inadequate, given the seriousness of the diseases, ... the nature of the danger, and the standard of medical care for persons potentially exposed to such diseases.

Mack, of course, deserves his share of the credit, too. His quick cuts, change of direction and ability to fit through small spaces at 6-foot and 210 pounds makes him dangerous in almost any situation. Some of the big runs we have, he's only hitting it in a space this big, center Kelly said, holding his hands shoulder width apart. He slides through and goes right up there. He's just trusting, man.

And then … Sunday hits and you're faced with the notion of another workweek. Sunday morning may start out fine, but as the day wears on your thoughts turn to Monday, and all of the things waiting for you at work — the tasks, the meetings, the stress.

I don't think anybody understands what that (run of championships) is, outgoing defensive coordinator and new Georgia coach Kirby Smart said as cigar smoke filled Alabama's locker room. Four national championships in seven years in a world where there is parity, where you have to change quarterbacks every other year, kids come and go, kids transfer. It's just a different world of college football. It speaks volumes to his coaching ability. Nobody realizes how much mental effort and execution and ideas this guy puts into it. He lives, sleeps, breathes football.

At the other end, Bledsoe kept his hot streak going, jabbing behind the three-point line before hoisting a trey that connected to coax a timeout from the Wizards bench. Bledsoe then got foul while making a strong rebound but only made one of two free throws. Beal again responded, this time with a layup, before Antetokounmpo knocked down a 21-footer with 36.2 seconds left to put the Bucks up five.

If all else fails — life is short, and none of us get an unlimited supply of weekends to stress out through. If you just can't seem to shake the weekend effect, consider making a job or career change. We're not endorsing anything impulsive, but it couldn't hurt to start making plans for a future shift — sometimes the simple act of setting a new goal, no matter how far off the finish line is, can bring about a wave of positive feelings to help combat the weekend effect.

Because down markets get me down, I opted for a 50-50 portfolio for me and my wife. Fifty-fifty, as in 50 percent stocks and 50 percent cash and bonds. A money manager I recently met with flat out told me that I didn't have enough in stocks. He could be right. But I don't care.

Spanos, whose Carson project enlisted a push from Disney CEO Bob Iger, may not have wound up with his desired option to win the market over Kroenke. But after pursuing a new stadium in San Diego for 14 years, he's obtained significantly more juice for a potential last-gasp effort. It's conceivable that the Chargers take the matter to voters on the November ballot, but public sentiment would have to change significantly given that polls indicated a 2-to-1 margin against taxpayer support for a Chargers stadium.

Except that Diaz had already left, on Dec. 13, to become the head coach at Temple, where he promptly signed a class of 17 players - many of whom, of course, had been wooed by Geoff Collins before he exited, on Dec. 7, for Georgia Tech ( which signed 18, but at least those kids had almost two whole weeks to decipher whether the new coach was a good fit.)
But by and large, the edge the Lions thought they'd gain from hiring Patricia as coach wasn't there. The season got off to a slow start in part because players didn't care for Patricia's ways, and they had too many no-show on gameday throughout the year. The Lions got blown out at home in their opener against the Jets, took three quarters off the next week against San Francisco and had their sloppiest day of the year in a November trip to Chicago.

Dean Spanos sided with then-general manager A.J. Smith, who had a power struggle with Schottenheimer.

I guess you could say he's a conservative coach in a sense, but he knows the athletes he has on the field, running back Kenyan Drake said. He won't ever call a play we've never practiced before, and we gameplanned all week that if (Clemson lined up a certain way), we can easily pooch it over his head. He has the confidence in us to make the plays, and we have to execute it and everything happened as we planned it. In my opinion it was the most important play of the game.

After trading him to Miami, the Suns brass fired shots back at Dragic, painting him as selfish and noting that they believed Eric Bledsoe, Brandon Knight and Markieff Morris were better than Dragic.

(Trump) doesn't come right out and say, 'You're going to be in big trouble.' … When he says it's going to be costly, I think everybody knows what that means, he said. It's specific enough and vague enough that you know what he's talking about. Who would it be costly to? I mean, come on. … It was a veiled threat saying, 'You better take care of this and find me these ... votes or you'll be in trouble.'

Nagy succeeded Pederson as co-offensive coordinator in 2016 when Pederson became the Eagles head cocach.

That's shameful and unworthy, but that's the political world in which we now find ourselves.
Helena: Urban deer culling for the fall and winter seasons was suspended by city officials amid budget cuts. The Montana Fish and Wildlife Commission recommended the city of Helena be allowed to continue culling despite budget cuts, The Helena Independent Record reported Tuesday. Former Police Chief Troy McGee made the decision to cut the program when the department was ordered to make more than $470,000 in cuts, city officials said. The program costs the city about $30,000 a year, officials said. The commission sets a quota range of up to 250 designated to maintain the population at desire levels and the city determines the exact number to cull each year within that range, officials said. This will be the first fall and winter the city has not culled deer since 2008, officials said. The city has plans to survey the deer population to determine if it will resume culling operations, Police Chief Steve Hagen said. The city has usually culled about 100 deer a year and populations have remained steady, officials said.

Nashua: Three employees were sickened by a cleaning chemical at an Amazon warehouse, fire officials said Thursday. Firefighters in Nashua responded at about 4 a.m. for a report of a chemical reaction that happened while a crew was mixing chemicals, Deputy Fire Chief Karl Gerhard told WMUR-TV. The major symptoms we saw were respiratory-related, scratchiness, coughing-related issues, Gerhard said. There was possibly an unknown chemical in the bucket already that they were putting the chemicals in, and that caused the reaction. The building was evacuated and the employees were taken to a hospital. Two were treated and released. A fire department report said after the building had been ventilated, crews monitored the building using air and chemical metering devices and found no abnormal readings. OSHA and the state fire marshal's office were notified.

Concord: Turkey sightings are on the rise in the state, possibly because of the coronavirus pandemic. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department said results from its 2020 winter survey reflect 2,309 flocks totaling 40,476 turkeys statewide. That was more than four times as many turkeys counted in 2019 and twice as many as reported in 2018. With many people spending more time at home last winter, there was an increase in backyard bird feeding as well as bird watching, which may have contributed to the uptick in reports, said Allison Keating, a state turkey biologist. More than 46,000 people have tested positive for the virus in New Hampshire, including more than 1,300 confirmed cases announced Sunday that include numbers for several days. Eleven additional deaths were announced, bringing the total to 780. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in New Hampshire decreased over the past two weeks, going from 766 new cases per day Dec. 19 to 750 new cases per day Saturday.

As a compromise, the commission was formed and consisted of 15 members: five Supreme Court justices and five members from each chamber of Congress. The key was that it was supposed to be composed of seven Democrats, seven Republicans and one independent. However, in a move that seemed calculated to secure his vote for Tilden, the Illinois legislature then moved to appoint the independent, Justice David Davis, to the Senate. If they wanted to buy his vote, it was a colossal failure when Davis decided to take the seat and leave the commission. He was replaced by a Republican, and the commission voted along strictly partisan lines to install Hayes, not Tilden.

Albuquerque: The head of New Mexico's largest Catholic diocese has issued directives aimed at protecting parishioners during flu season. Santa Fe Archbishop John Wester cited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying New Mexico is one of the states experiencing widespread flu outbreaks. He's urging people not to shake hands or hug when they attend Mass. Parishioners also are being asked not to hold hands while reciting the Our Father and those who are ill should stay home to avoid spreading the virus. Priests and other church officials also are being asked to wash their hands before and after distributing communion. Wester said the directives will be revoked when the situation improves. He said the archdiocese was instituting the directives not to limit expression of faith, but rather as a preventive measure against a widespread and potentially deadly disease.
Designed specifically with arthritic or carpal tunnel-plagued owners in mind, the Lead Mate is an ergonomic attachment that ingeniously eliminates hazards that clutching at, tying knots in, or wrapping a leash around your wrist for greater control, can impose. When simply clipped on the desired portion of the leash, the lightweight, no-slip sphere—made of 100 percent recycled ABS plastic—provides superb grip and a thoroughly comfortable hand-hold, allowing walkers to effortlessly deal with pullers, and clearly transmit commands. The Lead Mate can also be used to couple two leashes together for a double dog walk, fasten a leash around your waist for a hands-free jaunt or jog, or used as a tether, for securing a leash to a table at an outdoor cafe.

After a week of soul searching, discussions with our black, brown, and white peers, and consultations with our families, we, the undersigned nominees in this category have come to the conclusion that it's in the best interest of our genre for us to decline our nominations. We respectfully ask that our names be removed from final round ballots. We are deeply grateful to the Recording Academy and its voting members for the honor we've received, but we can't in good conscience benefit from a process that has – both this year and historically – so overlooked women, performers of color, and most especially black performers. Unfortunately, this year's slate of all white nominees, only one of whom is female, is not an aberration for children's music. In the past 10 years, only about 6% of nominated acts have been black led or co-led, another 8% or so have been non-black POC-led, and around 30% have been female-led. These numbers would be disappointing in any category, but – in a genre whose performers are uniquely tasked with modeling fairness, kindness, and inclusion; in a country where more than half of all children are non-white; and after a year of national reckoning around race and gender – the numbers are unacceptable. We take full responsibility for putting ourselves in the position we're in. We chose to submit and distribute our albums to voters, even as we were aware of this category's past history of exclusion.

Santa Fe: Native Americans go without medical insurance at a much higher rate than the state's other residents, according to a state-commissioned study from the Urban Institute that explores gaps in medical insurance coverage by race and ethnicity as well as age, location and education level. New Mexico fares relatively well overall in terms of paid access to health care services in comparison with the U.S. as a whole. The study found that 187,000 non-elderly residents go without health insurance – about 10.5% of the state population. The national average is just over 11%. Among Native Americans, 37,000 people go with insurance – or 16.2% of the population. Health insurance coverage also is relatively scarce in the northwest area of the state that is home to the Navajo Nation. The Urban Institute found that Native Americans working in the health care and educational fields are especially prone to go without health insurance.

The Lexilight is a portable desk light designed just for kids (and adults) who have Dyslexia. The majority of people with Dyslexia have two dominant eyes—instead of one—which causes both eyes to send simultaneous information to their brain, thereby creating mirror images of letters. The Lexilight emits pulsed and modulated light to suppress the mirror effect, which it claims makes reading far less difficult for kids who struggle. If it works as well as the founders claim, this could be some serious life-changing tech for those with Dyslexia.

The Green Bay Packers won three road games as a sixth-seed in 2010 before they beat Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl. They wouldn't have advanced if it weren't for a surprise performance in the wild-card round, when rookie James Starks had 123 yards rushing in a 21-16 win at Philadelphia after only running for 101 yards in the regular season.
Two courts agreed, but now it's before the Supreme Court because it's complicated. The 14th Amendment's privileges or immunities clause — not to be confused with the different privileges and immunities clause in Article IV of the Constitution — limits how states can discriminate against new residents. In addition, the interstate Commerce Clause, through the dormant Commerce Clause, forbids discrimination against out-of-staters.
But Gibbons has pledged to try to oust McConnell as the Senate's GOP leader, a move that Trump's allies have pushed. So it's no wonder McConnell is looking for an alternative.

Six months ago, an unremarkable bridge on a desolate stretch of desert highway collapsed, severing one of the most important roads in the nation. A flash flood toppled the eastbound portion of the Tex Wash Bridge, which carried Interstate 10 across a dry riverbed near Desert Center. A motorist was nearly killed. The main route between California and Arizona was closed for five days, diverting travelers and truckers, costing millions in detours and repairs.
Schumer said Sunday it would take only four Republican senators to join Democrats in the push for witnesses, and possibly new documents.
At the same time, the measure allows Chargers chairman Dean Spanos a huge dose of leverage – and $100 million towards construction of a new stadium – if he decides to keep his franchise in San Diego with a taxpayer-supported project. Spanos will have a year to determine if he wants to partner with Kroenke. If he opts not to pursue L.A. – which I'd suspect is doubtful – Raiders owner Mark Davis would have a year to accept a similar offer.
He was the brother I never had because I was an only child, Galloway said. He was a great friend, a stand-up guy you didn't want to let down. He was a guy who did things the right way. I had committed to Notre Dame when he convinced me to visit Alabama, and it was the best decision I ever made.

QB BATTLE? Expect a healthy debate — at least among fans — about the starting quarterback job this offseason. While Bryant has excelled this year, many supporters are looking to incoming freshman Trevor Lawrence to supplant the senior next fall. Lawrence was rated the No. 1 overall prospect coming out of Cartersville High in Georgia. Swinney is loyal to upperclassmen, but may have regretted not starting then-freshman Deshaun Watson from game one in 2014 instead of senior Cole Stout in early losses at Georgia and Florida State. Watson took over after that.

On one of four touchdown passes, Rodgers had nearly 9 seconds to throw by spinning to his left away from defensive end Kerry Hyder, setting his feet and dipping his right shoulder to move to the left again on a throw to Geronimo Allison. Rodgers ran by design at least once and at other times because he took advantage of opportunities to move the ball with his feet against the Lions.

But what Biden can accomplish depends a great deal on what happens in Georgia's two Senate races. Were he in the minority, McConnell's obstructionist politics would take a back seat to urgent action on potential solutions to our national challenges. With a single vote margin, the Senate would be anything but a rubber stamp for Biden. Any single senator could derail any piece of legislation, and the many Senate rules provide a safeguard, for better and for worse, against a highly activist agenda.

Hanover has numerous advantages over other places in New Hampshire cities. Its median household income of $96,406 is more than $26,000 higher than the next closest city and well ahead of the statewide median, which is $68,485. Hanover is also the best educated place in the state, as 83.1 percent of adults hold at least a bachelor's degree. No other city in New Hampshire comes close to that share. For comparison, the state's bachelor's degree attainment rate is 35.5 percent.

No other members serve on the boards of public companies, Holman said, but about 190 House members hold other positions involving public or private firms.

The initiative stops far short of completely closing what's been called the gun show loophole. Instead, the Justice Department will clarify an existing law that gun sellers who market firearms through gun shows and online can be engaged in the business of dealing in guns and require a federal license. That's important because under the law, gun sales by hobbyists and collectors do not require background checks, but licensed gun dealers do.

Newport, Rhode Island is by far the best educated city in the state. More than half – 50.9 percent – of adult residents completed at least their bachelor's degree. No other major Rhode Island community exceeded the state's college graduation rate of 32.5 percent. This high educational attainment qualifies many of the city's residents for highly skilled jobs and likely helps drive down the unemployment rate. Newport's unemployment rate is just 3.8 percent, the lowest of anywhere in the country.

Spokane: The city is planning to write off hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid utility bills dating back two decades as it looks to upgrade its payment software. The proposal would forgive more than $450,000 in payments and late fees accrued by 174 ratepayers during the years 1999 to 2013. The Spokesman-Review reports a city official says those payments would be legally difficult to recoup. Nonpayment of utilities, including charges for trash collection, sewer and water services, can result in late fees, liens placed on a property and termination of service. But the debt that is being considered for forgiveness may have been incurred by businesses no longer located in the area or residents who died or moved away. Spokane City Councilwoman Candace Mumm says she wants to make sure city officials have done everything to secure payment before writing the debts off.

We all know hearts can change: Guns N' Roses are reuniting, and it'll be in the warm April sun. They'll play the Coachella festival, set for April 15-17 and April 22-24 in Indio, Calif. Rumors of a reunion have swirled since December, and their appearance at Coachella will be their first together in two decades. Also worth noting: Electro-pop band LCD Soundsystem will reunite for the festival — but their farewell show was in 2011, a New York minute compared with how long GNR fans have waited to see Axl Rose, Slash and the rest of the band together again. So to recap: We lived, we let die, we waited 20 years, were rewarded for our patience and made you this playlist of our favorite GNR songs. Take me down to Indio (city).

Johnson played in that All-Star Game. He had 25 points, nine assists, five rebounds, two steals and earned MVP. He played for the U.S. Dream Team at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, but when he considered rejoining the NBA in 1992, opposing players still voiced concern. Johnson chose not to play because of the controversy. But by 1995, players, owners, trainers and executives were more educated. Johnson played 32 games and retired for good.

In the original bet, the two sides put about $320,000 into bonds that were expected to appreciate to $1 million dollars over the decade.

Any notion that America would express regret for neglecting to secure the sites of Iraqi (and global) heritage disappeared with Rumsfeld's infamous comment about the widespread looting. Stuff happens! he said at a news conference on April 11, 2003.

I could see the faded remnants of those Norman Rockwell days. Outside of the sketchy areas, this town 37 miles from Louisville was still that picture of rural America, with stubble-filled cornfields and a one-stoplight Main Street lined by churches, shops and sidewalks.

New Orleans: A new high school is preparing students for careers in coastal protection and restoration, anticipating a future with ongoing climate change and sea level rise. New Harmony High School opened in fall 2018 and currently serves about 100 south Louisiana students. Besides their traditional classes in math, literature and history, New Harmony students take science classes that tackle environmental issues. The school currently has grades nine and 10, with plans to expand to 11th and 12th grades. The state charter school's mission is intricately tied to the state's future. A multitude of issues from the leveeing of the Mississippi River to oil and gas development have made Louisiana ground zero for coastal land loss. The state estimates it has lost just over 2,000 square miles of land – a tract about the size of Delaware – since 1932.

Oklahoma City: The Oklahoma Corporation Commission said it has approved a plan for an additional area code for 19 central Oklahoma counties in the 405 area, including Oklahoma County and Oklahoma City. The commission said the North American Numbering Plan Administrator will announce the new area code later this month and it will be available in July. Starting in January 2021, callers will have to dial 10 digits that include the area code plus the seven-digit number. Commission spokesman Matt Skinner said existing phone numbers will not be affected or changed, but callers will have to dial all 10 digits to make a phone call. The area code overlay is similar to one adopted in 2011, when the 539 code was added in the 918 area code region that includes Tulsa. The commission said the additional area code is needed because the administrator has determined that the 405 area code will run out of available numbers in December 2021.

West Palm Beach: Doctors told a woman she had a better chance of winning the lottery than of giving birth to two sets of twins in the same year. But Alexzandria Wolliston said she won the jackpot with the births of Mark and Malakhi in March and Kaylen and Kaleb in December. Oh, yes, I feel like I hit the twin lottery, Wolliston told WPTV. She said her 3-year-old daughter helped her prepare for the double dose of twins. Two months after the first set of twins arrived, Wolliston said she learned about the second set. They were born in West Palm Beach on Dec. 27. Wolliston said Kaleb was dismissed from the hospital on Monday and she's hoping to bring Kaylen home soon. She said she recently learned that both of her grandmothers lost twin boys at birth, which makes her believe her four babies are a blessing from above. I always say that I feel like my grandmothers gave me their kids because two sets of twins and their twins passed away, she said. I feel like they just sent them down for me.

Frankfort: After months of watching mostly from the sidelines as Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear doled out pandemic relief and issued orders to combat the spread of the coronavirus, Republican lawmakers are ready to put their own imprint on policymaking in Kentucky. Republicans begin this year's legislative session in an increasingly dominant position after expanding their House and Senate supermajorities in the 2020 election. Wielding the power to override any Beshear veto, Republicans will be able shape legislation to their liking, including bills dealing with COVID-19 or policies for the post-pandemic world as vaccines roll out to more people. They've signaled their intent to rein in some of the governor's emergency powers. The General Assembly convenes its 30-day session Tuesday. Passing another state budget tops the agenda – a heavy lift after lawmakers opted to pass a one-year budget, rather than the traditional two-year spending plan, in 2020 because of uncertainties caused by the pandemic.

Black students and other students of color have long faced a host of challenges where education is concerned — disproportionately under-resourced schools, school closures, criminalization in schools, a lack of teachers who look like them and curricula too often not culturally relevant to them. These biased policies and practices undeniably continue to limit education outcomes for Black and brown students and those from tribal communities. While most students have access to free public education, they remain shackled in achieving their learning potential. As such, it is impossible to address the systemic learning gaps without addressing the racially disparate learning constraints within the education system or, said another way, without liberating their learning.

But someone born in 1958, for instance, would have a full retirement age of 66 years, eight months. But if that person retired at 62, they would only get 71.7% of their full benefit. It may not sound like much difference, but if you live to age 80, that's about $7,100 less on a $1,000-per-month benefit, not even including cost-of-living adjustments.

We went out there and moved the ball up and down the field. We put points on the board.

3. The NFL's concussion protocol continues to be a fiasco. Even after the league and NFLPA mandated last month that players struggling to stay upright be taken to the locker room for evaluation, the Panthers seemingly failed to adhere to the new guideline when Cam Newton appeared dazed in the fourth quarter. Carolina contended the quarterback, who missed one play, was being treated for an eye injury even though Fox cameras seemed to show Newton struggling to stay on his feet on the sideline even after trainers attended to him on the field. The league withheld comment amid discussions with the team's medical staff.

The NBA restarted the season last summer partly to salvage its television revenue during the pandemic and partly to use that platform to address systemic racism. Then, players and coaches routinely spoke out against recent cases of police officers killing unarmed Black people, including George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.

Wells: A historic hotel damaged in a 2008 earthquake is getting restored. The El Rancho Hotel and Casino in Wells is expected to see a new life after the small Elko County town received grants to fix it up. The city has secured funding from the federal Community Development Block Grant program and the Nevada Commission for Cultural Centers and Historic Preservation to help restore the property. Restoration is estimated to cost about $500,000 to the city as well. City manager Jolene Supp says the payoff will be worth it. The city plans to reopen the building as a community center, restaurant and small-business incubator. Originally a hotel-casino and later a community center and banquet hall, the El Rancho served the town of 1,200 since it was built in 1949. A 6.0 magnitude earthquake hit Wells in February 2008, damaging hundreds of structures in town, including the hotel.

With blockchain, this verification of transactions is always ongoing, which means the opportunity to settle transactions much more quickly, or perhaps even instantly.

Minneapolis:Two prominent leaders have proposed an amendment to the Minnesota Constitution aimed at closing the state's dismal academic achievement gap. The proposal comes from Alan Page, a former Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. They want to change the state's constitution to guarantee all children the fundamental right to a quality public education, the Star Tribune reported Wednesday. Page and Kashkari told the newspaper in an interview that making quality education a civil right for all children is the catalyst that's needed to break the logjam that has blocked effective reform. Even though Minnesota has spent billions of dollars to solve the problem, the state still has some of the worst educational disparities in the nation, as measured by race and socioeconomic status, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Courts have interpreted the Minnesota Constitution as giving students a fundamental right to an adequate education. Page and Kashkari want to raise that standard to a quality education. Page and Kashkari said similar amendments have driven improvements in other states. To amend the Minnesota Constitution, they will need the Legislature's approval to put the question to voters. The two hope to get it on the ballot this fall. But they'll face opposition from the state's powerful teachers' union, Education Minnesota, which said it will resist the proposal.

While most retirees would do well to start collecting benefits at their full retirement age or even at age 62, some might be best served by delaying collecting up to age 70, in order to get bigger checks. Starting to collect early is often smart, though, as you'll get many more checks, despite their being smaller. If you expect to live a longer-than-average life, however, and you can afford to delay starting to collect, that can be the wise choice.

Whiting: Some Illinois residents fed up with their state's second ban on indoor dining amid the pandemic are heading to restaurants in adjacent Indiana so they can dine out with others. Restaurants in Illinois towns like Calumet City and Lansing that border northwest Indiana say they are seeing customers lured away by Indiana eateries not subject to the same restrictions, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. Sylvia Coco, who owns Kilroy's and Dixie Kitchen and Bait Shop in Lansing, said her business is off substantially, perhaps more than than 50%, and one constant has been the looser rules for restaurants and bars in the Hoosier State. Indiana is pretty much open and doing whatever they want, Coco said. Tom Dabertin, a board member of the Whiting-Robertsdale Chamber of Commerce, said he's noticed the influx of Illinois diners. We're seeing increased business in both restaurants and stores, even at local drive-thrus, he said. We're seeing a lot more traffic and revenue due to the bans in Illinois. People come here to eat a meal and then shop.

The 2015 OCE report on a May 2013 trip to Azerbaijan by 10 members of Congress and 29 staffers concluded that the travel was not in fact paid for by the non-profit groups that had invited everyone, but by a foreign oil company, which is a violation of House rules. But the report also included an admission from the non-profit groups that they regularly relied on a Turkish organization to provide free travel for Capitol Hill VIPs on trips to Turkey. That allowed me to track down 200 other trips these groups had sponsored over the past decade that had probably all violated House rules.

I use a simple rule-of-thumb calculation to both tally my losses and keep them in perspective. For example, since I have only half of my money invested in stocks, when the broad Standard & Poor's 500 stock index falls, say, 20 percent, my total portfolio only decreases in value by half that amount. For example, a 50-50 portfolio valued at $100,000 would only decline to $90,000 with my asset mix in a 20 percent market decline, versus a drop to $80,000 if I had 100 percent riding on stocks.

The agreement, announced Friday, gives the telecommunications company access to the right-of-way along the rail line, where the company plans to install a series of small cell nodes. Gov. Ned Lamont says that will provide better cellular coverage and higher data speeds for train passengers. The Democratic governor also announced that 132 recently purchased rail cars will be designed in partnership with industry experts and equipped with rooftop antennas that amplify 4G and 5G signals in the train.
That tempo control was on full display in the Cavaliers' eye-opening 61-49 win against North Carolina on Saturday, a statement victory that puts the rest of the country on notice that this program is a force once again. Virginia limited a talent-loaded UNC roster to just 49 points and 59 possessions (15 possessions fewer than average) and forced 19 turnovers. But the difference was in the halfcourt as Virginia's patient offense led to big baskets when it mattered, deflating any Tar Heels' momentum.

And the game came down to the final play. Notre Dame won on its final possession when backup quarterback Ian Book — who replaced first-year starter Brandon Wimbush in the second quarter — found Miles Boykin for a 55-yard touchdown bomb. Boykin, who hadn't gotten much playing time during the regular season but led his team with 102 receiving yards on Monday, made a one-handed grab to clinch the win.

Louisville:A billboard calling on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to vote to remove President Donald Trump from office is making its rounds in Louisville this week. Trump broke the law, according to the billboard, which includes McConnell's face. Senator McConnell, don't help him cover it up. Vote to convict & remove. The mobile billboard appears on a white van sponsored by four progressive organizations: Need to Impeach, Daily Kos, MoveOn and Public Citizen. Organizers said it will be parked along West Broadway through Saturday. It will make stops in front of McConnell's office and also go to Bishop Lane in front of Jefferson County Republican Headquarters. The four organizations are spending more than $400,000 on the billboard and ad campaign, according to a press release. McConnell has said he wants a quick trial that would have the Senate first hear arguments from the prosecution and defense before deciding if witnesses should be called – conditions Democrats oppose.

The answer to the first question is probably not. The Supreme Court has held that the general rule against discriminating against out-of-staters is not overridden by the 21st Amendment, though some scholars have criticized that. Even so, we're supposed to have a seamless national market — making interstate commerce easier was the original reason for the Constitution. And though at the end of Prohibition, states were allowed to stay dry if they wanted to, or to restrict liquor sales to state-monopoly stores, the purpose of that local-option provision wasn't to allow them to discriminate against people from elsewhere. (Though that probably not reflects the case law as it is — the Supreme Court may have decided to hear the case so as to change existing rules, under the Commerce Clause or the privileges or immunities clause.)

The main differences between the Pro on sale here and our favorite model? A higher wattage (450 for the Pro versus 325) and a bowl-lift design instead of the typical tilt-and-lock base.

Once all the votes have been read, the tellers add them up and announce the result. In 2013, the entire process took 23 minutes.

Hilo: Hawaii's optional coronavirus notification app is expected to launch statewide Wednesday. The AlohaSafe Alert app aims to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 by notifying users about potential exposure to someone who tests positive for the virus, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. When the app senses another app in use nearby, the devices will exchange a secure, random, anonymous code. A person's location, name and other identifiable information would not be included. A user who tests positive would get a text message with the option to notify other app users who may have been exposed. The notification would go out to all users who were within 6 feet of the person who tested positive for at least 15 minutes. The app has already launched on the Big Island, Lanai and Maui. For me, the big takeaway is this is one other way that we can start protecting our island against the coronavirus and keep all of us safe, Hawaii County Mayor Mitch Roth said. He acknowledged that not everyone will use the app but called it an extra tool that will speed up contact tracing.

McElroy says Alabama could have had similarly potent offenses in the past, but Saban wasn't ready to completely change his philosophy. Even a year ago against Clemson in the College Football Playoff semifinal, the Tide's preferred style with Jalen Hurts was to grind away and let the defense asphyxiate opponents. But now Saban has empowered the (quarterback) position, according to McElroy. And it's mostly because of Tagovailoa.
While it did not start in 2018, Stacey Abrams' near-win that year showed the country that Georgia is purple, and it showed rural Georgians their political power.

Kellogg:Shoshone County Sheriff Mike Gunderson told KHQ-TV that a third body buried under an avalanche at a resort was located Thursday by searchers in a helicopter. But that body has not yet been identified and authorities are not sure it is the person who was reported missing on Wednesday, Gunderson said. He said there were no other reports of missing persons on the mountain. The Silver Mountain Resort said it received a telephone call Wednesday morning from a concerned family member of the missing skier who was confirmed to be skiing there at the time of the avalanche. An avalanche happened at about 11 a.m. Tuesday on Wardner Peak, an area of the resort where the ski runs are rated at the highest difficulty level, according to resort officials. The runs had just been opened for a short period after crews performed avalanche control blasting in the area Tuesday morning, using explosives to trigger avalanches in hopes of leaving only the stable snow layers on the runs, officials said. Rescue crews and volunteers searched the avalanche area Tuesday with dogs and probes. The resort previously said five people had been recovered with minor injuries but said Wednesday afternoon that there were four people. Another skier was discovered Tuesday under about 10 feet of snow and did not survive. Yet another was found after dark. He was taken to a local hospital and pronounced dead. Experts said most avalanche survivors are dug out within 30 minutes. Names of the victims have not been released.

PORTLAND, Ore. — As Rabbi Ken Brodkin watched the news trickle in from Sutherland Springs, Texas, in November 2017 — 26 killed and 20 wounded after a shooter opened fire during Sunday morning services, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history — he felt a jolt of realization. Seeing a house of worship become a hunting ground for shooters in real-time told him everything was about to change.

The former Manhattan federal prosecutor characterized the call as part of a pattern of criminal activity by the president, referring to Trump's call in 2019 when he repeatedly urged Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Biden, then his potential presidential rival.

Understand that in Saban's three previous national championship appearances at Alabama, the games were well in hand by the fourth quarter and followed the formula of physical superiority, fewer mistakes and grind-you-down clock management with the lead.

Will Green bolster the Warriors' defense? He might know how to defend all five positions, but he cannot fulfill that job description all at once. He might know how to hold teammates accountable for their shortcomings, but he cannot make up for any shortcomings in talent or schemes.
He made a bunch of plays in those games, Smith said of Howard's performances. It's motivating for me as well because I obviously want to come out and have a big game. It was awesome seeing him do that.
Sexton, Thompson, Cedi Osman and Alec Burks were all benched during New Orleans' big run to start the third. The four returned later in the quarter.

Let me answer your question with a question: What's the significance of any of these champion vs. champion bouts if no one is permitted to hold onto two UFC belts at the same time? Every champ-champ we've seen in the UFC was forced to give up one title, usually as soon as the company had another fight in that division lined up. So why keep doing it?
While analysts generally regarded Nelson as a star down the road when the Colts took him No. 6 overall in April's draft, the 6-foot-5, 330-pound guard was immediately penciled into the starting lineup and started showing flashes of what he could do.

His answer – what he believes Americans' next crusade should be – is as surprising coming from a conservative as the sudden fall of the Berlin Wall.

But filling out the federal aid form won't get you drafted, experts say.
It hasn't been the easiest season for the Pittsburgh Penguins center. The Pens are still languishing in the bottom half of the Metropolitan Division and Crosby took a lot of heat early in the season for his lackluster play. Though Crosby is experiencing something of a resurgence over the past two weeks, with five goals in his last six games, his play has been mostly inconsistent. Currently, Crosby has 12 goals and 31 points in 38 games, but the stats aren't enough to push him back into the top tier of players.
And then, Erin said, that's when we crossed the street.

Ketchikan has more bars, restaurants, and movie theaters than almost anywhere else in the state.

7. Lions — Micah Parsons, LB, Penn State: Where does Detroit start with overhauling a defense that ranked last in yards and points allowed? Given the Lions' modest cap space before addressing wide receiver Kenny Golladay, investing early and often in the draft has to be a priority. Parsons has a strong claim to the title of the draft's most explosive defender, and he's a standout in almost any assignment.

14. Vikings — Gregory Rousseau, DE, Miami (Fla.): Mike Zimmer's remark that this year's defense was the worst one I've ever had no doubt will shape Minnesota's offseason. The Vikings might have to part with some key defensive figures if they can't restructure several deals, so replenishing the roster with a disruptive talent like Rousseau looks to be a vital move.

Mogensen : We actually have started to use more of the ultra low-fare model. Because to talk about ultra low-cost, it might sound like you're compromising on some other elements. But we have the newest fleet. We're getting two brand new Airbus A330 for San Francisco and L.A. We believe that one of the reasons we can offer the lowest fares possible is that we have a new more-efficient fleet.

A third straight losing season and a third straight year of falling attendance prompted Brown to finally part ways with Lewis, who is 0-7 in the playoffs. The overriding question is whether Brown, who is averse to major change, will choose someone familiar or go outside the organization for his next head coach.
For security reasons, many big-city hotels don't want their corridors filled with food deliverers and are also wary of the mess that ordered-in food leaves behind, Lobrano says. But an increasing number of business hotels will allow food delivery, and I find the best way to sway an undecided front desk is to say I'll eat my ordered-in meal in the bar with a glass of their wine — no one's ever refused this request.

I don't think the next generation will be able to plug in a hard drive they find in a basement 50 years from now and recover that history, at least not easily.
Bond prices won't be directly affected by Fed actions, but their yields will increase if the economy picks up traction and inflation percolates. If interest rates in general and bond yields rise, bond prices will drop, as the two move inversely.
Mutzabaugh: Your fares have obviously drawn a lot of attention among U.S. consumers, who are not used to seeing fares to Europe for as little as $99 one way. During a fare sale last year, flights from Baltimore and Boston were available to Europe for less than $250 round trip.What are the value of these rock-bottom fares? You can't make much money on them. Is it a marketing tool? Just a way to fill up the plane and sell seats that would otherwise go empty?
Mogensen: I think it's all about the Internet. Twenty or 30 years ago, you had to rely on intermediates to sell and interact with the customer. There's a huge change in how you currently market and sell yourself to your passengers, which is fascinating to me how you can really be selling up to the last minute prior to the flight. This is the key in filling up the planes.

I wouldn't say I have like wide-receiver feet, where they've got the quick jabs and they can change direction up like that.

Low interest rates, of course, have been a big driver of the stock market rally the past nine years and has also provided a lift to the economy, as middle-class Americans have benefited from lower borrowing costs.
Apple back then had less than 3% market share. It didn't start its evolution into the world's most valuable $2 trillion company until 2001, when it introduced the iPod MP3 music player and helped bring digital music to the masses. This is after the short-lived Napster popularized MP3s by showing how easy it was to copy licensed music. In 2003, the iPod shifted into a mainstream product when CEO Steve Jobs (who rejoined the company in 1997) opened it up to be used on Windows computers with the iTunes music store, the first easy-to-use, legitimate avenue for buying music, back then at 99 cents a song. Streaming and the celestial jukebox was a far-off dream.

Indeed, before his July 27, 2016, request of Russia, Trump had been put on notice that it was illegal for his presidential campaign to solicit support from foreign interests. On June 29 and July 22, 2016, watchdog groups (including one led by one of the authors) filed complaints with the Federal Election Commission and the Justice Department, respectively, against Trump's presidential campaign committee for illegally soliciting financial support from parliamentarians in countries around the world, including Iceland, Scotland, Australia and Great Britain. Multiple news organizations had reported that Trump's campaign was violating the ban on foreign solicitations by emailing fundraising solicitations to foreign nationals. The Trump campaign did not respond to press requests for comments on the FEC complaint.

15. Patriots — Mac Jones, QB, Alabama: Bill Belichick can't afford any more half measures at quarterback after the Cam Newton experiment fizzled in New England's first losing season in two decades. The answer might materialize in free agency or the trade market, or perhaps earlier in the draft via trade. But even though this might be considered high for Jones, his superlative accuracy and poise could entice Belichick.
ANALYZING THE DRAMA:Grizzlies' losses, leadership void boil over in locker room drama
Honestly, when I saw Jones' Instagram post about putting his nose to the grindstone and really getting after it in 2019, I was cautiously optimistic. This is what I've wanted to see from him. Stop frittering away your own talent like it's some inexhaustible resource. If the fight game has taught us anything, it's that time eventually catches up with everyone, so you better make yours count.

Former Milwaukee chief Edward Flynn and Newark Public Safety Director Anthony Ambrose urged a reporter to consider the demographics of the victims of crime.
5. Rams RB Todd Gurley made the most of his 18 touches Saturday, gaining 111 yards. But he wasn't involved enough. L.A. was 9-0 this season when he had at least 20 combined carries and receptions. When he didn't, the Rams were just 2-5. The Falcons clearly tried to put Saturday night's game on the right arm of Rams QB Jared Goff rather than let Gurley beat them. The strategy worked as Goff's playoff inexperience was evident at times.

Young hit a rough patch midway through the season while dealing with a hip injury, but after regaining his health, he roared to life. In the final six weeks of play, Young recorded three sacks, two forced fumbles, three fumble recoveries and a touchdown. And his teammates fed off of his energy. He also commanded such respect that he was added to the team's roster of co-captains in the final weeks of the season.
Just as he did early in his battle to limit travelers from majority-Muslim nations, Trump has lost most of his battles with judges on issues ranging from early skirmishes over special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election to the revoking of CNN reporter Jim Acosta's White House press credential.
In a recent report, McKinsey experts Werner Rehm and Andy West described the rationale for M&A deals as changing.

The 62-year-old military commander played a key role in expanding Iran's influence and military reach in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon. His death marks a new, major escalation between Tehran and Washington following Trump's withdrawal from a nuclear accord between Iran and world powers. Soleimani had a hand in virtually every significant Iranian military and intelligence operation stretching back two decades, including a recent two-day siege against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad that ended Wednesday. The assault led to the Pentagon rushing reinforcements to the diplomatic compound in Iraq.

Our way of life depends on adapting to the changes that are happening.

The housing market in southeastern Idaho is booming, with home prices soaring. Nowhere is this more true than in Lava Hot Springs, where houses are being bought up before they're even listed, sometimes for well above asking price. Second homes are a hot commodity here. There aren't many houses to begin with, and because of the town's layout, it's hard to build new ones. Plus, most of the people moving into town really only want vacation homes. One local real estate agent said 8 out of 10 people who ask her about buying a home in this tourist town are looking for second homes. And most of those people are also looking to rent out their homes when they're not around to recoup some of the costs of the mortgage.

Trenton: All 37,000 of the lead water pipes in the state capital will be replaced over the next five years at an estimated cost of $150 million, Trenton officials said Thursday. The announcement comes about five months after the state's largest city, Newark, said it would speed up the replacement of its 18,000 lead lines over the next 21/ 2 years – and as the state grapples with how to move forward with its old water infrastructure. Trenton's publicly owned water utility draws water from the Delaware River and serves some 200,000 customers in the city, in addition to surrounding communities of Ewing, Hamilton, Hopewell and Lawrence. Pipes will be replaced in phases as the city and Trenton Water Works, the public utility, continue to secure funds, which are coming from the state infrastructure bank, as well a federal program, according to David Smith, the water works chief engineer. Residents must register on the utility's website and pay $1,000 to have their lines replaced, Democratic Mayor Reed Gusciora said. That's a savings, he said, because replacement typically costs about $2,000-$5,000 per line. About 7,000 people have registered to have their pipes replaced, and officials said they hope to make the replacement mandatory and at no cost at some point.

New York City: Nearly 300 of the city's new subway cars were removed over concerns that the doors could open while the trains were in motion, The New York Times reported Wednesday. The 298 cars on the A, C, J and Z lines were supposed to replace subways that date to the 1960s. They were removed after two recent incidents signaled trouble, the Times reported, citing people who were told about the malfunctions. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not say what specific incidents led to removing the cars, but said no riders were injured, the newspaper reported. The new cars, known as R-179s, were purchased for $600 million under a contract between the authority and the Canadian manufacturing giant Bombardier. A Bombardier spokeswoman told the Times that the company's investigation of the cars showed that the doors had not been properly calibrated by a supplier, Nanjing Kangni Mechanical & Electrical of China. Transit workers complained that the new cars speedometer was hard to see, that the master controller used to drive the train was uncomfortable and the space between cars was too narrow for some workers to operate in. Riders also complained that new cars broke down much more often than older subway cars, the Times reported. An outside firm has been hired by the MTA to inspect the troubled cars.

New Albany, Ohio, is one of the most affluent cities in the country. The median household income of $191,375 is one of the five highest of U.S. cities. Wealthier areas tend to have a number of livability advantages over low-income cities, including lower crime rates. There were just 36.9 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents in New Albany, less than a tenth of the nationwide crime rate. New Albany also has many amenities for residents, including over 600 acres of parks and sports fields.

It's very hard for a business to justify to spend thousands of dollars on a ticket when they might be able to spend, say $300.

GM warned the employees of the production timeline last January, and it has repeated that regularly, a GM spokesman said.

I didn't feel like he brought anything different, which I was kind of surprised because from the first to the second fight, he kind of tried to bring a couple of different tricks and things, Palmer said. But he pretty much stayed with his same game plan from the first fight. I didn't really see any improvement or changes. But also, in that short 10-week period from the semifinals to (Tuesday), there's only so much you can do to change when you're fighting the same guy. So I've been training for Alex since April, so I was pretty much prepared for anything that he could have brought to me.

The second factor is that this isn't exactly a fair market. Among traditional equities, like the stock market, an investor has the opportunity to buy, sell, and even bet against an equity. Money can be made if an equity moves up or down. With nearly all cryptocurrencies, except bitcoin, buying or selling is the only option. There is no way to make money if a cryptocurrency goes down, which naturally tends to incentivize buying. This probably won't last forever, but it's played a key role in pushing prices higher.
But first, today we learned there's a secret abandoned basketball court at the top of Disneyland's famous Matterhorn Bobsleds ride. Back in the day (aka the '70s and '80s) the park hired guys and gals to climb around outside of Disney's favorite mountain; the small court was a spot where they could chill between shifts or when the weather was bad. The climbers still make appearances from time to time, but according to WDW News Today (a Disneyland and Disneyworld specific online news org — yep, that's a thing), now the court is used by costumed cast members before their nightly flight to the castle fireworks celebration.

For many, dealing with climate change is inherently a political issue. A December report issued by the state of Texas about the need to future-proof the state from worsening natural disasters never directly mentions climate change, or the role that humans have played in emitting heat-trapping carbon dioxide by burning the oil and gas Texas has long been known for.

Phoenix: State health officials have reported 5,158 new cases of COVID-19 and three additional deaths. The latest figures released Monday by the Arizona Department of Health Services come as the number of people hospitalized due to the virus hits a new high. Officials say 54% of inpatient hospitalizations across the state are COVID-19-related. The number of patients in intensive care units due to the virus is also at a record high for Arizona. According to state health officials, only 7% of ICU beds remain available. The crush of COVID-19 patients has caused some Phoenix- and Tucson-area hospitals to suspend elective surgeries and turn away ambulance patients or transfers from other hospitals, while still accepting walk-in patients needing emergency care. Hospital officials have discussed triage protocols that the state could order to decide which patients get access to limited resources.

With Trump back on the ballot this year, Democrats think they can build on their winning formula from 2018.
Jackson: As the 2020 Legislature prepares to convene Tuesday, the future of hemp in the Magnolia State is hazy. There were a few attempts to legalize hemp production in the 2019 session, but all failed. Now, as farmers in surrounding states are already cultivating and selling hemp, Mississippi remains one of only three states where production is illegal. A task force on hemp production met three times last year and weighed pros and cons of the issue. Farmers crowded into a room in the Capitol to hear about a new crop they might soon plant. Agricultural experts explained the benefits and hardships of growing hemp without taking a hard stance on the issue, but law enforcement officials on the task force were deeply critical of hemp legalization. The task force ultimately produced a report that included these findings, though it doesn't include a recommendation on whether to legalize hemp. Last year, the House passed a bill legalizing hemp production. That bill stalled in the Senate.

Honestly, yes. I recognize how huge of a luxury it is to have the space to put up a wall-mounted closet in the first place, so that in and of itself negates some of my issues with it. If you plan on using the shelves to store large flat items, like folded sweaters, then it's a great bet. But if you're looking to use this as a sort of display case for smaller trinkets, cute little purses, or other accessories, you're better off looking for something with a solid flat base.

But I don't think it's any easier. It's a different team again. Different set of circumstances. We have to travel. If we're fortunate to win, we have to be on the road again. It feels different, but the excitement is the same.
If you've tried gyms before but the habit just hasn't stuck, maybe part of the problem is the travel time. Getting up to workout can be hard enough, but when you have to walk, take the bus, or drive to the gym, it adds one more hurdle to overcome for your workout. Having your own treadmill removes that hurdle and gives you one less excuse to skip your workout.

Either way, we are seeing an administration taking a dramatic course of action that was not well thought through either on the front end (why Soleimani was killed) or on the back end (how would this impact U.S. interests in a volatile region). And a president driven by any number of motives that are still opaque — from anger over pictures on cable news, to frustration with impeachment, to a desire to appear tough and bold in the wake of Iran's rocket attacks that killed an American contractor and wounded U.S. servicemen.
Columbia: Gov. Henry McMaster wants to expand full-day pre-kindergarten for low-income 4-year-olds to every school district across the state. The program was created in 2006 in response to a lawsuit by poorer, more rural school districts and didn't cover all the districts in the state. McMaster's $53 million proposal would expand the 4K program to the remaining 17 districts. Several are among South Carolina's largest districts, including Beaufort, Charleston, Greenville and Richland District 2, according to The Post and Courier of Charleston. McMaster told the newspaper the expansion of the 4K program is crucial to his efforts to improve education to keep economic development humming in South Carolina. Several senators and House members praised the Republican governor's proposal. Democratic Sen. Vincent Sheheen of Camden has been pushing for universal pre-kindergarten for years and said it can only improve education across all grades.

2. Josh Bell, 1B: Bell, 24, is a strong-bodied hitter with plus bat speed and raw power that eventually should result in 20-plus home runs a year. He held his own in a late-season call-up with an advanced understanding of the strike zone and an ability to shoot lines drives to all fields. Bell likely will start at first base.
1. Tyler Glasnow, RHP: Glasnow, 23, flashes a plus-plus mid-90s fastball with good downhill tilt, an upper-70s curve and a change-up that is a work in progress. He gets strikeouts by the bushel (168 in 140 innings in 2016) but needs to polish his control. He'll have a chance to make the Pirates rotation this spring.
The year ahead promises so much for Stewart. She'll march to an unprecedented level of accomplishment in the college game.

While Smith is no novelty winner, there also is some fresh air at an interruption of the quarterback hegemony. There will be plenty of quarterbacks ahead, and even Smith's win – the first for a wide receiver this century – doesn't change the fact that offensive skill players are overwhelmingly likely to win. We aren't at the point yet where a dominant defender like a Chase Young (Ohio State) or Jonathan Allen (Alabama), much less an offensive lineman like former Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson, can win.

Saffold spoke to For The Win on Wednesday, shortly after Rams owner Stan Kroenke filed paperwork to move the team to Los Angeles, bashing their current city along the way. The Rams veteran said that other than the commercial he was plugging, he was focused on rehabbing from his shoulder injury and helping coach the younger guys on his team to fill in after the rash of injuries the team had this season.
