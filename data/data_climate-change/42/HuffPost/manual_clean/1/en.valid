before you start pooping on people and what they've done, you got to do something, too, goldberg said on the view.
so you just got in there, and i know you got lots of good ideas, the host said, but i would encourage you to sit still for a minute and learn the job.
it's challenging to achieve permanence without legislation, gerrard said. but conditions on voluntarily received financial assistance are one method.
carolyn kaster/associated press president-elect joe biden announces his climate and energy team nominees and appointees at the queen theater in wilmington, delaware, dec. 19.
we have the technologies to solve the worst of the crises facing us, and buy the time to deal with the rest. back in 2009, stanford scientist dr. mark jacobson said that renewable energy could power the entire world by 2030. his solutions project calculated how to do this for every state in the u.s. and many countries. more recently, scholars like christian breyer have shown how to do this with photovoltaics alone.
does that make it four for four? is tony right?
humanity is in a horse race with catastrophe. the good news is that we are in the race. but even if we win, it will change our economy beyond recognition.
it requires risk to try something new, but also we know so much of what we've tried in the past hasn't worked either, ocasio-cortez told cooper.

throughout the first two years of his presidency, bolsonaro's most radical supporters have called for the closure of the national congress and the supreme court, and last year, a handful of militants were arrested after shooting fireworks at the supreme court building, as if to mimic a bombing. bolsonaro doesn't always endorse the worst, but he's always there to stoke the fervor among them.
obama picked ken salazar, an oil and gas ally, as his interior secretary, and balanced new federal support for renewable energy with boosts to fossil fuel drillers, promising an all of the above energy play. the approach relied on congress, both chambers of which democrats controlled when obama took office, to enact a new carbon pricing scheme that would gradually increase the cost of fossil fuels and incentivize a shift to solar, wind and energy efficiency. democrats' landmark cap-and-trade bill ― a conservative and incrementalist policy that aimed to set a cap on carbon emissions, then let companies trade pollution permits ― fizzled in 2010. going forward, the gop, seemingly hell-bent on obstructing anything obama proposed and financially encouraged by dark-money groups unleashed by the supreme court's 2010 citizens united ruling, adopted a full-fledged position of denying the reality of climate change itself.
the other election pits 71-year-old former business executive david perdue, who held the senate seat until his term officially expired on sunday, against democrat jon ossoff, a former congressional aide and journalist. at just 33 years old, ossoff would be the senate's youngest member if elected. he first rose to national prominence in 2017 when he launched an unsuccessful house special election bid.

danish siddiqui / reuters in 2013, india's supreme court reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalization.
but it's also not clear, boghossian said, that other institutions, including lower ranks of the military and the judiciary, would stand firm in the face of an all-out challenge should bolsonaro manage to incite one.
beverly mcdaniel cast her ballot tuesday morning amid light turnout at a neighborhood center's gymnasium in atlanta. she voted for both democrats, saying she believes they would do better dealing with the hardships wrought by the coronavirus.
the trump administration pursued its energy, climate and environmental deregulatory agenda with little regard for states' rights and interests, he said, citing, among other things, the administration's decision to revoke california's ability to set its own stronger fuel economy standards. this approach does not produce durable policy. as we've seen, many of the trump administration's rollbacks and replacement rules have been struck down in the courts, and many more will meet the same fate.
(ap photo/andre borges) in may 2020, bolsonaro greeted supporters who had gathered in brasilia, the brazilian capital, to call for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court.
if we only look at it from the perspective of political agitation, it seems like [bolsonaro] is only trying to get more support and make these people angry so they can support him with even more passion, boghossian said. but when trump really does something about it, when he does something concrete, then we see what bolsonaro can really do.
it appears unwise to have any of your assets in the industries that will be disrupted. bevis longstreth, former securities and exchange commissioner, observed: it is entirely plausible, even predictable, that continuing to hold equities in fossil fuel companies will be ruled negligence.
but biden and vice president-elect kamala harris have options. and they've made it clear they're all on the table.
storage technology to make renewable energy available 24/7 is only in its infancy as an industry, but its prices are falling, too.
scientists and environmentalists have fought the destruction of the tree snails' habitat and the increase of invasive predators, both of which are blamed for the snails' death.
rep. deb haaland (d-n.m.), one of the first two native american women elected to congress and a strong supporter of the green new deal movement, would replace a former oil lobbyist if the senate confirms her as head of the interior department. in place of the ex-coal lobbyist running the environmental protection agency would be michael regan, who brokered the biggest coal-ash cleanup settlement in u.s. history as north carolina's top environmental regulator. the energy department would swap a fossil fuel die-hard for jennifer granholm, michigan's former governor and attorney general and now a clean energy advocate.
the partisan divides that inhibited strong climate action during the obama years have only deepened under trump, a reality that horowitz hopes will be enough to deter the biden administration from futile attempts at reaching across the aisle to address climate change.
this is not a new cause célèbre for the brazilian. bolsonaro, like trump, peddled conspiracies about the 2018 election, openly musing about malfeasance against him even in a race he won. he has not stopped since: although many of bolsonaro's other blatant threats to democratic institutions, as well as the destruction of the amazon rainforest on his watch, have received more international attention, he has spent the last two years attempting to undermine brazil's electoral system and the last two months using trump and the united states as a reason to ramp up his attacks.
there were people there who voted three, four times, dead people who voted, bolsonaro told a crowd of supporters on thursday morning, according to folha de s.paulo, brazil's largest newspaper. and here in brazil, if we have the electronic vote in '22, it will be the same thing. … we're going to have a worse problem than the united states.
the islands once boasted more than 750 species of terrestrial snails, but more than 90 percent of the diversity has since been lost, according to the program's website.
these states and cities deserve to once again have a partner in the white house, the biden plan reads. biden will be that partner.
for brazil, it is a warning about what can happen even worse here, if bolsonaro's authoritarianism and his militias are not contained, if violations of freedom and rights continue to be tolerated, former leftist president lula da silva, who sought to challenge bolsonaro in 2018's elections before he was barred from running, wrote on twitter.
the administration could also consider providing new resources for states to mitigate the effects of wildfires and other climate-related disasters, or give states the flexibility to figure out how to meet new federal pollution-reduction goals, horowitz noted.
but not all of that criticism is from the right.
where does your energy come from? are you dependent on an industry that is at risk? millions of people, communities and cities are going 100 percent renewable.
goldberg argued that ocasio-cortez wasn't giving her democratic predecessors the credit they deserve.
in downtown atlanta, henry dave chambliss, 67, voted for the two republicans. he said he wants republicans to keep senate control to ensure the incoming biden administration doesn't slide all the way to the left.
in his book clean disruption seba describes how the convergence of disruptive technologies and business models makes a renewable world inevitable. he focuses on four factors: the fall in the cost of solar energy, the fall in the cost of storage (batteries), the rise of the electric vehicle, and the advent of the driverless car.
to oversee the effort, biden picked gina mccarthy, barack obama's former epa chief and architect of the administration's regulatory suite, as his domestic climate czar, a position obama initially created in his first term to coordinate the federal government's energy and environmental strategy and work to get climate legislation passed in congress.
republicans are unified against biden's plans for health care, environmental protection and civil rights, but some fear that outgoing president donald trump's brazen attempts to undermine the integrity of the nation's voting systems may discourage voters in georgia.
in 2017, scientists collected a two-millimeter snippet of george's foot and sent it to san diego's frozen zoo, where the living tissue sample remains frozen. this preservation offers the chance that in the future, the snail could be cloned and allowed to live again, if technology allows.
democratic success will likely depend on driving a huge turnout of african americans, young voters, college-educated voters and women, all groups that helped biden become the first democratic presidential candidate since 1992 to win georgia. republicans, meanwhile, have been focused on energizing their own base of white men and voters beyond the core of metro atlanta.
with the senate likely to remain in republican hands this year, biden seems to be preparing to resurrect the obama administration's approach after democrats lost the house in the 2010 midterms: a combination of aggressive regulation, executive orders and close collaboration with states.
it is very, very difficult when people make accusations where you say, you know, the democrats have done nothing, the establishment of the democrats have done nothing, the host said. and i just want to throw this out to you: [rep.] john lewis wasn't sitting still. [sen.] dianne feinstein wasn't sitting still.

brazil must learn a lot from yesterday's terrible events in washington, miriam leitão, a columnist for rio de janeiro's o globo newspaper, wrote on thursday. this is exactly president bolsonaro's plan, and that is why he has been nurturing conspiracy theories around the electronic ballot box, the country's electoral laws, and the [supreme court] since 2018. he plans to reap what we saw yesterday in washington.
lonely george was named after lonesome george, the famous pinta island tortoise who was the last of his species before his death in the galapagos islands in 2012.
(photo by lev radin/pacific press/lightrocket via getty images) pro-trump rioters stormed the u.s. capitol on wednesday, breaking through security barriers and entering the building in a desperate and conspiracy theory-fueled effort to stop the electoral college certification process from proceeding.
although the law banning homosexuality is rarely enforced in india, it is used to intimidate, harass, blackmail and extort money from gay people, activists say.
stanford professor tony seba argues that not only is the transition to renewables possible, it is inevitable.
consider oil. in 2011, carbon tracker calculated that at least 80 percent of the fossil deposits still in the ground would have to stay in the ground if the world is to avoid warming beyond 2c more that pre-industrial levels.
such remarks would be dangerously anti-democratic in normal times, but any sense of normalcy ceased to exist both in the u.s. and in brazil years ago. in 2016, dozens of angry, right-wing brazilians evaded security and invaded the country's national congress building to call for a military takeover of the government, a small demonstration that nevertheless offered some indication of the discontent that would later drive bolsonaro to power and portended worse to come. more recently, bolsonaro has fueled similar outbursts that feel like direct precursors to the sort of insurrection that occurred in washington.
biden isn't ruling out a legislative pathway. in the $1.7 trillion climate plan he released in 2019, which set a goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, biden said he will demand that congress enacts legislation in the first year of his presidency to establish a system for achieving that 2050 target. he said he will call on congress to make huge investments in energy and climate research and incentivize a rapid shift toward clean energy technologies.
lawyer anand grover, who appeared for five members of the lgbt community who had petitioned the court seeking a review of the ban, told the thomson reuters foundation: it is a big relief and a primary step taken by the supreme court to review its earlier order.
from the beginning, the worry in brazil was that bolsonaro was a more dangerous version of trump, a force that would offer a much tougher stress test for younger, less entrenched institutions. trump and the republican party ultimately proved american institutions weaker than many initially presumed, but in the end, the country's elections, the judiciary that oversees them and the congress required to certify them appear to have held ― if only just, and if only (possibly) just for now.
warnock is facing republican sen. kelly loeffler, a 50-year-old former businesswoman who was appointed to the senate less than a year ago by the state's republican governor. she is only the second woman to represent georgia in the senate, although race has emerged as a campaign focus far more than gender. loeffler and her allies have seized on some snippets of warnock's sermons at the historic black church to cast him as extreme. dozens of religious and civil rights leaders have pushed back.
one contest features democrat raphael warnock, who serves as the senior pastor of the atlanta church where slain civil rights leader martin luther king jr. grew up and preached. the 51-year-old warnock was raised in public housing and spent most of his adult life preaching in baptist churches.
in november 2013, more than 15,000 scientists reissued a warning to humanity of widespread misery and catastrophic biodiversity loss unless business-as-usual changed. by failing to adequately limit population growth, reassess the role of an economy rooted in growth, reduce greenhouse gases, incentivize renewable energy, protect habitat, restore ecosystems, curb pollution, halt defaunation, and constrain invasive alien species, humanity is not taking the urgent steps needed to safeguard our imperilled biosphere, they wrote.
in his plan, biden also vowed to use the full authority of the executive branch, beginning his first day in office, to combat global warming, including orders to limit methane pollution from fossil fuel operations, protect the arctic national wildlife refuge from oil and gas drilling and conserve 30% of america's lands and waters by 2030.
alex edelman via getty images defeating the threat of global climate change is the fight of our lifetimes, gina mccarthy said after being introduced as biden's nominee to be his national climate adviser.
rep. alexandra ocasio-cortez of new york's 14th district hasn't even been in congress for a week, and she's already attracted more criticism on the national stage than most other politicians will probably receive all year.
this week's elections mark the formal finale to the turbulent 2020 election season more than two months after the rest of the nation finished voting. the stakes have drawn nearly $500 million in campaign spending to a once solidly republican state that now finds itself as the nation's premier battleground.
sadly, his passing is also a harbinger of what's to come for our remaining kāhuli (tree snails) if more is not done quickly to protect them from invasive species and climate change, the department wrote. many of the island's remaining land snails are facing imminent extinction.
the brown and white snail was the sole survivor of the achatinella apexfulva species, a type of invertebrate that once flourished across the tropical islands and was known as the jewels of the forest, according to hawaii's snail extinction prevention program.
experts say there are numerous ways for the incoming biden administration to empower states and shore up its own gains even if a republican unseats him in 2024.
we're three for three on seba's predictions. but in seba's scenario it's the autonomous electric vehicle (aev) that drives the real reduction in cost he claims will make the disruption inevitable. are aevs more than just science fiction?
mumbai (thomson reuters foundation) - india's supreme court on monday agreed to reconsider its 2013 decision that criminalize consensual sexual relations between same sex adults, a victory for equal rights campaigners.
biden kicked off his presidential run on the wrong side of a climate movement. young activists were leading the push for a more ambitious federal approach, against the backdrop of dire united nations projections on global warming. in may 2019, reuters reported that biden was carving out a middle ground climate policy that would likely face heavy resistance from green activists.

in the united states there was objection from the military, from congressmen from the republican party, from electoral authorities from the republican party in the states, and from the vice president, boghossian said. i'm not sure that bolsonaro is going to have the objection of all these players in brazil. … the checks and balances and the democratic institutions and all the authorities involved in the political process might not be as hard on bolsonaro as the american authorities were on trump.
we as a party have compromised too much, ocasio-cortez told cooper in a clip from the interview. and we've lost too much of who we're supposed to be and who we are.
there are no official figures on the number of cases and most go unreported as victims are too scared to report crimes to the police, fearing they will be punished too, activists say.
either way, we will totally transform the global economy. the crises we face and the inevitabilities of change described here will drive this change.
luis macedo/afp via getty images in november 2016, dozens of protesters invaded the brazilian congress to call for a military takeover of the government. it was peaceful compared to the riots that took place this week in the united states but foreshadowed further calls for the closure of the country's congress and supreme court from right-wing brazilians.
university of hawaii professor emeritus michael hadfield, who ran a conservation lab for snails of the achatinella genus, told cnn that despite scientists' efforts, the future of lonely george's genus also looks bleak.
what is natural to one may not be natural to others, the top court said on monday. a section of people or individuals who exercise their choice should never remain in a state of fear.
the hawaii department of land and natural resources similarly cautioned that lonely george's death is likely just the beginning.
the court said a larger group of judges will re-examine the constitutional validity of section 377 - a colonial-era law that prohibits carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal - widely interpreted to refer to homosexual sex.
the world looked on in horror as a mob stormed the u.s. capitol building on wednesday, putting a country that touts itself as the planet's oldest, strongest and most exceptional democracy on the brink of succumbing to the authoritarian whims of president donald trump and his most radical supporters.
witnessing and seeing firsthand how deeply dysfunctional attempts at bipartisan action have been over the last four years have really taken the shine off any notion that there might be some grand 'kumbaya,' coming-together moment, and that the biden administration should waste any amount of time whatsoever at the beginning of their administration seeking such a moment, she said.
in his lengthy climate plan, biden slammed the trump administration for abdicating america's leadership on climate, and applauded state and local leaders for their efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, invest in renewable energy and build climate-resilient infrastructure. since trump announced in june 2017 that he would pull the u.s. out of the landmark paris climate agreement, 25 states, hundreds of cities and thousands of businesses and other entities have pledged their commitment to the goals of the international accord.
georgia's january elections, necessary because no senate candidates received a majority of the general-election votes, have been unique for many reasons, not least because the contenders essentially ran as teams, even campaigning together sometimes.
as the obama and trump presidencies prove, it could likely be a rocky road. absent new legislation, the white house must creatively interpret its legal mandate to enact rules under existing statutes, leaving them open to challenge. republican state attorneys general sued the obama administration so routinely that the top cop in texas joked: i go into the office in the morning. i sue barack obama, and then i go home. gop-led states persuaded the supreme court to block obama's signature power plant regulation in 2016, and that was before trump added three right-wing justices to the bench and stacked lower federal courts with conservatives. red states are already vowing to pursue that same strategy.

that is why it is so important to come together: we need to protect ourselves and avoid the worst in 2022! molon pleaded, while são paulo state gov. joão doria, a former bolsonaro ally who may run against him in next year's elections, called it an alert for brazil, where a minority that flirts with authoritarianism and fanaticism tries to weaken institutions and threaten the rule of law.
notably, several members of biden's environmental team have state government experience.
atlanta (ap) — georgia voters are deciding the balance of power in congress in a pair of high-stakes senate runoff elections that will help determine president-elect joe biden's ability to enact what could be the most progressive governing agenda in generations.
in november, elon released an all-electric long haul truck, and china announced the launch of the world's first all-electric cargo ship.
david hayes, executive director of new york university school of law's state energy & environmental impact center and a former deputy interior secretary under obama, declined to comment specifically on the incoming biden administration, but stressed the importance of federal-state collaboration.
there are nuanced differences between brazil and the united states that the ready-made comparisons between trump and bolsonaro often obscure. still, it's undeniable that trump's election in 2016 was a preview of what followed in brazil two years later. brazil didn't learn the lessons on offer from its northern neighbor then. but this time, it still has a chance to heed the warnings before it's too late.
you've got to swarm it tomorrow, trump told thousands of cheering supporters, downplaying the threat of fraud.
there's no doubt that only 10 or so of those (species) still exist, and none of them will survive in the next 10 years, hadfield said. the extinctions have just been horrendous.
we want to emphasize that we are not asking for any special rights. we are asking for constitutional rights given to any citizen in the country, said koninika roy from the humsafar trust that works with the lgbt community.
hawaii's department of land and natural resources highlighted the snail as an ambassador for the plight of the hawaiian land snails in an obituary confirming its new year's day death.
he was featured in many newspaper, magazine and online articles, and hundreds of school children and visitors to the lab eagerly viewed him, the last of his kind, the department wrote last week.

anyone doubting this risk must have been sobered when, in september 2017, china announced it was going to phase out internal combustion vehicles. given that china represents a quarter of the global automobile market, this – coupled with india, france, the uk, and norway making similar announcements – is an existential crisis for both the oil and car industries.
on thursday, he pushed brazil to abandon electronic voting machines that provide fast and reputable vote counts in favor of paper ballots ― a move some have warned could fuel the type of conspiracy theories that, in the u.s., baselessly alleged that mail-in voting was linked to rampant fraud.
that's where i think the list really shines, horowitz said. he's packed this list with people who know how state progress is made.
lonely george, a beloved hawaiian tree snail that was the last known member of its entire species, died at the age of 14, state wildlife officials said.
loeffler pledged monday to join a small but growing number of gop senators protesting congress' expected certification of biden's victory wednesday.
the petitioners had told the court they were living in constant fear of police action because of their sexual orientation.
is your job at risk? companies will either become part of the solution, or they won't be a problem because they won't be around. the emerging industries are creating millions of jobs, but millions are at risk. will we substitute a universal basic income? will we descend into unimaginable darkness? or will we create a finer future?
trump's instinct is also to throw red meat to his base when times are tough. and the riots, which broke out immediately after trump explicitly told his supporters to go to the capitol, offered brazilians an obvious look at how easily such agitation can erupt into a full-blown explosion, said bruno boghossian, a political columnist for folha de s.paulo.
the biden-harris administration intends to pull every lever available, not only through executive and legislative action, but partnering together with cities, states, and businesses to reverse course on the climate threat, advance environmental justice and a clean energy future, and create millions of good-paying union jobs, jamal brown, a biden transition spokesman, told huffpost in an email.
the democrats secured a narrow house majority and the white house during november's general election.

even a closely divided democratic senate wouldn't guarantee biden everything he wants, given chamber rules that require 60 votes to move most major legislation. but if democrats lose even one of tuesday's contests, biden would have little shot for swift up-or-down votes on his most ambitious plans to expand government-backed health care coverage, strengthen the middle class, address racial inequality and combat climate change. a republican-controlled senate also would create a rougher path for biden's cabinet picks and judicial nominees.

we are being cautiously optimistic about the development today. we have climbed mountains of hope in the past and come toppling down, said gay rights activist harish iyer and host of gaydio, india's first radio show on lgbt issues.
these innovations, he argues, by delivering renewably powered, electric vehicle transit as a service will be ten times cheaper than current private ownership of internal combustion cars. in the process, the shift to evs will move us to a completely renewable energy system.
perdue and loeffler have answered by lambasting the democrats as certain to to usher in a leftward lunge in national policy. neither warnock nor ossoff is a socialist, as republicans allege. they do, however, support biden's agenda.
but in brazil, perhaps more than anywhere else, the capitol riots felt like a warning from a not-so-distant future.
the lesson of the trump years is that executive order is a weak tool, said amy myers jaffe, managing director of the climate policy lab at tufts university. the biden team absolutely needs to see how they can support states ― from new england wind to stricter methane rules mirroring colorado to california's clean freight and [electric vehicle] policies.
former un climate chief christiana figueres and physicist stefan rahmstorf last year warned that the world has approximately three years before the worst effects of climate change become inevitable. in an open letter they urged companies, communities, countries and citizens to cut carbon emissions now, arguing that failure means fires, floods, droughts, rising sea levels, extreme weather, agricultural losses and massive insurance costs. between 2008 and 2016, climate related disasters displaced 21.5 million people.
within ten years? asked tom. easy. tesla, he said, released its driverless vehicle when it was as safe as a human driven car. remember, hundreds of thousands of people die every year in car crashes. teslas have driven more than 5 billion miles in autonomous mode, en route to the company's 10 billion mile safety proof point. in fact, all teslas are now capable of full autonomous mode. the google car has driven four million real miles, and 2.5 billion simulated miles. gm just announced that it is pivoting its business model to offer autonomous electric vehicle transit as a service by 2019.
george matured in a cage by himself, and although we called him a 'he,' the snail was a hermaphrodite, having both male and female parts, the department wrote. unfortunately, achatinella apexfulva seem to have been an obligate outcrossing species, meaning that it needed a partner to reproduce.
on the view monday, whoopi goldberg dinged ocasio-cortez after the congresswoman's 60 minutes interview with anderson cooper on sunday.
hawaii dlnr lonely george, the last known tree snail of its species, has died in hawaii, wildlife officials announced.
more than 3 million georgians voted before tuesday. some precincts in metro atlanta showed light-to-steady turnout tuesday morning with no lines and voters taking just a few minutes to complete their ballots.
despite fears among some republicans that trump's baseless claims of voter fraud could depress turnout, the two gop candidates strongly support him. perdue on tuesday said that trump would of course deserve credit if the republicans won.
in 2012, lonely george was taken to the university of hawaii among 10 of the last known achatinella apexfulva snails. there, the snail outlived all of its gastropod companions, leaving it unable to mate with another snail of its kind, according to the hawaii department of land and natural resources.
it endangers the banks, as well: a quarter of all corporate debt, perhaps as much as $3.4 trillion, is related to utility and car company bonds that are tied to fossil fuel use.
when the aliso canyon natural gas well blew out, spewing 100,000 metric tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, the local utility feared it would be unable to keep lights on in southern california. in record time, tesla and others brought online more than 70 megawatts of energy storage at a price cheaper than building a new gas peaking plant, and vastly faster.
alessandro molon, an opposition member in brazil's lower house of congress, tweeted that the riots in the united states proved that not even the most stable democracy in the world survives right-wing populism with impunity!
about a week after china's announcement, jerry brown, the governor of california, the world's fifth largest economy, asked mary nichols, head of the state's air resources board, whether california could do the same. two days later she said yes. two days later jerry said then we will. that was a friday.
what he can do without congress
that trump's provocations resulted in wednesday's melee in washington set off alarm bells in bolsonaro's brazil, as if it were merely the matinee.
he reminds doubters that experts totally underestimated sales of mobile phones. in the 1990s, mckinsey told att to expect 900,000 mobile subscribers by the year 2000. they were off by 108 million. by 2014 there were more mobile phones on earth than the seven billion people, increasing five times faster than humans.
i'm moderately successful and i know they will come after more of my money which i've earned, chambliss said. i was born a southern democrat, and i just hope and pray that some moderate voices are heard and things stay more in the middle of the road.
why? because the cost of solar is falling rapidly. in october saudi arabia announced the new world record low price in an auction bid: 1.7¢/kwh. when the kentucky coal museum puts solar on its roof rather than plug into the coal fired electric grid at its doorstep, you know that the fossil era is over.
just as many brazilians have pointed to trump as an example of the horrors that bolsonaro could bring to their own nation, bolsonaro has warned that the problems that exist in the minds of trump and some republicans in america will make their way to brazil soon.
gay sex is punishable by up to 10 years jail under the law.
in late 2016 the financial times reported that fitch ratings warned: widespread adoption of battery-powered vehicles is a serious threat to the oil industry, noting that transport accounted for 55 percent of total oil use in 2014. in the u.s. it accounted for 71 percent of oil use, according to 2016 figures.
the results also will help demonstrate whether the political coalition that fueled biden's victory was an anti-trump anomaly or part of a new landscape.
unsurprisingly, climate activists and scientists revolted, with some dubbing him middle ground joe. the biden campaign dismissed the report, and biden himself defended his record as an early champion of climate action.
democrats must win both of the state's senate elections to gain the senate majority. in that scenario, the senate would be equally divided 50-50 with vice president-elect kamala harris serving as the tie-breaker for democrats.
on the monday, general motors, which had reclaimed its coveted status of the world's leading automobile manufacturer on the strength of its bolt electric car, announced that its future is electric. meanwhile, daimler, volkswagen and volvo have committed to electrifying their entire product portfolios.
there's this very calculated, hard-nosed recognition among the choices that executive action is going to be the key to progress, and action at the state level is going to be the key to progress, said cara horowitz, a climate policy expert at ucla school of law.

georgia, the whole nation is looking to you. the power is literally in your hands, biden declared at his own rally in atlanta on monday. one state can chart the course, not just for the next four years, but for the next generation.
biden won georgia's 16 electoral votes by about 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast in november.
since winning election in 2018, far-right brazil president jair bolsonaro has waged an all-out assault on the country's democratic institutions, sought to undermine faith in its electoral system, and trafficked in many of the same voting-related conspiracy theories that trump and the republican party fomented over the last six months.
there is some possibility of compromise on issues such as nuclear power, carbon capture technology and research funding for renewables, all things included in the bipartisan spending bill passed last month. but a legal mandate to rapidly phase out fossil fuels and intervene radically in the economy is difficult to envision, given the makeup of the 117th congress.
so we can run our society on solar energy, but what if the sun isn't shining or the wind blowing?
democrats have hammered perdue and loeffler, each among the senate's wealthiest members, for conspicuously timed personal stock trades after members of congress received information about the public health and economic threats of covid-19 as trump and republicans downplayed the pandemic. none of the trades has been found to violate the law or senate ethics, but warnock and ossoff have cast the republicans as self-interested and out of touch.
but whether he's able to forge a climate legacy that endures beyond his time in office may very well hinge on leveraging states and cities to take aggressive action.
the snail extinction prevention program, which is part of hawaii's forestry and wildlife division, is working to protect the islands' tree snails from meeting a fate similar to lonely george's.
you decide. but realize that if the evidence laid out here is true, it has profound implications for everything. it will mean the dissolution in value, likely complete loss of the oil, gas, coal, uranium, nuclear, utility, auto industries, the banks that hold the loan paper for all of these companies and the pension funds and insurance companies that are invested in them.
our kids are not fully, fully in school like they're supposed to be and people don't have jobs, said mcdaniel, a medical field worker. she said the virus is taking over where we should have the government taking over instead.
for more than two months, as trump has parroted absurd claims of voter fraud and stolen or disappeared votes, bolsonaro remained one of his only international allies in the fight. he was one of the last world leaders to recognize president-elect joe biden's november victory, and still seems hellbent on pretending that trump isn't going anywhere yet.
a new solar array goes up in the u.s. every 150 seconds, but can the whole world be renewable by 2030?
president-elect joe biden has assembled what environmentalists are calling an all-star team to lead his government's efforts to curb climate change and reverse the trump administration's astoundingly pro-polluter legacy.
given that those fossil assets are on the balance sheets of some of the world's wealthiest companies and form the basis of the sovereign wealth funds of many nations around the world, john fullerton of the capital institute predicted that this implied a write-off of at least $20 trillion dollars. in contrast, fullerton warned, the 2008 financial collapse was triggered by the stranding of only $2.7 trillion in mortgage assets.
ocasio-cortez has taken a number of anti-establishment positions since arriving on the political scene. she ruffled the feathers of some party colleagues in november when she encouraged future primary challenges against democratic incumbents. she also participated in a climate change protest outside then-house minority leader speaker nancy pelosi's office during her congressional orientation.
this story has been updated with additional details about biden's 2020 presidential run.
brazil's institutions, meanwhile, have at times acquitted themselves better than many thought they would, and divides in brazil's congress, where bolsonaro doesn't enjoy the support of a consolidated party like trump does in the gop, may help shield the country from total disaster.
ap journalists haleluya hadero, angie wang, and russ bynum contributed.
what the president said last night is, even if you are upset about all of that, you've got to stand up with us and fight, perdue told fox & friends. we'll look back on this day if we don't vote and really rue the day that we turned the keys to the kingdom over to the democrats.
beyond their stark ideological contrasts to president donald trump's agency heads, biden's top-level nominees also appear to signal the new administration's plans to embed climate policies at the state level, cementing the clean-energy transition and making it harder for the next gop president to undo whatever progress his administration makes.
it's really about whether an agenda that moves the nation forward can be forged without significant compromise, said martin luther king iii, the son of the civil rights icon. there are a lot of things that are in the balance.
attack on democracy, the front page of estado de s. paulo, one of brazil's largest newspapers, blared in bold, capitalized letters on thursday morning ― coverage of news from afar that nevertheless felt like a plea for brazilians to heed the danger facing their own republic.

brazil should take everything that happened yesterday seriously, leitão continued. a president who lies for years and sabotages the bases of the republic will one day use his powers against the country. we need to strengthen the defenses of brazilian democracy.
biden will be forced to navigate a similar legislative playing field, except another decade into a rapidly worsening global crisis. unless democrats can somehow flip a pair of republican-held senate seats in the georgia runoff election on jan. 5, the gop will maintain control of the senate while democrats hold a slim majority in the house.
at a rally in northwest georgia on the eve of tuesday's runoffs, trump repeatedly declared that the november elections were plagued by fraud that republican officials, including his former attorney general and georgia's elections chief, say did not occur. at the same time, trump encouraged his supporters to show up in force for georgia's tuesday contests.
ap photo/alex brandon trump and bolsonaro have fashioned themselves into international allies on every major topic of their presidencies, and have mimicked each other's often-conspiratorial approaches to climate change, covid-19, democracy and elections.
no such thing actually occurred in the u.s., and no such thing is likely in brazil, where the voting system is far more efficient and immediately accurate than any in the united states. but that doesn't matter to bolsonaro. the point is to find even the smallest kernel of evidence to bolster wild-eyed conspiracy theories.
it will mean an economic collapse on a scale never seen coming at us within about 10 years.
india's lgbt community has argued the ban undermines fundamental rights as it fails to protect them. but earlier petitions to review the ban were overturned by the court.
as the election drew closer, biden made climate a central part of his bid for the white house, tempering fears among advocates and scientists that he'd take the same slow, moderate approach that obama had during his first term a decade earlier.
giving states the power and funding to make progress helps to insulate progress from the seesaw of future federal policy priorities ― not perfectly, but at least somewhat, she said.
ultimately, though, goldberg seemed to give ocasio-cortez more encouragement than condemnation.
india's supreme court had in a surprise ruling in 2013 reinstated a ban on gay sex after a four-year period of decriminalization that had helped bring homosexuality into the open in the socially conservative country.
there are a lot of people in the democratic party, goldberg said, who have been busting their asses.
biden's administration could condition federal funding for state plans to build electric vehicle infrastructure and clean energy, or pay states to prepare climate action plans and stipulate that they be subject to federal enforcement or forced to return the money if they don't meet those goals. such a program would need to be voluntary, and could be expanded to include funding for states that agree to conserve additional land under their control, but it's a possibility, said michael gerrard, director of columbia law school's sabin center for climate change law.
